===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Philip Morris International 2025 First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2025 first quarter results. The press release is available on our website at www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated April 23, 2025, and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. In Q1, we delivered a very strong start to the year with all key elements of the business contributing strongly to deliver double-digit increases in organic net revenue, operating income, and adjusted diluted EPS in both constant currency and dollar terms. Our smoke-free business performed exceptionally well across all areas, with shipment volumes up plus 14.4% year-on-year, organic net revenue growth of plus 20%, and outstanding organic gross profit of plus 33%, as all three smoke-free categories extended gross margins. This was especially fueled by the rapid growth of ZYN and the continued volume momentum, operating leverage, and scale benefit of IQOS. Our smoke-free business now accounts for 44% of total gross profit as we continue to deploy our multi-category strategy across markets and broaden our growth opportunities. IQOS delivered close to plus 10% HTU-adjusted IMS growth, with continued strong performance both in Japan and Europe, despite the annualization impact of the EU characterizing flavor ban. We expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year. ZYN, once again, delivered strong growth in the US, with shipments increasing by an impressive plus 53% to reach 202 million cans, exceeding our initial expectations as demand remained strong and production capacity increased ahead of schedule in the latter part of March, enabling some initial replenishment of trade inventories. International nicotine pouch can volumes also grew by plus 53% or by plus 182%, excluding the Nordics, demonstrating the global dynamism of this emerging category. In e-vapor, VEEV Q1 performance was impressive, demonstrating its increasing contribution within our multi-category offering. Shipments more than doubled year-on-year and gross margin further expanded, driven by strong pod growth in Europe as we increase our distribution and commercial activity. Within combustible, overall volume growth, coupled with strong pricing and ongoing cost initiatives, drove a robust performance, despite notably negative geographic mix from increased volumes in lower margin markets. Overall, the very strong and increasingly profitable underlying growth of our smoke-free business was coupled with very solid combustible results and the added benefit of favorable shipment timing. This allowed us to deliver plus 16% organic operating income growth and plus 250 basis points of expansion in adjusted OI margin to reach 40.7% and resulted in strong double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in both currency neutral and dollar terms, despite currency headwinds. While it is early in the year and there are a number of uncertainties in the global economic outlook, we remain confident that we will achieve another year of super growth. As such, we now forecast double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth at prevailing exchange rates. Turning to the headline numbers, we delivered volume growth of plus 3.9%, reflecting the very strong dynamism of our smoke-free business. Combined with strong pricing and despite unfavorable combustible mix, we delivered double-digit organic net revenue growth of plus 10.2%, reaching $9.3 billion in total. There was also a technical impact from the change in commercial model for the Indonesia below tier-one cigarette segment, where we now act as a handling agent. This results in lower net revenue and cost of goods sold that has no meaningful impact on gross profit or operating income. Excluding this effect, which will notably affect the first three quarters of the year, organic net revenues grew by around plus 12%. And as I mentioned, our smoke-free business was the primary driver behind our organic adjusted OI growth of plus 16% or plus 12.8% in dollar terms. Q1 adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 17.3% in constant currency and by plus 12.7% in dollar terms to $1.69. This includes a $0.07 unfavorable currency variance, notably due to non-recurring transactional losses in the quarter linked to currency volatility. This stronger than expected performance was primarily driven by the top line and gross margin result of our smoke-free business. Excellent ZYN performance was further enhanced by the great work of our manufacturing team in accelerating capacity initiatives. Strong IQOS HTU shipment growth includes a robust performance in Europe and around 1 billion unit in favorable shipment timing, which we expect to reverse in H2. This was complemented by the resilience of our combustible business. Looking at the category performance in more detail, our smoke-free business grew net revenue by plus 20.4% and gross profit by plus 33.1%. This led to an impressive plus 670 basis points of organic gross margin expansion to surpass 70%, more than five points above the gross margin of combustible at the current category and geographic mix of SFPs. As I mentioned, this reflects an acceleration in gross margin expansion for all three smoke-free categories, notably combined with the positive mix impact of ZYN's accretive unit economics and pricing on both HTUs and ZYN. Very strong IQOS gross margin expansion reflects the powerful growth and scale effect of this large and growing business, manufacturing productivity, and a comparison benefit from higher device shipment in the prior year when ILUMA i was launched in Japan. On an organic basis, combustible net revenues and gross profit grew by plus 3.8% and plus 5.3% respectively. While pricing was strong and volume were positive, there was a notably negative geographic mix this quarter due to growth in markets such as Turkey and Egypt, in addition to the technical impact from Indonesia. We expect gross pricing and negative geographic mix to moderate over the rest of the year and target combustible gross margin expansion organically and in dollar terms. As expected, input cost headwinds eased compared to recent years and based on current assumption, we expect this to further improve in 2026. Taking a closer look at our volumes, shipment growth of plus 3.9% was primarily driven by our smoke-free business with all categories contributing positively and placing us on track for a fifth consecutive year of total volume growth. Smoke-free volumes grew by plus 14.4%, above our full year target range of plus 12% to plus 14%, reflecting very positive contribution from IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV. In addition to the growth of these three brands, which I covered earlier, I would also note that our oral smoke-free business includes US Moist Snuff and Scandinavian Snus, which declined modestly in the quarter. Despite this, oral smoke-free product shipment growth accelerated versus the prior quarter to plus 27%. Cigarette volumes were positive for the fourth consecutive quarter as we grew share in a modestly declining industry with continuous growth in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted, such as Turkey and India. You have heard us talk recently about our multi-category strategy for smoke-free products as we leverage on the strengths of the IQOS brand and commercial infrastructure in international markets to accelerate incremental growth from ZYN and VEEV. This is evidenced by our strong smoke-free portfolio results in Q1, with visible accretion across regions and markets. We have 46 markets with multiple smoke-free offerings, including 16 with all three PMI categories on offer. The execution of this three-pronged strategy is generating positive results in markets such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland and our global travel retail business, in addition to promising starts in the UK and Italy. It is also helping to bolster our position as a global smoke-free champion. Double digit Q1 organic net revenue growth was again driven by all three key elements of our structural growth model, namely volumes, pricing and smoke-free mix. Pricing contributed plus six points, reflecting over plus 8% combustible pricing and around plus 3% for smoke-free excluding devices. The positive mix impact of the shift to smoke-free product, including US smoke-free mix, drove a further positive contribution of plus 3.1 points. Overall, combustible geographic mix and other factors had an unfavorable impact of 2.7 points. This was more negative than in prior quarters, reflecting the technical Indonesia impact and combustible market mix dynamics I explained earlier. Currency had a negative impact of 3.9 points, with a further 0.5 points from acquisition divestiture, which includes the divestment of Vectura. Turning now to gross margin, we delivered very strong expansion of 340 basis points on an organic basis and plus 360 basis points, including currency acquisition and divestitures. This comprised plus 180 basis points from pricing, more than offsetting an 80 basis point unfavorable impact from cost inflation, net of productivities and other cost items. Smoke-free growth delivered an excellent plus 230 basis points with a flat contribution from combustible excluding pricing, but including the Indonesia impact. This excellent gross margin performance supported strong adjusted operating income margin expansion of 250 basis points, or plus 200 basis points organically after accounting for the currency mix of our cost, the divestiture of Vectura, and other scope effects. This impressive margin expansion was delivered despite a 140 basis point impact of higher SG&A costs driven by continued investment in our smoke-free growth, including U.S. investments, a low cost comparison in the prior year, and the impact of 2025 investment phasing. As we continue to invest in top-line growth, we target organic SG&A growth broadly in line with net revenue growth for the year. We continue to drive manufacturing and back-office efficiency and delivered over $180 million in gross cost savings in Q1 across both cost of goods sold and SG&A. After more than $750 million of savings in 2024, this places us nicely on track to achieve our $2 billion target over 2024-2026. Focusing now on our IQOS business. As expected, calendar effects and EU flavor ban annualization impacted Q1 adjusted IMS. However, the delivery of plus 9.4% growth despite these factors marks continued strong underlying momentum. We expect double-digit progress in the balance of the year in line with our target of plus 10% to plus 12% growth. Supporting this are commercial initiatives around brand building and continuous innovation on devices and consumables as we progressively roll out ILUMA i and new consumable variants of Terea, Levia and Delia. Over the longer term, we have a rich IQOS innovation pipeline to further enhance the breadth and quality of the user experience with the iconic brand. As disclosed in our latest integrated report, over 99% of our 2024 adjusted R&D spend was on smoke-free products consistent with the last four years as we continue to drive consumer-centered product development. Turning to Europe where we are building on the strengths of our IQOS business to create an integrated multi-category portfolio to accelerate consumers switching and value creation. Total shipments of our flagship smoke-free brand advanced by plus 17.5% in Q1 with an increasing contribution from both ZYN and VEEV. IQOS HTU shipments grew more than 15% including a positive comparison impact from the prior year. Our investment in brand building initiatives is exemplified by the recent partnership with Italian designer SELETTI at Milan Design Week as part of the IQOS' Curious X campaign. For IQOS, Q1 HTU adjusted IMS grew by plus 7.4% as we further accelerated our share of cigarettes and HTUs to a record 11.4%. Many markets in the region grew adjusted IMS by double digits including IQOS growth or more in Spain, Germany, Bulgaria and Greece. This dynamism more than compensated for flavor ban annualization which has flagged last quarter was especially pronounced in Q1 and most notably in Italy. I am particularly pleased to report that sequential market share in Italy is trending well with a record high of 18.4% for Q1 and probably increases to the quarter. Overall, regional Q1 adjusted IMS growth was in line with our expectations and we expect another robust quarter in Q2 followed by an acceleration in the second half. Our experience of the flavor ban impact remains the same with a broadly consistent pattern of recovery across markets following implementation. We continue to expect an impact of around 1 billion units in 2025, primarily due to annualization with only Hungary and Slovakia implementing the ban so far this year. The most notable remaining market is Poland where the future debt will be in early 2026. We also continue to roll out new and improved variants of our tobacco-free consumable Levia which is driving promising results. This is well illustrated by Hungary where Levia reached a double digit share of PMI HTUs less than three months from launch. Our fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the consistent growth in key city offtake share. This also includes Hungary where Budapest's share reached almost 42%, over four points higher than Tokyo. Impressively, 24 of the 34 markets where IQOS is present in Europe have crossed the 10% key city share mark with 6 above 30%. Notable fallouts across the region include London, Vienna, Zurich, Lisbon and Athens. The regulatory launch date is an important determinant of smoke-free progress and we are encouraged by recent policy development in a number of markets which recognize the role of tobacco harm reduction in policy measures. This includes Greece which introduced dedicated legislation supporting science-based plans on smoke-free products and Hungary where factual and science-based communication to consumers on smoke-free products is allowed versus a total advertising ban for combustibles. In Ukraine, an excise tax differential on HPU versus cigarettes was reintroduced following a period of equal treatment. In Japan, we deliver HPU-adjusted IMS growth of plus 9.3%, effectively marking the 10th quarter of double digit growth after accounting for the least year. HPU-adjusted share increased by 3% of points year-on-year and plus 1.6 points sequentially to reach 32.2% further highlighting the dynamism of the innovation of the innovative IQOS brand and product portfolio in this new market. IQOS HTU captured more than three quarters of category growth in Q1 and combined with our cigarette business, PMI is now the market leader by volume of which approximately 75% are HTU. The overall smoke-free category continues to progress reaching almost 48% on a national offtake basis in March with 13 cities and 8 prefectures now crossing the 50% threshold. Globally, we continue to see very strong IQOS performance as illustrated by key city offtake share. Highlights include impressive year-on-year growth in the capital of Indonesia and Mexico to surpass 5% share. Robust progress in the Middle East and North Africa and strong growth in Belgrade to 17.7% share despite increased competitive activity. IQOS reached a new high in South Korea with a 14.1% share in Seoul supported by the launch of ILUMA i in a highly competitive market. Offtake share performance in Cairo continues to be optically impacted by the growth of the combustible market where a competitive supply has normalized. Also worth highlighting is the excellent growth of our global travel retail business which is a leading space for our multi-category offerings. We record a strong HTU growth across all regions with share of over 18% in airports where IQOS is present. In the U.S. as planned, we commenced direct sales of IQOS 3 devices and HTUs in Austin, Texas at the end of March following targeted engagement with legal education consumers over recent months. While intentionally small-scale, we have received strong interest with further IQOS -3 pilot plans in the coming months as we prepare for the upscale launch of IQOS ILUMA. As a reminder, we are not assuming any significant HTU volume from the U.S. in our full year process. Switching to ZYN, which continues to resonate strongly with adult nicotine users as a superior product with premium brand equity and deliver excellent result. Continued strong demand and increased production capacity enabled shipment volume growth of plus 63% to reach over 200 million cans for the quarter. This plus 70 million year-on-year increase is impressive. Though we should note the prior year first quarter featured notable depletion of retail and distributor stock levels and therefore a sell-out volume higher than shipment and this quarter included the beginning of replenishment. As we continue to expand production at our Owensboro plant, we accelerated one plan step in this process to the latter part of March. This enabled increased shipments at quarter end and a pull forward of initial distributor re-stocking. With very limited flow through of this additional shipment to retail in the quarter, this did not yet have a meaningful impact on store availability. We target full normalization of the supply situation in Q3 this year. ZYN continues to perform very robustly at retail given the circumstances with strong double digit offtake growth. According to Nielsen, Q1 offtake volume grew by around plus 15% year-on-year with category value share remaining strong at over 70% despite heavy competitor discounting. While Nielsen data is based on only a small sample of stores, it also shows our offtake volume share has been held back by availability and declined by 1.45 points sequentially to 61.5%. We already observe our share on MSA data which measures shipment from distributor to retail recovered to almost 66% in March on the limited flow through I just mentioned. With category offtake growing at around plus 30% to plus 35%, while the leading brand is supply constrained, we expect ZYN offtake to gradually accelerate in the coming months as in-store availability improves and we reactivate commercial and marketing initiatives. We remain excited about the growth prospects of this dynamic category and its potential to regulate consumer from cigarettes and other traditional forms of tobacco. ZYN remains the only nicotine-powered product authorized by the FDA and this includes all variants in both 3 mg and 6 mg strength currently commercialized in the US. As outlined at CAGNY, there is a large addressable market in the millions of legalized nicotine users in the US and we plan to engage actively beyond our existing consumer base to other legalized nicotine users. Indeed, with strong latent demand and capacity extension ahead of target, we now raise our shipment forecast to 800 million to 840 million cans per year. With the outstanding effort of our team on the ground, we continue to work on increasing capacity in our Kentucky facility. Construction of our second US manufacturing site in Colorado is well underway with production due to commence in early 2026. We remain, as we have been since entering the US, committed to investing in US manufacturing. The substantial investments we have made in the US are expected to continue to result in significant job creation and economic contribution to the country. Outside the US now, we continue to roll out ZYN, leveraging our presence with IQOS and ZYN, drive awareness and trial with legalized nicotine users. The total international nicotine category is nascent in almost all geographies and stand at around half the size of the US in volume term. We are now in 38 markets globally, following Q1 launches in the UAE and Colombia, and ultimately to all addressable markets as meaningful opportunities given the unique characteristics of the category. Within the plus 53% growth of our international pouch can volume, shipment almost trebled outside of the Nordics, including promising momentum in European markets such as Austria, Switzerland, and the UK, where we commence a national share count rollout. In emerging markets, strong progress continues in Pakistan, Mexico, and South Africa. PMI global travel retail is a notable standout as it also increases global visibility and awareness of ZYN within our multi-category offerings. Finally, closing our smoke-free performance with e-vapor. This plays an increasingly important role within our multi-category universe with growing volumes and gross margins. Shipment volume doubled year-on-year to 0.6 billion on an equivalent unit basis, driven by very good performance in Europe, whereas the pod pot segment continues to grow strongly, partially at the expense of disposable given increased ban and restrictions for this format. We observe increasing ZYN adoption rates and low abandonment across key markets, which is testament to the quality and presentation of this premium product to legal-age consumers. Turning to combustibles, our business performed robustly in Q1 with organic net revenue growth of plus 3.8%, or closer to plus 7%, excluding the Indonesia technical impact. This was driven by strong pricing of plus 8.3%, with notable contributions from Turkey, Poland, and Germany. With less favorable dynamics in H2, we continue to expect truly combustible pricing of plus 5% to plus 6%. The cigarette industry declined by 1.3% in Q1, due to growth in geography where smoke-free products are nascent or not present, more than offset by accelerated cigarette declines and sales. Where SFPs are not permitted, such as in Turkey or India, we expect this divergence to continue, supported in some cases by demographic trends. Nonetheless, we continue to expect a low cigarette industry decline for the year. Category share was strong, growing 0.4 points in Q1, partly due to service-to-market needs. Both Marlboro and our global brand portfolio reached all-time first quarter highs. We continue to target broadly stable category share over time, with our main priorities being maximizing value and supporting the growth of smoke-free products. Most importantly, combustible organic gross profits continued to grow robustly at plus 5.3% following the recovery of 2024. This brings us to our outlook for 2025. We delivered a very strong first quarter, including better-than-expected margins, and we remain confident we will achieve another year of superior growth. As such, we are reconfirming the currency-neutral growth outlook we provided in February, despite a backdrop of increased uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment. As a global company with broadly diversified production and a worldwide sectorial network, including an established U.S. manufacturing base, we believe we are well positioned to mitigate potential supply chain challenges. While the situation is volatile, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our business from recently introduced or discussed tariffs. We expect a continuation of strong momentum from our smoke-free business, including the benefits of further multi-category deployment. As I explained, we are raising our forecast for U.S. in shipment to 800 to 840 million cans. This further supports our forecast of plus 12% to plus 14% SFP shipment growth, which incorporates unchanged strong growth assumptions for IQOS. We also continue to expect total semi-organic net revenue growth in the range of plus 6% to plus 8%, organic operating income growth of plus 10.5% to plus 12.5%, and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10.5% to plus 12.5%. As announced in this morning's press release, we are raising our 2025 adjusted diluted EPS forecast to $7.36 to $7.49. This now reflects plus 12% to plus 14% growth in dollar terms, and includes a favorable estimated currency impact of $0.10 at the value exchange rate. This reflects recent strength in the Euro, Japanese yen, and Russian rubles, vastly offset by a stronger Swiss Franc. For Q2, we assume HTU shipment volume of 37.5 to 38.5 billion, with another strong quarter of HTU adjusted IMS growth of around plus 10%. For U.S. ZYN, we expect shipment to be at a similar level to Q1, as trade restocking continues and offtake gradually accelerates. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 to $1.85, including a favorable currency variance of $0.06 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong H1 overall, with organic net revenue growth around the IM of our target range for the full year, and organic OI growth slightly above. With regard to our balance sheet, delivery remains a key priority, and we continue to target further reduction in 2025, placing us on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of 2026. We believe our growth profile is best-in-class within large-cap consumer goods, as shown by our three-year CAGR target, which we are well on track to meet or exceed. Adjusted diluted EPS growth in dollar terms is a key priority, and as demonstrated in 2024, we are committed to taking proactive steps to manage potential currency volatility, including through our hedging activities. Behind the delivery of our growth lies the enormous effort we have made to transform our business over the last 10 years, and the continued drive towards our ambition to become substantially smoke free. This quarter coincides with the publication of the sixth edition of our annual integrated report, which provides a comprehensive view of our company's performance across both financial and non-financial dimensions. Highlights include the important efforts and actions we are taking with regard to youth access prevention, as well as the progress we have made on our operational efficiency, strengthening our resilience, driving innovation, and ultimately future-proofing our business. As explained in the report, our approach to sustainability is fundamentally business-driven, with the objective of both sustaining and enhancing the growth of our small-group transformation to drive continued value creation. I would encourage anyone with an interest in how and why we are transforming to read it. I will now conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Following an excellent start to the year, we are now on track for another year of strong performance in 2025. While no company is immune to macroeconomic volatility, we believe we are well positioned to navigate external dynamics. We have three powerful growth drivers with pricing power and positive smoke-free categories on top of volume growth, where we target our fifth consecutive year of extension, led by IQOS, ZYN and VEEV. As we continue to invest strongly behind our smoke-free brand, these drivers are also profit-accretive, and combined with our proactive measures on pricing and cost, we have great confidence in sustainable, adjustable EPS growth in both currency-neutral and dollar terms. Finally, we will remain a highly cash-generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel and everyone. I had a few questions on ZYN. Could you maybe give us some more color on the out-of-stock issues you might still be experiencing in the U.S.? I know you touched on this, but then just curious how long you think it will take for retailers to rebuild their inventories. And I know you raised your shipment guidance for ZYN for the year, but it does still imply that growth will decelerate year-over-year to around, I think, 35% for the rest of the year. This is at the low end of your range versus, I guess, the 53% you reported this quarter. So just hoping you could talk through the thinking behind this, maybe just the phasing. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Happy to do that. So, of course, we are facing a particular year in 2025 with ZYN in the U.S., because it's going to be a mix of continuation of strong growth and strong consumer offtake growth. Of course, when you look at the shipment, be careful, and I flag that in my remarks, because last year we had clearly consumer offtake in Q1, which was much, much stronger than our shipment. That was the time when the consumers started to empty the shelves. So we need to be cautious when we look at the shipment, if they are now reflecting the consumer offtake and take that into account. And next to this strong growth that we expect from consumer offtake, and we have a very dynamic category, 30% to 35% growth, despite the fact that the leader ZYN was constrained. We're going to add on top of that this replenishment, this restocking. I'm not going to speculate on exactly what it is, but it's certainly a few tens of millions can. And we have started, because of this good performance on production that I explained, to send more product to, first of all, wholesalers, distributors, and then they're going to start to ship to retailers. So it's going to be a very gradual process. There is still, of course, very, I would say, material situation of out of stock. We're going to continue the replenishment in the second quarter, maybe part of the third quarter as well. And we've been explaining that we explain we are expecting to be back to a normalized situation, if I may say. Therefore, no more material out of stock situation in the third quarter of ‘25. So in terms of shipment, that's going to be this profile through the year of an accelerating growth for our shipment. That's what we expect, which is going to reflect first the consumer offtake that is going to accelerate. And then, of course, replenishment impact that is going to decrease as we fulfill this replenishment, if you want. So it's a particular profile. And the replenishment, if you want, to some extent, is going to hide the fact that there is a growth in the consumer offtake that we're going to experience through the year.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just maybe a second question from me on margins. You delivered robust margin expansion in the quarter. So how should we think about the drivers of continued margin expansion for the remaining of the year? I guess, especially in the context of what you mentioned as it relates to continued SG&A growth and the investments, et cetera. And then on the back of that, I know we've talked about this before, but how should we also think about the margin gap you're seeing between your combustible business and then smoke-free products today and then possibly key drivers of further expansion of that gap over the next couple of years? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, Bonnie, obviously, we are very pleased with our margin expansion. That's something we are targeting for 2025. And we are very positive about our expectation. We have a clear illustration in Q1 of the strong performance in terms of margin expansion. Clearly, our smoke-free products are here driving this, first and foremost, this margin expansion. You have an impressive 670 basis point organic expansion in Q1 for our smoke-free business. Don't take that as a reference for the full year, but that means that we are now above 70% gross margin rate for the smoke-free business. It's five percentage points higher than combustible. So as we are growing, of course, very fast, our smoke-free business and faster than combustible, that means that we are benefiting at the margin level of a very positive mix evolution. And we believe that the difference through 2025 should stay between smoke-free and combustible. I'm not saying it's going to stay exactly at the same level, but we're going to keep a very material difference between the two, and we're going to continue to benefit from this quality of mix effect. I think for the future, there are a number of drivers that will continue to play on the margin for our smoke-free portfolio. There is, of course, a mix coming from ZYN. ZYN in the US is the best-in-class gross profit margin. So when we grow ZYN fast in the US, that has a positive impact. You have all the scale impact that we are generating on IQOS. And if you look at the last two to three years, you've seen on a very consistent basis, a gradual improvement on the margin on IQOS. This is certainly magnified in the first quarter, because we have a less sale of device. Last year, we had big device sale in Japan as we were launching ILUMA i. So that is helping the margin. But fundamentally, we are benefiting from scale impact, productivity, and a better performance on device. And then we have some pricing that you have seen 3% on consumable for our smoke-free business. So we are increasing price as well. And last element, which is more marginal today, but we are also improving the margin on ZYN. So that is also helping. So as you can see, we have many positive drivers behind our smoke-free business. And smoke-free business is the driver for or the first driver for margin improvement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Smith of Stifel.
Matt Smith: Hi, Emmanuel. Thank you for the question. If we could first talk about the guidance outlook. With the strong first quarter and now the second quarter guidance, the first half EPS growth on a constant currency basis is a few points above the high end of the full year outlook. Can you talk about the factors in the second half that we should take into consideration with the constant currency EPS growth outlook implied to be a couple of points below the full year average by my math, just the shape of the year there?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Matt. Happy to take that one. So yes, we are saying that we expect to be well positioned versus the overall bracket for the year in terms of revenue growth. We expect to be a bit above on OI. These are the traditional difference that you can see during a year between H1 and H2. You may have some comparison basis that can play. There is potentially some phasing on how we're going to position SG&A. So there is here nothing to be read, I think, in terms of change in the underlying business between H1 and H2. These are more how a number of things are positioned in shipment through the year in terms of investment. But I would say we expect a strong year as we go through the quarters. And we've been finding the fact that we expect in some area an acceleration for IQOS in the second half in terms of IMS. But that's not going to necessarily translate into shipment as the phasing for shipment can be a bit different. So again, I think we expect strong momentum through the year for our smoke-free portfolio. We've been finding the fact that on combustible, we are positive in volume in Q1. But for the year, we expect a low single-digit decline. So that could mean that the second part of the year will have more negative volume for our combustible. But clearly, we expect strength through the year.
Matt Smith: Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about the IMS growth you referenced for IQOS. You had nice growth in the first quarter. I think it was above 9%. But if we look back to the fourth quarter, it was around 13%. Now you're expecting a re-acceleration in those IMS, in IQOS IMS growth across the remainder of 2025. So can you talk about some of the underlying benefits to IMS growth re-accelerating across the rest of 2025? Thank you. I'll leave it there.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So indeed, 9.4% was in line with our expectation. And Europe was below the average, so there are always a turbulence coming from the flavor ban implementation in Europe. We believe that the impact will be lower in H2 as we go through annualization. And therefore, we expect in H2 an acceleration, as I mentioned, in the IMS growth in the second half in Europe. But otherwise, we are expecting this 10% to 12% adjusted IMS growth through the year. So we expect overall a continuation of a nice double-digit growth. Q4 was very strong after a few quarters that have been weaker last year. So you can have some fading through the year. But after this Q1, which was in line with expectation, we expect continuation of very good growth in Europe, in Japan. And I took some time in my remark to talk about the other markets where we see also some very promising growth in several markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Serotta of Morgan Stanley.
Eric Serotta: Great. Thanks for the question. In terms of the full year guidance, you did raise the ZYN shipment volume. And obviously, that's a very high-margin product. You kept the constant currency EPS guidance the same. You delivered some very robust margin expansion in the first half. Are there any specific offsets that you could point to that caused you to reiterate the guidance rather than flow some more through to the full year? Or is it more of a factor that were early in the year and there's obviously a lot of macro and geopolitical uncertainty?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Eric, for the question. So, indeed, we were targeting a year of very strong growth and performance. And I think Q1 is flagging the fact that we are well on track to deliver a year of strong growth. So we are confirming that we expect a year of very strong growth across the board for PMI. What we've seen in Q1 is indeed very reassuring on the fact that we're going to deliver this full year. We are raising the guidance for the volume for ZYN in the US by on average 20 million cans. So, yes, it is a very profitable brand, but not to the extent to dramatically change the outlook for the year. So I would say that goes into various scenarios with which we are playing to give the guidance for the year. And obviously, after only one quarter and in this uncertain volatile environment, we need to, of course, be cautious and say this is the beginning of the year. And we are happy to confirm the guidance. Again, I think Q1 is showing that we are well on track to deliver a very good 2025.
Eric Serotta: Great. And then a quick follow up. How are you guys thinking about what the unconstrained growth for what the unconstrained offtake growth for ZYN theoretically looks like? Obviously, you can't observe it. You could estimate it. But how are you thinking about how that evolves where it is today and sort of how it evolves as you get into the second half and next year where the business is obviously a lot larger than when you bought it? So really, you can't give a precise answer, but any color there would be helpful.
Emmanuel Babeau: Eric, frankly, we don't know, of course, what is the unconstrained demand because the demand is still constrained. So I'm not able to provide an answer. What I can say is that certainly as we are removing the limitation and the out of stock situation, we expect an acceleration in the consumer offtake. And we are very much encouraged by the very nice dynamism of the category, which shows the appeal, the attraction for the consumer and all these legal age nicotine users that are discovering the category and understand the benefits. So we expect the acceleration. We're going to be gradually back to normal life because it's true. We've been mentioning that we have very limited commercial marketing activities. So we were trying to service the existing ZYN consumer and we knew that it was not reasonable to try to acquire new consumers that we could not serve and supply. So obviously, that's going to be also another leg of the growth in the coming quarter. And I guess that's certainly something you include in unconstrained demand. But frankly, I don't want to speculate on what this unconstrained demand is going to be. We are expecting a gradual acceleration of the consumer offtake for ZYN in the coming months.
Eric Serotta: Fair enough. And then just one quick last one. You did cite the Nielsen data in terms of ZYN. Are you seeing different trends or diverging trends when you look at some of the non-track channels that you would have a better read on than we would?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I mean, I certainly don't want to say that Nielsen is not an interesting data point. But of course, it's 3,000 sales points. And in the universe, that's probably close to 200,000. And when you are in an out of stock situation, you can create some distortion on the perception of the consumer offtake. So I'm not able to say whether the 15%, I mean, we know it's an estimate. What I was reporting is the MSA. So the very nice acceleration towards the end of March of the sales from wholesaler and distributed to the retailers. But that's the other data point that we have. But we don't have any other, I would say, reliable data we could share with you. We can sense in the market the very strong underlying demand for ZYN. That's very clear. And I also flag the fact that the consumer offtake. So what Nielsen measured last year for first quarter, then probably significantly higher than the 130 million can that we reported for the quarter -- the first quarter of 2024. So that was the basis on which you should apply the 15% is accurate to have an idea of the consumer offtake today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faham Baig of UBS.
Faham Baig: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Emmanuel. A couple of questions from me as well. Just coming back to the growth and the offtake. Are you in a position to potentially share what the MSA data highlights is the growth rate for ZYN and how it really compares to this sort of 30% to 35% growth you highlight for the category. The same question sticking with the U.S. and IQOS. I just wanted to get your views on the recent movements at the CTP and how that impacts the timing of ILUMA i’s launch in the market or whether it does impact the timing of the launch would be helpful. And the final question is really how housekeeping net interest guidance for the year would be helpful.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sorry, I missed the last question, Faham.
Faham Baig: The net interest cost guidance for the year would be helpful, please.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So taking your question in the order growth of the, I think we said that the share was close to 66% on MSA in March. It's probably a growth around close to 30%. But take that with a pinch of salt. I'm not sure I have a very precise data, but clearly the MSA was showing this acceleration as more product was coming. So that's one thing. On the new situation at the CTP and what it means for IQOS, no, it's too early to say. So we have nothing to report. And I don't know what is going to happen. I think we are still hoping for an efficient process to be put in place and for the FDA to comply with the mandate, which was to give an answer after six months. But I have nothing at that stage new to report on the situation. And on the net interest for the year, I think you have the performance in Q1. I don't have at that stage nothing specific to tell you for the full year. We're not providing any additional data for the full year, but of course, we started well the year. Nevertheless, with some positive impact coming from mark-to-market on some of our aging.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Philip Morris International fourth quarter 2024 and full year results conference call. At this time, all participants After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. The press release is available on our website at PMI.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation are available in exhibit 99.2 for the company's form 8-K dated February 6, 2025, and on our investor relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections future results, I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements? I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. We delivered an outstanding performance in 2024, with all key elements of the business, contributing strongly to deliver best-in-class organic scope, and bottom-line growth. There has resulted in significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in both currency neutral and, equally importantly, dollar terms as we mitigated substantial currency headwinds. Our business outperformed the industry and consumer packaged goods overall, with growth across all categories, to deliver our fourth consecutive year of positive volumes. IQOS continued its strong underlying momentum with continued excellent growth in Japan, robust progress in Europe despite the EU characterizing flavor ban and further strong growth in our global markets. Importantly, the growth of IQOS is increasingly profitable as the benefits of scale and pricing more than offset continued substantial growth investments including brand building activities, and innovations on devices and consumables. Then once again delivered strong growth in the US as 2023 demand acceleration continued in 2024. This resulted in short-term supply challenges, which we have progressively addressed throughout the year, working towards our goal of matching existing user demand. As we unlock further capacity, we will be in a position to explore the full potential of this dynamic Outside the US, shipments grew by 75% as we increased our global presence in nucup and pouches to 37 markets. Any Vyper. VIV is progressively contributing to growth with encouraging volume momentum in closed spots and strengthening market position with a premium offer. Our combustible business performed well on all metrics. We delivered double-digit gross profit growth in quarter four of last year, and around 7% organically for the year. Led by strong pricing, resilient volumes in certain markets, and ongoing benefits of our Cost actions. Yeah. Overall, our strong performance across all categories and regions drove meaningful operating leverage, notably in our smoke-free business, alongside cost efficiency initiatives across the entire value This enabled us to deliver over deliver operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS above our expectations at the start of the year despite ongoing currency and input cost headwind. Our transformation journey and growth drivers have excellent momentum and we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and returns in 2025 and beyond. Over the past year, we achieved several key milestones in our smoke-free journey. Including the ten-year anniversary of IQOS and ZYN. Our smoke-free business is large, profitable, and growing fast. Our total smoke-free net revenues reach almost $15 billion in 2024. Combined with a strong combustible performance our company also surpassed $10 billion in adjusted net earnings for first state. Our smoke-free business reached 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter, and around 42% of adjusted gross profit. As our transformation becomes increasingly profitable. In our top five markets, by operating income, around 60% of net revenues were smoke-free. We have deployed our smoke-free multi-category strategy across almost half of the 95 markets with smoke-free products and we closed the year with over 38.5 million estimated adult users across Kidnodbir, Oral, and e vapor. Our smoke-free business surpassed one billion pounds including 644 million cans of nicotine pouches. The ZYN brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine consumers across the US, where it is the number one smoke-free brand and the fourth biggest nicotine brand and also grows international. We're also very pleased that the robust science and responsible marketing practices behind ZYN were recognized by FDA through the recent marketing authorization of all currently commercial commercialized US invasions. Making ZYN the first and the only authorized nicotine pouch brand in the United States. We remain at the forefront of the effort to increase understanding of smoke-free products and advanced tobacco harm reductions among consumers and regulators. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopt adopting tobacco reduction policies to incentivize switching to reduce nicotine product instead of containing to smoke. Which is a sound public health policy. A number of markets also moving favorably with regards to robust regulation of nicotine pouches and evapro. Now regretfully, there is also resistance in many places, often driven by ideology not fact and science and therefore a considerable amount of work it's stealing from the bus. While reaching important milestones is pleasing, after ten years, we are still in the early stages of transformation. With our strong brands and our innovative and commercial capabilities, we have many years of opportunities and growth ahead. I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming CAGNY conference on February nineteenth. I will now hand over to Emmanuel to this discuss our results and outlook in more detail.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. I will start with the headline financials for the year. As Jacek said, this was a truly outstanding year of growth across our business, as the rapid progress of IQOS and USIN was complemented by emerging growth contribution from Veeve and ZYN internationally at a much improved combustible performance. We delivered in line or above our last communicated expectation across KeyMetrix. Organic net revenue growth of plus 9.8% adjusted IMS and shipments of HTUs, and convertible pricing of plus 8.7% were strong. Excellent total shipment volume growth of plus 2.9%, including zinc and combustible volumes performed at the top end of our expectation. Coupled with accelerated cost efficiencies this led to better than expected plus 14.9% organic operating income growth and plus 15.6% currency neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. Our clear focus on delivering performance in dollar terms was reflected in the plus 9.3% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As a result, we achieved record operating cash flow of $12.2 billion which was significantly above both our initial and most recent forecast supported by excellent profit delivery and favorable working capital. Combined with strong adjusted EBITDA, this allowed us to significantly improve our leverage ratio which I'll come back to Later. We closed the year strongly in Q4 with organic net revenue growth of plus 7.3% despite the impact of timing and comparison effect most notably related to red sea disruption the EU characterizing favor ban for HTUs and prelaunch Iluma iDevice shipments. This was driven by total volume growth of plus 2.3% alongside positive smoke-free mix and robust pricing. Now Combined with the operating leverage and manufacturing efficiencies, we delivered close to plus 12% organic operating income growth and plus 10% currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income increased plus 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew plus 14% to $1.55 This includes a positive currency impact of six cents which reflects an unfavorable transactional impact in the prior year in Argentina as well as a move to hyperinflationary accounting in Egypt, which also a negative impact on our organic growth of around one point on net revenues and two points on operating income. So The noncash impairment of our RBH equity investment had no impact on our adjusted financials. In future, we may benefit from Airbnb's dividend income but we do not include any impact in our 2025 forecast at this time. Let's take a step back and consider 2024 in the context of the last few years. Our organic top line delivery has been consistently strong since the pandemic and further accelerated this year as both smoke-free product and combustible step up than combustible step up their trajectory. Clearly, 2024 was all also a standout year for adjusted diluted EPS growth. The profitability of our smoke-free business accelerated due to the operating leverage of IQOS increasing scale favorable unit economics, pricing, efficiency, and the impressive accretion from ZYN's rapid growth at superior US margins. We also benefited from a notably robust combustible performance which provide important structural support for our transformation journey. These dynamics are further demonstrated by the organic top line and gross profit growth of both category in the year. Our smoke-free business accelerated to plus 17% net revenue growth and plus 23% gross profit growth reaching close to $10 billion in gross profit. This drove an impressive plus 330 basis points of organic gross margin expansion fueled by the factors I just mentioned. On the combustible side, net revenue and gross profit grew organically by plus 6% and plus 7% respectively, leading to plus 60 basis point of organic gross margin expansion. Our combustible business is once again contributing positively with pricing and cost efficiency more than compensating for the third year of significant input cost headwinds which we expect to ease in 2025. I would also note that adjusted gross margin for smoke-free product were plus 490 basis points higher than combustible in Q4. And plus 270 basis points higher for the year overall at 66.6%. While we continue to target gross margin expansion in combustible, we expect this gap to grow over time as we continue to drive profitable growth from smoke-free product, investing in new market Brand building. And innovation. Taking a a closer look now at our volume performance, we delivered our fourth consecutive year of shipment growth up plus 2.3% in the fourth quarter and close to plus 3% for the full year. Including our viv e vapor business in equivalent unit This growth was plus 2.4% and plus 3% respectively. Our total 2024 smoke-free volume growth including Viiv was plus 13.5% or 19 billion unit equivalent acceleration compared to 2023. For IQOS, we delivered HTU adjusted in market sales growth of close to 13% and shipment volumes of 139.7 billion both broadly in line with our expectation. Adjusted IMS growth accelerated in h two to close to 14%, essentially in line with our target of plus 14% to plus 15%. This includes dynamic growth of close to plus 11% in Europe with strong momentum across the large majority of markets. As I touched on earlier, q four HTU shipment growth includes the impact of additional shipment in the prior year to prepare for the EU characterizing flavor ban and the phasing effect of additional shipment to Japan in h one notably due to retail disruption. Our oral smoke-free business grew 2024 shipment volume by plus 24.6% including ZYN's US growth of plus 51% to 581 million cans. Snuff and moist snuff volumes were stable. Cigarette shipments grew by plus 0.6% approximately in line with the estimated growth of the international industry. The growth of the cigarette market can be largely attributed to growth in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted such as Turkey, Brazil, and India. Excluding such markets, we observe a low single digit decline consistent with historic trends. Our strong full year top line growth of almost plus 10% was again achieved through a combination of volume growth, pricing, and the positive mix impact of the shift to smoke-free product. Pricing contributed plus 6.2% reflecting almost plus 9% combustible pricing and plus 2% for smooth free product. Smoke free also drove a positive mix impact of plus 1.9% with with higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS HD overall smoke free product contributed plus 2.2% to overall group top line growth for the year demonstrating Jean's role as a meaningful accelerator As in prior years, geographically, was negative primarily due to combustible, but to a lesser degree given robust networking growth Moving down to adjusted operating margins, we delivered full year organic expansion of plus 180 basis points and plus 100 digits points in dollar terms, comfortably achieving our objective of extension on both basis. This reflects one q four with OI margin expanding organically by plus 140 basis points, As gross margin expansion, I will create SG and A investment. Full year gross margin increased organically by plus 160 basis points and by plus 120 basis points in dollar term. SG and A grew plus 20 basis points of margin expansion enabled by cost efficiency action despite significant reinvestment commercial support, Vienna was moved to the next and US capabilities. Especially We delivered over $750 million in gross cost efficiency for the year, discuss productivity across more free and combustible, and continue back office savings. This places us well on track for our twenty four, twenty six target of $2 billion. Focusing on our smoke free business. We grew our estimated user base by over five million people in 2024, Reached approximately 38.6 million legal edge users as of December the first. This includes an estimated certificate of two million IT users five point seven million forward users, and one million users. I am pleased to report robust iCUSE growth of plus three point four million dollars versus prior year, and plus one point five million during This growth is both based and consistent with recent years, despite limited new market opening and the easy characterizing Facebook bank. Overall, added plus one point five million user year on year driven by this continued strong traction with legalized nicotine consumer in the US, despite the flight concern. Zooming in now on IQOS. Home user momentum is reflected in adjusted IMS volume with 2024 growth of over 16 billion units in line with the prior year despite This growth is also in line with the five year average and more than one billion units above when excluding contributions from markets launched in the current fiscal year. Importantly, following the rollout of HycoCinema and with increased scale of the business, the profitability of Sycos is growing strongly. In in this way, this here with the index product contribution over time as compared to January. As we've explained before, the outcome cost of the business to consumer operation results in declining in passive per per user over time as the user can grow in the market. This is a dynamic We expect to continue in the future. Turning to IQOS in Europe. As expected, HTU adjusted IMS growth accelerated strongly in HP to almost plus 11% following h one progression of around 80%. This resulted in robust plus 9% focus on growth overall for the year, despite the significant disruption, of the characterizing This double digit adjusted aims gross image was driven by strong progress, in the last number of markets including growth of around 20% or more in markets such as Bulgaria, Greece, Germany, Romania, and Spain. While growth was less dynamic, in Poland, Czech Republic. Recovery in Italy is ongoing following the discipline of the paper band. Although at a slightly slower pace than expected, The continued momentum in the region drove q four. I just share growth of plus zero point nine point zero net to ten point six percent with adjusted IMS volume reaching thirteen point five billion units on the fourth quarter moving average. Inflow shipment volume increased by just six percent against prior comparison, which included additional volumes related to the implementation of the standard band notably limited. The is now receiving all that speech you mark it? This is a generally consistent pattern of short term disruption followed by a return to the prebound growth trajectory. Following an impact of around two billion units in 2024 we expected a 2025 impact of around one billion on goods shipment and IMS including annualization effect is the most prominent effect in the first in the first quarter of 2025. We also continue to roll out the I device and new consumer variants such as Vydia and Vydia to more market providing an increasing test profile and press one button. Looking at the toxicity of textures in Europe, we reached a number of important milestones with Budapest achieving over 40% share, Rome over 30%, and London approaching 10%, and is Madrid not far behind. Japan delivered outstanding results yet again with adjusted IMS growth of close to plus 13% in both the quarter and the full year to reach an adjusted P4 share of thirty point six Let's three point one point Hi, Eur. Year on year. This was supported by continued schedules of Tera and Thinka, as well as a positive fraction of the IQOS Filima I device as we reach over nine point five million adult users. Cost per share in Tokyo for the overall entertainment category Which fifty two point eight percent in December. With the addition of cheese vodka and Amamad Suites in the ten cities and five pictures. Exceeding the fifty percent share On the National of Tech Davis, forty seven percent of the total industry is now Outside of Europe and Japan, adjusted in market sales continued to grow slowly in q four. Promising growth in a number of markets will be respected by TCT shares in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Mexico. Continuous innovation is a key driver of these goals, with stereo variant and capsule in Indonesia driving an up list in the quarter and some good initial results from the trial of Wound our lower tie our lower tier offering. IQOS continues to perform well in payroll, though off the chair performance was impacted by the dynamic of the convertible market, where competitors supply normalize and the very strong prior quarter following the long I will get the free HP of the chair increase Nike. As we start to harness the strength of our multi category portfolio, drive sales of IQOS, v Yeah. That's Coming out to the US where our IQOS would be the first complain campaign in your team is progressing well. And we expect to comment direct sales of device and HPE in our spin around the end of q one. We are seeing high interest from consumers with over four thousand added smoker on our way. As we learn from this initial consumer engagement, We are planning the rollout of pilot for the city. As you know, Steve, our focus will be on selective adult consumer engagement and giving awareness to category and brand education in the legal edge market community. We do not assume any significant volume from US IQOS before the at the launch of IQOS Illumina. And we continue to hope for an every authorization in HP 2025. Teaching categories now to ZYN where we continue the where continuous demand supported q four new achievement going growth of plus forty two Sent you on mute. One hundred and sixty five million cap. Despite ongoing production limitation, this reflects an acceleration to a new record sequential increase of plus sixty million ten hundred sixty three. On a full year basis, shipment volumes grew by plus one hundred and ninety six million tons versus 2023. Highlighting both the magnitude of growth and the tremendous effort made to maximize our pollution capacity. Win category share incrementally improved to the second ad reaching sixty five point nine percent in q four as we progress in increasing production further supported the growth of the category. Indeed. Category goes slow to me considering the summer peak of our supply constraint as shown on this chart. As the situation started to gradually improve, ZYN was again leading and outpacing the category. I am pleased to share that underlying demand for games from adult continued to grow in q four. And was higher than previously as We continue to experience some out of stock at retail, And while production capacity continues to increase, we now target full normalization sometime in the second half of 2025. We continue to target around nine hundred million tons of for the full year from our Kensington facility And as supply continues to improve, we will look to further extend growth beyond our existing consumer base to other legal entities. Our greenfield site, which is what I do, is due to come online in early twenty And we believe we are well positioned to capture this potential over the coming years. Responsible regulation of the industry is fundamental in supporting sustainable future growth for the dynamic category. We are therefore encouraged by the recent FDA authorization for the marketing and sale of all the nicotine pouches currently marketed in the US, following extensive As mentioned, this makes them the first and only authorized pet in the market. Among several consideration, we have a substantially lower amount of harmful constituent that's fixed. And all the smokeless tobacco product as well as current low use cigarette lighter. The FDA's authorization marks an important step in the protection of public health by recognizing the role that Bing can play in providing better alternative direct and other traditional tobacco product or legal edge either. We remain committed to driving industry standard in the twenty one prevention. This policy and initiative designed to help prevent this access. Further, combating trade initiative that co an interesting product remain a core priority and we dedicate a significant level of resources is performed before. ZYN, also has an exciting future outside of video. While still in its very early stages. International nicotine pulp shipments grew by twenty seven million tons or plus seventy five percent And we already see strong volume momentum in international market which is Pakistan, South Africa, Mexico, the UK, and Google, We launched nicotine vouchers in six new market during the quarter, reached a total of thirty seven worldwide including Italy, Romania, Using e vapor, we continue to see strong consumer traction behind Vibone. The brand holds the top sweet post proposition in thirteen European market, and add the number one position in five including Italy. V plays an important role within our multi category strategy as an increasingly trusted choice for small group category fully users as a source of incremental growth is improving Our primary focus for the combustible business is to maximize value over time while supporting the growth of the smoothivity. Pricing and cost efficiency are the key leaders, drive performance, while maintaining our category leadership. We delivered another robust volume quarter with growth of plus one point one percent. All regions contributed to twenty four organic net revenue growth, of plus six point two percent is gross profit increasing by ten point eight Full year pricing of plus eight point seven percent includes contributions from Germany, and thirteen. We expect organic twenty twenty five predictable pricing to normalize to plus five to plus six percent past year reflecting GDP to higher inflationary accounting. In twenty twenty four. Category share was flat in q four with positive contribution from Turkey and India. Offset by decline in Egypt and Indonesia, with continued growth in the below tier one segment. On a full year basis, we grew category share plus zero point one points. Reaching all time high for both Marlboro and our global brands This brings me to the outlook for 2025. Where we expect another year of strong growth from all categories driving stuff, and bottom line delivery. We anticipate the fifth consecutive year of positive volumes with growth of up to plus two percent notably driven by another year of strong growth in smoke free products, at around plus twelve percent to plus fourteen percent. So I close we expect the continuation of strong momentum with the absolute growth in HPU adjusted IMS volume expected to be at a similar level to 2024, translating
James Bushnell: ten percent.
Emmanuel Babeau: The the expression goes We expect shipping growth to be broadly in line with this double digit trajectory subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing inventory. We expect ongoing strong growth dynamic within the US in cutting pouch category. Despite the supply constraint I mentioned before, we forecast a US in volume shipment range of seven eighty to eight hundred and twenty million tons for the year, supported by capacity expansion. This represents another year of sequential acceleration in volumes with an expected increase of opportunity two hundred to two hundred and forty million cans compared to the one hundred and ninety six million can increase This supports the total TMI forecast of plus six to plus eight percent organic net revenue growth. This includes a headwind of over a hundred basis points due to higher inflationary accounting energy, and the technical impact of implementing a new financial model in Indonesia below tier one premium. The change in Indonesia has no effect on the. Moving down to the p and l, we expect ongoing small clinic effect operating leverage and cost efficiency, to drive double digit adjusted operating growth, operating the growth. Of plus ten point five and plus twelve point five. This includes single spot gross With those gross and adjusted operating margin forecast to expand in both organic and adjusted the last term. At seventy six hundred. We expect SG and A cost to increase increase broadly in line with net revenue on an organic basis as we invest behind our small ticket. We forecast currency neutral adjusted, deleted, EPS growth of plus ten point five percent
James Bushnell: and plus twelve point five percent.
Emmanuel Babeau: This factor is in essentially stable net interest expense and an increase in our Corporate tax rate to approximately twenty two point five to twenty two point five percent due to tax increases in language OECD plus the global minimum tax. And the mix of international earnings. In dollar terms. We forecast growth of plus seven plus nine percent to a range of seven that are four to seven the last seventeen. This includes an unfavorable forecast currency impact of twenty two cents at revenue exchange rate percent, primarily driven by the growth trends of the Bellard mitigated by our AGI For the first quarter of 2025, we expect a strong start to the year with net revenue and operating income growth growing in line with our full year objective despite the leap year comparison. We forecast HTU adjusted INR growth of around plus ten percent which factors in the large annualization impact from the easing weather ban in the quarter with a progressive improvement Goody. We forecast shipment volume of thirty five to thirty six billion for HPUs and one hundred seventy one hundred and eighty million times for USU. In project q one adjusted diluted EPS of one dollar fifty eight, one dollar including a negative currency values of four cents at the revenue rate, And then if you incorporate tax rate, two to three points higher than the prior year quarter. These are our 2024 delivery and 2025 outlook, we are well positioned to meet or exceed all metrics of the twenty four, twenty six target targets presented at our twenty twenty two investigate. This is especially true at the level of operating income growth. As well as for ECS delivery, where our algorithm assumes instant. This level of top and bottom line growth reflects the best in class growth profile within the context of flash cap consumer technology. Importantly, we're also well on track to deliver high single digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in dollar term across the twenty twenty four, twenty twenty six period after any Indeed, we measure our cash flows in dollar and after a record delivery in twenty twenty.
James Bushnell: Four
Emmanuel Babeau: we expect to deliver operating cash flow of around eleven billion dollars, fourteen Thank you. Five. This is forty nine with twenty twenty four. Once accounting costs in nonrecurring payments with a total impact of around one billion dollars. While we continue to achieve the German tax for such space. We have decided to make a zero point eight billion dollar payment this year. And we also anticipate the final transition tax payment rated to the US tax Yes. We anticipate capital expenditure of around one point five billion dollars Is the last portion of this related to you? As we prioritize the investment behind our most successful. Our sprint twenty twenty four cash flow and EBITDA growth combined with a favorable impact from our euro balance sheet AGI, allowed us to reduce our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by zero point five times point sixty six. Ahead of our expectation. And representing a dramatic of power delivery. We expect further progress in twenty twenty five placing us on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of twenty twenty six. I will now send you back to Yaczek for confirming email.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. In summary, 2020 was a remarkable year for PMI. Our financial result that comprises this of our strategy and the success of our transformation the underlying momentum it took bolstered by our practice measures and pricing and cost. I remain confident in our position as the global smoke As we continue to identify on our multi category strategy, your premium brand,
Emmanuel Babeau: I cost I'm Our key strategic priorities for 2025 are clear. As we continue to support a function and development of our smoke to business, what is the UI, and international. We expect continued strong momentum in 2025. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our our twenty twenty four, twenty twenty six growth target as we progress towards our ambition of becoming substantially smarter by twenty thirty Finally, and importantly, our strong growth output and highly cost generative business enables us to continuously reinvest in our small footprint transformation while returning cash to shareholders. In September we increased our annual dividend for the seventeenth consecutive year in line with our long term Thank you. And Emmanuel and I, would be happy now to answer your question.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. And our first question today comes from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is open.
Matt Smith: Yeah. Speaking to Manuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning. May I ask who's calling?
Matt Smith: The 2025 outlook calls for HTU shipments in
Owen Bennett: in numbers or in market sales growth fairly in line with what you saw in 2024. But could you talk about the the composition of the growth? If it's overall in line, a different contribution by geography in in your outlook and can you remind us on if there has been any progress in new markets contributing to growth in 2025 or if you've made any progress in those markets as you look out to your 2026 goals.
Jacek Olczak: Now so in the guidance, our financials continue seeing good growth in Japan. And in the you know, number of parts in Europe, I mean, a manual man about the Italy, Czech, Poland, right, when the group is a a bit below what would expect at this stage, especially Italy and Czech following the the flavored ban But we also see that there is some recovery coming in, so I think you know, hopefully, in the second part of the year, we should bring Italy another geography that part to what the rest of the euro Europe is going through. And we have not, in the guidance, assume any significant new market opening in terms of the volume. As you know, we've you know, we're gonna head into my remarks. Mean, we're dealing with this rational world, fighting with the irrational world. I hope that, you know, the most recent authorizations of FDA following the authorizations of Kid Not Birth, now the vouchers. Will be a good incentive or encouragement by other governments which to be very frank, to be stupidly oppose smoke free products while allowing cigarettes. But in the guidance, we have not put any significant volume coming from the new geography. So this is all organic growth, and as you could saw it in the for the quarters of this year, Despite the fact even if you look at Japan when almost half of the market is already on a on a smoke free products, the growth continues there.
Owen Bennett: Thank you, Yasuk. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Monica of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alright. Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel and Yancek. I am No. I'm good. Had a question on your margins. You're guiding robust
Bonnie Herzog: operating leverage on a currency neutral basis. This year. So hoping you could highlight the, you know, some of the key drivers behind this. Also, so I wanted to verify if your guidance assumes a potential entry of a loom US or you know, just possibly continued investments without, you know, any corresponding Sales. And then how should we think about the margin contribution from ILUM in the US and how long it might take after your entries in the market for for those margins to really be meaningful.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe I start, Bonnie, the good morning. Is that I mean, yes. We're looking for a robust margin, like expansion this year, maybe not precisely to the same level as we had last year, but still it's gonna be robust searching in a hundred basis points of territory, this is what we're looking into. Is that, you know, combinations of a few factors, we still looking at the pricing contributions, pretty obvious. There's obviously positive Mix, right, between a categories and especially now that we have a free smoke free categories, on the positive to margin path including the vape. So, you know, the recircheated. You know, our strategy of going selectively, but you know, with the right impacts in the geographies that is needed in order receiving money, you know, behind if you like or marching behind. So this will contribute. And, you know, we've had in the past that you remember quite a headwinds headwinds coming from a COGS. And I think those have I think they are behind us. this base here and there, Okay? Then obviously, this whole, you know, conversations especially coming from the US about the tariffs and so on. But, you know, the way we organize our supply chain as you know, US on the ZYN is essentially self sufficient. Our supply chains in Europe I mean, we organized our supply chain almost by blocks, so I don't see at this at this stage that they should be on a surprises coming on the tariff side. I think we're pretty confident where we'll land with the COGS for the year. There is obviously ongoing support coming from the scale of IQOS, especially devices. When the okay. There was a con be of scale. There was a robustness of the device in terms of a quality, etcetera. So we actually don't have this like, in the past, a bit of a pressure on the margins coming from a device sales. This this we have well stabilized for twenty twenty four towards behind the margin expansion. And I think we we we should expect the same expecting the same in a twenty five. Now your questions with regards to Illuma margins US, okay, maybe one by one, we still expect that hopefully you know, we will get the authorization for I CONSULUMA around the mid of the year. Again, on the one hand, one could read this as encouragement that a As we said, it's total scientific, etcetera, review FDA has gave authorizations for all variants of the I I wouldn't be my wouldn't be myself if I wouldn't comment that obviously, if something takes five years, it must be thorough because otherwise, I cannot fix explain, you know, the length of the process. But I do hope that, you know, FDA We'll move faster and, you know, already I could do my spending for a while. And by the way, if you have it also authorization, for for Zendesk. So the the margin story, I would repeat my self that, obviously, when we start adding support behind the behind the Lumen, I mean, at the initial period, will be a negative. Right? But in a scheme of the things, in the PNL size equal, like, of our business in the US, I don't think it should be something which is you know, that much worried. And I believe US will go in the similar path as had on a heat not burning in other places. So two to three years, we should I could should be net net contributor to to the bottom line. Bearing in mind, as always, reminding everyone that we don't really have the headwind of cannibalization. Right? So we don't really we're we're we're in a better starting position. And we know, we had a growing confidence in the ICOSI Lumen international, but we know where ICONZYLUM are brought us on international over the last three years. And it continues, you know, generating the growth user acquisition. So I believe it's really a great proposition for for adult smokers in the
Emmanuel Babeau: Maybe just just to compliment on on the margin side, Bonnie. As you can, you know, judge from our guidance, we have significant ambition in terms of margin improvement in 2025 And what is driving that is the fact that we are flying on several engine here on margin improvement, and everything is coming together put it positively at the same time. So indeed, you know, we have of course, the mix evolution that is very favorable to to to to us with smoke free product coming with a higher margin, and they are growing very fast. Among those multi products, we have the US and ZYN that is growing even faster and which, as we already said, is best in class in terms of margin. So that's obviously a plus. We're also increasing price. Yes. Of course. We're not gonna continue to deliver eight percent plus price increase on combustible, but it's gonna remain extremely robust. And we also have the ambition to grow our price, not at the same level, but significantly on our smoke free portfolio. And then when we look at our COGS, we are working on productivity. They are scale effect. That are delivering positively And as you know, we were facing until now a significant headwind on cost, notably on the combustible business. This is easing. Twenty five should be better. And twenty six could be even better than than twenty five, by the way. So we are going in the right direction there, and that is making us clearly targeting nice margin improvement both organically and in dollar term for twenty five.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Super helpful. And actually, I'm just gonna ask a quick follow-up because you kinda touched on this, but you also mentioned this morning about, you know, targeting or you continue to target gross margin expansion in combustibles, And then you did say that you expect the gap to grow relative to your smoke free product gross margin. So, you know, previously, you guys have talked about, I think, a ten point gap. So know, as your your gross margins expand on, you know, combustibles, I think what I'm hearing you say is that, you know, not only is that an opportunity, but also continued margin expansion on Smokefree is what you just mentioned. So do you foresee that gap expanding? I mean, does it go to fifteen points? Spread or, you know, could it go to twenty? It's just kinda trying to think through that in the next couple of years.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look. On on the consumable, we we've already highlighted the fact that there was a ten percentage point gap and and it has been expanding in the last few years. So, indeed, we have the ambition to do better on, the gross margin for combustible, and we explained why. But as we continue to progress also rapidly on smooth free products, and both, you know, with the mix effect coming from from ZYN, but separately on IQOS and and and ZYN, we want to continue to progress. So we could have indeed a gap that could continue to expand between smoke free product and and combustible in the in the coming years.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you, Ben.
Operator: Our next question comes from Grav Jay of
Gaurav Jain: Good morning. Emmanuel and Jace.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you for asking my questions.
Gaurav Jain: Kevin, I have a couple of questions. One is on Zendesk. So if I look at the scatter data,
Jacek Olczak: the volumes have decelerated to mid teens growth. And your guidance is for thirty four percent to forty one percent growth.
Gaurav Jain: Then you also mentioned that the supply normalization would only happen in two h twenty five.
Emmanuel Babeau: So, you know, just wanted to understand what gives us the confidence that the sooner we can we'll be accelerating to
Gaurav Jain: This almost forty percent growth rate again.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So I I would take it, girl. Good morning, So we look also you know, how the volumes were evolving in a q four of the weeks of the last quarter. We see the growing velocities behind ZEN. Actually, there was the only brand I think, over the last few weeks which was growing in the velocities, not the rest of the at least the big four other brands or smaller, but big other brands. Look. We all also have to understand that we're reading all this data. We've No full supply of the supply constraint environment. Right? So it's a bit difficult that you see at the retail. It depends even in which stores you're looking at that something which be significantly different than what we're shipping to the to the trade. But, you know, q four as we predicted, you know, with the increased capacity in Owensboro, We had the first quarter with the significant sequential quarter on quarter growth. Even if you will take the run rate of what we see the last weeks, etcetera, I think that the the the guidance is somehow reflect what we see there. Now our comments that you know, we should we think that we should be meeting the demand by about mid of this year, I have to make one reservation. Is that it's difficult to actually read what the demand is. Because we know what is the level of out of stock. We know what is the existing users of Zena demand for the product and knowing that this this purchases or the purchases somehow impact by the fact that, unfortunately, they are confronted with the lack of a bill lack of availability out of stock, and that is the you know, all the positive momentum, which doesn't have. I've also the FDA authorizations, which know, on the one hand, one could read product was in the market, so there is no change. Actually, I think it gives a lot of you know, visibility and stability to all the market participants, including the trade. And I believe also consumers that the product now has the full fledged, you know, my language authorization and all the flavor variants So all of these things I I think, will translate into the volumes which we prefer. Project of the volumes which will reflected in our in our guidance.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And and follow-up
Emmanuel Babeau: Question to that. You know,
Gaurav Jain: to build clearly in supply shortage, retailers have been putting their markups I think you increased prices by thirty cents last year while retail has increased prices by one dollar or
Jacek Olczak: you know, three dollars, five dollars.
Gaurav Jain: How do you control retail price? And is there a way for you to as supply normalizes, to reduce retail price so that that will also have a positive effect on your volume.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So, you know, if you have a degree of the out of stock as Zen is experiencing, it's obviously managing the price at the at the retail level is you know, is a little bit more challenging. Right? I mean, it's pretty obvious. But I believe with the growing demand sorry. With the growing supply of the product, I think this pricing will come to the sum sort naturally to the normalization So I have to also admit that, look, we are very happy with the support we're getting from you know, retailers handling our products and, you know, it's not that easy for them also to be confronted with product which on the one hand has the demand on the other hand, they cannot realize their margins and, you know, they take from a certain price and you know, I hope but again, I think that, you know, the pricing situations in the market will will sort out somehow not surely the moment when the product will be in a full, unconstrained suppliers, as we said. You know, second half of the twenty five, we should start seeing we should start seeing improvement on this
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. And if I could just squeeze in one last question on Zendesk.
Gaurav Jain: Could you just talk about that ELTA, what the product is, and then you think we can see it in the market?
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So, obviously, as well, as we all know, right, the the authorization came Essentially, last days or hours of the one administration is now I guess we'll have to wait for the for the new author sorry, for the new administration Look. As I said in the You know, in the answers to the questions before that, I do hope that you know, period of four or five years waiting for authorization, Is too much. It's too long. And I do believe that there will be some I hope there will be some accelerations in the processing because of the authorizations. And you know, we have to also understand that, you know, partially the challenge which the US market has very much on the vape product is by the fact that the legal part of the market has not been created So on the one hand, you know, FDA is doing a lot of right things in terms of law enforcement and chasing the illegal Chinese or whatever import. But on the other hand, there is a demand among the smokers adult nicotine users for this type of a product. And unless we create in a fast manner the legal part of that market, and then, you know, we essentially wasting our time and and money. So I do believe that the FDA will take this also into considerations that know, this situation shouldn't happen in our product category. And
Gaurav Jain: there is a demand for the product. So let's rest.
Jacek Olczak: For the law enforcement, etcetera, the illicit mark But you cannot just control the illicit market if you haven't provided the legal solutions in the market which are available. So I do believe that, you know, the ICOS sorry, ICOS as well, but ZYN has some
Gaurav Jain: pending
Jacek Olczak: authorizations or applications, I should say. I do believe that they're gonna be processed in a faster in a faster manner than before.
Gaurav Jain: Thank you so much. Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question, please press star one one. And our next question comes from Eric Serrano of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks, guys.
Eric Serrano: Morning, mate. Hoping you could get hopefully, I just give some color in terms of
Callum Elliott: what you're seeing in Italy, You mentioned that the fourth quarter was a little bit softer than you had anticipated anticipated after the nice recovery you saw in the third quarter from the characterizing flavor ban. And then in terms of Poland, can you remind us when, you know, when you expect to see some disruption from the ban being implemented and what sort of an impact you expect in terms of overall European combustors combustibles business? And then lastly, on FX, it seems like the FX headwind that you called out for the year and the guidance was know, a bit less than what seems to be implied based on spot rates and your typical yen hedge Wondering if there's been any change in the hedging policy or if there's any reason why it may be a bit lower than anticipated. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe I take the last one. It's the easiest one, and I come back to Italy, which is a bit the longer story. I mean, in a twenty two cents at spot rates right now, I mean, frankly speaking, the biggest contributor to the negative is the Russian ruble. And that's well above the sixty percent of the variance. The year actually goes in a cent. I guess it was if I recall, about the four cents in our estimate that the spot rate, obviously, As we all know, we're living in the pretty dynamic times. As we speak, but this is what it is. There was a big and coming from the Egyptian fund, right, when you know, it's we had to take the heat. That obviously will not be repeat re repeated in the will not repeat in the in twenty five. Actually, this will result in a positive currency value, but this is on the currency. So frankly speaking, at this stage, it's a ruble and and as I said, four cents or so on the end, and the rest is just the bag due to our international footprint. The manual wants to add
Emmanuel Babeau: add something. I want to add something because I think I mean, you know, the volatility we're seeing on the currency market today be a good touch of trust from, you know, how things are are working for us. I should first remind you that we have a natural important edging in our balance sheet with more than sixty percent of our debt that is in euro. And therefore, when we have a weakness in the euro versus dollar, which is a situation we've seen recently, course, we have a negative impact on our p and l, but we have also a decrease of our debt in dollar terms, and we're also benefiting from lower cost of the debt in euros plus, of course, lower interest rate interest cost in euros translated into dollars. So that has been certainly helping our trajectory in twenty four. And if there was continued weakness of the euro, that would continue to help us in the future. Probably, what is not fully captured by the market is the fact that indeed on top of that, we have two significant edge position, one on our exposure to the yen for twenty twenty five. We have around sixty percent of our exposure that is covered at a rate of around one hundred and thirty eight yen for one dollar. So that means that we we we are not impacted by the possible deterioration of the yen for that part of of our exposure. And we have also a lower exposure to a lower aging, sorry, on on euro. Where we have around a bit more than one fifth sorry, one fourth of our exposure to euro, where we are covered at one twelve. Which is also limiting a bit the impact on the PNL when the euro is going down. So with everything I've been saying, you have all the explanation. What has been showing with you on the forex impact for us today.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. Now on the on Italy. So I think, yes, the second half was a bit weaker than we would maybe expect. I mean, Tally was going this know, many others, not all, but many other to to member states of the EU for that flavor ban. I think what we see is that okay, some smokers, some users have a hop temperal. Right? But the return to cigarettes, which always was that risk. So Also explains in the same geography is the cigarette trend are slightly or better than one could you know, expect or could think. There is some polyols between the vape product very much, and that's, I believe, maybe partially also explains why beef proposition has advanced most in Italy. Right? And this was in a in a in a in a closed system. Very shortly after short period of time, jump to travel to the number one proposition. I think we need to maybe look at, you know, the category of a smoke free over period of time on a total basis because there will be some poll usage and sometimes driven by the event. Like this by this flavor But we also have a geography in Europe that very shortly after the implementation of the of the of the of the flavors one. I mean, they actually returned to the the growth rates which we had before. So, you know, maybe Tally is our player. We're looking into this whole pay. But as I said, Part of our multi category strategy is also Should there be any leakage that they keep not burn users, we can capture this with other proposition. Then I guess we need a bit more time to see the stabilization. Poland, you asked me about the Poland. I don't think Poland has put the stick in the ground which moment they really want to fully implement the bar Right? Later in the week, it will happen. I think somewhere in the twenty five, but it has to be this is not you know, if this speaker has not been put in the ground, It is more towards the end of a of a busy year.
Callum Elliott: Great. Thanks so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Hamed of UBS. Your line is open.
Hamed: Good morning, guys. Thank you for for the questions. Hi, guys. A couple from me as well.
Hamed: Firstly, on on on ZYN again in the US, We we noticed a couple of your peers have have launched synthetic moist nicotine products. And according to the scanner data, have seen some initial uptake. How how do you see the moist versus dry dynamic in the US and where do you think the consumer may end up in in the future recognizing that in Europe, most products are are moist. And and the second question maybe comes back to your comments around Italy. But but but just longer term, we see the vapor category continuing to grow quite quite strongly, and we can discuss its flaws around flavors, marketing, underage use, etcetera. But but do you see this as a headwind for for the tobacco industry, or do you believe the total pie can continue to grow with limited impact on tobacco?
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe the second part, I take it. I think the total price grows despite the fact that, you know, the the movements between the categories within a smoke free you know, there is some dynamics, right, between a heat not burn and an e vape. And the pouch is now depends how market is organized and regulated. We also know that know, the most difficult actually to read category due to the way the the market is organized currently is the eBay category. Right? Because you have a a a disposables, you have parts. You have open tank systems still, and some products Okay. You know, under the regulations and properly authorized depends on a jurisdiction. Some products are just popping up in the market, so you could call it the different forms of illicit trade, but I think, you know, you see this in the US, but also in Europe, in the UK, and a few other places. The regulators, governments, taking more a serious look into properly organizing that market. I can't tell you whether this will be completed in the twenty five, but definitely, there is a the moves the movements the moves are in the right direction. So I believe twenty five, twenty six, the category should be normalized by the five that it's gonna be properly regulated. And then we take it from the I'm not the one to talk about the youth exposure, etcetera, because, you know, we know, follow-up is you know, our policy, you know, with our reviews on this one. But, definitely, it's difficult to control of the discipline in the market. If you're dealing with You know, all of the different emanations of the product coming essentially legal to the marketplace that obviously also enjoys the less distantly in trade channels. So completely, you know, invisible trade channels, if you like, etcetera. When it comes to your questions about the synthetic vent versus dry, So just to take it from a perspective, the way we look at the data in the US, for example, this whole new things which are coming into the market, there is a quite a long list of different SKUs and you know, the moist flowers and know, This whole market, the debt part of the market, if I'm not miss mistaking, move year on year by barely twenty basis points. In a scheme of these things, there's presumably a lot of dynamic on the on the on the weekly basis, but doesn't seem that it's, you know, has any any major attractions, etcetera. The insights which we'll have when we talk over consumers, we see and obviously, you know, when you read that consumer insight, it's not a pure mathematical accuracy and the exact number, but I think that the moist products moist pouch products is more appealing to the moist snuff. Type of a users. Right? Like snows, etcetera. While what we see in the marketplace that the dry product has a more appeal towards the smokers and evapor. Or evapist. That is what I can tell you at this stage.
Hamed: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate that. Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question today comes from Phillips
Phillip Stein: Stein of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Phillip Stein: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I just had I just had one question, please.
Phillip Stein: It was just on the HTU guidance. If I look at where the volumes landed at the at the end of twenty four and then I look at the guidance range you've the ten to twelve percent you've guided to for for twenty five. But then just extrapolating that out for twenty six and looking at your guidance there of the hundred and eighty to two hundred million of of of shipment volume. Just trying to get a sense of what gives you confidence in like, my math said implies, you know, we acceleration in the growth in twenty twenty six. And I just want to understand, I suppose, what gives you that confidence You will see that reacceleration, in twenty twenty six. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. So as I said earlier, I mean, in the guidance for this year for twenty five. We essentially stayed very low into we essentially focus on organic growth in a market that Obviously, if you open the, you know, twenty five and beyond, twenty think it's becoming maybe more prudent of her to assume that there will be some geographies also coming finally and opening the the markets to the new proposition. There is one point which I maybe we haven't articulated well in the in our remarks and that the answers to the questions before is that There is still about the twenty or so percent of the volumes on the heat not burn that we don't really do We would can't really realize the full growth potential. And I'm referring here to to the geographies of Russia and Ukraine. Now for obvious reasons. But I was just look at the numbers of twenty four I think we have left behind about point six, maybe even more point of a growth which we would normally expect to deliver. If all these markets were you know, subject to the same sort of market conditions as other place Right? The Zillooma, etcetera. So okay. Let's see how this unwind. I think the the graph which we projected very much focused on organic organic meaning, you know, the geographies which we have today on hand. I think, is a good growth. Volume terms is essentially the same volume growth as we used to have in the past. But also in a broader sense, we more and more see the potential of the multi category and the total volumes of the smoke through products is just the one category. And as we know very well, the margin from the margin per perspective, they all they all essentially create a great opportunities. I mean, I think they all greatly accretive to to where we are today and to especially to the combustibles. Second thing is and I think we will zoom a little bit tomorrow. Try to zoom a bit more to this at our CAGNY con at our CAGNY presentations. But from the user's perspective, it's actually pretty nice economic proposition. Because we're essentially then leveraging all the investments through the user acquisitions, etcetera. And, you know, one of the category of your of of acquiring the user, but all the average product categories are actually very nicely benefit from this whole thing. So you will hear from us more and more talking. Obviously, we'll give you the granularity about the KidNotverbi vaping as in. But I think in the next few years, the focus will be more and more turning into total of a smoke free rather than just the individual. Because this also somehow reflects the the user directions, the user consumer dynamics.
Phillip Stein: Thank you very much.
Hamed: Thank you. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions.
Operator: At this time. I would like to turn it back to James for closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you. Before closing our call, I'd like to remind you that as Yacine mentioned, we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on February nineteenth and we hope you'll be able to join us either in person or virtually. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. And have a great day.
Hamed: Thank you. Thank you. Speak to you soon.
Jacek Olczak: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Following an excellent first half we delivered another outstanding performance in Q3. All key elements of the business performed at or above expectations, driving strong double-digit organic top and bottom-line growth, margin expansion and a significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in dollar terms. As expected, both IQOS and ZYN accelerated on a sequential basis. IQOS delivered a significant step-up in HTU adjusted IMS volumes in Q3, which is historically a quarter impacted negatively by seasonality. This reflects the strong underlying momentum of the business, with adjusted IMS close to plus 15% ahead versus prior year with another very strong performance from Japan, reaccelerating momentum in Europe, and promising results from a number of global markets. With ZYN, we continued our efforts to increase U.S. production capacity in response to strong demand, enabling stabilization of share performance followed by sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This led to a significant increase in sequential U.S. volumes, with over 40% year-on-year growth despite capacity constraints. Outside the U.S. nicotine pouch can volumes grew by close to 70%. Our combustibles business also accelerated to high single-digit net revenue and gross profit growth, led by further very strong pricing, resilient volumes and the benefits of our cost actions. Our overall Q3 performance epitomizes the soundness of our strategy, with underlying momentum across categories with strong volumes, pricing and smoke-free mix supported by cost efficiency measures. With double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and diluted earnings per share in currency-neutral and dollar terms, we are raising our full-year guidance. Turning now to the headline financials for Q3. We delivered excellent organic revenue growth of plus 11.6%, driven by shipment volume growth of plus 2.9%, positive smoke-free category mix and pricing. The combination of this positive top-line performance with the additional favorable smoke-free mix impact on profits and ongoing cost efficiencies, enabled us to achieve growth of plus 13.8% in organic operating income and plus 18.0% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share. This excludes an unfavorable currency impact of $0.06, notably due to weakness in the Egyptian Pound, Argentine Peso and the strong Swiss Franc, partly offset by the Japanese Yen. Despite the currency headwind, our proactive measures on pricing and accelerated cost initiatives drove plus 11.2% dollar growth in adjusted operating income and plus 14.4% dollar growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to a record $1.91. This better-than-expected earnings delivery reflects IQOS and ZYN shipment volumes at the higher end of our expectations and a very strong combustibles performance. In addition we benefitted from a lower net financing cost, including increased interest income as well as mark-to-market gains on derivatives that we use to manage the currency profile of our debt, driven by interest rate volatility. Combined with an excellent H1, this yields an impressive plus 17.2% year-to-date currency-neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, with double-digit organic top-line growth and 190 basis points of organic opening income margin expansion. Including currency, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of close to plus 8% which is a testament to our continued focus on delivering strong performance in dollar terms. Let’s turn to the Q3 financial performance by category, with both sides of the business producing excellent results. Smoke-free net revenues and gross profit grew organically by plus 16.8% and plus 20.2% respectively, driving 200 basis points of gross margin expansion. This reflects a robust IQOS performance in the quarter including manufacturing productivities, as well as the continued accretion of ZYN and a small but growing contribution from VEEV. Smoke-free gross margins were more than 450 basis points higher than combustibles in Q3 and more than 200 basis points higher year-to-date. Combustible net revenue and gross profit growth accelerated to almost plus 9% organically. Combustible gross margins improved by plus 10 basis points organically and by plus 20 basis points in dollar terms, marking the second quarter of expansion following a challenging 2023. We continue to target combustible gross margin expansion for the year in organic and dollar terms as cost pressures, including the impact of the EU single-use plastics directive, are more than offset by pricing and ongoing cost initiatives. Focusing now on volumes, we are well on track for our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. Our business delivered a remarkable performance of around plus 3% total shipment growth both in Q3 and year-to-date, with all categories and all four regions growing over both periods. Q3 HTU adjusted IMS growth of plus 14.8% reflects the underlying dynamism of our IQOS business, with a continued strong performance in Japan and a reacceleration in Europe as expected. Q3 HTU shipments of 35.3 billion units were at the upper end of our expectations, with the superior adjusted in-market sales growth compared to shipments due to shipment phasing, as highlighted in H1. Our oral smoke-free business grew Q3 shipment volumes by plus 22.2%, with ZYN powering U.S. growth of plus 41.4% and very strong international performance. Our VEEV e-vapor business exhibited continued volume momentum in the quarter, reaching the equivalent of 1.2 billion units on year-to-date basis. Q3 cigarette shipments grew by plus 1.3%, outpacing the total estimated international cigarette industry excluding China and the U.S. at plus 0.5%. The unusually resilient industry performance this year reflects growing volumes in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted such as Turkey, India and Brazil, alongside a reduction in illicit volumes in a number of markets driven partly by geopolitical factors. Our growth includes notable contributions from Turkey, India and Italy and reflects good category share performance despite robust pricing. Our exceptional Q3 revenue performance reflected our three structural pillars of top-line growth: volumes, pricing, and smoke-free mix shift. Building on our very robust volume growth, pricing contributed plus 7.5 points of growth. This was powered by strong combustibles pricing of plus 9.7%, plus 3% pricing for IQOS HTUs and a notable contribution from ZYN. The positive mix impact of our smoke-free business delivered plus 1.4 points despite the strong growth of combustibles, given the higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS and ZYN. As in prior quarters, geographic mix was negative but to a lesser degree as growth stepped-up in Europe and the U.S. The year-to-date net revenue drivers were very similar, with double-digit organic top-line growth built on positive volumes, smoke-free category mix of more than plus 2 points and strong pricing. Turning to operating income, we delivered impressive Q3 organic margin expansion of plus 90 basis points, and plus 110 basis points in dollar terms. Gross margins increased organically by 80 basis points, and by plus 70 basis points in dollar terms. This was again driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity savings across the value chain. Moving now to SG&A. Despite a planned step-up in commercial activity, our organic cost evolution was essentially in line with top-line growth, with plus 40 basis points of margin expansion in adjusted dollar terms supported by cost efficiency actions. As previously communicated, we target an organic increase in SG&A below the rate of net revenue growth for the year, while still supporting our smoke-free expansion with continued commercial investment. We delivered an incremental $180 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3 reaching almost $490 million year-to-date, with initiatives notably focused on manufacturing and back-office costs. While only the first year, we are progressing nicely towards our 2024-2026 target of $2 billion in gross savings. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted operating income margin evolution was also very positive with plus 190 basis points organic expansion and plus 40 basis points in dollar terms. We are well set to meet our full-year objective of expansion on both bases. Turning now to our IQOS business, which is celebrating the ten-year anniversary of its first launches in Japan and Italy. IQOS is the world’s leading smoke-free product, generating over $10 billion in annual net revenues. Notwithstanding the incredible growth and success of the brand over that time, there is a very substantial growth runway over the coming years as more of the world’s one billion legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. Indeed, robust growth continues this year. We spoke last quarter about our expectation for a strong H2 delivery, with continued user growth momentum supported by our commercial programs, including events to celebrate the 10-year milestone. As expected, Q3 momentum accelerated with plus 14.8% year-on-year growth in HTU adjusted IMS and a very substantial sequential step-up of 1.8 billion units versus Q2, which is especially impressive in a quarter that is typically negatively impacted by seasonality. This reflects a return to double-digit growth in Europe, a continued excellent trajectory in Japan, and a further acceleration from our global markets. We expect further strong growth in Q4. The success of IQOS is built on technology, commercial capabilities, brand-building and innovation on both devices and consumables. Following the successful launch of the IQOS ILUMA i device in Japan earlier this year, we are expanding the rollout to more markets, including Italy, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, I am pleased to report a Q3 reacceleration in adjusted IMS growth to plus 11.3% following a slower Q2 progression. This includes the resumption of growth in markets passing through the adjustment phase of the characterizing flavor ban. The majority of EU HTU volume is now covered by the ban, and we observe a return to robust growth in markets such as Greece, Romania, and Portugal. Following the stronger-than-expected initial impact in Q2, we are pleased to report positive volume momentum in Italy. This was supported by the launch of recent HTU variants, including our mainstream-priced offering DELIA, and tobacco-free LEVIA, jointly accounting for close to 7% of Italy’s HTU offtake three months from launch. In addition, we see excellent momentum in markets such as Germany, Spain and the UK, and increasingly balanced growth across markets overall, regardless of IQOS penetration. Regional Q3 adjusted HTU share was up by +0.8 points year-on-year to 9.5%, and modestly lower sequentially due to the typical impact of seasonally higher combustible volumes in the summer. HTU adjusted IMS volumes reached 13.2 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, maintaining our high share of the category with robust sequential growth. Looking at our key city offtake shares in Europe, we see continued rapid progress in a large number of cities. An increasing number are posting growth of over 2.0 points year-on-year, which is the most meaningful comparison given seasonal factors. Particular callouts include Budapest, Athens, Bratislava, Bucharest, London and Amsterdam. Turning now to Japan, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit progression with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 14%, reaching 10.9 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Our commercial programs continue to drive meaningful results, with innovation on devices and consumables propelling a +3.2 point market share increase to 29.8% in Q3 and surpassing the landmark of 30% in September. This includes the impact of the IQOS ILUMA i device, which was launched in Q1 and delivers enhanced consumer satisfaction. As shown on the previous slide, IQOS HTU offtake shares in key cities such as Tokyo continue to advance rapidly. We have previously flagged that Tokyo offtake share for the overall heat-not-burn category reached 50% earlier this year. This is also now true in eight cities overall including Yokohama, Kawasaki, Sendai and Fukuoka, with several others rapidly approaching the same milestone. This is clearly a positive sign of the enduring growth potential in a market with already high penetration. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very good growth across a number of global markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. These include cities in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Egypt, where Cairo reached close to 10% share. Offtake share of more than 5% in Jakarta is indicative of the strong acceleration in Indonesia, as we continue our geographic and portfolio expansion, including a growing offer of clove TEREA HTU variants. Finally, I would like to call out duty-free, where the ongoing travel recovery combined with the strength of our multicategory portfolio delivered dynamic growth, with ZYN and VEEV increasingly offered alongside IQOS. Moving now to ZYN, the number one U.S. smoke-free brand continues to see very strong underlying momentum. As flagged previously, we are working to progressively increase our production volumes, and this was reflected in a sequential acceleration to 149 million cans shipped in Q3. As we continued working through these supply constraints, ZYN’s category share stabilized and then resumed growth on a sequential basis through the quarter, despite a further $0.15 per can list price increase taken at the start of September. We continue to expect shipments to match consumer demand at some point during the fourth quarter. While gauging the level of underlying demand is not an exact science in the current circumstances, our promotional and commercial activity has naturally been lower as we prioritize meeting existing consumer needs over growing the legal-age user base from other nicotine categories. With ongoing efforts to increase our U.S. production capacity to around 900 million cans for the full year of 2025, and significant expansion beyond 2025 from our planned new facility in Colorado, we believe we are well positioned to capture ZYN’s potential over the coming years. We remain committed to driving industry standards in under-21 prevention, with policies and initiatives designed to prevent youth access. Our robust U.S. marketing code prohibits social media influencers and we refuse requests for such partnerships. All our owned product websites use age verification technology and we partner with WeCard and TruAge to support age restriction checks for retail sales. Overall, we are encouraged by the results of our efforts, which I’ll come back to. Combatting trade in illicit tobacco and nicotine products remains a top priority, and we dedicate a significant level of resources to support these efforts. We have strong governance and supply chain controls in place, and we take appropriate action where necessary, including limiting and/or terminating sales to certain customers in both the online and traditional trade, and we are continuously improving these control measures. We also closely monitor imports of products which may be illicit or infringing our patents and are committed to act on our own or in conjunction with the authorities to prevent these products being illegally commercialized. Our multicategory approach continues to gain momentum, as we leverage the strength of our leading brands whilst expanding the reach of our smoke-free portfolio. For nicotine pouches, we are focused on responsibly building the category with ZYN in international markets. Increasing category awareness and interest among legal-age nicotine users is driving positive traction in a growing number of geographies. We have increased ZYN’s presence year-on-year to 30 markets, including the Philippines, Mexico, several European markets as well as within duty-free. Despite still-limited distribution in some markets, we see continued strong traction in Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, the UK and duty-free. The category also continues to grow robustly in Scandinavia. E-vapor performance remained dynamic in Q3, and we reached profitability at product contribution level in September on the back of excellent volume momentum and cost of good sold improvements. Europe is at the forefront, as closed pods continue to take share from disposables and we lead the category with our flagship VEEV ONE closed-pod system in several markets, including Italy, Romania and the Czech Republic. We are seeing good repeat-purchase and regular usage within a competitive environment, as we continue to build distribution and brand awareness. Outside Europe, we are investing behind VEEV for future profitability in a number of focus markets. We are underway with the first stage of our IQOS 3 consumer pilots in the U.S., with the launch of our “Be the first” campaign in Austin, Texas. As explained previously, the focus is on adult consumer engagement, building awareness through category and brand education in legal-age smoker communities. We do not anticipate any commercial volumes in 2024. The learnings from these pilots in Austin and other cities will be used to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, where we continue to assume an FDA authorization in H2, 2025. Finally, a brief comment on our Wellness & Healthcare business. As we disclosed in September, we have entered into an agreement to sell Vectura Group and expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. Our ownership of Vectura was important to develop the required skill and scientific expertise to advance our inhaled therapeutics pipeline. Significant progress has been made on this front, however given that Vectura’s scientific engagement and commercial CDMO relationships were being impacted by unwarranted opposition to PMI’s ownership, we believe the overall future of Vectura will be better served under its new ownership. Together with the divestment, we announced the establishment of master service agreements to support the continued development of our inhaled therapeutics proprietary pipeline. Our Wellness & Healthcare strategy continues, and we look forward to updating you on future developments, including launches of consumer wellness products. Moving now to combustibles, where our portfolio delivered a very strong financial performance. Net revenues grew +8.6%, driven by Q3 pricing of +9.7%. This includes pricing taken during the quarter as we continue to focus on value maximization, and was led by markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Germany. As covered earlier this drove a very robust +8.7% increase in gross profit. With better-than-expected pricing of +8.8% on a year-to-date basis, we now forecast full-year pricing of +8 to +9%. Cigarette volumes were resilient, as global industry trends remain benign. As I touched on earlier, this can be largely attributed to markets where smoke-free products are not allowed or are early in their development, as well as the impact of significant industry efforts and geopolitical factors on global illicit trade in a number of markets. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.1 points in Q3 and year-to-date. Both Marlboro and our overall global brands achieved their highest quarterly share since the 2008 spin-off, with a corresponding positive impact on value share. As announced last week, there has been some long-awaited progress towards resolution of the decades-old cigarette-related litigation claims in Canada. Our Canadian affiliate RBH was deconsolidated in 2019 after entering the mediated CCAA process. The mediator’s proposed plan would entail a settlement of around $23.5 billion for the industry, payable from cash and cash equivalents in Canada and future combustible profits in Canada. The reconsolidation of RBH’s financial results after the plan is implemented would be subject to the final terms of the Proposed Plan and U.S. GAAP. We estimate reconsolidation would be incremental to PMI’s cash and cash equivalent, cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS numbers. I direct you to last week’s press release for further details. Moving now to sustainability. We are making continued strong progress towards our product transformation targets, including on access to smoke-free products. Our smoke-free products are now available in 92 markets, placing us on track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. As a reminder, there remain a notable number of markets where smoke-free products are not yet available due to regulatory constraints, which in the case of heated tobacco make up close to one fifth of industry volumes excluding China, as covered at our Investor Day last year. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle-income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free products markets. Our efforts to increase access to smoke-free products are specific to legal-age nicotine users and tackling underage nicotine use is a critical area of focus. We are encouraged by the results of the U.S. 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which reported youth usage of nicotine pouches remains very low at less than 2%, with no statistically significant change year-on-year despite the strong growth of the overall category. Such results can only be achieved through responsible stewardship of the category, and we are committed to continue driving standards in youth access prevention through a multi-stakeholder approach. Addressing our company’s environmental impacts is another key pillar of our sustainability strategy. We are working towards carbon neutrality in our direct operations, including certification of all our manufacturing facilities as carbon neutral. Year-to-date, we certified four additional sites, bringing us to a total of 52%. We have concrete plans for the remainder of our footprint in order to achieve the 100% aspiration by 2025. Additionally, we are progressing with the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard, certifying one additional factory year-to-date to place us at 86% against our goal of 100% by 2025. Combining our ongoing initiatives to address our environmental impacts with robust and rigorous reporting processes, we believe we are well-prepared for upcoming reporting requirements, including the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Okay. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Following this stronger than expected year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year volume, organic sales growth, organic OI growth and bottom-line currency-neutral and U.S. dollar forecasts. First to volumes, where we target record organic growth and increase our outlook to +2% to +3% total shipment progression. Within this, we continue to expect adjusted IMS HTU volume growth of around +13% and shipment volumes of around 140 billion. This forecast continues to assume an impact from the EU characterizing flavor ban of just over 2 billion units and no volumes in Taiwan, where we continue to await regulatory approval. For U.S. ZYN we forecast shipment volumes at the upper end of our prior guidance, in the range of 570 million cans to 580 million cans, reflecting the progress made on capacity expansion as well as continued strong demand. Our outlook also factors in a robust combustibles performance, driven by a resilient total category as previously outlined. Given the combination of stronger volumes with accelerated pricing and continued smoke-free mix, we are increasing our forecast organic net revenue growth to around +9.5%. This includes strong double-digit organic growth in smoke-free net revenue and should result in close to $15 billion in total for the year. With the impact of this improved top-line performance, coupled with IQOS and ZYN operating leverage and further cost efficiencies, we now also raise our forecast adjusted organic OI growth to +14% to +14.5% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free products and combustibles, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +14% to +15%, which also factors in lower-than-anticipated net financing costs, including higher interest income. This translates into a range of $6.45 to $6.51, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.40 for the year at prevailing rates. The $0.06 increase in expected currency headwind largely reflects the same factors as Q3. On a U.S. dollar basis, this forecast represents very robust growth of approximately +7% to +8%. As reflected in this forecast we expect another robust delivery in Q4, despite a more challenging top-line comparison on the mix of shipments between categories. We also target another quarter of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, including a planned increase in commercial investments behind our smoke-free brands. Q4 net financing costs are likely to be sequentially higher, notably given the mark-to-market benefit in Q3 from the volatility in interest rate markets I mentioned earlier. Our expectations for strong operating cash flow of around $11 billion for the year are unchanged, and factoring in the most recent currency moves we now target a 0.3 times to 0.4times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024. This places us well on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered, subject to Board approval, once we are within sight of this goal. In conclusion, we delivered another outstanding quarter reflecting the strong underlying momentum of our business coupled with our proactive steps to support superior growth in dollar term. We are delivering on all key metrics, with best-in-class volume and pricing, in addition to substantial margin expansion and earnings growth on both a reported and dollar basis. We are raising our growth outlook for an exceptional 2024, with growth rates comfortably above our 2024-2026 targets. While the industry dynamics affecting combustible volumes may be specific to 2024, the key drivers of our growth are both structural and sustainable. Legal-age smokers are looking for smoke-free alternatives and we are building strong and profitable premium brands with IQOS, ZYN and VEEV to lead the smoke-free category. As we continue our powerful smoke-free transformation we have significant further opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally. Importantly, we raised our dividend in September for the 17th successive year, in line with our progressive policy. We retain a strong and growing cash generation profile, which enables both reinvestment in long-term growth and the capacity for substantial shareholder returns. Thank you very much for your attention, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi Emmanuel hope you are well?
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on IQOS. I wonder if you could maybe comment a little bit further on the expected volume trajectory for IQOS, shipment volume growth did decelerate to the high single-digit range in Q3 from double-digit history. So I know there were some timing impacts and seasonality. But just could you maybe update us a little bit further on that in the quarter than maybe how that will reverse in Q4. And then also hoping for more color on volume, IQOS volume that is in East Asia, which has also decelerated just the drivers of that and whether you expect shipments to improve in the region in Q4?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie, with pleasure, and you’re giving me the opportunity to maybe be back on the fact that when you look at IQOS, I really urge you to watch at the in-market sales, the adjusted in-market sales, which is the best proxy we can have from consumer off-take. And on that indicator, the good news was the confirmation of the reacceleration that we were expecting and we have been flagging the fact that we’re expecting accelerated momentum on IQOS in H2. And we are indeed seeing that in our Q3 adjusted in-market sales because we are almost at 15%. You were asking the question about East Asia. Actually, Japan delivered again around 14% of adjusted in-market sales. So the market for IQOS remain extremely dynamic despite the fact that we have, of course, already close to 30% market share, but we continue with strong double-digit, and that was a very good news. What happened in Q3 to explain the acceleration is, as I said, continued very strong dynamism in Japan. By the way, South Korea is also doing well. And we – I think we are showing the number in Seoul where we are nicely growing the market share. Then there was a reacceleration in Europe. And I know that we received a lot of questions, okay, how confident can you be in the fact that Europe is going to reaccelerate. We knew that we were going through this transition phase for the flavor ban. And we see the market progressively exiting the disruption of the ban with the reacceleration. Italy was, of course, during the third quarter, the country with the reacceleration and that was nice to see Italy clearly restarting on a very strong foot, the growth on IQOS. And we resumed double-digit growth on adjusted AMS in Europe in Q3. And then you have a number of other markets in the world. And I would say we see momentum here building up, which is very good news for the future. I could mention, of course, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, I think EU here as well. I mean, we see a number of markets where there is – and of course, Egypt, but Egypt has been now for more than a year with growth, where we see real momentum emerging behind IQOS which, of course, we’re just at the beginning. So a lot of potential but that is very encouraging on the fact that we have nice growth relay outside Japan and EU for the future. So that’s really what we’ve seen in Q3. Now you have the question on the shipment. Well, we’ve been flagging the fact that shipment would be – trajectory would be disconnected from the consumer off-take. We had some very strong growth in the first two quarters, which was notably driven by comparison year-on-year. There was, of course, a Red Sea disruption that generated some shipments in the first part of the year. And therefore, today, we have shipments that are a bit lower for the third quarter than the adjusted IMS. And we’re just, if you want, here for the nine months going to a situation where gradually, we are equalizing adjusted IMS and the shipments. So that’s what we are seeing. And in Q4, we’re going to be with more equalization because we’re going to be facing two elements. The first one, regarding the Red Sea disruption, we’re going to have some reversal in Q4, so that will play negatively on the shipment. And we also are facing some high comps last year as we are building inventory to prepare the transition for the flavor ban in Europe. So that’s a high comps in time of shipments last year. But at the end of the day, you should expect adjusted IMS and shipments through a certain period to evolve in parallel way. And as we said, we continue to expect, for Q4, a renewed momentum on a consumer off-take or what we call adjusted market sales, which is really what matters. That’s what is important because that’s what is talking about the health of IQOS.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes. Okay. All of that makes sense and it’s really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a second question on ZYN. So the supply constraints appear to be easing, which is great. So I just wanted to confirm, Emmanuel, that you are on track to fully restore supply levels this quarter? Or is there a chance this bleeds into maybe early next year? And then when this happens, how quickly do you expect ZYN to recapture some of the lost market share? And just curious what role will potential stepped up promos play, I guess, if at all? How are you thinking about that? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. On ZYN, Bonnie, we said somewhere in Q4, we will have the supply to the market, meeting consumer demand, which to clarify again, doesn’t mean that we will have fully been replenishing all level of inventory. Here at that point, we believe for what we can assess of the consumer demand that what we bring to the trade will correspond to what the consumer will take from the trade, will buy from the trade. But then there will certainly be – and I’m not able to tell you what is going to happen during this quarter. But I think we are still in this perspective then, but that’s probably more for 2025, there will be a replenishment of the out-of-stock situation. And we will gradually – but that’s going to happen only gradually probably through 2025, put back the level of inventory to what it should be normally and that certainly will take some months as we continue to increase the capacity. Remember, we said that for the full year 2025, we are targeting an overall capacity of around 900 million can. Of course, that is a capacity that we are going to build gradually. It won’t be there at the beginning of the year. And I would say the replenishment and being back to a fully normal situation is going to happen only gradually through 2025. And of course, when we can be more specific about that, we will be more specific with the topic. So that’s for supply. When it comes to regaining share, so what we’ve seen is that, in fact, when the availability of ZYN went down, we’ve seen the category slowing down because, obviously, it seems that a number of buyer of ZYN are not intending to buy another brand. And therefore, when they don’t find their ZYN, they are maybe producing or consuming something else. But that probably has been slowing down a bit the category. We will see how we gradually recover. We’ve seen in the second part of the Q3, some improvement sequentially on our market share, which is good news. We believe that we have some positive outlook as we regain availability for the product, but it’s difficult to be more specific than that at that stage.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, thank you. I will pass it on.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.
Gaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.
Gaurav Jain: A couple of questions from me. So just looking at the cigarette markets internationally, your pricing guidance, you have increased 8% to 9% and yet volumes are positive. The factors that you’re mentioning why volumes are so strong, which is lack of SBD in Brazil and Turkey, lack of smuggling probably from Russia, Belarus, all these countries. They should continue in FY 2025. So shouldn’t then FY 2025 also be a pretty strong year for cigarette volumes and pricing internationally. And within that context, can you also touch on if there are any disruptive excise tax hike happening in the next few months?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Gaurav, for your question. So I don’t want to enter now into commenting 2025. And of course, in due course, we’ll share with you on the outlook for the year. I think what we are seeing in 2024 is well-identified. We talk about a number of markets where smoke-free products are not allowed. Sometimes you have increasing the prevalence, sometimes you have demographics that are playing positively for the consumption of cigarettes. I think India is a clear market when it comes to demographic, for instance. And it’s difficult to say how long all that is going to play and what’s going to be the continuation of this trajectory. I think we need to be a bit cautious on the outlook, but it’s true that I cannot say that everything will finish on the 31st of December 2024. So we don’t know what’s going to be the trajectory in 2025. What is certainly good is to see that we are able to actually grow volume, grow share of segment and, at the same time, increase price in a very dynamic manner, which is a tribute to the strength of our brand, and it’s true that the 9.7% in Q3 was a remarkable price increase. Don’t take that for Q4 as a guidance, but that was very good in Q3. And that shows that in this category, where I think we’ve been clear on our objective, which is really to maximize the performance on combustible in order to accompany and help the fastest transition to smoke-free. I think this strategy on combustible is working and delivering. And remember, we also said that in 2025, we expect a number of positive evolution for combustible cigarettes when it comes to cost of goods, where we’ll have a lower level of headwinds. So there will be continuation of price increase in the future without a doubt. Nevertheless, don’t take the 8% to 9% as the guidance for the future. We always said that we were more mid-single digits on the medium term. And we should see less headwind on cost of goods, which is probably good for the combustible cigarette profitability. On excise tax, at that stage, there is nothing really material I can report, I would say, traditional discussion, but we’re still a bit early. You know that many, many decisions are made in November, if not in December, so probably we’ll know more at the end of the year. But so far, I would say nothing specific or unusual to flag.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my second question is on your e-cigarette comments. So what you told us is that you have shipped 1.2 billion sticks year-to-date. And if I understand correctly, you are using the conversion factor is 1 ml is 10 sticks. And if I assume 1 pod is 0.7 ml then you’re shipping 160 million pods. So that would suggest that your e-cigarette revenue run rate is $300 million to $400 million, at which your contribution basis breakeven. So am I ballpark correct and all these numbers are done?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, I can certainly confirm that 1 milliliter equates to 10 sticks, 10 cigarettes. That’s the equivalent. And I would say that ballpark, I’m not going to confirm exactly, but you are not million miles away from the reality on volumes. On revenue, I won’t comment.
Gaurav Jain: Sure, thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.
Faham Baig: Hi, Emmanuel. Hi, James. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple from me, please. I want to start with vapor, particularly because one of your peers highlighted that in Europe vapor is seeing greater success in sort of fully converting smokers than heated tobacco. I know I’ve asked this before, but I wanted to get your latest thoughts on this topic as well as whether you’re seeing an acceleration in vapor adoption as you sort of roll out VEEV in several markets. And the second question goes back to nicotine pouches in the U.S. I noted in your prepared remarks, you’ve also seen some illicit products coming into the market. Some of that may be infringing your patents. Could you just maybe expand on what measures you are currently taking or expect to take? And how do you think this will differ from the current environment we see in vapor in the U.S., please?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Faham. With pleasure. So on greater success from vaping in convincing smoker, we don’t see any of that. The experience is very different. It’s quite obvious that versus heat-not-burn, heating a liquid, which has no tobacco is delivering a very, very different experiences. And I think all markets are pointing to the fact that there is clearly a much, much higher and much better conversion from smokers to heat-not-burn into vaping. And I think the success of IQOS is brightly illustrating that, I have to say, I’m not coming back on the performance on IQOS. I don’t think we are really seeing an acceleration in the adoption of vaping. The vaping market, the vaping category is impacted today by many, many regulation evolution or potential evolution. We know that one of the problems of the vaping category is that you have a responsible player going for fancy flavor, unacceptable marketing behavior that can generate underage consumption that can be creating some disruption. We know that notably the disposable category has been generating some of that. But if you look at the – what we can say of the legal age nicotine user, I don’t think that we can report any acceleration that would be meaningful from vaping. Regarding the nicotine part in the U.S., and your question on what we do, can you first allow me a general comment? I think that PMI is at the forefront, at the very forefront when it comes to fighting illicit trade. And that is true for the U.S., that is true everywhere in the world. We commit huge resources, I mean, investments in fighting illicit trade, working with authorities, regulators in many countries to do that. And for us, it’s a very, very important battle, a very important fight. So, the U.S. make no exception. And yes, when we are aware of illicit, when we are aware of product infringing, potentially our patent, we are acting. I think that in my remarks, I signaled some of the things that we do. When we identified the sources that are potentially outside the U.S. we could go to even terminating sales to these sources. I said it. We are working with distributors. It can be informing, creating the awareness for illicit product writing to distributor. It can be sending cease and desist letter to distributor retail where we see an issue. And we do that on our own or working with the regulator, as I said, in the U.S. like everywhere in the world. So you can be sure that we take that extremely seriously.
Faham Baig: Thanks, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Hi Emmanuel, thank you so for receiving me.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, great.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Just two quick ones from me. First, it does look like you modestly sort of took down the top end of your potential deleveraging for this year by a little bit if you could address sort of what drove that? And then secondly, you do have a fairly sizable amount of maturities over the course of 2025. Any thoughts on pulling some of that refinancing forward into the remainder of this year, just given where markets are opportunistically? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, taking these two questions with pleasure. So, on the slightly and very modestly narrowing the guidance for deleveraging, it’s because of the euro strength at the end of September that was – because as you know, we have a significant part of the debt in euro and therefore, when the euro is going up versus the dollar, that can have a kind of one-off element because we always have this discrepancy between an EBIT that is calculated on an average rate for the year when the debt is going to be calculated on the spot on the 31 of December. So we’ll see where we land. But the trajectory is clear. And you may have seen that at the end of the third quarter, we have generated cash flow of $8.2 billion, and that is simply $2.3 billion above the cash flow generation at the end of Q3 2023. So, we are highly generating cash, of course, on the back of a very strong momentum in the business, but that’s good news. Yes, I mean, I am certainly not going to discard the possibility for us to be active on the refinancing market in the coming months. I am not going to elaborate now on that, and we have a number of options that are open to us. But you can be sure that we are already working on how to put in place the best refinancing again in the coming months for PMI.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.
Gaurav Jain: Guys, just a follow-up on the Canadian litigation settlement. Would these payments be tax-deductible? And when do you think something final will happen in this long run in sort of COVID case?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav. On the Canada litigation, so you have what we can say at that stage in our press release that we have issued last week. It’s too preliminary. And as I said, I am not able to tell you whether it’s going to be tax-deductible. Of course, as soon as we know we will let you know. But for the time being, I am not able to say. And as you may have seen in our release, where we shared what we can share at that stage, there are still a number of elements in this proposed solution put on the table by the mediators to be finalized. And of course, once we have the final terms, we will come back to you with this answer, of course, but also all the question on what’s going to be the impact for PMI of a final settlement.
Gaurav Jain: Thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you for joining us today. Please reach out to the Investor Relations team if you have any follow-up questions. I am wishing you a good rest of the week and earnings season.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Philip Morris International Inc. 2024 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communication. Please go ahead.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 second quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated July 23, 2024, and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered another outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024. Our categories were strong across the board to deliver a record H1 on organic top-line growth and on organic OI growth, excluding the pandemic recovery year of 2021. The strong underlying momentum of IQOS continued in Q2, with shipment and adjusted IMS volume growth above or in line with our expectations. This reflects another quarter of strong progress in Japan and robust fundamentals in Europe, despite the volatility of the characterizing flavor ban. With pricing, manufacturing efficiencies and scale benefits, the expanding profit contribution of IQOS is driving excellent growth for PMI. ZYN continued its impressive growth trajectory, with Q2 U.S. volumes growing by over +50% despite recent supply tensions and increased pricing. In addition to IQOS and U.S. ZYN, I am pleased to report building multicategory momentum. While still early days, VEEV has already become the closed pod leader in 5 European markets and is firmly on the path to profitability, while international nicotine pouch volumes grew over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. growth rates. This progress of smoke-free product is reflected in a rapidly growing consumer base, with around 36.5 million estimated adult users as of June 30, and our products now available across 90 markets worldwide. Our combustible business also overdelivered, with a return to gross margin expansion ahead of plan in Q2 after two years of significant inflationary headwinds. This was driven by stable H1 volumes and category share despite robust pricing, in addition to cost efficiencies. This broad-based delivery translated into double-digit organic OI growth, with significant margin expansion. As we have outlined previously, delivering robust growth in dollar terms is a key priority and we are taking pro-active steps on pricing and cost efficiencies to mitigate currency headwinds. This is clearly evident in our H1 adjusted diluted EPS delivery of mid-single digit growth despite a currency headwind of over 12%, as essentially all of the expected full-year impact fell in the first half. Following this exceptional first half performance, we are increasing our 2024 full year forecasts on all organic dimensions, and for adjusted diluted EPS on both a currency neutral and US dollar basis. This reflects our strong H2 outlook with accelerating adjusted IMS growth for IQOS, sequentially higher ZYN volumes and a stepped-up rate of USD EPS growth, at prevailing exchange rates. Looking at our headline financials, strong total shipment volume growth of plus 2.8% drove Q2 organic net revenue growth of plus 9.6%, or plus 5.6% in dollar terms. Robust top-line growth, positive smoke-free margin mix and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.59. This represents plus 10.6% growth excluding a larger-than-expected unfavorable currency variance of $0.18, which includes a small transactional impact from exchange rate volatility at quarter end. This better-than-expected ex-currency performance reflects the improving profitability of IQOS, ZYN and combustibles, which I will come back to. Looking at the first half overall, our volumes grew by plus 3.2%, and organic net revenues by plus 10.2%, our highest growth since the 2008 spin. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove operating income growth of plus 17% with margin expansion of plus 230 basis points organically, and plus 7.1% growth in dollar terms. We expect continued robust OI growth on both a reported and an organic basis in the second half. H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew by an impressive plus 16.8% in constant currency and by plus 4.0% in dollar terms. The $0.38 unfavorable H1 currency variance includes $0.08 of non-recurring transactional impacts from Egypt and Russia. Focusing now on volume. Total shipment growth in both the quarter and H1 overall reflect smoke-free share gains in a resilient international industry, which grew by more than 1% in both periods, even excluding oral and e-vapor. Q2 HTU shipments of 35.5 billion units exceeded our prior outlook, notably driven by continued strong performance in Japan, robust underlying growth in Europe and promising growth in newer markets, such as Indonesia. In addition to underlying momentum, Q2 saw an incremental phasing impact of around 0.5 billion unit, primarily related to Red Sea disruption. Q2 HTU adjusted IMS volume grew by plus 10.2%, in line with our expectation. This includes the impact of the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, most notably in Italy this quarter. Total smoke-free adjusted in market sales volume grew plus 11.2% in Q2 and plus 13.1% in H1. This includes our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with Q2 pouch unit volumes up by plus 20%. U.S. ZYN shipment grew by plus 50% to 135.1 million cans. This does not include the promising result of our e-vapor business where volume grew strongly to the equivalent of 0.7 billion units on a year-to-date basis. Cigarette shipments grew by plus 0.4% with notable positive contribution from Turkey and North Africa. This reflects a stable category share, excluding market mix, despite step-up pricing. With such a positive H1 volume performance, we are raising our full year forecast for total cigarette HTU and oral unit volumes to plus 1% to plus 2%, which would mark our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. The power of our multicategory smoke-free transformation and recovery in combustible are clearly illustrated on this slide, as both areas contributed strongly to double-digits organic OI growth of plus 12.5% for the Group in Q2. Smoke-free continued its excellent momentum with plus 18% organic growth in net revenue and plus 22% in gross profit, driving plus 220 basis points organic gross margin expansion. This reflects the strong performance of ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities and an increasing all by smaller contribution from VEEV. Expanding smoke-free gross margin continued to widen the gap versus combustible gross margin, enhancing the very positive mix effect of our transformation. However, combustible gross margin expansion is also a key objective. After seven quarters of contraction, we are very pleased to report plus 50 basis point expansion and gross profit growth of plus 5.5% on an organic basis, providing a meaningful contribution to total PMI profitability. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong pricing in addition to ongoing efficiencies and reduced headwinds on our COGS, notwithstanding continued tobacco leaf inflation. We also expect convertible gross margin expansion in H2. Combined with a very strong first quarter, the year-to-date picture is even more compelling with double-digit organic net revenue, gross profit and OI growth. This is driven by the same dynamic as Q2 with an impressive plus 390 basis point gross margin expansion and plus 29% gross profit growth for our smoke-free business. Our H1 revenue performance again demonstrates the powerful drivers of our financial model with an unparalleled combination of positive volumes, robust pricing and the very favorable category mix of our smoke-free product. As mentioned, volume grew by plus 3.2%. Pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth, including plus 8.3% pricing on combustible and around plus 2% on smoke-free. Smoke-free category mix added plus 2.5 points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and ZYN. While it’s still small, VEEV also contributed positively to the overall mix. I also note that oral smoke-free product added plus 2 points to organic net revenue progression, underlying the continued accretion from the Swedish Match acquisition. As in recent quarters, geographic mix was negative. This is primarily due to combustible where volumes increasingly skew to lower margin markets, where smoke-free alternatives are small or not available, with higher margin markets over-indexed to cannibalization. We expect this dynamic to be less impactful in 2024 than last year. Now let's focus on the mechanics behind our H1 margin delivery. Gross margin increased organically by 140 basis points and by 80 basis points in dollar terms. This was driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity saving across the value chain. As expected, SG&A cost growth stepped-up in Q2, increasing 9.8% organically after a very modest increment in Q1 due to planned phasing of commercial spend. The resulting 5.8% organic increase in H1 was below the rate of top-line growth, driving plus 1 percentage point of margin expansion with our successful back-office cost program able to mitigate some of the investment step up. With a range of important commercial activities in Q3, we expect SG&A to remain elevated but continue to target an organic increase below the rate of net revenue growth for the year. I’m pleased to report we delivered over $300 million in H1 growth cost efficiencies across both COGS and SG&A, as we pro-actively drive bottom-line growth. We expect an acceleration in H2 savings, notably from manufacturing, as we progress towards our $2 billion target for '24, '26 period. The combination of these factors drove a plus 230 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margin. Despite a significant H1-skewed currency headwind, adjusted OI margin were stable on a dollar basis. Moving to our smoke-free business. We estimate there were 36.5 million adult users of PMI smoke-free product as of June 30th, reflecting an addition of 3.2 million during H1. This includes an estimated 30.8 million IQOS users, 5.2 million oral users and 0.8 million VEEV users. The increase in both total and IQOS users was broad-based with notable progress in Japan, Europe and newer growth markets, such as Indonesia, in addition to ZYN’s strong traction with legal-age nicotine user in the U.S. Our smoke-free products are now present in 90 markets following recent launches of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, where fundamental dynamics are developing very well including the user growth I just mentioned. First, we see robust recoveries in markets, where the characterizing flavor ban has passed the initial adjustment phase. Second, there is continued excellent growth in markets where IQOS is already well-established such as Portugal, Hungary and Greece. Last, new growth leader markets are emerging with accelerating momentum in Germany, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania in addition to recovery in Poland, following the launch of DELIA. Our Q2 HTU share increased by 0.8 points year-on-year despite the impact of the flavor ban, due to the usual seasonal factors and the resilient combustible market, Q2 share was sequentially below Q1. HTU adjusted IMS volume demonstrated robust growth, growing by 0.8 billion units sequentially to reach 12.9 billion on a four quarter moving average. As expected, adjusted in market sales growth of plus 6.8% was lower than in Q1 due to higher comparison and the initial impact of the characterizing flavor ban, notably in Italy. Growth excluding Italy was close to 10%. The impact of the ban is progressing in line with our prior estimate in the majority of markets, though the implementation in Italy during Q2 was slightly more pronounced than anticipated. This was primarily driven by earlier sell-through of affected SKUs and concurrent pricing. It is important to note, this is a transitory dynamic and I'm pleased to report a recovery in markets such as Greece, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania where the ban was implemented previously following an initial period of consumer adjustment. Indeed, despite an uncertain outlook in Ukraine, we anticipate an acceleration in Europe adjusted IMS growth in the second half. This is supported by the planned step-up in commercial activity behind IQOS, including the introduction of DELIA and LEVIA HTUs to an increasing number of markets. Another illustration of our continued progress in Europe is in our key city offtake share. Strong gains in city with already high IQOS adoption such as Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon and Sofia; and historically slower growth markets such as Madrid, London and Amsterdam, highlight the enduring growth potential in the region. Japan demonstrated impressive IQOS growth in the quarter, with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 12.5%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit progression. Adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially, reaching 10.5 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by 3.1 points year-on-year to 29.4% with national offtake share exceeding the impressive milestone of 30% in June. We also maintained offtake share of over 35% in Tokyo despite seasonal factors, where the overall category continued to track at over 50% of total offtake and grow sequentially, demonstrating the continued potential in this important market. Our continuous innovation is a key driver of this growth, with Q2 seeing a strong step-up in user acquisition following the launch of ILUMA i, and further innovative TEREA variants such as capsule consumables. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across a broad range of geographies, including low and middle income market as highlighted by key city offtake shares. Accelerating growth in Indonesia, the world's largest cigarette market by volume excluding China, leads the way with increasing geographic reach and Clove HTU innovation. Markets across North Africa and the Middle East are also a growing weight and source of growth. We show Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia here in addition to Egypt where performance in Cairo remains robust despite recent pricing and a recovery in the combustible market. I am also pleased to report very good progress in the UAE and Jordan. Following the recent launch of ILUMA, growth in Mexico City is very promising and the East Asian market of South Korea and Malaysia continue to perform well. Also worth highlighting is the successful contribution of Duty Free, where we are increasingly leveraging our multi-category portfolio to expand share in a growing market as travel recovers in Asia. Our fundamental HTU growth outlook for the year has not changed. H1 adjusted IMS growth of plus 11.4% reflects the strong dynamic I described across Japan, Europe, and global markets, partly offset by the transitory impact of the EU flavor ban. Indeed, growth excluding Europe accelerated compared to the last year and we expect this to continue. However, we see an incremental headwind of around 2 billion units to our full year adjusted IMS forecasts, the majority of which is driven by the ongoing delay in approval for commercialization in Taiwan, which was previously expected around the midpoint of the year. We also factor in an impact of a few hundred million units for a slower recovery from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, principally in Italy. I would note that our revised full year forecast for adjusted IMS growth of around 13% represents the same absolute volume increase as 2023 despite the EU headwind. We accordingly forecast full year HTU shipment volume of around 140 billion units with shipment as usual expected to be a few billion units higher than adjusted IMS given continued offtake and user growth. Importantly, we expect a very strong H2 delivery in adjusted IMS on both sequential and year-on-year basis to between plus 14% and plus 15% growth. This is supported by a notable step-up in commercial activity, continued momentum in Japan and increasingly dynamic global markets. These include the markets I just mentioned and the ongoing acceleration in Duty Free. For Europe, the broadening of growth acceleration in Germany, Spain, the UK, & Romania adds to the ongoing momentum in geographies such as Portugal and Greece. H2 should also see several markets start to rebound from initial flavor ban impact, including a gradual recovery in Italy. Turning now to ZYN, where very good U.S. progress continued in Q2 with close to plus 70% growth in 12-months rolling shipments. As we shared earlier in the year, strong demand dynamics have created short-term supply chain constraints, which has impacted volume growth. As shown on this slide, this has resulted in a temporary slowdown of the category. ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity remained strong, with ZYN maintaining very robust category volume and value share, despite these availability challenges and the recent price increase. We also remain highly-focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We are making good progress on expanding production and continue to expect a gradual improvement through Q3, with sequentially higher volume and for production volumes to meet expected consumer demand during the course of Q4. We expect the ongoing expansion of the existing facility in Kentucky to provide around 900 million cans of capacity for 2025. We also recently announced a planned investment in a new plant in Colorado, which is due to begin preliminary operation by the end of next year. Together, these plans support our U.S. growth ambitions for the coming years. For 2024, we are now forecasting a U.S. shipment range of 560 million to 580 million cans, to reflect strongly increasing demand from adult nicotine user and the progress made on increasing our production capacity. I will now take a moment to update you on the international expansion of our smoke-free business. Our multicategory approach is gaining momentum, as we unlock new horizon of growth with increasing commercialization of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV across markets. Our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. In Europe, closed pods are accelerating within the dynamic e-vapor category. We are seeing strong traction of our VEEV ONE product, achieving a number one closed pod position in five markets within the first year of launch including Italy, the Czech Republic and Romania. We continue to observe good repeat purchase and conversion rate, which is often a challenge for this category. We continue to expect good production and conversion rate which is often challenge for this category. We expect continued volume momentum in H2, supported by ongoing geographic expansion and to reach profitability in Q3. For ZYN, there is a large opportunity outside of the U.S., which we are working to capture. Our international nicotine pot volume, including the Nordics, grew by over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. ZYN growth. We see promising results in a number of markets, including Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan and the important UK market where we have seen strong traction with only limited distribution so far. Our expansion of the IQOS portfolio remains active as we innovate to broaden and enhance our offer for both existing user and switching other smokers. Further market launches are planned in H2 including DELIA and LEVIA HTUs and the new ILUMA i device range which is currently only available in Japan. We also continue with our preparation for IQOS ILUMA in the U. S. And we are underway with consumer engagement for our first city pilot in Austin, Texas with the IQOS 3 system, which we expect to start in Q4. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and focused on direct activation of select legal edge smokers in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose is to fine tune our approach and readiness in anticipation of the at scale launch of ILUMA. We continue to assume an authorization from the FDA in the second half of 2025. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth and a very positive profit contribution as I covered earlier. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong Q2 pricing of plus 8.7% including our proactive action to maximize growth. It is worth noting the large majority of our pricing is derived from regular pricing action unrelated to significant currency devaluation. Factoring the strong H1 and favorable outlook, we now forecast an increased fully combustible price variance of plus 7% to plus 8%. Our cigarette category share was stable in H1 and down 0.2 in Q2, or stable excluding market mix impact. Lower share in Egypt and Indonesia was offset by positive contribution from Turkey, India and the Europe region, again despite strong pricing. Our global brand grew category share in the quarter with Marlboro gaining plus 0.3 points to 10.1%. On a global basis, our leadership in combustible is a critical enabler to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we target a stable category share over time. As mentioned previously, we evaluate our strategy on a market-by-market basis and have the flexibility to adapt our approach where smoke-free products have already reached critical mass. Taking a more holistic view on the business. Our transformation and smoke-free journey are backed by a strategy that seeks to embed sustainability in all that we do. We are making strong progress towards our product transformation targets. Our smoke-free products are now available in 90 markets, placing us on-track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free product market. The rapid growth of our estimated SFP user base, which now stands at around 36.5 million adult users, as previously described, is further testament to this progress. With regard to our operation, decarbonization is an important focus area and we are very pleased to have been awarded the top spot on the Forbes’ 2024 Net Zero Leaders list, which highlights the 100 U.S. public companies best positioned to reduce their greenhouse gas emission. It also follows the announcement earlier this year of CDP awarding us a triple-A rating for our disclosure and efforts on climate change, forest and water security. This recognition reflects our continued focus on our sustainability performance and robust reporting, as we continue to work towards a smoke-free future. This bring me to our outlook for 2024. Following an excellent H1 performance and strong business momentum, as we start the second half, we are raising our full year currency neutral and U.S. dollar growth forecast. This is supported by accelerated total volume growth and pricing and reflects the very strong outlook for ZYN, despite short-term supply constraint and the increasing profitability of IQOS due to operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and pricing. We continue to target close to $15 billion in smoke-free net revenue for the year. Taking these factors into account and robust combustible performance, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to a range of plus 7.5% to plus 9%. In addition to strong top-line growth, the positive smoke-free mix effect, combustible recovery and further cost efficiency enable healthy margin expansion. We are accordingly raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 11% to plus 13% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free product and combustible, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Consequently, and also factoring a lower forecast net financing cost, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 11% to plus 13%. This translates into a range of $6.33 to $6.45 including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.34 for the year at prevailing rates. The increased currency headwind versus prior guidance is primarily due to the Q2 impact already described. As shown by the increase in our forecast U.S. EPS growth to plus 5% to plus 7%, the underlying strength of our business and proactive mitigating actions have allowed us to more-than-compensate for this, and we expect to deliver on our objective of strong growth in dollar terms. Focusing on the second half in more detail. We expect another strong performance driven by excellent IQOS adjusted IMS growth, the progressive improvement in ZYN volume and continued positive impact from our actions to drive bottom-line growth. For Q3, we forecast a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.77 to $1.82 despite a significant step-up in commercial spending and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 at prevailing rates. This is in contrast to a forecast currency tailwind of $0.04 for H2 overall, which enables us to target accelerated U. S. dollar adjusted diluted EPS growth. We include a table of estimated currency impact by quarter in the appendix. This Q3 forecast notably reflects another quarter of dynamic growth with HTU shipment of 34 billion to 35 billion units and an acceleration in HTU adjusted IMS growth. Given expectation for a strong full year profit delivery, we are forecasting operating cash flow of around $11 billion which is at the upper end of our previous forecast range at prevailing exchange rate and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We expect this improvement to more than offset an increase in capital expenditure to around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we further accelerate ZYN capacity expansion. Last, we continue to target 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. As of June 30, we have already improved a ratio of 3x on a 12-month trailing basis as compared to 3.2x at the end of 2023. This represents good progress towards our target of around 2x by the end of 2026. We intend to reconsider share repurchase subject to board approval once we are within sight of this goal. I will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. The powerful combination of strong underlying business momentum and our own proactive steps enable us to generate best-in-class growth across key metrics. Our strategy is delivering on volumes, pricing, cash flow and dollar earnings despite ongoing currency headwinds. The success of our smoke free transformation is reflected in our remarkable first half performance with excellent underlying IQOS and ZYN growth, very robust pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies. This puts us firmly on track for an exceptional 2024 with accelerated top line growth and margin expansion. Our momentum is broadening across the business with exciting multi-category growth opportunity to further support the delivery of our 2024-2026 growth targets. We remain highly focused on delivering performance in dollar. And as shown in H1, we are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds. Finally, we are steadfastly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Our growth outlook and strong cash flow generation underpins our capital allocation priorities to reinvest behind our rapidly transforming business alongside our progressive dividend policy. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: So 2 questions from me. One is just on the cigarette pricing algorithm that you have. So if I look at your market share gains, clearly quite impressive, even excluding modern oral. And if I add that, then you are gaining almost 80 basis points share right now per annum. So isn't that level of market share gain excessive and suggest that you are not monetizing your cigarette business as much as we should be? And that would mean that increased the pricing growth in cigarettes from 7% to 8% to, let's say, to 10%? And then I have a follow-up.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav, for the question. Look, let's be clear. We can always challenge us on whether we could do even better in terms of price increase. The fact is that we are doing better than what we thought initially. We have this very strong performance, 8.7% price increase for combustible for H1. I think we all know that the inflationary environment is no longer what it was last year. So obviously, this is a very strong performance. Please bear in mind, I said it in my preliminary remarks, but around 3/4 of that is not coming from inflation in -- sorry, from a price increase in a country with very high inflation. And this 8.7% in Q2 is largely driven by the markets where we are really driving price on a kind of opportunistic basis, building on the strength of our portfolio and making sure that we are ever optimizing the potential for price increase. So you can be absolutely sure that this is a very granular work, market by market each time as we signal, we take into account what is our position on smoke-free product on this market, what is the impact of increasing price. And I think we can demonstrate that we have a very successful approach on this price increase. So I would tend to believe that we are optimizing this price increase potential in the current environment.
Gaurav Jain: You mentioned that ZYN capacity will increase to 900 million cans next year. So does it mean that by Q4 of this year, it will be 225 million cans per quarter?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, I'm confirming that we have the objective to be around 900 million can of production capacity for next year, that's for the full year 2025. We are gradually improving our capacity, and there is a number of steps that we are taking. I'm not going to elaborate on them, but there are several levers that we are pulling to increase this capacity. So I would say every quarter versus the previous one, we are improving the capacity. I'm not going to give a prediction on where we're going to be at the end of the year. We believe, given what we see from the potential consumer demand today, that in terms of what we produce at a certain point in Q4 versus what the consumer offtake could be without restriction, we're going to be good. And then we'll see exactly how we finish in terms of capacity at the end of the year. But I think what is more relevant and, frankly, more important is you have the picture of this 560 million to 580 million can. That is our goal for 2024. You know that we have this capacity for 900 million cans for next year. Let's be clear, it's not a guidance on the volume for next year. We're just here giving the capacity on which we are working. And I think with that, you have what is important.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: I had a question on your guidance. You raised your top and bottom line growth expectations, but you lowered your HTU shipment volume outlook slightly. And you attributed this to slightly greater-than-expected impact from the EU flavor ban. And you did touch on this, but maybe hoping for a little more color on that and any other impact on HTU volume that you're expecting in the back half? Are you expecting IQOS growth to remain robust in Japan in the second half, for instance? And then finally, you mentioned your HTU guide assumes no volumes in Taiwan. So maybe an update there in terms of timing?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Thank you for maybe giving me the opportunity to further clarify the dynamic and the good dynamics that we are seeing behind IQOS. So we are indeed revising, first of all, our objective of adjusted in-market sales by around 2 billion. I've been clarifying that the majority of that is coming from Taiwan, okay? So in fact, it's really the fact that we were expecting Taiwan to start more than 6 months this year. And it's -- at the end of the day, today, we are making here the assumption that at the end of the day, it's going to be zero volume in Taiwan. We thought it was a reasonable assumption. Remember the law allowing for heated tobacco product was passed now 15 months ago. So we thought that during this period of time, there was this capacity to get the approval from the regulator. And there is an administrative process, asking question, you have Q&A. It's just taking much more time than what we thought. But first and foremost, the reason for this 2 billion revision on adjusted IMS is Taiwan. Then in addition to that, we have this a few hundred million that is coming from Europe. So that's really all you should understand, the 2 billion. And because of Taiwan, we are indeed saying when we were expecting to be above 140 billion in terms of shipments. We are now expecting to be around 140 billion. Again, that's the way you should understand the revision on the guidance. But let me take 2 minutes to explain the dynamic because I want to make sure that things are very clear. What we've been seeing in H1 is, in fact, an acceleration of the IQOS business outside Europe. So if you look at the adjusted in-market sales outside Europe, and we talk about 60% of the business, the adjusted IMS were growing around 14% versus around 13% last year. So we've been growing faster in percentage. So you can imagine in terms of volume, of course, that means a significant acceleration. And indeed, what is beyond this very nice dynamism is Japan. You have other developed markets such as South Korea, but we've been seeing a number of new contributor to this growth. We mentioned Indonesia. We mentioned a number of markets in Middle East. Mexico is also accelerating, and we enjoy also a nice performance in duty-free. So that's really what we are seeing outside Europe. Then Europe, absolutely as expected. I mean, we are going through what is a significant transition. We are moving away from flavor. It's still growing. Outside Italy, we have adjusted in-market sales growing close to double-digits. So very strong in dynamism despite the fact that many of the country are going through this transition. And as we flagged, it is true that it's really great to see, at the same time, our champion market, like we mentioned in Portugal, Hungary that continue to do very well. We have new markets that are really confirming their status of growth driver for the future. We mentioned Germany, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria. So it's important to have this new growth provider, if you want. And then a number of markets exiting, I would say, as expected, the turmoil or the disruption, I would say, of a few weeks that is coming with -- with the implementation of the flavor ban. And here, we can mention Greece, we can mention Romania, we can mention Bulgaria, we can mention Czech Republic. So a number of markets where things are happening absolutely as expected. And then you have Italy, where we've been, in fact, not evaluating well the level of flavored products available with distributor and with retail, and there was less than what we thought. And therefore, the consumer offtake has been impacted quicker than what we were anticipating by the absence of a flavor product after the implementation of the flavor ban, and that has had some impact on the growth. And at the same time, no doubt that the 2 accumulating have had some impact. We've been increasing price by $0.30 on our consumables. And that has not been followed only very marginally by the competition with some impact on our market share as it happens when we increase price in a meaningful manner, widening the gap with competition and the competition not following. So that is really the picture. And now when we are looking at the second half, so we expect outside Europe situation to continue to do well. I'm not going to name again all these very great country where we are performing extremely well. We have the launch of LEVIA and DELIA in a number of countries. And we expect Europe to accelerate as we are transitioning out of this phase of adjustment to the flavor ban. And Italy will be part of the market where we expect improvement. But I would say, globally, we expect more acceleration on all the markets that have been going through the flavor ban. So I think this is really the complete picture, Bonnie. I hope it is helpful in answering your question.
Bonnie Herzog: That was definitely very helpful. I appreciate you going through all of that. And then if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on ILUMA i in Japan. I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on this device, which I believe is only available in Japan right now. And curious to hear how big of a lift it's been or essentially how incremental and really what you're seeing or hearing from consumers in terms of acceptance of the new device, impact on your growth, margins, et cetera? And then finally, your plans for further rollout of this device.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So you're right. ILUMA i, so the latest generation of IQOS ILUMA. So it does not change the fundamental technology, but the -- the device is offering a number of additional functionalities, is, for the time being, only present in Japan. There was the launch in a few other countries that is planned for H2. And it's always difficult to say what this new product is triggering, but we've been seeing clearly a new acquisition of IQOS user. We've been seeing consumer sentiment going up with some very good reaction to this product. So I would say we continue to have more ammunition to convert smokers to IQOS, to improve the experience, to improve customer satisfaction that is triggering of course, more loyalty that can have some impact on the average daily consumption, so a number of positive effects. That's what we have seen in Japan. Difficult for me to tell you exactly by how much this has been further accelerating the growth in Japan, but now that was a positive for the market.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Matt Smith of Stifel.
Matt Smith: Could you provide a little more detail on the growth in oral pouches in international markets? You highlighted some early success in several markets. Are you continuing to expand distribution there? Are there any capacity constraints for those international markets outside of the U.S.?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. So as a coincidence, I suppose that it is true that in H1, the growth in nicotine pouch outside the U.S. was very similar to the 1 in the U.S., what chart. It's -- we talk about 10% only of the volume in the U.S. That is included. It's not totally nothing because that is including the Nordics. And what we are clearly seeing is that there is from the nicotine user, some interest and attraction in many countries. And I tend to really put 3 buckets of possible growth for this market. You have, of course, first, the Nordic country that have the knowledge, the understanding the culture of this product and where the nicotine pouch category is dynamic. And here, we want to take our fair share of the growth. Then you have Europe, where the category is not relevant in all markets, but we can already flag a number of countries such as Austria, the U.K., Switzerland, where we believe that there is potential, and we see the growth. And then you have, I would say, global market, international market. We can name Pakistan, we can name South Africa. We could talk about Indonesia and the Philippines, where we see potential for these nicotine pouches. You may have some culture already of overall product. And we see some development of the product. I could add Mexico to the list, by the way, where we are starting nicely the development of ZYN. So we see that this product maybe because of the U.S. influence, I think in the case of some country like the U.K., it's clear. That's a category that could grow in awareness, I would say, interestingly and rapidly, and we want absolutely to make sure that we're going to capture our fair share of this opportunity.
Matt Smith: And just a quick follow-up. Is there any capacity limitation on that international business? Or is that capacity not constrained like what you're seeing in the U.S.?
Emmanuel Babeau: No, there is no capacity issue that I have to report at that stage.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Faham Baig of UBS.
Faham Baig: Hi Emmanuel, thanks for the question. I've got 2 as well. One, the vapor category and 1 on ZYN. I know you're looking to expand with your VEEV product, but how do you see the development of the vapor category, particularly outside of the U.S.? What profile of users is the category attracting? For example, in Europe, I'm just trying to understand whether consumers that use vapor see it as an alternative to heated tobacco? Or are the 2 categories attracting a different profile of consumers, particularly post the flavor ban in Europe?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. And you want to ask a question on ZYN now? Or you want to come back on ZYN after?
Faham Baig: Why don't I come back after --
Emmanuel Babeau: Okay. So on the vaping category, I think what we are seeing is that with what we've always been saying, the vaping category is a legitimate category to be an alternative to people who would otherwise smoke. And therefore, that is a category that is growing, not necessarily faster than burnt, not faster than nicotine pouch for sure. But of course, the basis for nicotine pouch is smaller. And we know that the vaping category is more appealing for people legal age and above that want to start consuming nicotine and it's much more difficult to convert smokers. And that's clearly what IQOS and the heat-not-burn category is doing much better. So yes, the vaping can be appealing for some legal age and above nicotine user. More difficult to convert smokers, very clearly. We haven't seen any meaningful report of people moving to vaping and a change of kind of dynamic in the category following the implementation of the flavor ban in Europe. Of course, we are monitoring that. But as I said, there is nothing that we can obviously report on that trend, which probably could confirm that we talk about people that are probably with different profile, but that's something that we will have to keep monitoring, of course. So we've always been saying that the concern with the vaping category is that if the products are not properly developed and marketed. If there is an unreasonable appeal to flavor, what that can trigger unintended usage, and that is a problem for the category. And we are very happy with our growth because we do that in a very responsible manner, both in terms of development of our product, development of our marketing activity. And we are developing this responsible approach, very much based on our commercial strength and a great product. I think VEEV ONE is a great product, and strong partnership with the trade that is giving this very good start as we mentioned, the number 1 position in five countries for close pods. That's really what I can share with you at that stage.
Faham Baig: Yes, that's helpful. And then secondly, on ZYN in the U.S. Now according to the scanner data, some of which we received today as well, since momentum from a volume perspective is sequentially falling, albeit very, very low single-digits, would you have an estimate of if you did not have the capacity constraint, what volumes could potentially look like? And in the back half, when you are expecting an acceleration in volumes, is that implying that you begin to gain market share? Or is that largely driven by further acceleration in the overall category?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, on ZYN, I think we mentioned the fact that we are clearly with some restrictions. So I'm not sure that what you read in the Nielsen, which corresponds to the availability is going a view on the trend and the consumer demand, we are gradually improving, and we expect to see that in the coming months, the availability. Today, we clarify that we are working with a target of around 900 million can capacity for next year. So we are creating very nice headroom for growth for the coming quarters. And we think it's really important. I'm not going to be able to tell you because, frankly, it's impossible to say what would have been the growth rate without the limitation. Please bear in mind that there were some competitors move in term of pricing last year that triggered an acceleration in our market share, and that the effect is now behind us. So it is also having some impact on the year-on-year comparison. So that's what we can say on ZYN.
Faham Baig: If I could quickly squeeze in 1 more. Is there any update on the review of the ZYN sales post the recent subpoena in the District of Columbia that is ongoing and forced you to close your zyn.com sales and when that might recover?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, I know, there is nothing new. We keep working and fully cooperating, of course, with the Attorney General. And at that stage, it's impossible to say how long the work will take or what will be the conclusion. And there is nothing new today.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: I hope you are well. I just had a couple of questions on the U.S. pouch dynamics. So first -- and I would assume this is due to certain retailers trying to fill the supply gap. I have been seeing some Scandinavian ZYN available in certain stores. So I was wondering how you can get on top of this to make sure that's not happening. And then second, I'm also now seeing over more than oral brands appearing, I assume do not have a PMTA submitted. So how do you see the risk we could see a similar scenario developing in pouches in the U.S. and to what we're seeing in vape with the legal products?
Emmanuel Babeau: So you're alluding to product that would come from non-U.S. market, correct? That's what...
Owen Bennett: In retail, the distributors are buying them online from Scandinavia to try and fill the supply gap. Just wondering how you can get on top of that to make sure that's not happening?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, I don't have any information about that. So I cannot make any comment or report. I think we are doing everywhere we can, our utmost to ensure that the flows are appropriate and not going where they should not be going. And we are working very hard with this objective. And I don't have any data and I cannot react on that. But our position is very clear. We are very strict on doing everything we can to make sure that this parallel flows are not happening. On your question on -- if I understand you well, Owen, could -- do we see the same kind of phenomenon on nicotine pouch than the 1 we are seeing on vaping, which is illicit parallel flow that would be entering the U.S. market?
Owen Bennett: Yes. I'm starting to see brands that I'm assuming do not have the MTS. Just wondering how you see the risk around that?
Emmanuel Babeau: Today, from what we can monitor in the market, we are not having the feeling that there is anything material at that stage. But of course, we are monitoring that very carefully. If it was to become material, I think what we are clearly seeing today is that the authorities take that seriously, and they are starting to have much more action and be much more alert on the topic. So I would expect them to have the same behavior when it comes to nicotine pouches. So to summarize, I don't think we're seeing anything meaningful today to be certainly watched. And if it was to become the case, we would expect the authority to have the same, I would say, proactive behavior that they -- I think they are starting to implement on vaping.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Callum Elliott of Bernstein.
Callum Elliott: Actually a follow-up, quite a similar question to what you just had for a moment, but I want to push you a bit further because we also, like Owen, see pretty widespread evidence now that European moist versions of ZYN that do not have premarket approval as far as I'm aware and weren't in the market as of August 2016 are available for sale on a widespread basis across New York City. But also, the online performance suggests that this has become a pretty widespread issue across the U.S. as a whole. So I guess 2 questions. Can you just confirm for us that those products weren't in the market of August 2016 and that they are being sold in breach of FDA regulations? And then, I guess, secondly, building upon what Owen asked, presuming that you're not selling a list of product directly to U.S. retailers yourselves -- and what can you do? And what are you doing to stop European e-commerce retailers selling this product? Because it strikes me that this presents a pretty meaningful potential risk to your U.S. ZYN business if this illicit product continues entering the U.S. market in this way.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Callum. Look, again, I don't have any data on what you're saying. So it's very difficult for me to report. I think we know whether the product that benefit from the situation and the positioning in 2016 in the market and that, therefore, are legally being commercialized. As you can imagine, I'm going to repeat only what I said. We are doing everything we can to control the flows. I don't have information today saying that you have these flows of product. If we knew, we would certainly tackle that, and we would try to understand where it's coming from. And what I can certainly repeat is that our objective is to do our utmost, everything we can to be compliant with the regulation. And there is nothing else I can say, really.
Callum Elliott: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. I guess, as you think about bringing supply back online in the U.S., also bringing new supply online to meet demand, what gives you this confidence that we're going to see the sort of upward lift in ZYN guidance today? Implies a very significant sort of back half hockey stick in terms of sort of positive inflection in the growth rate. Which, to Faham's earlier question, we see sequential declines in growth now quarter-to-date. So what gives you the confidence that the consumers are switching to on consumers that are switching to rogue, some of the consumer reviews of some of these competitive products are sometimes better than this. So what gives you the confidence that now that consumer awareness for these other brands has grown as a result of your supply chain issues that you're going to immediately win those consumers back when the supply comes online again?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, Callum, this is obviously coming from a mix of consumer demand perception that we have. And we believe that if we can produce them, there is a space to get to 580 million can shipments. That's the first element. And that's what our senses are telling us about, what consumer would be happy to buy if it was available. And at the same time, of course, our measures to increase production capacity, where, as I said, I'm not going to elaborate on the various levers, but we're pulling a number of levers to progressively increase the capacity for ZYN production in the U.S. So that's really the combination of the 2.
Operator: And our last question will be coming from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Emmanuel, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the IQOS ILUMA tests that you're planning for the U.S. It sounds like just a few cities. Will those be sort of diverse geographically across the U.S.? And what are some of the learnings that you're hoping to, I think, unlock? And how could this be different than what we saw initially several years ago with some of the stand-alone stores that were put in place? And then I have a follow-up.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Priya. Well, that's a very broad question, although a very important one, of course. So given where we are, I'm going to make a short answer on that one. First of all, we clarify the fact that we go for a scale launch only once we get the PMTA for ILUMA. And as I said in my preliminary remarks, we are still, today, targeting to get this approval in the second half of 2025. Once we are there, then we have the right product to really go broader in the U.S. And at that stage, we will have been learning with a number of things that we're going to do between Q4 and the moment where we go with ILUMA. And it's -- you're asking, okay, what are you going to do differently? Let's -- let's be clear, we don't believe that IQOS has never been launched in a kind of serious, consistent and profound manner. And we believe that what makes IQOS so popular outside the U.S. is going to resonate with a number of smokers among the around 30 million smokers in the U.S. So we're going to develop what has been working elsewhere. It will be about, of course, going to the smokers explaining what IQOS is about, explaining the experience, why IQOS is a better product than smoking. I think it will be, as always, very important to create the image, the brand territory, but also talk about closely with the smokers, okay, this is a journey to move away from smoking and to go to a better product to IQOS. We will have the same commercial, I would say, a machine that has been successful in so many markets with developing our own retail sales point. We will have a strong partnership with a number of independent and third-party retailers. So we're going to pull all the levers and something that has not been done in the U.S. Because until now, it has been only a very limited launch in a few cities with limited actions. So everything is going to start at that moment for IQOS and there won't be any magic. We're going to use what has been working so well elsewhere, of course, adapting it to the U.S. market.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: That's really helpful. And I guess just a follow-on to that is you talked a lot about the development of IQOS VEEV outside the U.S. Maybe broad strokes, how do you think that product could play out in the U.S.? And at what point would think about filing PMTAs and then broaden the availability of that in the U.S.?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, for the time being, we don't have the plan to file a PMTA on these. We are very much focusing on IQOS. I think that this success is just at the beginning today. It's great to have already five markets where we are number 1 on the closed pods system, but it's just the beginning. We're going to keep learning, developing how we can develop a successful, profitable business on vaping. And then we will see whether in due course, it may make sense to have some thoughts for VEEV in the U.S., but we are not at that stage today.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Just 1 final, I think, housekeeping item. You talked about your interest expense being at the low end of your prior range, $1.3 billion. Does that reflect, I guess, the issuance you've done to date? And should we anticipate that there wouldn't be any incremental interest expense headwinds, i.e., potential scope for any other refinancing or pre-financing that you might consider?
Emmanuel Babeau: No. I think the improvement in the estimated financial cost for the year is reflecting a better situation on, first of all, the level of the debt with the cash flow generation. Second, with how we are financing the group. And that is coming with this -- you said it. I mean, we are in the low end of the initial bracket. And I don't think you should expect some kind of revolution in the way we are financing the company, nothing on the agenda.
Operator: I would now like to hand the call back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.
James Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the PMI Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Philip Morris International 2024 First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 first quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated April 23, 2024, and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. In Q1, we delivered outstanding performance that exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in organic net revenue and operating income, as well as currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share, all supported by robust volume growth. Excellent smoke- free business momentum continues with plus 25% organic growth in net revenues and plus 38% in gross profit, as IQOS operating leverage and ZYN mix contribute positively. IQOS continues to advance rapidly, with growth of 13% in adjusted in market sales volumes and plus 21% in shipments. IQOS ILUMA is a key driver of this progress and is now available in 64 markets, representing nearly 100% of IQOS volumes outside Russia. ZYN also continued its considerable growth in Q1, with U.S. volumes up plus 80%. Importantly, this top-line performance translated into strong operating income growth and margin expansion, both organically and in dollar terms. This was notably driven by accelerating profitability in both our IQOS and ZYN businesses, in addition to improving combustible performance. We faced higher-than-expected currency headwinds in the quarter, primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. We are taking mitigating actions including additional pricing and accelerated cost initiatives, which allowed us to deliver Q1 adjusted diluted EPS above our prior expectation, despite these pressures. While the prior year quarter was favorable for certain growth comparisons, this exceptional start to the year sets the stage for us to deliver significantly better-than- expected 2024 currency-neutral growth, and robust growth in U.S. dollar at prevailing rates. Turning to the headline numbers, very good shipment volume growth of plus 3.6% supported organic top-line growth of plus 11.0%, or plus 8.6% including currency. This reflects continued excellent IQOS and ZYN momentum as well as strong combustible pricing. Operating income grew by plus 22.2% organically versus a softer prior-year quarter, notably driven by gross margin expansion and a deceleration in SG&A growth. As a result, our organic OI margins expanded by plus 3.7 percentage points. In dollar terms, adjusted OI grew by plus 11.3% and adjusted OI margins expanded by 90 basis points. We outperformed our Q1 adjusted EPS outlook due to three main factors. The first is the net revenue and profit impact of better volumes following the industry-leading performance of ZYN, the strong shipment growth of IQOS HTUs including some higher-than-expected timing benefits, and a resilient combustible delivery. Second is the benefit of our pricing actions to mitigate currency headwinds and third is on cost including some timing benefit and a stepped-up focus on manufacturing and back office efficiencies to prioritize growth investments. The majority of the outperformance was driven by underlying business dynamics, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. Indeed, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.50, representing plus 23.2% growth excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.20. This includes $0.09 from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, including a transactional impact of $0.06 primarily related to the balance sheet remeasurement of foreign currency payables. With increased liquidity in the Egyptian pounds, we are now reducing our balance sheet exposure, and this should be complete in the coming weeks. Focusing now on volumes, our Q1 HTU shipments of 33.1 billion units exceeded our outlook, with robust underlying growth across geographies and a higher-than- anticipated timing impact of shipments to Japan. The incremental phasing impact was around 1 billion units and was primarily related to Red Sea disruption. While uncertain, we assume this will normalize in the second half of the year. As mentioned previously, we believe the best indicator of underlying HTU growth is adjusted in market sales, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. Adjusted IMS volume grew nicely by plus 12.5%, including the expected impact from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe. We continue to see strong IQOS momentum, with excellent growth in Japan, robust underlying fundamentals in Europe, and a growing contribution from newer markets such as Indonesia. We continue to target plus 14% to plus 16% adjusted IMS growth for the year, with around plus 10% growth in Q2 followed by an H2 acceleration driven by the timing of commercial programs, ILUMA uptake, newer markets and a less demanding prior year comparison. Total smoke-free volume growth of plus 22% includes the impressive expansion of our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN, with pouch equivalent shipment volumes up by plus 35.8%. U.S. ZYN shipments grew by plus 80% to 132 million cans. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 0.4% in the first quarter, with a notable positive contribution from Turkey as we increased share in a strong overall market. Let me now walk through the drivers of our Q1 net revenues. As I mentioned, volumes grew by a remarkable 3.6%, including oral. Pricing contributed plus 5.5 points of growth primarily from combustibles, as well as pricing of around plus 3% on HTUs. Smoke-free category mix added plus 3.1 percentage points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and, to an even greater extent, ZYN. Oral smoke-free product overall boosted our organic net revenue growth by plus 2.2 points, showcasing its role as a meaningful accelerator. To report a positive contribution from our VEEV e-vapor business which, while still small in the context of the group, delivered good revenue growth. As in 2023, there was a negative geographic mix within our combustible business as lower margin markets, often without smoke-free products, grew faster; and smoke-free products accelerated cigarette declines elsewhere. The positive category mix impact of smoke-free products, overall volume growth, and pricing are the three enduring engines of our transformation and growth. Focusing now on the key dynamics of our Q1 profit delivery, smoke-free gross profit grew by an impressive plus 38% organically, on top-line growth of 25%. This reflects the very strong performance of U.S. ZYN and the growth and scale effects of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities. This strong underlying acceleration was amplified by only a few percentage points due to HTU shipment phasing. Gross margins expanded substantially for both heat-not-burn and oral nicotine, and by a striking plus 600 basis points organically for smoke-free overall, which made up close to 39% of total gross profit, an increase of plus 6 percentage points versus prior year. Combustible organic gross profit growth was notably improved and exceeded our expectation at plus 2.3%. Gross margins were also better-than-anticipated, leading to an improved full year outlook. Resilient volumes, strong pricing and manufacturing productivities more than offset the continued cost pressures in the category, geographic mix, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. As previously flagged, cost increases in leaf, wages and certain other inputs carried over into 2024, and these should ease next year. We were also impacted by around $30 million of costs from implementation of the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, primarily on cigarettes. A key feature of Q1 was strong operating income margin expansion. Gross margins increased organically by 150 basis points and by 80 basis points including currency. This reflects excellent expansion within smoke-free products, their growing weight within our business at higher margins, and the better-than-expected evolution of combustibles. These factors, combined with productivity savings, significantly outweighed the unfavorable technical dilutive impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia, which equated to 30 basis points in the quarter. For SG&A costs, currency-neutral growth of only plus 1.4% drove 220 basis points of organic margin expansion. This benefitted from our resource allocation and prioritization programs, including the delivery of approximately $160 million in gross cost efficiencies across COGS and SG&A towards our $2 billion target for 2024-2026. Although the Q1 margin impact of SG&A cost evolution including currency was small due notably to Egyptian Pound transactional currency, we continue to target SG&A progression below top-line growth for the year. We expect higher organic SG&A increases in the remainder of 2024, notably reflecting investment spend phasing, which was favorable in Q1. The combination of these factors powered a remarkable plus 370 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margins, and plus 90 basis points including currency. This exceeded our expectation and we are now raising our full-year operating income growth outlook, as I will come back to. Taking another lens on adjusted operating income margins by geography, we see broad-based global momentum with all regions delivering strong organic progress. In dollar terms, margins expanded in every region except the South and Southeast Asia, CIS, and Middle East Africa region, mainly reflecting the transactional currency impact of the Egyptian pound and the technical dilution in Indonesia. Indeed, excluding these factors, this region grew margins at a very similar rate to the group. Moving to IQOS. With ILUMA now widely launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present. PMI HTUs now exceed the 10% market share milestone on the prior basis excluding Indonesia, which we now include following broader commercialization in the market. Our HTUs are the number on nicotine 'brand' in 11 markets, and as shown at CAGNY, IQOS net revenues have surpassed those of Marlboro. Focusing on IQOS in Europe, Q1 HTU share increased by plus 0.9 points, also crossing the 10% regional share milestone for the first time. While still early in many markets, the growing availability and uptake of ILUMA is a key driver and we are seeing a strong acceleration in a number of historically slower-growth markets. Adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high of 12.6 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects year-on-year progression of plus 9.4% in Q1, with excellent growth in Greece, Portugal, Germany, Spain, UK and the Netherlands. Growth was slower in certain Central European markets such as Poland and Czech Republic, where increased economic pressures and price-sensitivity are visible. We continue to evolve our portfolio in these markets under the recently-launched ILUMA system to drive further growth. Excluding Ukraine, where growth was absent, adjusted in market sales grew double-digit. As anticipated, the 11 markets so far affected by EU characterizing flavor restrictions saw an impact in line with our total region estimate of around 2 billion sticks for the year. Consistent with similar past situations, we observe an initial consumer adjustment followed by a reversion of growth rates to previous levels. We have not seen meaningful shifts towards e-vapor or competitor heat-not-burn products, and we expect the structural growth of IQOS to fuel continued HTU progression over the rest of the year. The strong fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the expansion in key city offtake shares. Very strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoption, such as Lisbon, Rome, Athens and Budapest, demonstrate the potential for further growth at the national level. The recent acceleration in London, Madrid, Munich and Amsterdam is also very promising for the IQOS brand in these markets and for Europe overall. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by an excellent plus 3.1 points to 29.3%. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by plus 13%, maintaining the rapid progress of recent quarters. Such impressive growth in a market with already-high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable growth potential of IQOS around the world. In connection with IQOS' strong brand equity and commercial footprint, we are fostering growth through continued innovation on both devices and consumables. In March, we launched the latest IQOS device ILUMA i in direct channels, with national expansion ongoing. We remain laser focused on innovation. Our innovation in consumables has included a number of new variants and taste experiences on the premium TEREA brand. As shown by the offtake data on this chart, this has helped TEREA to continue growing Japan share at the same time as mainstream-priced SENTIA. This successful strategy of broadening consumer appeal with different price tiers while reinforcing and growing the premium line-up is a good illustration of how our IQOS business is evolving across markets as the category continues to grow. The potential of the category is clearly demonstrated by the performance in Tokyo. As shared at CAGNY, heat-not-burn category volumes surpassed combustibles in January and have continued to grow since then. Led by Japan and Korea, the East Asia & Australia region reached almost two-thirds smoke-free net revenues in Q1. While somewhat flattered by shipment timing, this clearly demonstrates the path forward for the broader company as we strive towards our ambition of becoming substantially smoke-free, surpassing two-thirds by 2030. Outside of Japan and Europe, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across the globe, including low and middle-income markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. A notable call-out is Indonesia, where we have expanded commercialization to targeted areas in new cities and introduced TEREA clove variants catering to kretek taste preferences. We have witnessed an uplift in user growth, and now have over 150,000 estimated IQOS users in the country. Our city offtake share in Urban Jakarta is one indicator of this, with plus 1.6 percentage point growth to 3.4% in a growing total industry. We are also pleased to report the reacceleration of IQOS growth in South Korea following the introduction of ILUMA. TEREA recently became the number one HTU brand as measured by national c-store offtake, and in Seoul IQOS market share grew by 1.8 points to 12.8%. Egypt continues to stand out with Cairo offtake share up 1.3 points to 9.1% despite recent pricing, and we also see promising results in Malaysia, Morocco, Lebanon and the Balkans. While not shown on this slide, Saudi Arabia also had a promising restart with Q1 national offtake share of 1.3% following the resumption of IQOS commercialization in late 2023. In a similar vein to some of our European markets, the November launch of ILUMA in Canada has coincided with an acceleration in key city growth, as shown here by Toronto. While still early days for ILUMA and in a very restrictive regulatory environment, this is clearly a positive development. Moving now to ZYN, where excellent U.S progress continued in Q1 with 70% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the fourth consecutive quarter to 74.3%, an increase of plus 6.9 points year-on-year and 1.3 points sequentially despite a $0.15 cent per can price increase in March. Retail value share also grew to 79.3%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users. As outlined at CAGNY, we remain focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We support the FDA's efforts to ensure only consumers over 21 have access to nicotine products. Swedish Match follows a robust U.S. marketing code that prohibits using social media influencers, age-gates digital platforms to 21-plus and includes partnering with WeCard to help ensure retail sales only to legal-age adults. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% in Q1. This primarily reflects better-than-expected pricing of plus 7.9%, with a notable contribution from Germany, and stepped-up pricing in Egypt. The pricing environment remains favorable, and we now forecast a full-year increase of 6% to 7%, with annualization effects lessening in H2. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.3 points in Q1. This includes positive contributions from Algeria, Poland, and Turkey, resulting in only a modest volume decline in a total cigarette industry which fell by 0.6%. Our global brands gained category share during the quarter, with Marlboro gaining plus 0.4 points. As previously flagged, our 2023 share of segment was flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt which may normalize this year. As I already mentioned, strong pricing in Q1 coupled with accelerated manufacturing productivities also resulted in a better-than-expected margin evolution. Now, let me provide an update on our latest innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. As I covered earlier, we recently launched IQOS ILUMA i, our most innovative offering to-date, in Japan. The ILUMA i portfolio consists of three devices offering a range of adaptable new features. This includes the new touch screen on the device's holder which allows users to see experience-relevant information quickly and easily, as well as a pause mode so users can pause and resume their smoke-free moment where they left off. Initial consumer feedback has been very positive. Japan was the first market to launch ILUMA in H2, 2021 and we plan to gradually roll-out ILUMA i to more geographies over time. As shown in our Japan and Indonesia performance, consumable innovation on the ILUMA platform is also critical, as we broaden offerings across markets. LEVIA HTUs, which contain nicotine but no tobacco leaf, were launched nationwide in the Czech Republic and Romania in Q1 with promising initial results. More markets are planned later this year. DELIA, our new mainstream-price brand for HTUs, was rolled out in Switzerland, Hungary, and Lithuania. In the U.S., we continue to prepare for the first consumer pilots in select cities with the IQOS 3 system. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and will be focused on direct activation of select legal-age nicotine users in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose of these consumer activations is to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, following authorization from the FDA. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. We have launched or relaunched in 11 markets so far, with more planned later this year. In e-vapor, our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. Positive consumer feedback is translating into promising repeat-purchase and conversion rates, and we are on a path to profitability in H2. This brings me to our outlook for 2024. With unparalleled smoke-free volume momentum, best-in-class pricing and expanding margins we are raising our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. This strong pricing, combined with positive smoke- free mix and efficient cost allocation also helps us to mitigate currency headwinds and should allow us, at prevailing rates, to deliver on our objective of robust growth in dollar terms. Given continued ZYN volume progress, we are increasing our U.S. shipment forecast to around 560 million cans. We have further accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this additional step-up. We continue to target strong growth in both adjusted IMS and shipments of IQOS HTUs, and to reach close to $15 billion in 2024 smoke-free net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. Factoring the increased ZYN shipment forecast and a strong pricing outlook on both combustibles and smoke-free products, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to plus 7% to plus 8.5%. In addition to higher revenue growth, we expect accelerated organic margin expansion. This is strongly driven by a significant expected uplift in our smoke-free gross margin due to IQOS scale effects, ZYN mix and accelerated manufacturing productivities. It also includes organic gross margin expansion in combustibles, where we had previously assumed a negative development. In addition, we are focused on delivering further SG&A efficiencies while continuing to invest in smoke-free growth. As a result, we are raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 12%. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 9% to plus 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.19 to $6.31, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36, at prevailing rates. The increased forecast headwind is primarily explained by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent weakness in the Japanese Yen. As I mentioned, we are taking pro-active actions to mitigate the incremental impact. We expect full-year gross and OI margin expansion, in both organic and dollar terms, at prevailing exchange rates. This includes organic expansion in both H1 and H2. After the excellent Q1 performance, we expect a strong H1 overall with organic net revenue and OI growth around the high end of our full year ranges. For Q2 specifically, we assume HTU shipment volumes of 34 billion to 35 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including an unfavorable currency variance of $0.14, at prevailing rates. With regard to our balance sheet, deleveraging remains a key priority. We continue to target a 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. We also continue to target reaching around 2x by the end of 2026 and will consider buybacks once confirmed we are on-track. Now switching gear. As this quarter coincides with the publication of our 2023 Integrated Report, I would like to welcome Jennifer Motles, PMI Chief Sustainability Officer, to share an update on our sustainability progress. Jennifer, over to you.
Jennifer Motles: Thank you, Emmanuel. I'm very pleased to be joining today's earnings call. As Emmanuel mentioned, our sustainability transformation and business strategies are one and the same. We're focused on creating value for the long term, where generating shareholder returns requires us to deliver on transformation, and delivering on transformation requires us to deliver on sustainability. As shown in our recent results, our product transformation fosters profitable growth and short, medium, and long-term value creation. However, our transformation also means reshaping both our value chain and how we engage with society. As we venture into new product categories, we actively collaborate with different stakeholders and advocate for regulatory frameworks that can accelerate industry change and end smoking. Business transformation is a company-specific journey, which sustainability reporting standards and frameworks often fail to adequately capture. To help illustrate our progress towards achieving our smoke-free purpose, we regularly report our business transformation metrics, a bespoke set of financial and non-financial KPIs. Some of them were already presented by Emmanuel in our financial results. Others you can see here. For example, the growing proportion of commercial and R&D spend on smoke-free products demonstrates the allocation of resources away from our legacy business and towards replacing cigarettes with better alternatives. As another example, increasing the availability and access of adult smokers around the world to smoke-free products are two key pillars of achieving this replacement. As our geographic expansion continues, low-and middle-income markets now make up 47% of our market presence. These metrics, together with our overall performance for 2023, can be found in our latest integrated report published last month and available on our website. It is a comprehensive document covering our most important sustainability topics, starting with our products. The report highlights progress on our continued expansion of smoke-free alternatives across categories and geographies, as well as social and environmental programs deployed with and in parallel to these products in support of sustainable value creation. This includes responsible marketing and sales practices, youth access prevention programs, and efforts to reduce post-consumer waste. Further, it highlights our progress on improving the quality of life of people in our supply chain, decarbonizing our operations and value chain, and preserving nature. We're also very pleased with the continued recognition of our sustainability performance and our robust reporting. To highlight just a few from 2023, PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time and for the fourth year in the DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was the only U.S. company to obtain a AAA rating from CDP. More than 20,000 companies worldwide participated in this rating, and only 10 obtained this prestigious recognition. Notably, for investors in parts of Europe, but also in ESG or sustainability-themed funds in the U.S., we're subject to sector exclusion policies because we're a tobacco company. It is clear that excluding companies or sectors from the consideration set does nothing to address the underlying reasons for the exclusion, which in our case would be the harm linked to combustible tobacco use. Many funds that may be excluding tobacco on ESG considerations will still own stocks in other consumer sectors, despite many of these companies not having comparable harm reduction strategies in place to address the impact of their products. As we transform our company away from combustible and work to end smoking at a societal level, we welcome the engagement and challenge of investors to help us accelerate this critical shift. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jennifer. I will conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Our excellent IQOS and ZYN volume momentum, best-in-class pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies put us on track for a strong 2024, with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Following an exceptional and better-than-expected start to the year, we have raised our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. Critically, we are also focused on delivering performance in dollars. We are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds through pricing, accelerated manufacturing productivities and judicious resource allocation to prioritize growth investments. Our 2024 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2024-2026 CAGR targets. Beyond 2026, we have further exciting opportunities to grow our smoke-free business as we progress towards our ambition of being substantially smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while maintaining a steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you and we are now very happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Matt Smith: If we start, the first quarter, it was a strong start to the year. You noted a better revenue and margin performance supporting your ability to raise the outlook for both organic revenue and constant currency EPS. From a high level on a constant currency basis, the first quarter EPS was about $0.20 ahead of your 1Q guidance, and you raised the full year outlook somewhat below that. Can you talk about unique benefits in the first quarter that may have changed the timing through the year? Or how are you viewing the rest of the year different now in terms of the fundamental environment or investment level?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Matt. I'm happy to explain why some of the bits, but only part of it, of course, because we started, as I explained in my prepared remark, the year in a very strong manner, in an underlying manner. But in addition to the very strong momentum that we are experiencing, indeed, there was around an additional 1 billion HTU stick because of Red Sea. So that has been a plus in Q1, and we expect that to reverse later in the year for the time being. So that's one element that is important. We may have been helped a bit by some volumes on combustible, but it's probably more marginal. And at the scale of the combustible business, it's probably smaller. And then the other element, of course, is the SG&A evolution, organically 1.4% increase only. We want to grow organically revenue faster than SG&A, but of course, we will have the 10 points of difference that we've been experiencing in Q1. So that will also reverse partially in the rest of the year as we are coming with some phasing on commercial actions and marketing, advertising later in the year and starting in Q2, where we will have more SG&A. So I think that with that, you have the key element that has been adding to what was, as I said, very strong momentum anyway in Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: Emmanuel, I wanted to maybe ask for a little bit of more color on a point you made about or at the end of your script regarding currency headwinds and how you're hoping to mitigate these headwinds. You highlighted pricing and productivity savings, et cetera. So maybe just provide a little bit more color on those, I guess, levers if you can pull them and maybe why you're more optimistic going forward, given the never-ending currency headwinds since it continues to impact your business. I think that would be helpful.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Happy to share our view and what we're doing on that one. So we said it at the beginning of the year and then we're at CAGNY, we want to deliver performance in dollar terms. And therefore, that means that even when we have another significant ForEx headwind and, you know, some of that, I mean, we have in Q1 actually $0.06 coming from the Egyptian pound that won't be there next year. So that's not something that's going to stay with us. So it's a kind of one-off negative impact. But we want to deliver robust growth in dollar terms. So in order to deliver that, we have two big levers, I would say. One is on price. And to be clear, when we talk about price, it's, of course, in the countries where we can see some devaluation, but not only. It's really across the board. How can we push the boundaries and push, to the maximum of the limit, the price increase? Well, we think that we're doing in a way that is not necessarily taking a big risk on market share. But we are clearly here and notably on combustible pushing on price increase. So that's something that we can do. That is taking into account a certain economic environment. And in the current environment, we are doing what we think is optimized and the best we can. Of course, if there was some more depreciation, more devaluation, we would reconsider whether more action can be done. And then on productivity and on cost efficiency, that means really accelerating everything we can do on productivity. And we are working across the board. It's, of course, on procurement. It's on optimizing the manufacturing footprints. It's on logistic. I mean, it's on everything where we can generate extra saving and playing with this environment of a strong dollar. And then on cost allocation. I mean, of course, we are working permanently as part of our 2 billion saving program on plans to be simpler, to generate efficiency, to work in a more efficient manner. So we do that. We try to accelerate that. Here again, we're trying to do things faster. And we are also making sure that when it comes to investment allocation, we really prioritize on what is having the biggest and strongest and I would say clearest return, which is allowing us to also generate some profitability improvement to partially offset the negative ForEx. So that's really everything that all the action that we are doing. We're not saying we can offset any kind, of course, of ForEx environment. But I think our Q1 numbers and the outlook for the year is showing that we have some good capacity to mitigate to a very significant extent the ForEx impact.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That is helpful. And then I just had a quick question, if I may, on ZYN. We're actually hearing about some out of stocks in the U.S. from some of our industry trade contacts. So, maybe hoping for a little more color on this and how much it might have impacted volumes in the quarter. Also, curious if these issues are related to maybe specific production issues or more related to the strong demand and ultimately when you expect them to be resolved. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. This is very much the latter. I mean, you can imagine when a business is growing 80% and we are growing 80%. That is indeed creating some tensions on the supply chain without any doubt. I'm not sure that out of stock is still the proper word, given where we are today. I think that, maybe sometime a reference is not going to be available. Not everything is going to be is going to be is going to be fully available in the range at a certain point in time. But look at what, the Nielsen are telling us on Q1 and our volume. I mean, we seem to be growing fast and it's difficult to see any kind of impact coming from restriction on availability. As we said, we are working very hard to maximize our capacity in this fast-growing environment for ZYN. We are comfortable, of course, with our capacity to deliver around our 560 million can. That is not the limit that we are putting, of course, in terms of production capacity. But we are in this phase of adaptation to this strong growth and fast-raising demand. I think so far, maybe with some tension, but with limited impact on volumes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Owen Bennett: First question on heated. Can you maybe talk a bit more about the contribution from newer markets? Is this trending in line with expectations or do you see potential for upside here? Because some of the trends you called out sound very encouraging. I'd also love an update on bonds in the latest with this, if possible. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, with pleasure, Owen. So I think we see and you said it, I've been elaborating on the number of markets where we see very interesting trajectory for new market. We've been speaking about Indonesia. We could have been speaking in addition to all the markets I've been covering. I could have been speaking about Mexico, where we have also a nice acceleration and we are just launching ILUMA. So the good thing is that we're not relying on one or two names, but we start to have a growing team of new markets where we see clearly, IQOS getting traction and increasing its stake. First, as always, in the big cities. That's where in many of these countries we have the biggest potential. But that's, I would say, happening in line with expectation. And as I said, we expect even a further acceleration in the second part of the year. We believe that then Taiwan will also start adding to the flow of this new market. So it's in line with expectation and clearly coming with a great potential. And as always, IQOS being perceived as, in many big cities rapidly as an aspirational product, which is extremely positive for the future and the brand franchise that we're going to be able to build there. Then on top of this new market and the IQOS trajectory in this new market, we have indeed bonds that we plan to develop in the future. We've been making the test, as we explained, in the Philippines and Colombia. We are working on the result. We are making a number of adjustments and will come with a detailed plan in the coming quarters. To make sure that we come with a product that has all the ingredients, all the features to be a great success. And we're working on it. That's going to be really important in all this market, because we know that the affordability here is different. To come with a portfolio that is segmented and where IQOS will have a role to play. But we need to also come with the rest of the portfolio bonds in order to cover this market.
Owen Bennett: Thank you. Very helpful. And I just add one more. I want to talk a bit more about Vape. And what sort of volumes do you think you can do here for the year? And if I heard you right, you said you'll be profitable already in H2, which would suggest volumes have been really healthy already. And just any kind of commentary on which markets you're seeing the strongest traction so far?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Owen. Of course, there is modest versus IQOS and ZYN in terms of impact at the group level. And we stick to our strategy, which is we don't want to be big in vaping if it's to lose money. We want to be really going with VEEV in markets where we are having the right commercial impact where VEEV can make a difference and in a profitable manner. Indeed, the year started well in terms of volumes. We have this outlook of moving into positive bottom line for VEEV in the second part of the year, which would be very good news. And we are prioritizing markets where we have the critical mass, where I would say the nature of the vaping market is interesting. And we are developing today very nicely, I would say, in markets such as Italy, Czech Republic, France, UK, developing in Canada. These are markets where we can reach, if you want, the size, the mass and where we have the impact to make our vaping business successful and profitable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.
Faham Baig: I have a couple as well, both on heated tobacco. Firstly, could I get your view on any implications that you see from the recent EU court ruling on the supplementary excise tax in Germany to any other of the European countries? And when are you expecting a decision from the finance court in Dusseldorf? And the second question, please, is again on heated tobacco. Clearly, pricing has stepped up over the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about balance between price and volume growth? And could pricing be higher than the original guidance of low single digits?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you for the question. So, first of all, on the German situation, I mean, yes, they've been asking for the view from the European Court of Justice. But it's a purely German question whether the way they've been implementing their extra tax was according to EU law or not. So there is no consequences for other countries. It's really a German question due to how they implemented this increase in the tax. So that's what it is. On the final decision, because as of today, that would be the decision from the German court. I have to say, I don't know when we will know more, I guess in the coming months, obviously. But I'm not going to be able to be more specific on the timing of the Dusseldorf court to make the decision. There are a number of steps still needs to be taken before they get there. So that will be for the coming months. But given where we are today, I'm not able to tell you when they will make the decision. Regarding your second question on price versus volume. So we said, and I'm going to stick to that. Yes, we believe that we can increase price more low single digits or not at the level of combustible on is not burn. Again, I think we are very clear on the very positive impact coming from the growth in volume from heat-not-burn our business. They're coming with a much higher per stick revenue. They're coming now with a higher gross margin rate, even at the level of just the consumable. It's significantly higher than for combustible as an average for the group. So that means that's really growing volumes is the name of the game for us. That's where it makes sense. Now, on top of it, given the very strong franchise of IQOS and the attractiveness of the brand, we are able to increase price without putting in danger the volume. But that's really the way you should be looking at it for us today. It's very much a play on maximizing the volumes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Gaurav Jain: So two questions from me. So one is, just conceptually. So, let's take a city like Tokyo where the heated tobacco category share is now 50% plus. So one can argue that by increasing the premium cigarette prices, which haven't increased now in two years, you can accelerate the down trading to IQOS. This will accelerate IQOS volume growth. This will also accelerate your dollar EPS growth out of Japan. So why wouldn't you do something like this in cities and countries where heated tobacco and IQOS becomes the dominant form factor?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you for your question, Gaurav. Look, I'm always very cautious, of course, as you can imagine, on commenting any kind of price strategy. So don't expect me to enter into any kind of detail. But conceptually, it is clear that as we build leadership in the category, as there is a growing adhesion from the nicotine user to heat-not-burn, there is a capacity for ongoing premiumization and more price increase without any doubt. But as I said, and as I explained, with the previous question, we believe that today still it's very much about maximizing the volumes. And that's what for us is important, of course, coming with great gross profit per stick and great contribution. So I'm certainly not closing the door to more price in the future. But I think I've been clear on what our priorities are. Having said that, as you know, in Japan, we need to have an agreement from the authority to increase the price. So I think it's something that is also sometimes regulated. So it doesn't mean that we have all the latitude that we would like to enjoy on the topic. So that's on the long-term. It is clear that today, as we've been discussing that already, you have the IQOS consumable that are positioned, even at some discount versus Marlboro. That gives an idea of the kind of increase that we'll be able to reach in the future, probably without too much, I would say, issues over time. Once again, it doesn't happen in one go. But as I explained for the time being, maximizing volume is the name of the game. And it's coming with, I think, what the Q1 is illustrating in a very bright manner, a very, very powerful mixed impact on our financial performance.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And my second question is on Russia. So, IQOS volumes in Russia grew, which is surprising, given that you do not invest in IQOS there anymore. So how should we -- so first of all, can you just remind us the contribution of Russia on your EPS? And how should we think of Russia IQOS shipments for this year?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, on Russia, you have to be a bit cautious on the shipment that you see. And that does not necessarily fully reflect the consumer offtake. You can have some movement from the surrounding countries. So I think we have to be cautious. So Russia is a market that has not been -- if I look at the past, I'm not sure that one quarter is enabling us to conclude anything. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been a market that has not shown, unfortunately, any kind of meaningful growth. Today, we have no reason to believe that suddenly Russia is going to become a growth market, because nothing has changed fundamentally. And that's a country that has been impacted, of course, by currency depreciation that has been impacting the weight in the EPS. So I think that we were referring to 7% to 8%. I think we'll have to revise. And I don't have the number top of mind for 24 on the outlook, but that was the kind -- it was around 9, 10. And I think with the currency, it has been losing a bit of weight in the overall performance of the company.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Callum Elliott with Barclays (sic) [Bernstein]. Your line is now open.
Callum Elliott: So my question is actually following up on Bonnie's question on dollar growth. In 2013, I think your dollar EPS, Emmanuel, was $5.40 per share. So you've compounded dollar EPS growth at about 1.5% percent over the subsequent 10, 11 years. So best-in-class organic growth and probably worst-in-class dollar EPS growth over that 10-year period, which is really striking given that 10 years captures the whole of the creation of this IQOS business that has been quite remarkable. So my question is, you obviously outlined a number of initiatives in answer to Bonnie's question of how you hope to drive dollar growth. But maybe you could sort of double back on those explanations. Which of those are actually new and haven't been present over that sort of past 10-year period that could have been helping you over that past 10 years? Because it struck me in those explanations that it sounded like things like pricing, et cetera. Those have all been around for the past 10 years and haven't helped you offset the FX. So is there anything you can tell us that's new that should give investors confidence that if FX headwinds persist, you are able to drive dollar growth for your business?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, I guess you are assuming that the ForEx headwind will persist in the coming years, which I think nobody can really say. We know that currency can be facing cycles and that it's true that the last 10 years have been about a strengthening of the dollar. We've been knowing other cycles where the dollar was more weakening versus at least other hard currency. So nobody knows what's going to happen. I think what we are saying and thank you for giving me the opportunity to maybe repeat and clarify that we are today in a position to put together very strong growth before ForEx. And I think you are seeing with the guidance for '24 that we are obviously coming still with a very dynamic top line, very much accelerating operating income growth. We are targeting a double-digit before currency impact now in 2024. And on top of that, we are going to price and in an environment that today we see positive for pricing, certainly with the fact that pricing on combustible is something that we can use now very tactically. We know that CC is not our future, so we can certainly use pricing very tactically in order to boost performance. We also are coming with some price increase at the level of HTU. We have some price increase on ZYN as well. So we have globally a pricing environment that looks attractive to us in the future. And then, when it comes to our cost, it is true that we've been investing a lot in the past years, and we've been reporting on all the action that we were having on investment across the board, in terms of innovation, in terms of science, in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing. Now is the time where, of course, we are reaching critical mass on smoke-free products. There are a number of things that we are doing that we can do more efficiently, a number of things that we've been learning and that we're going to implement in the continuation of our journey. So all that we believe is also giving us some very good ammunition and capacity to generate efficiency at a very high level in the future. So that's all the -- and they are quite important, quite numerous, all the levers that we own to deliver performance in dollar terms in the future.
Callum Elliott: Thanks Emmanuel, that's helpful. Maybe I can just ask a follow-up. So we have a number of U.S. consumer staples companies reporting this morning, and many of them face similar FX headwinds, sort of incremental FX headwinds over the past two, three months, as PMI does. And it's striking to me that amongst some of those companies, even a commoditized U.S. toilet paper company has done a better job this quarter of offsetting these incremental emerging market FX headwinds with sort of rapidly responding with incremental price increases to offset those headwinds. So I guess my question here is, you know, is there something structural in your business that's making it less agile in responding to these changes in FX relative to some of your other consumer staples peers outside of the tobacco space?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, can I answer you that your question is highly speculative because you asked me to compare with other businesses that are obviously very different in, I guess, the way they invest, their outlook, what they have to do. We are building here a business that has a tremendous growth potential, so we're not going to, of course, limit all the initiative, all the investment that we must do in order to keep growing the business and extract the full potential that we have with our smoke-free portfolio. Maybe that's different versus the paper business you were mentioning. I frankly have no clue because I don't know what you are referring to and the specific situation. But I think it's difficult to probably compare businesses that are facing different potential, different trajectories. That would be my answer.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Bye-bye. Speak to you soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-11 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2024 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. The press release is available on our website at www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, and additional net revenue data are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated February 8, 2024, and on our Investor Relations website. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I’m joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and high single-digit organic top line growth, driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I am also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid-November. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024. ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall group, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for heated tobacco units reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete, now present in 51 markets representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume excluding Russia and Ukraine.  The superior experience and design of ILUMA combined with the strong premium brand equity of IQOS and our unrivalled commercial infrastructure enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multiyear growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower margin markets without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns including currency in 2024 and beyond. We reached a number of key transformation milestones in Q4. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes, and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also testament to our organization’s ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volumes. We are also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed two-thirds of group net revenues. Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded carbon disposal projects Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year. I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Let’s start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of 8.3%. This includes 14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effects, and also 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November 12, it contributed 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top line growth and grew by an excellent 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically, and grew excluding the technical effects mentioned by Jacek. This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations with ZYN’s remarkable growth a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater than expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year. Net revenues grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margins and operating income margins in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effects of growing HTU volumes and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible. As expected, OI margins organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margins include a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross up of around $250 million growth in both net revenues and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include the strong contributions from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressures and supported investments with efficiencies. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q4, and $2.2 billion for 2021/2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamics I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes. We comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a 15% increase for IQOS HTUs, in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens or better growth expected here, we are very well-positioned to continue growing volumes over the mid and long-term. 2023 HTU shipment volumes of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market volumes and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of 6% reflects trade inventory build-up in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is therefore a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year. For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022 these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volumes and exceeded the company’s growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits. Organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10% following the exceptional headwinds of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business, and in line with our 2024/2026 CAGR target range of plus 8% to 10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income, smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margins by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4 with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenues, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effects and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profits. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume declines in higher margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available such as Turkey. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventories cover multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024, and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency neutral top line growth of 26% in Q4 and 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectations, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned, as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume declines which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN’s excellent U.S progress continued in Q4 with 15% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN’s premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31st, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuations and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward. With the addition of ZYN to our portfolio, and a smaller, but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the delegated directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco products and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volumes and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustibles in 2020. Based on the initial data from markets that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same. We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category, and indeed expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points to 27.6% with off-take share surpassing 34% in Tokyo. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volumes returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison, following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city off-take shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo off-take share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic off-take volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamics on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust with organic top line growth of plus 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing, with notable contributions from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 points in 2023 with notable contributions from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Although flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in 2024, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains, with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years, in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency neutral 2021/2023 targets of more than 5% organic top line and more than 9% bottom line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next three years we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to 8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to 10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to 11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rates, including an increase in net financing costs which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay. This brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volumes, smoke-free net revenues and gross profit. We forecast the highest ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially no off-take growth in Russia. For shipment volumes, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches and potential supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory levels compared to 2023 given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this further significant step-up in volumes and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN’s excellent economics continue. We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion’s share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressures and negative geographic mix in combustibles I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margins excluding technical impacts, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margins. This forecast includes notable capability investments in the U.S., but as mentioned at Investor Day we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year’s Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia’s suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economies in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%. We forecast a strong Q1 overall with HTU shipment volumes of 31 billion to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparisons improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impacts of 2023. Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effects on net earnings including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impacts and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of around $1.2 billion including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around three times given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minorities and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria. We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5 times deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I'll now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year. These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruption and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear. We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY conference in two weeks’ time. Let me now conclude today’s presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds, driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity. Combined with our unrivalled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, everyone. I actually wanted to ask a high-level question on the year. You originally guided FX-neutral EPS growth in '23 of 7% to 9%. Yet, you really did finish out the year a lot stronger, reporting 11% currency-neutral EPS growth. So as you look back, what were some of the key areas of outperformance versus your initial expectations? And then as you think about this year, you're initially guiding to 7% to 9% FX-neutral EPS growth again. So just trying to understand how conservative this may be, especially considering your 9% to 11% midterm growth target?
Jacek Olczak: So Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum which we have in the category is in Japan, is really well worth singling out. And despite the fact that as you know IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean where we capture well above our segments, I think we captured about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching the year 10 anniversary of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks how category is continuously expansions in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category. So if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really worth singling out. Clearly, ZYN and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match, that adds the important element of our portfolio of alternative smoking, the pouches and obviously, creates a very good opening for us in entering the U.S. market and that ZYN is clearly is growing above their expectations. What is very important is we hear from time-to-time, quite rightly, conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product. I am so pleased with both IQOS and with ZYN actually are delivering of as they were designed for, i.e. going after adult smokers in the U.S. above 21 years. We're all familiar with the CDC data, less than 80% youth usage, the same is for IQOS and international. So we have a good -- my view is we have a very good, sustainable growing two fabulous propositions in a smoke-free product, and we're also trying here to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the e-vape. So right now, if we roll this forward to 2024, I think that Japan is on the good momentum. ZYN in the U.S. continues this momentum. Europe is going very strongly very well. Yes, we have this distortion maybe potential headwinds we're getting there. We very clearly indicated the $2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU.  But other than that, these key geographies and these key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective expansion, they really are on the positive side. And I don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing you should note that, on occasions, there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on. And you remember during Investors Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS 10 consecutive years of fabulous growth despite the fact that we essentially lost any growth, access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, and depends how you now -- which period you pick up, but easily above the 4 billion maybe even 5 billion per annum growth of the category. So I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our 3-year outlook.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I did want to ask a little bit more on margins. Just hoping for a little bit more color on your margins in Q4, especially in Americas, where they were actually negative. I'm assuming, I think you called this out, a key driver of this is your investments ahead of the IQOS relaunch in the U.S. in May. So in the context of this, how should we think about operating income growth in Americas this year? Will it continue to be negative? And then for the full year of '24 year, just total company, your guidance is for FX-neutral revenue growth and operating income growth does imply operating margin expansion. So could you maybe touch on your expectations for gross margin and OpEx in the context of that?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, Bonnie, Emmanuel can chip in a little more details. I think in the Americas segment, where it's more the impact of the devaluation in Argentina which drove the margins down rather than the U.S. market. Specifically about the U.S. market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth, and ZYN expansion, but also in preparing Swedish Match organization or Philip Morris International in the U.S. organization for being able to handle IQOS soon and obviously have the organizations, which is after the opportunities and the challenges of the U.S. market. So there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L even ahead of the IQOS process start of the commercialization. Emmanuel, do you want to?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, just to complement -- to answer your question, Bonnie, and complement what Jacek was saying on what is behind the higher-than-expected performance for '23. Clearly, as I described, a very strong dynamic on the volume on the commercial dimension, if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4. And in that perspective, I mean, clearly, the U.S. is a fantastic market. We've described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the U.S. is best-in-class among our portfolio of products. And therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S., the U.S. is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating income. And we reflect the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. U.S. is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Emmanuel, if I may just clarify something then. For this year, you are expecting gross margin and possibly op margin expansion? Based on your guidance, it implies op margin.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. We do absolutely, Bonnie. Yes.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Gaurav Jain with Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, good morning. Two questions from me. One is just to clarify the Argentinian peso impact. So you have a $0.19 impact this year, which is linked to balance sheet revaluation. And on the slide, you are using the Argentinian peso rate, which is equal to the spot rate. So there shouldn't be any further balance sheet revaluation down, which means that there is an automatic $0.19 benefit to EPS. Isn't that the way the math works?
Jacek Olczak: Look, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar terms has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing. What you have to take into account is that the basis has been -- in fact, as basically with the devaluation in December. So any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Maybe I can ask it separately. And my second question is around ZYN. We are hearing a lot of statements. We had a statement by Chuck Schumer. A lot of investors are concerned, they think that regulation is coming on, then flavors will get banned. So how do you plan to get ahead of this entire potential controversy that could emerge around ZYN?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So we observed over the last few weeks, I heard a lot of conversations around Brazil in social media and generally Internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the U.S. market for 10 years, okay? And if you look at the numbers, CDC latest data on the underage usage, et cetera, it stays very below. I think it's 50% which is the lowest from any product nicotine and also other products where there's some major restrictions applied. I think we know what about the Swedish Match marketing practices, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisition of the (inaudible). We have said that the alignment with Service Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory, but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing as we are on -- with IQOS, with heat-not-burn and the international. We have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal too in these conversations with general consumer, but also to FDA and I think the facts are different than sometimes it is being -- trying to be the positions in the media. So the product is helping adult smokers with very strict with the age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little -- well, going anticipating, frankly speaking, in the territories we wouldn't have a control. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media. So we think what we're doing is put the right product from the potential of the reduction of the harm where the product is based on science position and the risk reduction continuum, frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any another nicotine product, very much obviously versus the cigarette. We have a pending PMTA with FDA and feel the science is very strong and very conclusive on the site. So I feel very confident. From the very beginning of our transformation, solid Swedish Match, we put the marketing team and very much the protection of the youth very, very high on our agenda. So I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products, which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smoker.
Operator: We'll go now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Good morning. I have a question about ZYN as well. It's seen phenomenal growth in the U.S. Can you talk about what's driving the acceleration in growth in ZYN in the U.S.? And are there any particular regions where you're seeing stronger growth? And just on the ZYN guidance, it implies about 35% growth in U.S. shipments, but that seems conservative given the strength that we've seen. So is there anything that would temper ZYN's growth outlook relative to what we're observing?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So the ZYN, as you might remember from our Investors Day, the profile of the ZYN, when it comes toward the smoke or where the adults are coming from, there is any sourcing very nicely from a combustible cigarette, obviously, serves from the overall categories, including the tobacco-containing pouches, Swedish snus or similar products, but also resourcing from the vape category. So it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of Brazil. It is -- another way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish snus product, the tobacco-containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people were not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type where they may be constraints, et cetera, and ZYN is something which is -- looks cleaner and is white, it doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for a -- might be for some consumer create some resistance. So this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the U.S. with a well-developed e-vape category, obviously, still a very sizable combustible cigarette category and also many other oral tobacco forms, so it's a nice sourcing for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences. With regards to your comments about the number of accounts forecasted, naturally related to our guidance for next year. We are very well familiar with that slightly trend in the U.S. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes. Can -- but guidance is built on the number of the assumptions, right? I mean it's a global business, multi-category and there are some headwinds, which we are aware today. I'm not sure whether there's a lot of materialized, but I think it's a matter of prudence is that this part of the year at the beginning of the year to single them amount and be prudent, but there are also some upsides and the tailwinds, which we are well aware of. The year-end faults will come to the Q1. I mean as a player, we build the confidence as you go through the year.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. And Pam, to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with a growth year-on-year that would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth and not in a big percentage year versus '23 and '22. So these are similar volume growth. It's related to a reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether your -- we have still going even higher than what we are forecasting for the time being.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. And a question on the patent settlement with BAT. Can you elaborate on the implications of that? I know you've been investing in manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. for IQOS. How does the settlement influence your ability to import into the U.S.? And does it change your manufacturing strategy?
Jacek Olczak: Well, it actually allows us now to also connect IQOS in the U.S. to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day 1, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, et cetera. So obviously, as the mitigating type of a strategy we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the U.S., but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. We would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and the HeatSticks and it will take a while until U.S., on a stand-alone basis, would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we had on international. So for us, it clears the path for IQOS, top blend and ILUMA. So we're bringing a lot of -- or removing that, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward. And IQOS because it is U.S., it's just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from a day one, will have an access as I said to the pipeline of the products and its economic cost benefits as an international market. So for us, actually, is clarity and acceleration which we gain through this agreement. And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business and we plan to have even more sizable business with the addition now of U.S. and that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important which I believe is also important for investors too.
Operator: We'll go next to Faham Baig with UBS.
Mirza Faham Ali Baig: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. I have a couple as well, please. Firstly, you're guiding for another impressive year of mid-teens heated tobacco in-market sales growth. You've highlighted Europe will be within that range. Historically, Europe has done slightly better. What markets make up the sort of difference to help you to still get to the mid-teens growth? If you could allude to the larger markets. And within that, are you assuming any contribution from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, you mentioned? And what should we expect for the U.S. as well, please?
Jacek Olczak: So maybe I start with the U.S. I mean the U.S., we will do the test market on IQOS three point -- what we called IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the high cost and we keep looking forward to get more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA MRTPA for IQOS which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of a commercialization. So what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from U.S., it's very minimal. We are not treating this as testing the engine, commercial, the consumer phasing type of a solution rather than a lowered the current version of the product at the full scope. We have assumed -- we made some assumptions with regards of opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. The trade not on the list is obviously Taiwan. Okay, that's each other assumptions and we might be right or wrong, but these are the assumptions which we made. It obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being passed and et cetera. And with regards to Europe, look, I mean although I believe and the history have shown with the flavor type of regulations in the different categories, in the different places, that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact to the dollar. But we're going in a period that some markets or markets will be implementing these regulations. I think they need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean that they put in a guidelines and these will be transparent and still give you potential with headwind, which we take in, in the volume outlook for IQOS, but we'll have to see where this materializes. Not materialize, I think it's a matter of who then we should talk about this. Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the value of a share evolution, essentially, our European market is pretty strong despite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from other heat-not-burn participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables, consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates for this highly sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. Again, the major driver is Spain. We make the -- we start making a significant progress. So that's it for me.
Mirza Faham Ali Baig: Thank you. And then just one other question, please. So you're expecting a smoke-free acceleration in 2024, but that's not translating into group net revenue growth acceleration in 2024. Are you expecting a softer performance in combustibles in '24? Is that the discrepancy?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I mean look, this is the blended -- at this moment in time, at the beginning of the year, the blended outlook for the group revenue is combustibles, oral and, obviously, heat-not-burn. There's few other in smaller things. But we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think again, it's fair to assume that the driver of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year. But there is obviously a pricing potential, which we baked in, in the -- or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now, number of the years when we leave the revenue top line above 7%. And remember very well the times when we started transformations when they were the 3% to 5%, now I think a quality what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention, that we not only want to lead in a sustainable matter the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of that revenue growth. So having a 3-year total group volumes to start with above was no decline, not even flat, but growing, when you start overlaying this by pricing and managing to -- focusing to avoid the risk of some down-trading, et cetera, I think that the 7% is there, well, above 7% revenue growth is the pretty -- from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective, I would think that is all that EBITDA.
Emmanuel Babeau: Just to add to what Jacek has just been saying. I mean indeed, it's taking into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increase with close to 9% on the combustible portfolio and we don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to a mid-single-digit price increase for 2024. So of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business.
Operator: We'll go next to Callum Elliott with Bernstein.
Callum Elliott: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the questions, guys. I just wanted to start with disposable vaping products. We've obviously seen these products have huge success in the U.S. in 2023 and the U.K. also driving us a steeper volume decline for commutable cigarettes in those markets. Obviously, your combustible cigarette business in those two markets is not huge, if nonexistent, obviously, in the U.S. So not a huge impact on your business so far. But my question is why do you think we haven't seen equivalent success for these products in the markets that are big markets for your business and the EU in particular? And do you think this could be a threat to your business in 2024?
Jacek Olczak: You mean the threat to our business coming from the e-vape products? Look, there a number of factors, right? So one is that I think that the category of the e-vape product is being disposable; it's not disposable. It's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right? Then we very often forget that the core of the smokers' market-by-market with literally few exceptions are very much and if I would characterize is a traditional tobacco type of experience flavor, et cetera. So this creates sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption. But I think for some smokers and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time, triggers the bottleneck in terms of a full-time type of a switching adoption. So that's one of the factors, okay? And then obviously, other factors at play.
Callum Elliott: I guess I understand that, yes. But why hasn't that -- it seems like in the U.S. and the U.K., that hasn't been an impediment to these products' success over the past 12, 18 months.
Jacek Olczak: Results, so the focus, right? Because U.K. was on the forefront as was U.S., if I remember historically, of the forefront of this category partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category. So obviously, people are going with alternatives to the places which create some sort of that underlying margin opportunity with the relative freedoms also to talk about these products. As you know, Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very -- let me put it that way, warmly welcomed. So let's leave aside the hybrid action principles. But some other opinions and views at play. Look, we know that we enter a e-vape category, but we're trying to be very disciplined or focused I should say and it's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. And we don't want to focus the company from some other opportunities which we're pursuing, which, in our view, are more sustainable and offer the good start for the margins and the underlying profitability But when we enter with this product, Italy, Czech, a few other markets, I mean our products despite the fact that we're relatively late into the -- from a category history perspective, and then we have gained double-digit shares in this market in the speed of -- span of less than 12 months or so. So it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalties in place. There's a lot of yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trial. I should not ban category and the pouches judge by performance in the U.S. And then by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more discipline in how they navigate it also.
Callum Elliott: Okay. And I have a follow-up that is related but maybe a slightly more philosophical question. In a number of markets and especially the U.S. related to some of these disposable vaping products, we've been seeing this formation of -- I would describe it as like a dual-tiered market that's been forming with big legacy players such as yourselves who are forced to play by the rules and hold themselves to a certain set of standards, marketing only to existing nicotine users and all of us will have seen your video on ZYN last week, I would imagine.  But at the same time, we also have a secondary set of smaller new businesses who seem to be doing basically whatever they want and often illegally, but having great success within the marketplace and attracting lots of consumers. And so I guess my question is, do you think that this dual-tiered structure that seems to be forming in a number of markets, structurally impairs the attractiveness of your business and your brands when it seems like you're just being forced to play on a playing field which is not level?
Jacek Olczak: Well, look, obviously, companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations. So obviously, I mean, our ability to come to you, these are -- it isn't what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook, but it's essentially hit and run almost type of operation. And I think we know what has happened or what is happening in the U.S. There is, I understand, some discipline in the market is now underway. But frankly speaking, it's a long overdue because there is a lot of -- pardon my language, but a mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcements and other design for this designated for these agencies were a bit slow. And I think it's, frankly speaking, a replica, which we have for many years, and still in some places, kind of on a cigarette market, and it forms of an illicit type of a participation in the market. It's not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards, all of these things creates completely around distortions in the market at the expense of the legitimate category manufacturers and also diverts the conversation from how further we can progress and have reductions and divert them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed.
Callum Elliott: Okay, thanks, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.
Matthew Smith: I think you asked second, Emmanuel, wanted to ask a follow-up question about investment levels embedded in the 2024 outlook. If we consider the expectation for gross and operating profit margin expansion on an organic basis, can you talk about the areas where you're seeing a step up meaningfully in incremental investment? Last year, you called out $150 million of explicit investments, including $75 million or so in the U.S. It would seem like the growth in ZYN would allow you to step that investment level up while still being able to achieve your double-digit profit expectations in the market.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So a lot depends, obviously, we target adjusted the live growth above on the revenue growth. So obviously, we are assuming some improvement in the margins. But on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So it is -- if we were to completely stop investing, obviously, the expansions on a wide growth would be much more significant, margin expansions will be much more significant, but we are -- it is not what we see in our strategy. So I think once we operate it at scale and we build, like the consumer has there, so the scale in the U.S., the revenue is very substantial over there, at least by the market standard. And the revenue, which we generate from a small crew, but also combustibles on international with that sort of a revenue growth rate, I think we have a room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure. And I think, especially on the combustible, I -- we assume that the 2024 is sort of the last year of this extra ordinary life of inflation under pressure. And as of 2025, in other words, we should start seeing easing when the COGS pressures, and this is about delivering some other materials. And I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously requires proportionally less of the investment with the first IQOS and the first ZYN. So, I mean, the scale offer is going forward, there's opportunity for supporting the margin.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 third quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, and additional net revenue data are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's form 8-K dated October 19, 2023, and on our investor relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. We delivered very strong and better than expected performance in Q3, driven by IQOS and ZYN. Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an excellent plus 20% in currency neutral terms to reach a record quarterly high of $1.67, despite a significant adverse currency impact in the period. Once again, our total volumes were positive, with the Q3 progression of over plus 2% positioning us to deliver our third straight year of growth. While not yet in our organic metrics, ZYN continued its exceptional growth with US volumes up by plus 66% in Q3 and over plus 50% year-to-date with a substantial increase in category share. Importantly, our IQOS business delivered another strong quarter with HTU shipment growing plus 18%, in line with the year-to-day trend. As covered at our recent Investor Day, HTU volumes have excellent unique economics relative to cigarettes, and the plus 16.5% organic net revenue growth from smoke-free product was a key driver in both our high single digit organic top line and double digit organic operating income growth. Smoke-free products made up over 36% of total net revenue in the quarter as we drive toward our new ambition of over two-thirds by 2030, making us substantially smoke-free. In combustibles, we delivered very robust performance with plus 6% growth in organic net revenues, strong pricing and higher category share despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free product. Our impressive operating income growth drove organic year-on-year margin expansion and a sequential improvement compared to the second quarter. This includes [healthy] (ph) expansion in the gross margin of our IQOS business, which surpassed combustible in the period and lower than expected commercial costs. Overall, we are pleased to report another strong quarter and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year and beyond. Turning now to the headline numbers. We surpassed $9 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time as strong positive volume and continued excellent IQOS momentum supported organic net revenue growth of plus 9.3%. This organic growth does not include the impressive plus 22% adjusted ex-currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and very firm combustible pricing of plus 9%. This positive top line and mixed performance drove very strong organic operating income growth of plus 11.3% and organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis points. Again, this excludes the exceptional performance of Swedish Match, which is included in our adjusted diluted EPS. We delivered adjusted diluted earning per share growth of plus 20.3% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.17 notably due to the Russian ruble and the balance sheet related currency impact in Argentina, as disclosed at our recent Investor Day. Sequentially, lower net financing costs were broadly offset by a higher tax rate. Our excellent third quarter combined with the robust H1 resulted in strong delivery year-to-date. I want to highlight our volume growth of plus 1.5% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again, reflecting continued dynamic IQOS performance and combustible pricing. In addition, Swedish Match currency neutral net revenues increased by plus 18%, excluding accounting reclassifications. Year-to-date, operating income grew by plus 2.4 organically, despite accentuated margin headwinds and notable OI decline in the first quarter due to the headwinds covered previously, which are now starting to subside. Combined with outstanding ZYN performance, this resulted in year-to-date currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10.7% to $4.65. This is an excellent performance. Turning now to the full year outlook. I am pleased to share that following this very strong year-to-date delivery, we are raising our volume, organic sales growth and currency neutral adjusted bottom line growth forecast. First to volumes, where we increase our outlook to plus 1%, to plus 1.5% total shipment growth for cigarettes and HTUs, despite a lower expectation for the total industry. Within this, we expect to deliver HTU shipment volume within the lower half of our prior 125 billion to 130 billion range. While IQOS fundamentals remain strong, this narrowing reflects a further delay to the expected market launch in Taiwan, limited underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine, as well as some uncertainty related to inventory level in the EU as trade partner adjusts to the upcoming HTU flavor ban. For combustible, the resilience of our portfolio is reflected in an updated forecast of a 1% to 2% cigarette volume decline. ZYN continues to perform exceptionally with strong adult consumer traction. Following a further step up in the US volume run rate, we are now increasing our full year nicotine pouch forecast range to 390 million to 410 million cans. Combining the improved volume outlook with robust pricing and continued positive mix, we are narrowing our organic net revenue growth forecast to around plus 8%, the midpoint of our previous range. As I will come back to shortly, we expect excellent organic OI growth over the second half of the year. Combining this strong profit performance with the continuation of ZYN’s phenomenal growth and diligent cost management allows us to raise our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 10.5%. This means we now expect double digit growth for the third year running and translate into a full-year range of $6.05 to $6.08, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.53 at prevailing rates. Last, despite increased currency headwinds, we continue to expect operating cash flow of around $10 billion for the year. This sets us up nicely as we focus on deleveraging towards our target of around 2 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA in 2026. Now, let me provide a different view of our forecasted results. As you can see, 2023 has very much been a year of two halves with a number of accentuated headwinds in H1, as explained in prior quarters, including steep cost inflation. H2 is a different story, and we believe it is more reflective of the underlying trajectory of our business. First, we expect an accelerated H2 top line with organic growth of around plus 9%. Second, we expect a significant re-acceleration in profit growth. We continue to expect organic operating income margin expansion in H2, and we are well on track after delivering another quarter of sequential adjusted OI margin improvement in Q3, with margins also expanding organically year-on-year. In H2, we expect strong organic operating income growth of around 10%. For the full-year, our expectation remains that organic margin evolution will be towards the lower-end of our minus 50 basis point to minus 150 basis point range, including the expected technical margin impact of around 40 basis points from third-party arrangement in Indonesia and Ukraine. For Q4, we expect strong operating income growth with broadly stable year-on-year organic margin provision. This includes the expectation of higher device sales as we accelerate our ILUMA rollout to reach around 50 markets by year end, complemented by further ILUMA device innovation. This very positive organic OI trajectory in H2 naturally translate into an acceleration in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth posted by Swedish Match. Now turning back to our results, our total shipment volume increased by plus 2.2% for Q3 and plus 1.5% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver our third sequential year of growth. HTU shipment volumes grew by plus 18% in Q3 to reach 32.5 billion units, driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. Adjusting for inventory movement, including the transition back to sea freight, Q3 adjusted IMS grew by plus 14.4%. This includes Europe at plus 16% despite heightened competitive activity, notably in Poland. And a more normalized growth rate in Japan of plus 12%. Excluding Russia and Ukraine where growth remains limited, our adjusted IMS advanced by a very robust plus 16%. These growth rates exclude the excellent development of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by plus 19% in Q3 and plus 14% year-to-date on a pro-forma basis, including the US growth of ZYN of plus 66% and plus 56%, respectively. If we were to add the growth of nicotine pouches on a unit basis, our Q3 proforma smoke-free volume grew by plus 19.5% and our total volumes by plus 2.5%. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.5% in Q3 with strong performance in Turkey and Egypt and by 1.3% year-to-date, reflecting solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite robust pricing. I will now walk through the mechanics of our Q3 net revenues. In addition to plus 2.2% volume growth, pricing contributed plus 6.2 points of growth as combustibles remain strong and the negative impact on HTU pricing of the annualization of excise tax increases in Japan and Germany, notably moderated. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business continues to be a consistent top-line driver, reflecting higher net revenue per unit. The positive mix impact of HTU's overall volume growth and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. We expect ZYN to enhance this further as it starts to be included in our organic metrics from mid-Q4. Looking now at adjusted operating income, where the $3.7 billion delivered in Q3 is also a record-high. I am pleased to report that following peak margin headwind in Q1, our organic growth has accelerated nicely as inflation, supply-chain disruption and ILUMA related factors continue to moderate. And the underlying dynamics of our transformation bear fruits. The Q3 progression is slightly above our 2024, 2026 CAGR target of plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth. And as I covered earlier, we expect our overall H2 OI growth to be around the top of this range. This strong operating income growth in excess of an already healthy topline performance drove a better-than-expected organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis-points in the quarter. This was also the first-quarter this year, where gross margin expanded organically, notably, due to lower shipping costs, ILUMA margin improvement and lower device sales compared to the prior year. SG&A cost were also organically lower as a percentage of net revenue reflecting a good cost performance and some phasing between the third and fourth quarter. We delivered a further $120 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3, now surpassing our $2 billion target for 2021-2023. We aim to continue this run rate, as reflected in our 2024-2026 target of an incremental $2 billion in gross savings. The Q3 margin currency variance include a 0.6 points impact from the Argentina balance sheet related item I mentioned earlier. By its nature, this does not carry-forward to future periods. Now moving to Swedish Match which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory as we progress towards becoming substantially smoke-free by 2030. Swedish Match business delivered excellent adjusted currency-neutral net revenue growth of plus 22% in Q3 and plus 18% year-to-date. This means that our adjusted pro forma year-to-date topline growth was 60 basis points higher at plus 8.3%. Swedish Match strong profitability also enhanced our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin by plus 70 basis-points. As we covered at Investor Day, Swedish Match smoke-free portfolio has excellent economic and is already at significant size compared to total PMI with its product contribution or operating profit before G&A to be clear, approaching one quarter of our total smoke-free business year-to-date. ZYN remains the key performance driver as it delivered another remarkable US performance with plus 66% volume growth, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free recent trends of share gain in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia broadly continued. We continue to be very pleased with the positive impact of Swedish Match on our company and I would like to thank the team for delivering such a great performance. Now, let's examine ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Exceptional progress continued in Q3 with an increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume growth of plus 62% compared to Q3 2022 and plus 14% sequentially. Impressively, ZYN Q3 category volume share grew to 70.8%, which is plus 4.7 points higher year-on year and plus 2.4 point -- 2.5 point sequentially. Retail value share remained strong at around 76%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth reflect progressive increase in distribution and a further broad step up in nationwide store velocity as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS starting with user groups. We estimate there were 27.4 million IQOS users as of September 30th, this represent an increase of 3.7 million user versus one year-ago and 0.2 million compared to Q2 2023. As shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the third-quarter of each year typically experiences slower user growth due to the seasonal influences in the calculation. Both new user registration and devices to legal age smokers continue to advance strongly and at levels broadly in line with Q2 when users grew by 1.4 million sequentially. Also, as in prior years, we expect a substantial acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where our third quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.3 points to 8.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Continued share gains include the growing take-up of ILUMA, which is available to over 80% of IQOS users in the region. In addition to Q3 launches in Denmark and the UK, ILUMA was launched in Poland, which, like Japan, is a market with high competitive activity. We look forward to driving its performance here over the coming quarters. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of plus 16% in Q3, despite limited growth in Ukraine. We expect strong IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. In the EU, the majority of member states have transposed a delegated directive withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban international law. The ban in this market will be effective as of October 23rd and the remaining markets are expected to adopt in 2024. As previously mentioned, we are adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition, and while short-term volatility is possible, including in year-end trend inventories. We do not expect significant change in the structural growth of the category. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA celebrated its second anniversary of the national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 3 points in Q3 year-over-year to 26.6%. Importantly, adjusted in market sales volume again grew sequentially on the four-quarter moving average, reaching over 10 billion units for the first time in Q3 2023, as IQOA outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q3 shipment to Japan also benefited from further switching back to sea freight during the quarter. This shift is now substantially progressed and we expect a more normalized rate of HTU shipment in Q4. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow individually and in aggregate, reaching Q3 offtake shares of around 18% and 8%, respectively, despite the impact of seasonality. Our Japan city shares also continue to progress with a number reaching over 30%. We continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q3 key cities offtake share across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We see notable ongoing success in Egypt with Cairo offtake share of plus 3.5 points to almost 9%. And in Santo Domingo our leading Latin America city, with offtake share around 8%. Most promising is a 3.1% offtake share in [Urban] (ph) Jakarta, where IQOS is only available via the IQOS Club Members program. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across this important future market, despite seasonal effect on sequential share metrics. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of plus 6.2% in Q3 and plus 5.6% year-to-date. This reflect another strong quarter of pricing with notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia. With better-than-expected pricing in Q3 of plus 9% and plus 8.6% year-to-date, we now forecast a full-year increase of plus 8% to plus 8.5%. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.6 point in Q3 and plus 0.3 points year-to-date. This reflects notable contribution from Egypt, Poland and Turkey, resulting in only modest volume decline. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last two years, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS supports robust overall market-share gains. We captured plus 0.9 point of international cigarette and HTU share in Q3. And plus 0.7 points year-to-date. As covered at Investor Day, our superior share of smoke-free product give us a formidable platform for sustainable market-share gains with superior unique economics. Now let me update you briefly on our exciting innovation and expansion activities, which will be critical as we aim to reach over two-third smoke-free net revenue by 2030, including 60 markets over 50% and 40 markets of over 75%. As we covered at Investor Day, the global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues. We launched ILUMA in four markets in Q3 reaching 27 markets in total, which represent around 75% of our IQOS business by volume. ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth with upgrades from existing user and new user acquisition. With a further six market launch already this month, we expect ILUMA to be present in around 50 market by year-end and to essentially complete the rollout next year. As also mentioned during Investor Day, superior tobacco taste is critical to our ongoing success, and we are further exploring complex and new test spaces to enhance our tobacco flavor experience. On the other end of the consumer preference spectrum, we will be offering zero tobacco consumable for non-tobacco flavored discovery under the LEVIA brand. Just as nicotine pouches are an evolution from snus to make the oral category relevant to more adult smokers, LEVIA is a similar non tobacco evolution for IQOS, as we broaden our offering to increase switching away from combustibles. The US represents the most significant opportunity to drive accelerated smoke-free growth at both the top and bottom line. We are continuing to invest behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 2024 and a scaled-up rollout with ILUMA once authorized. We remain on track to file for IQOS ILUMA's PMTA and MRTPA this months. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remain a key mid to long-term focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. During the third-quarter, we relaunched ZYN in Switzerland and following positive regulatory developments rolled out ZYN in Finland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible product by switching adult smoker to smoke-free product, which are designed and marketed for adult-use remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy as we become a more sustainable business with accelerated growth and returns over time. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the Science Based Target initiative validated our forest land and agriculture emission reduction target, a recognition achieved by very few companies. We pledge to reduce this absolute Scope 3 emission by 33% by 2030, which is significant given that Scope 3 remain the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. In September, almost 20,000 employees in over 60 countries participated in World Cleanup Day, showcasing our commitment to raising awareness around littering as part of our wider strategy to reduce post-consumer waste. We have long expressed our support for more rigor in sustainability related reporting and welcome recent moves towards greater consistency in standard under strong governance framework. As part of our ongoing work, we provided responses to consultation request from the International Sustainability Standard Board to have shared the development of their work plan, an update to the [SASB] standards. PMI continues to be recognized by [indiscernible] such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development as the leader in non-financial reporting. We have much more to share on our sustainability effort and transformation. [indiscernible] will be presenting at the CECP CEO Investor Forum in New York on November 14th, and the event is open to all those who would like to attend. To conclude today's presentation, we continue to deliver sustainable growth through our transformation. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business give us confidence in strong full-year results, built on volume growth, positive mix, pricing and cost management. Considering the headwinds faced, notably in the first part of the year. We believe this speaks strongly to the fundamentals of our growth model. Notably, the outstanding performance of IQOS and ZYN continues, further enhancing our position as the global smoke-free champion. We have exciting plans to accelerate our smoke-free future in both the US. The largest smoke-free market and internationally. We are confident in our 2024-2026 CAGR target of plus 6% to plus 8% organic topline growth, plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth and plus 9% to plus 11% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth. We also as a clear guiding objective with our new ambition to be substantially smoke-free by net revenue in 2030 as another key milestone on our journey toward the smoke-free future. And finally with our latest dividend raise in September, we have delivered 16 years of continuous dividend increase since our 2008 spin, despite the ups and downs of economic and currency cycle. This translate to cumulative 183% increase and CAGR of 77.2% since 2008 with an annualized dividend of $5.20. As these demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return through a progressive dividend remain steadfast. Thank you very much. And we are now extremely happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So I'd like to start with ZYN, please. Clearly, a very impressive result with continued acceleration in the top line. Emmanuel, you talked about distribution gains. So, I was hoping you could just level set how much more runway do you see from a distribution standpoint? Certainly, this remains a velocity-driven story, I would think. So that would be question one. And then the follow-up will just be on the margins, which came in way ahead of expectations. You've called out very strong cost management. That's clearly apparent. I'd love to hear your perspective on the durability of the current margin level for ZYN, please. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Vivien. So on ZYN and of course, every quarter will bring its new, I would say, load of news. And I think we see in Q3 another great quarter of acceleration in the velocity that means that where the brand is already even nicely present, we see the consumer offtake accelerating. It just show that this product are becoming more relevant for a growing number of adult user and that's a great news. There is also the geographical dimension on which we elaborated at the time of our Investor Day and which is showing that, while the brand has a certain level of presence on the western part of the U.S., it doesn't mean that it isn't going to grow it further, but it's, of course, bigger than the rest of the country. There seems to be a trajectory that is saying that the rest of the country is going to adopt it progressively, and that is indeed giving also a nice, I would say, trajectory on further growth in the coming quarters and years, of course. We talk here about probably years of very nice growth. So it's great that we have beyond ZYN, two engine, which is really where the brand is already with the biggest presence. We don't see any decrease in the consumer adoption, and we see increase, what we call the velocity. And we see progressively, I think, as well quarter-after-quarter, this geographical momentum building up as expected. Now on the margin, yes, it's true that this growth of ZYN is extremely positive when it comes to margin. Of course, we are going to continue to invest behind this growth potential in the U.S., and we will put the necessary commercial resources to make sure that we maximize the growth potential. But I said it, ZYN is really best-in-class in terms of gross margin for our product in -- at the group level. I'm talking about ZYN in the U.S., but globally in [indiscernible] nice margin, but ZYN in the U.S. is best in class. And that means, of course, that growing ZYN is an excellent news for top line, but also for bottom line. And I think that in the growth of the adjusted earnings per share over the quarter, this is absolutely visible.
Vivien Azer: Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I had a question on your HTU shipment volume for the year. You mentioned you're now expecting to come in within the lower half of your guidance. And then you highlighted a few reasons for this, including the uncertainty related to inventory levels in Europe given the upcoming flavor ban. So could you give us a sense of maybe where inventory levels are at right now? And then maybe how many quarters do you expect some of this unwind to happen? And then, just thinking about the trade, is this being offset in any way with -- I'm just thinking about combustible cig inventories? Or really, how is the trade responding to this ban?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Bonnie. So I think it's, of course, something on which we will be able to elaborate once we have been landing the year after the ban put in place on where the country are implementing it at the end of October [indiscernible] in all countries. One of the questions we have is, as with some reduction with some SKUs, does it mean that they are globally going to reduce the level of inventory and can this impact the level of shipment toward the year-end? So I think we're flying that because, of course, we continue to be with a view that this ban should not ultimately bring major disruption, and we've been elaborating on many occasions on why we think that this ban is not going to ultimately change the dynamic in the category. But it's so that we have some question mark on the landing for the reason I've just been describing on the level of inventory. That's why we are -- I mentioned we need to make sure that we are as clear as possible on the possible, I would say, temporary effect that this could generate. Now when I look at our shipments for the year. So we are clarifying the lending area. When I look at the 2023 performance versus 2022 performance, that will mean even in the low end of the bracket, an acceleration in terms of growth versus the growth that we experienced in 2022 in terms of incremental billion of [indiscernible] being sold. And of course, shipments are, as we know, what we are selling, what is probably more important is the consumer offtake. And here, frankly, we see the momentum continuing with no change. And I think the Q3 number where we have seasonality. But when we look at Q3, what we expect for Q4, we are very much with the same strong 15% to 16% IMS growth. And we are in line with what we have experienced last year. So that shows -- and by the way, it's a percentage on a higher base. So in fact, in volume, that means that the volume growth is higher. So we don't see any change in the momentum. We see a lot of strength in the growth, and that's visible in the volume and the market share that we are reporting today for Q3.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of another question, I just wanted to ask on your new IQOS users in the quarter. It did come in a bit light. You highlighted that this is normal quarterly seasonal trend. So maybe could you talk through that a bit further for us? And then maybe what other drivers might be impacting this? And essentially, how much visibility do you have in terms of Q4? You mentioned you expect a substantial acceleration in user growth this quarter. So I just kind of wanted to verify what you're seeing so far in October gives you that confidence. And is it realistic to assume a typical $1 million average quarterly run rate moving forward? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So actually, last year, we were flat in terms of user acquisition. So we're doing better this year than last year in terms of user evolution. And I think we are in line with what we experienced in 2021, if I remember well, I think we've been sharing the numbers. So that's a typical pattern for Q3 which is due to the mythology on how we calculate the user growth. And I think we have today the -- as I said, the element of the momentum that we are seeing on people buying the device and people registering that is pointing to the fact that we see the same momentum, there is no change. And last year, we finished the year with a strong user growth, and we target to do the same this year. So I have to say it's remarkably stable in the strength, if I can use this expression. And as I said, we could be at the end of the day, in fact, growing in shipments and in IMS volume more than last year. So the percentage is about the same. Again, the basis being higher, it means that we're going to increase in terms of volume differential year-on-year.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.
Gaurav Jain: So I have a question on the U.S. cigar side of things. So clearly, the FDA stand as rule-making process to ban flavored cigars to the [OMB] (ph). So first, how will you address that? And secondly, if I look at the reported numbers on cigars, it seems that the revenue had a pretty steep decline this quarter. Can you help us understand what's happening there?
Emmanuel Babeau: So on the trend, we've been increasing price. I mean the cigar had been below a certain threshold for a period of time and we decided to move above this ratio, which was $1.14. And there is a time for adaptation and that explains why on volume we are impacted this year. But I don't think it reflects what's going to happen in the long term where we continue to have very good brands and with a lot of consumer support. Frankly, on the flavor, will you allow me not to speculate. I mean, I don't know exactly what are the plans. What it’s going to mean, how long it would take, what is decided, and again, nobody actually knows what could be decided, how long it's going to take to be implemented. So I'm not going to speculate at this stage on what would be our answer and what we would do because I'm not going to be relevant on anything that could be seen at that stage.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And then my second question is on FY 2024 EPS and what's the base we should use to project that? Because I heard a comment that the Argentinian balance sheet revaluation impact, which is about $0.06 that will not recur in FY 2024. So we should add back to FY 2023 EPS? And then could you also just comment on Russia exposure and the [CLCPS] (ph)?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So this is a technical comment on Argentina. Gaurav, you're absolutely right. This is a ForEx impact that is a kind of one-off, if you want, because that is impacting this year but next year, we're not starting with the base on our profit that is decreased by that. It's just something that you need to book on your balance sheet exposure. But what is taken is taken. I mean, of course, depending on the evolution of the Argentinian peso in the future. But I don't have anything to say at this stage. I think I just wanted to clarify this technical impact. On Russia, frankly, versus when we made three weeks ago, there is nothing new to report on the Russian situation. This is a market where, of course, we are being very significantly impacted on the profit reported in dollars because of the very strong weakening of the Russian ruble versus the dollar. And that is one of the, if not, the biggest impact this year on ForEx. That is, of course, I would say, mechanically reducing our exposure to Russia in our profit. That's mechanical. And we are -- as we already said, we are seeing very limited growth in Russia, that is a market where as we've been saying, we've been reducing our commercial activity and [indiscernible] market where we're investing and that is translating, of course, on the performance of this market.
Gaurav Jain: Thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Pam. Good morning.
Pamela Kaufman: I have a question on the combustible business. It's been exceeding expectations, and you've taken up your guidance for volumes on the combustible strength. Can you talk about what's driving the performance in this category, despite the acceleration in pricing growth?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Pam. Happy to do that. So yes, combustible is being resilient. We have a decline, but it's a modest decline in Q3. Let's be clear, this is driven by a few market where we see a nice share gain. One is Turkey, the other one is Egypt. As you can imagine, they are not market with great profitability per stick. So let's be very clear. We have a nice performance on combustible on volume, to some extent on revenue. All the great work that we are doing now on increasing OI and growing margin is first and foremost driven by our smoke-free product, IQOS first, ZYN second and [indiscernible]. So yes, great performance when it comes to volumes, greater performance versus the decline that we have seen in the past few years. Good impact on revenue. We've been doing good on price increase as well. But remember, that's a category on which we've seen a lot of inflation on our cost and part of the growth is generated by market with low profitability.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. And then on ZYN, when do you expect to hear a decision from the FDA on ZYN's PMTA applications? And how are you thinking about the prospects for ZYN flavor approvals, considering the FDA has recently issued unfavorable decisions around flavored e-cig products.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, we discussed that three weeks ago and there is nothing new on the PMTA. We don't know what's going to be the time line. It's at the discretion of the FDA, and we see that a lot of things are taking significant time to be -- decision to be taken. Let me make a couple of comments on this PMTA process, nevertheless. The first one is that, we have with our snuff product, [indiscernible] an MRTPA of Level 1. So the FDA has been recognized that this product are representing a reduced risk versus combustible cigarettes and we're very clear as benefit claim. We believe that by nature, this product should be considered as equally good, if not better. And we believe that they have the potential to really convince million of smokers to move away from combustible cigarettes to have a better way of consuming nicotine. So we are really helpful that -- hopeful that the FDA will really take that as a very important element and that it's important to make this product available for nicotine users in the U.S. Now on the flavor, because I think that was probably one of your questions. For the same reason, we believe it is important that the consumer has the choice of flavor, if it is a reason for them to move away from combustible cigarettes to this better product. Having said that, we have the example of a ban on flavor in California. And the reality is that, there was an adjustment during a couple of months, and then the [rules] (ph) resumed without flavor in California and we are today very, very significantly, I think we are close to 30% above the pre-ban level in California. So it shows that these products are extremely attractive and resonate with the nicotine user, with the smokers and with other nicotine users beyond the flavor, which is very good news.
Pamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pam.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Smith: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Smith: If we take the full year organic profit margin guidance, the down 150 basis points or so and the year-to-date performance, along with your commentary around kind of a flattish year-over-year performance in the fourth quarter, can you talk about some of the factors in the fourth quarter. I understand there's a lot of crosswinds here, but you get the benefit of Swedish Match rolling into the organic base. And then you mentioned you've completed the shift to -- back to sea freight for HTU consumables in Japan. So can you talk about some of the headwinds to margin in the fourth quarter? Maybe some detail around your expectations around the incremental ILUMA launches or any other factors would be helpful.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. So indeed, there are going to be some mix impact in Q4 and notably on the devices as we are rolling out ILUMA in a significant number of new markets. We are also launching some new innovation in some markets on the ILUMA device. That's going to generate, I would say, significantly accelerated activity on our device sales, and that is having a negative impact on the margin. So that's going to be clearly one element. Then on top of that, there will be certainly some investment during the fourth quarter, and that is having an impact on the margin. And then you can have some mix coming from geographies and other mix element. That is what is today behind the guidance of around flat. I mean it doesn't mean that it's going to be a bit positive. But today, we are seeing this around stability situation for our OI margin year-on-year organically for Q4.
Matthew Smith: Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, when you talk about investments in the fourth quarter, should we think of that as a sequential step-up in investment relative to the level in the third quarter? Or is that more of a year-over-year higher investment compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. And I'll leave it there.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, I think you should expect certainly a continuation of a significant level of investment as we are accompanying the growth of our star product, IQOS and ZYN. That should probably mean quarter-on-quarter, I would say, sequential increase and still a significant growth versus last year.
Matthew Smith: Thank you for that.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Good morning, Emmanuel. Hope you are well.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Owen.
Owen Bennett: I just wanted to ask also ZYN very, very strong in the U.S., but I wanted to ask about pouches ex U.S. So volumes only flat versus 2Q for Scandi and ex-Scandi. You mentioned you also had relaunches in Switzerland and Finland during the quarter. So I was just wondering how you see the near-term outlook for volumes at U.S.? Do you expect any meaningful acceleration over the next several quarters? And then the second question linked to that, there's some increasing chatter now that the EU is looking to potentially ban pouches as part of the new TPD. Does this impact how you think about investing in the space ex-U.S. near term? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Yes. So we have this situation in Scandinavia on nicotine pouch where the product is already present, mainly in Sweden, where it's a nicely growing market. That's not where we enjoyed the biggest market share. So we are globally year-to-date, growing on nicotine pouch in Sweden, but are not -- we're not talking about big volumes here as we have our strong leadership in Sweden on snus. Outside Scandinavia, we are just at the beginning. So yes, we are launching. So we explained that we've been launching in Switzerland, Finland as well, even in the Nordics. There will be more market to come. Now it's going to be hopefully nice, but it's going to be small versus what we see in the U.S. You see what I mean. So it's going to be difficult to see given the strength that we are seeing in the U.S. to see volume outside the U.S. showing their strengths. Now yes, it's going to add very nicely additional numbers. But again, it's not going to be huge compared to the U.S. We'll see with TPD if there is any decision taken around nicotine pouch. Of course, if there is anything decided that will -- in that respect, which we don't know today that may influence the way we invest on this category in the EU. But frankly, at that stage, it's too early to say because we don't know what's going to be discussed, if anything on that one. And therefore, we'll see.
Owen Bennett: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Andrei Condrea with UBS.
Andrei Condrea: Hi. Good morning, Emmanuel. Just one from me, please. And I know it's a bit of a topic to [Joe] (ph), but the GLP-1 drug, obviously, there's been talk about it having anti-addictive properties. Do you think this could be an issue for PMI in the long term, rather? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Frankly, I mean, I've been hearing things about that. I mean I know what the assumption is everybody going to be under GLP-1, and therefore, they're going to drive massive change in consumer behavior. And I'm not even able to tell you what would be the impact for somebody who is a nicotine user and is going to take GLP-1. I'm not sure we have any serious study on human behavior on that that is going to say that. So first of all, I don't know how broad the usage of this medicine as drug is going to be. Second, I don't know what's going to be the potential impact. So I'm not sure that today we can say anything relevant and that makes sense on that topic.
Andrei Condrea: No. That makes sense. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Emmanuel for closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Hi. This is James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, talk to you soon. Bye-bye.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 second-quarter results. The press release is available on our website at www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, and additional net revenue data, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated July 20, 2023, and on our Investor Relations website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such, figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023.  Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations to reach a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60. This was driven by impressive ZYN and IQOS growth, coupled with strong combustible results. We delivered total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth of 3.3%, putting us well on track for our third consecutive year of positive volumes. This excellent result underpinned double-digit organic topline growth and high-teens currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We also expanded our leadership in smoke-free products in the period. Firstly, IQOS’ strong momentum continued, with adjusted in-market sales volumes, led by plus 16%, and shipments up by plus 27%. This reflects very good user growth of plus 1.4 million in the quarter and continued strong traction across the world. This is increasingly driven by IQOS ILUMA, which is now available in 23 markets, representing around two thirds of our IQOS business by volume. Secondly, and now two full quarters after the Swedish Match acquisition, ZYN is delivering an exceptional acceleration to our smoke-free business. US volumes grew by over plus 50%, including a notable step-up in June. We are delighted with this performance. Our combustible business also delivered better-than-expected results with over plus 7% organic net revenue growth after a very robust quarter for pricing and resilient volumes. This was a key contributor to the strong plus 7% organic operating income growth, with a plus 210 basis points sequential improvement in our adjusted operating income margin.  Turning to the headline numbers, positive volumes supported very strong organic topline growth of plus 10.5%, with continued excellent IQOS momentum and a further acceleration in combustible pricing. This does not include the remarkable plus 19% pro forma ex-currency topline growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN, with combined pro forma ex-currency net revenues increasing by plus 11.1%. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by plus 19%. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7.0%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and combustible pricing. Due to these positive factors, adjusted operating income grew by a very robust plus 7% organically despite continued inflationary headwinds. This excludes the tremendous growth of ZYN, and starting in Q4, our organic results will include Swedish Match. Adjusted OI margins improved 210 basis points sequentially, and while still organically lower year-on-year by 140 basis points, this better-than-expected performance was notably supported by combustible strength and favorable timing of certain costs. We also increased our participation in the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia, which now represents close to 40% of its industry volumes, and is slightly dilutive to our margins. This organic delivery, including the favorable timing of costs, combined with exceptional June ZYN volumes, and a lower tax rate, allowed us to outperform our most recent Q2 forecast. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, representing 16.9% growth, excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.13, notably due to the Japanese yen.  While the first quarter of the year contained some exceptional headwinds and distortions due to timing and comparison effects, our business delivered a strong first half, including volume growth of 1.1%. Organic net revenues grew by 6.8%, with Swedish Match’s excellent ex-currency pro forma net revenue growth of 17% for H1, demonstrating its growth accretion to our business. Combined pro forma currency-neutral net revenues increased by around 7.5%.  Following peak margin headwinds and a notable operating income decline in the first quarter, the strong improvement in Q2 narrowed the H1 organic decline to minus 2%. As in Q2, this excludes Swedish Match, which delivered an excellent profit performance and made a significant contribution to our adjusted OI margins. We expect continued strong reported and organic operating income growth in the second half. Despite these headwinds, we delivered 5.9% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to $2.98 in H1, providing a strong platform for the second half of 2023 and beyond.  Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q2 net revenues. While not included in our reported shipment volume growth of 3.3%, Swedish Match’s smoke-free volumes grew by 15%, providing impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth. This primarily reflects combustible strength, partly benefitting from timing effects. As in Q1, HTU pricing was impacted in Japan and Germany by the annualization of 2022 excise tax increases, and in the case of Japan, the transition to ILUMA. These factors will have less impact in the second half as annualization recedes. We also continue to expect greater visibility on the likely outcome of the court ruling related to the German tax surcharge toward the end of the year. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business again contributed positively, reflecting higher net revenue per unit, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing, are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth.  Let’s now turn to gross margins. While the year-on-year trajectory remained negative, we saw improvement versus the first quarter, driven by strong growth fundamentals. Indeed, we achieved sequential improvement of 1.2 percentage points despite increased inflationary pressures, as topline growth accelerated and supply chain disruptions and ILUMA-related factors started to dissipate in the quarter. In addition, cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, increasingly normalized after an adversely affected Q1. Our IQOS business contributed positively to our gross margin in Q2, and we expect this to continue, partly mitigating combustibles. We expect further improvement in our year-on-year gross margin trajectory in H2 as headwinds continue to subside, ZYN’s outstanding growth continues, and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. As expected, SG&A growth was much closer to net revenue growth in Q2, and at a more normalized growth rate with regard to our full year expectations. Indeed, with such a strong topline in Q2, SG&A costs were lower as a percentage of net revenues. While we continue to invest in IQOS and ZYN, our successful cost efficiency programs continue to deliver, helping to finance growth investments and mitigate inflation, which remains a headwind. With $1.9 billion of gross savings realized to date, including $820 million from SG&A, we are on track to achieve our 2021-23 $2 billion target ahead of plan. Turning now to the 2023 outlook, we are raising our currency-neutral top and bottom-line growth forecasts. We aim to be a growth company starting with volumes. In 2023, we expect to grow total volumes for the third year in a row, even before factoring in the excellent progress of Swedish Match’s portfolio. As part of this growth, we are reiterating our targeted HTU shipment range of $125 billion to $132 billion, while we expect a cigarette volume decline of 1.5% to 2.5%. We are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting the continued momentum of IQOS, the resilience of our combustible business, and the ongoing excellent growth of ZYN, which we expect to contribute positively in Q4. We expect strong organic operating income growth in the remainder of the year to support H2 margin expansion despite the headwinds previously mentioned and certain technical impacts. These relate to the increased use of third-party manufacturing in a few markets, such as Indonesia and Ukraine, and the related growth of the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia I already mentioned. The full year estimated impact of these factors is around 40 basis points on our adjusted OI margin, and without this impact, we would expect to be broadly in the middle of our forecast organic margin range. On top of this organic evolution, we expect Swedish Match to add around 50 basis points of accretion.  Our strong topline and OI outlook allows us to raise our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to 8% to 9.5%. This translates to a revised range of $6.13 to $6.22, including $0.33 from unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, notably due to the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This forecast continues to assume around $150 million for incremental investments in the US, and our Wellness and Healthcare business. It also assumes around $1.2 billion in net finance costs, which includes higher interest on variable debt, partly offset by better returns on cash deposits. As previously mentioned, our forecasts do not assume any contribution from a potential favorable ruling on the Germany tax surcharge.  Focusing on the second half in more detail, we expect strong performance on all key metrics as smoke-free products deliver an increasingly positive impact. In Q3, we forecast high single-digit organic topline growth, with HTU shipments of 31 billion to 33 billion units, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, including $0.06 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect notably strong reported and organic OI growth as certain inflationary impacts are annualized, and we increasingly benefit from an optimized ILUMA supply chain and consumables. As I mentioned, Swedish Match will also be included in our organic figures during the quarter. The exceptional growth of ZYN is clearly margin-accretive, as visible in our adjusted H1 figures.  Turning back to our results, our total shipment volumes increased by 3.3% for Q2, and 1.1% year-to-date. HTU shipment volumes grew by 26.6% in Q2 to reach 31.4 billion units, notably driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. In addition to fundamental strength, HTU shipments to Japan were boosted in Q2 by around 2 billion units as we increased sea freight, with corresponding increases in inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, total PMI adjusted in-market sales volumes of HTUs increased by 16% in Q2, continuing the excellent trend seen in Q1. H1 shipment volumes grew by 18.5%. Notably, this does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 14% in Q2 and 12% in H1 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.4% in Q2, with notable support from Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.7% for H1, reflecting a solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite stepped-up pricing. Our smoke-free transformation continues to progress rapidly. Due to the continued impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 16.4% of our total shipment volume in H1 as compared to 14% in the first half of 2022, despite a resilient cigarette category. Including oral smoke-free products, this would be close to 18%. Powered by IQOS and ZYN, smoke-free products made up 35% of our adjusted net revenues in H1, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2022. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 4.5% of our H1 inhalable smoke-free net revenues. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of 7.4% in Q2 and 5.2% in H1. This reflects strong Q2 pricing, with a notable contribution from Indonesia and the Philippines. While we don’t expect the exceptionally strong Q2 pricing of 9.4%, which benefitted from timing factors, to be fully replicated in H2, we now forecast a full-year increase of 7% to 8%. Our cigarette category share grew by 0.7 points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, including contributions from Duty Free, Egypt, and Turkey, and by 0.1 point in H1, resulting in only modest volume declines. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last 18 months, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.  The combination of our stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of our leading smoke-free brands, positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 1.1 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q2, and 0.5 points in H1, with notable contributions from Turkey and Japan. Impressively, despite increasing competition in many markets, our volume share of the growing heat-not-burn category remains stable at around 75%. This is supported by ongoing ILUMA market launches and increasing focus on our two-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q2 of 0.2 points to a record 9.2% share. We estimate there were 27.2 million IQOS users as of June 30th. This reflects excellent growth of 1.4 million adult users in Q2, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. While fundamentals remain very strong, I remind you that Q3 user growth can often be below the average for the year due to the seasonal factors evident in prior years.  I will now turn to IQOS in the Europe Region, where we are approaching a milestone of 12 million users. This reflects the further roll-out of ILUMA, which is now available to around 70% of IQOS users in the region, and the expansion of our two-tier portfolio. As an illustration of its progress, TEREA is already close to 100% of our HTU in-market sales volumes in the first launch markets of Spain and Switzerland. Our second quarter HTU share increased by 1.6 points year-over-year to 9.0% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted in-market sales volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and reached a record high on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of 20% in Q2, outstripping the 11% growth in HTU shipments, which were affected by some residual effects from the inventory dynamics seen in Q1. We expect robust growth in HTU shipments, adjusted in-market sales, and overall region organic net revenues in the second half.  We continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of European countries adopting multi-year excise tax plans, with clear differentiation of smoke-free products. Over half of EU member states have now passed multi-year plans. Also in the EU, a number of member states are currently transposing the Delegated Directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the flavor ban into national legislations. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on October 23rd, and we will be adjusting our HTU portfolio as required, in line with this transposition. While short-term volatility is possible, we do not expect a significant change in the structural growth of the category.  To give some further color on our continued progress in the region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Despite the denominator effects of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. We are very pleased with trends in Rome, showing a sequential step-up to 28% share following the ILUMA launch. Robust progress in London and Munich also bodes well for these two key markets. While the Q2 2022 comparison for share in Vilnius was helped by the popularity of certain bundle offers, the share of over 40% remains impressive, and underlying offtake continues to grow.  In Japan, IQOS ILUMA continues to drive impressive growth momentum. Smoke-free products made up over 75% of our Japan net revenues in H1, clearly showing the path for the broader company. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points in Q2 to 26.3%, further strengthening TEREA and SENTIA’s positions as the clear number one and two heat-not-burn brands, despite intensified price competition for mid and low-price offerings. Importantly, adjusted in-market sales volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, as IQOS outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q2 shipments to Japan also benefitted from progressively switching back to sea freight during the quarter. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q2 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Notable ongoing successes include Egypt, with Cairo offtake share surpassing 8.5%, and Bulgaria, with offtake share in Sofia exceeding 15%, despite the usual impact of seasonality that I mentioned. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets.  Now moving to Swedish Match, which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory. As covered earlier, the business delivered outstanding currency-neutral net revenue growth of 19% in Q2 and 17% in H1. This means that in the first half of the year, Swedish Match has added 70 basis points of currency-neutral growth to our pro forma topline, and 60 basis points to our adjusted OI margin. In the US, ZYN delivered another exceptional quarter, with volume growth of over 50%, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gains in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia, broadly continued. The cigar business performed well, with Q2 organic net revenue growth of 16%. This reflects ongoing share gains despite being an early mover on category pricing. I would like to again congratulate and thank all the Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver terrific results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities, which is progressing very well.  Looking at ZYN’s US performance in more detail, exceptional year-over-year volume growth in cans of 53%, also reflects a 22% sequential increase versus Q1, 2023. This accelerated growth reflects progressive increases in distribution and a broad nationwide step-up in store velocities as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. This includes California, which implemented a statewide flavor ban in December. While such elevated rates of growth may not continue indefinitely, the structural indicators remain very encouraging. Impressively, ZYN category volume share grew 2.2 points compared to prior year and 1 point sequentially, despite continued discounting from less premium offerings. Retail value share also grew to 76.8%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity.  Now, let me provide an update on our innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. First and foremost, the global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA continues to be a top priority. We launched ILUMA in six markets in Q2, and with HTU manufacturing constraints now normalized, we aim to be present in around 50 markets by the end of the year. The most significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth is in the US We are investing behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 next year. As mentioned in today’s release, we are also on track for IQOS ILUMA PMTA and supplemental MRTPA submissions in Q4 2023. Our philosophy on the US remains unchanged. We will seek to accelerate our topline with IQOS and ZYN, supported by disciplined investment and leveraging both our extensive experience in smoke-free products and Swedish Match’s infrastructure and knowledge, while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI. Our pilot city launches for BONDS in the Philippines and Colombia continue to progress well. The learnings from these markets will be integrated as we roll out more broadly, starting next year. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key medium-term opportunity, notably for ZYN as the world’s leading brand. We are now preparing for the launch of - re-launch of ZYN in several markets. In e-vapor, our refocused approach in select markets is progressing with VEEV ONE, our newly designed pod-based system introduced in four markets, and VEEV NOW, our disposable product, in six markets.  Now let me discuss our Wellness and Healthcare segment, starting with its first clinical trial results for our inhalable aspirin product. While it was observed that the experimental product had a rapid onset of effect, which is the key medical advantage sought, there was significant variability in inhaled dose among subjects. The study was therefore deemed unsuccessful, and as a result, product design improvements are required. Our plan was to file this product with the FDA later this year. However, additional time is now required, and the outcome is therefore less certain. In addition, the CDMO business has been facing slower-than-anticipated development, including cost-related challenges. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment from our annual assessment, as detailed in today’s release. While these elements will postpone the achievement of our 2025 aspiration to reach over $1 billion of net revenues from Wellness and Healthcare products, they will result in a corresponding decrease in the level of investment in 2024.  Our ambitions to build and monetize our product pipeline are unchanged. As in the early days of developing IQOS, certain headwinds are to be expected, and the 2021 acquisitions in this segment have provided us with unique and enabling R&D capabilities. We remain committed to developing our Wellness & Healthcare business and continue to see attractive mid and long-term growth potential on many fronts such as inhalable drugs, NRT, and consumer wellness products, including non-recreational cannabinoids, in line with applicable regulatory requirements. We also aim to accelerate Vectura’s growth, and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its CDMO business. We plan to discuss all these topics, including our plans for IQOS in the US and a full update on our Wellness & Healthcare business at our Investor Day on the 28th of September in Lausanne, Switzerland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible products by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy, driving accelerated growth and returns over time from a more sustainable business. In addition, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class progress in other key sustainability areas. With our extensive agricultural and manufacturing supply chain, human rights are a very important responsibility for our company. We released our first dedicated report on the topic last month, detailing our strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights, and the progress to date in implementing our human rights commitment. Our performance on human rights is included in the 19 KPIs of our Sustainability Index, which comprises 30% of executive long-term equity compensation, weighted towards our product transformation. Our goal is to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest risk markets by the end of 2025. These help us better understand and address our impacts, and we are making excellent progress, with seven completed to date. Addressing climate change is another priority for us, and I’m pleased to share that PMI was included in Forbes' first ever Net Zero Leaders List, ranking seventh overall for all US public companies, higher than any other consumer products or services company.  To conclude today’s presentation, we delivered a very strong first-half despite a number of headwinds, putting us on track for the third consecutive year of positive volumes and organic net revenue growth of over 7%. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business gives us confidence in a strong full year performance, with excellent operating income growth. Outstanding momentum continues for IQOS and ZYN, the world-leading heat-not-burn and oral nicotine brands, and we have exciting plans to further grow oral nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year. Importantly, we remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders, including through our progressive dividend policy. In short, our smoke-free transformation continues to deliver sustainable growth. We look forward to sharing more with you on the next phase of our transformation at our Investor Day on September 28.  Thank you very much, and we are now delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your full year guidance. You exceeded your own Q2 guidance by at least $0.13, but did not flow through the EPS to the full-year outlook, even when factoring the greater FX headwind. What's tempering the flow-through of Q2 upside, and how much does this reflect conservatism around the balance of the year versus a more cautious outlook on the second half or higher investments? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pam. When we look at the driver for beating our initial expectation for Q2, I think we can probably make three buckets. One is the outperformance of ZYN versus our expectation, and that's something that we are of course taking into account as we see a better trajectory for ZYN than initially anticipated. Remember that will only contribute to our organic growth on revenue in Q4. But that is of course helping the adjusted EPS growth excluding forex. We also see some cost that has been moved to H2 and that is if you want cause that are we going to see in H2, so it's not a net addition for the year. And then there was, as we said, some better news on a financial cost of course from our debt. There was also some element on tax and of course this one is more uncertain and more difficult to predict for the second part of the year. But I think as always, we are building scenario for the full year. We've been including in a clear way what we see a real change in the trajectory and on which we have visibility for the second half on things where we have postponement of things with good news, but of course we still a lot of uncertainty on H2. Of course, we have to be a bit more cautious when we take them in the scenarios.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay, thanks. And then just on operating margins, you pointed to operating margins closer to the lower end of your initial guidance range of down 50 to 150 basis points for the year. Can you discuss the puts and takes impacting your margin performance in the second half?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. When you look at the margin, really things are happening as expected, I would say. So, after Q1, which was not coming as a surprise to us, we said from now on, we're going to see an improvement of the margin trajectory. We knew that inflation would still be there for the rest of the year, although in the second part of the year, we are going to be facing comparison where inflation was starting to kick in, so that's going to have some impact. But we knew that a number of other headwinds would start to abate, and here I'm talking about the disruption on the supply chain and among other things, things connected with air freight, the cost attached to the launch of ILUMA, and the fact that not everything was optimal. So, we started to see improvement in Q2 as expected, and we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of the year. And then what we see playing in Q2 that we expect to see playing in the rest of the year are the fundamental positive drivers that we have for our margin. First of all, the fact that IQOS growth is having a positive impact on our margin. We said it in the beginning, we expect a positive contribution on margin evolution for the year from the IQOS business. Remember, we have a higher gross margin rate on our consumable for IQOS. So, as we are growing IQOS, that is having a positive impact. There is no - when it comes to our smokefree business, another driver that is positive for our margin, which is ZYN, and ZYN in the US, which is also accretive to the margin. You don't see it in the organic reporting so far, but it's going to start to kick in in Q4 and we expect to have another nice positive. And then the third element that I think you see of course nicely in Q2 is our pricing power. We see today very clearly on combustible. We have some headwinds that are temporary coming from Germany and Japan on heat-not-burn, but we retained pricing power, which is positive for the long term. And these are good elements. Of course, in front of that we will keep investing and making sure that we are maximizing the growth potential, but that's really what is behind the margin development for the year. Now, on top of it, and I think we've been flying that during this quarter, we have the development of businesses that are coming with lower margin because we are buying to (sub-parties), and that is a different margin dynamic. And also, this business which we called below V1, which is in fact with reduced excise duty in Indonesia, that is coming with lower margin. It's more a technical effect, I would say. And as mentioned, without that we would've been, in fact, in the middle of the bracket that we gave the 50 to 150 negative. And again, this is not reflecting the positive contribution for ZYN. So, I would say as a summary, things are happening as expected and we start to see the fact that we have on the long term some fundamental positive drivers for our margin that I summarized.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the commentary on ZYN, certainly consistent with the very robust trends that we're seeing in the Nielsen scanner data, accelerating growth, strong market share gains. You've spoken in the past about the opportunity to offer some incremental investment for that business unit to expand the sales force, improve distribution and drive velocity. Can you just talk to us about where you are in that assessment time horizon for ZYN, please? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Vivien. Yes, ZYN is - I mean, we knew that the brand was great. I think we are seeing something that is above our initial expectation to be very clear for the time being, at the time of the acquisition of Swedish Match. There is clearly a growing awareness of this category. We see a lot of poly usage. So, you have a percentage that is fully converted, but a lot of poly usage. We talk about people discovering that they can enjoy their nicotine in moments where they cannot enjoy, whether they’re combustible cigarettes or other inhalable product. That is certainly playing. I think there is a very positive lifestyle element around the development in the US that is gathering momentum. So, that is, I think, explaining the success of ZYN, that is the icon of the category, and of course, taking today the lion's share of the growth of this nicotine pouch progression in the US. Now, that is very good news of course, because that means that we have a very dynamic business in the US. To be very clear, it's not marginal at the group level. So, you will see, and you already see in the performance, the impact of the ZYN US performance.  So, that's great to have another driver for our smoke-free performance and globally for the financial performance of the company. But it's setting the scene very well for IQOS because on top of what is successful, we're going to be able to build a very efficient commercial engine. You said it increased sales force. We’re in the making of that. It’s happening progressively. It's of course going to help both ZYN and IQOS, but that also goes very well for our capacity to develop IQOS successfully in the future in the US. We don't have a convergence of strength between ZYN and IQOS. So, to be very clear, we haven't been suddenly increasing at that stage by several hundred people to the sales force. It's happening gradually as we build the capacity for IQOS starting Q2 next year. There is other investment that we're doing in our digital capacity and digital commercial engine. Again, just the beginning. So, I don't think it is really today behind the growth that we see behind ZYN, but these are additional strengths and capacity. And again, I think we are very excited about the amazing teams that IQOS and ZYN can be in the future in the US.
Vivien Azer: That's really helpful. Thank you for that. And then just moving to the Wellness and Healthcare segment for my second question, please, understanding some of the challenges around the clinical trial, I was wondering if you could just comment on your aspiration to delever the balance sheet post the Swedish Match transaction versus the potential need for incremental M&A as you think about an ultimate $1 billion revenue target, understanding that you pushed out the date for that. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, and I want to be very clear. I mean, the focus is on deleveraging the balance sheet. We are focusing on extracting the great potential that we have in our smoke-free business. I mentioned IQOS and ZYN together. We certainly want to grow VEEV as well. But I think there is so much potential on IQOS and ZYN that it's of course the key focus today. And we are spending our time, energy on maximizing the potential there, and that's going to generate deleveraging. So, the time today is not for us to think about, I would say, a structural move on M&A in other spaces. We are very much focused on optimizing this great potential that we have in our smoke-free business today.
Vivien Azer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.
Gaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning. So, I have a question on ZYN in the US. So, the volumes are coming in much ahead of where I think consensus is where we were. We also know that US cigarette volumes have persisted at very weak rates despite easy comps. So, what do you think is the cannibalization rate of ZYN on US cigarettes today? And as you project out IQOS growth over the next seven years, if ZYN's cannibalization is higher than what is thought of, then does it mean that the cigarette universe is smaller, which implies that the IQOS opportunity is smaller?
Emmanuel Babeau: It’s, Gaurav, an excellent question. I believe - first of all, I'm not going to be able to give a precise answer, as you can imagine. I believe that there is probably some cannibalization for the reason I mentioned. We see behaviors developing of people that probably are aware, combustible user, and they discovered that they can enjoy their nicotine in a different manner, with certainly positive perception on when they can do it and the impact on them. Now, I'm not able to tell you whether this is something very material. So, I don't have any data at that stage. And I'm sure we'll try to elaborate on the ZYN driver on the 28th of September, but as I said, I'm not able to share with you any hard data on how it's materializing. Frankly, I don't think that this is going to be really relevant for IQOS because maybe in a kind of super marginal manner. But here we talk about with IQOS, smokers who want to enjoy when they are still enjoying today combustible cigarette, but different product that is mimicking very closely their pleasure, with clearly personal benefit on their health, but also on their lifestyle. So, I don't see the ZYN moment as something that is going to compete with IQOS in a meaningful manner. So, I think that that's not something that we see as a risk to undermine IQOS potential in the future.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And the second question I have is on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban. And you mentioned that there could be some volatility. Now, the experience in California has been pretty bad for - post the menthol cigarette ban, and that only 70% of the menthol smoker seems to have been retained in the cigarette market. So, like, what is the precedence? Is there any precedence of a flavored heated tobacco ban anywhere which helps you form the view that the impact will be quite minimal?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, there is, Gaurav. So, I will take two examples, one in Europe when there was the menthol - the flavor ban in May 2020, where it had minimal impact on the combustible business, very, very small. So, that's one illustration. And the other one is actually - because we talk about growing products. The other one here is the ban on flavor in California that impacted ZYN at the end of 2022. And there was a few weeks with a blip on the volume. And then the momentum came back on non-flavored product actually with even more intensity and blip has been swallowed, and you don't see today any impact of this ban. So, I think here you have two element experiences that show that this is having minimum impact. And again, we're comparing in California with growing a category, which maybe is more appropriate, but referring to combustible in Europe in May 2020, the impact was de minimis.
Gaurav Jain: Okay, sure. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Hi, Emmanuel. I wanted to circle back to your guidance with just maybe a quick follow-on question. Your full-year guidance implies, I guess, more riding on Q4. So, just hoping you could help us understand maybe your level of conviction and or visibility that your business really will strengthen so much later this year. And then, I know it’s early, and I don't expect you to guide next year, but is there anything we should think about that you’re investing in this year that really could position you for even greater growth next year and beyond?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So, Bonnie, trying to be back on H2, I think you see it already in Q2. I mean, the momentum behind IQOS is there. We see it. We estimate 1.4 million user growth in Q2. That's an excellent number. We see in-market sales going up. We know that there is seasonality, but it doesn't mean that the consumer offtake is going to decrease. There is more launch of ILUMA and some of them that happened in the end of H1 that is going to contribute as well in the second part of the year. So, we see very robust momentum there. We see the work that we've been doing and as we said, the highest intensity of price increase has happened in Q2, is going to be lower in H2. And we've been defending our market share well in a market that is resilient. And we may discuss why CC is so resilient, but the fact is that combustible is proving to be resilient in many geographies. And then there is a ZYN moment, clearly a ZYN momentum, which we're not saying we're going to keep growing at 50%, of course, but clearly we expect momentum to continue super nicely on ZYN and starting Q4 that will also contribute to the organic growth. But in any case, it's going to fully contribute to adjusted EPS growth, excluding forex. So, all that give us the confidence that we are set for a very, very good and very strong H2 in terms of performance. Now, when we look towards 2024, we believe that the growth drivers are going to stay the same. So, IQOS, with of course the launch in Q2 in the US, but let's be clear, it's going to be the beginning. So, it's not going to immediately have a huge impact. It's going to be a ramp up, as we explained, but there will be a number of countries where ILUMA will be fully delivering. Look at Japan. That's quite interesting what happened in Japan. In fact, we've seen kind of another acceleration on market share and volume one year after the launch of ILUMA. So, it's not as if the old positive impact was happening in the first weeks. I would say takes some time to create the awareness, the understanding, and the positive appreciation. And then we're going to have ZYN and nicotine pouches. ZYN, first of all, starting in the US, but a number of exciting launch outside the US as well. So, that is boding well for 2024, but of course, it's premature to talk about ’24, and we'll give guidance in due course.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That all makes sense and helpful. And then I just for my second question, I was hoping for some more color on Japan, and it looks like your shipment volume was really strong in the quarter and then your market shares increased nicely. So, could you talk through key drivers of this? And then I believe BAT is cutting their prices on glo Hyper starting in August. So, could you talk through the current competitive environment and then maybe how you expect it might change in light of these actions, as well as how you may need to respond, if at all. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So, Japan, of course, is a matter of great satisfaction. I was alluding to it, the fact that one year after the launch of ILUMA, we see a further acceleration of our market share. We are now above 26%. And as I said, that shows that the brand keeps doing inroads, converting more people, making a big difference versus competition. And we are - actually, we've seen our capture share of the growth of the category that continue to grow increasing. We have a two-tier strategy between TEREA and SENTIA that is proving to be very efficient. So, we have the premium range, TEREA, with a lot of innovation, great flavor experience. And then we have SENTIA, which is of course at the lower level in term of positioning. But with this two, I would say range, we managed to really reach the broadest possible member of ILUMA user, and that's clearly showing some great success. We are back in Japan to see freight progressively. So, that was expected. Last year, the shipments were lower than the consumer uptake. And this year, that is of course not - we're going back to the normal situation. That was absolutely planned. And we see indeed competition while trying to fight. This is a category that keeps having a lot of traction and gaining share. They are fighting to keep growing when ILUMA is clearly doing well. And so far, they believe that their way forward is to come with cheaper consumable. That's of course their decision. I won't comment on that. It's clear that despite that, we managed to grow the share. But it's good to see that there is a clear growing commitment from the whole industry behind the category in Japan.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you again.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open.
Matt Smith: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pacing of the rollout of ILUMA to 50 markets from the 23 markets where it's available today. Do you expect that to be fairly evenly spread across the second half? And could you talk about the rollout or the expansion, the impact on your operating margin in the second half, as well as your gross margin?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Matt. So, there will be a progressive difficult for me - I mean, there will be events in Q3 and Q4 of launch of ILUMA in a number of countries. It’s difficult for me to tell you whether it even spread, because I would've probably to do that depending on the size of each market, but it's going to be relatively well spread. Let’s be clear. We have already two third of the IQOS volume that are exposed or benefit from ILUMA’s presence. So, it's not marginal, but a big part of it has already been done. And as we said, at the beginning of ILUMA, we were not fully optimized on the product, on the productivity. It doesn't mean that everything will be done at the end of the year, but we expect to certainly see an acceleration of productivity, reduction in the weight in the second part of the year, and that will have a positive impact on margin evolution, absolutely in line with what I explained a number of headwinds that are receding in line with expectation. But that's really what you can expect for ILUMA in the second part of the year.
Matt Smith: That you for that. And if I could ask just a follow-up question on the combustible performance. It's been stronger in terms of both volume and organic revenue contribution, and you made a couple of comments about the demand environment holding up better than your expectation relative to the elevated pricing. Can you talk about the factors that are allowing the consumers to hold up elasticity better than your expectations? Do you expect that to continue now that you're going to lap some pricing action?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, so far, I think that we've seen that pricing, it doesn't mean that the consumer is going away. I'm not able to tell you how it's going to further evolve in the future. I think what we see globally on the combustible market is first of all, a few markets where, because of the demographic, we see the consumption of combustible going up. I could certainly mention India, probably Egypt, Turkey, probably Vietnam, even if it's not a big market for us, where we see combustible business going up. The resilience is also coming from a number of markets where there is a ban on smoke-free products. So, of course, that is to some extent protecting the combustible business. As you know, that’s clearly not something that we like. We think that it's a big mistake, but that is probably providing some resilience to the category overall. So, that would be my analogy on combustible.
Matt Smith: Thank you for that, Emmanuel. I'll pass it on.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Owen Bennett: Afternoon, Emmanuel. Hope you are well. So, related to heated competitive dynamics, so all three of your major tobacco peers now appear to be in a better spot, at least versus the past with regard to product offerings at least, and money they're investing into this. I was just wondering if you could comment on IQOS trends in some of the more competitive heated markets where all three of your major peers now have a presence. So, like (indiscernible) for example. So, how is IQOS share holding or ILUMA having less traction in these markets than others? Are you seeing trial of other brands and consumers coming back to IQOS? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Owen. Actually, you may have seen that our share of the category has remained stable in Q2 at around 75%. So, it shows that indeed there is increased competition, but the quality of IQOS and notably ILUMA, but not just ILUMA, the overall IQOS proposition, is allowing us to, even if we're more premium, to maintain our share of the category, which is very good news. Here, I'm talking about volume. You can imagine in term of value, that is even higher. Now, let's be clear. Since the beginning, we knew, and I can say we were hoping for the whole industry to embrace heat-not-burn as the category of the future for inhalable nicotine product. And it's great to see a growing commitment from all the player behind that. So, no doubt that they will come with innovation. Our self, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to innovate as well. And we will see certainly innovation and maybe new things coming in the future. Now, after six, seven, almost eight years of launch of IQOS, I think in term of franchise, in term of impact, in term of strength, in term of brand power, I think we are really second to none. And we made a clear gap and differential. And I think that this is exactly what we did with Marlboro in the past, which Marlboro was a superior product and recognized for the brand that was unique. But on top of that, we managed to create a unique brand that was extremely appealing. And I think with IQOS, that's what we are repeating today. So IQOS products are clearly better recognized as such. It's a different customer experience, but then the IQOS brand is also iconic, and people are seeing that as part of lifestyle and product they want to associate themselves with, which is a recipe for long-term success.
Owen Bennett: Cool. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jared Dinges: Yes. Hi guys. So, you talked about the ability to use sea freight finally to supply Japan as you progress throughout Q2. Would you be able to confirm that you're no longer capacity-constrained on the TEREA sticks?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So, we can confirm that for the market where we've been launching today, we have no constraint, and therefore that's the reason why we've been able to move to sea freight. Now, there is still a ramp-up for the remaining markets that do not have ILUMA today. And this ramp-up is of course, accompanying the growing capacity. So, it doesn't mean that today we could serve on the 1st of July 100% of all the market, IQOS market with I ILUMA consumable, but we have no longer pressure restriction and the fact that we are back to sea freight, and we have a plan to accompany the growth of the remaining markets in the coming months.
Jared Dinges: Got it. And maybe just to follow up on that, so you guys did call out Europe with IQOS, saw some further negative inventory move in Q2. Should we expect that to reverse in H2? Because actually it's been - on the whole, in H1 it's been somewhat sizable, the negative inventory.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. In fact, that’s - sure. In fact, that's - Japan was finishing with lower shipment volume than consumer offtake in 2022. That has been reversing in 2023. And Europe went the other way round. Remember, we had too low because of uncertainty on the availability of product and energy supply in the manufacturing site. And that was expected, but the catchup has been happening mostly in Q1, but still a little bit in Q2. And now we expect to move to normal pattern of shipment versus consumer offtake or in-market sales. And therefore, we expect to have a strong H2, both in term of shipment progression and in-market sales in Europe, back to normal. 
Jared Dinges: That's clear. And if I can just follow up just one last one. On Russia, given the news last week or this week, just can you give an update on if that business is fully ringfenced at this point?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, on Russia, we have nothing new to say. We've been explaining in the past communication that the situation was complex. There is no new element. I'm not going to comment on the situation of a company that I know nothing about. And we have nothing new to report on Russia at this stage. 
Jared Dinges: Got it. Maybe just in terms of supply, like Russia's not supplying any neighboring markets at this point, right? 
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, we are, as you can imagine, complying with all regulation, restriction, sanction today, and we are obviously fully compliant. 
Jared Dinges: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 first quarter results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation and additional net revenue data are available in the exhibit to the Form 8-K published this morning and on our Investor Relations website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such, figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Q1 performance exceeded our expectations, with strong underlying momentum from IQOS, ZYN and our combustible business. As mentioned at our full-year earnings in February, we expected this quarter to be the weakest of the year due to a confluence of transitory factors impacting our top- and bottom-line. In this context, our business delivered robust results and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 35% of total PMI, despite the impact of adverse timing factors on HTU shipments, with an increasing number of markets crossing the 50% threshold. IQOS continues to deliver strong share and user growth across its geographies, both with the blade version and ILUMA. Where launched, ILUMA’s excellent traction with both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers is boosting growth, demonstrating the dynamism and importance of our ongoing innovation. ILUMA’s progress is especially notable in the first launch market of Japan, where share growth has accelerated in recent quarters. In combustibles, accelerated pricing across a range of markets helped to deliver robust organic net revenue growth. Swedish Match delivered impressive results, with a stand-out performance from ZYN’s 47% U.S. shipment volume growth compared to the first quarter of 2022. Following an encouraging start to the year, we are well set up to deliver strong performance in 2023 including excellent top- and bottom-line growth for the remainder of the year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 organic net revenues saw robust growth of 3.2% against a very strong prior year quarter with organic growth of 9%. This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and a step-up in pricing but was partially offset by expected HTU inventory movements, which I will come back to. This organic figure does not include the excellent 14% ex-currency top-line growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by 9.6%, with combined pro forma adjusted net revenues increasing by around 4%, also excluding currency. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by 4.4% with strong combustible pricing of 7.4% partially offset by HTU dynamics in Japan and Germany, which I will come back to momentarily. We delivered Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.38, well above our previous expectations. This reflects a strong underlying delivery from our existing operations, excellent Swedish Match performance, and favorable phasing on interest costs. Compared to a record high prior year quarter, and with a number of one-off or accentuated margin headwinds from inflation, supply chain inefficiencies and timing factors as flagged previously, our adjusted diluted EPS contracted by 4.4%. Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q1 net revenues. We delivered overall adjusted net revenue growth of 4.6% on an organic shipment volume decline of 1.1%. While not included in this number, Swedish Match’s smoke-free volumes grew by an excellent 10% – adding impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing, excluding Germany and Japan HTUs, contributed 5.3 points of growth, including positive HTU pricing in a number of markets. This was partly offset by a negative 1.3 point HTU impact from Germany and Japan. The larger of the two was Germany, reflecting a full quarter of the 2022 excise tax increase for which we await a court ruling later this year. In Japan, the October 2022 excise tax increase and transition to ILUMA were also a drag on our top-line, and we expect some of this impact to phase out in the second half. While the increasing mix of HTUs in our business, at higher net revenue per unit, continues to positively impact our performance, lower shipments in Europe this quarter due to wholesaler and distributor inventory movements limited the benefit. This was also the main driver for the difference between our smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment volume growth. We expect this positive mix shift to accelerate as both smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment growth align more closely with offtake trends for the year, as they also did in 2022. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. As expected, the first quarter was impacted by peak margin headwinds at both the gross margin and adjusted operating income level. Our gross margin contracted by 0.6 percentage points due to the net impact of COGS inflation, pricing, volume, mix and productivity savings. We expect the positive elements of pricing, productivities and favorable HTU category mix to increasingly compensate and ultimately outweigh inflation as we progress through the year. Supply chain disruption and the accelerated transition of consumers and our business to ILUMA accounted for a further 0.6 percentage points impact. We anticipate these items to abate as we progress with ILUMA launches and gain efficiencies in our supply chain, including a return to sea freight. In addition, specific cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, impacted our gross margin by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter. Despite these exceptional Q1 dynamics, we continue to forecast the full-year 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business to be favorable as inventory movements and ILUMA-related factors dissipate. Therefore, and as explained previously, we expect a progressive improvement in our gross profit and OI margins, notably weighted towards H2 as headwinds subside and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. At around 26% of adjusted net revenues, our Q1 SG&A costs are at a similar ratio to the full-year 2022. However, as expected there was a notable increase compared to Q1, 2022 given lower commercial spend at the beginning of last year, the inflationary environment, cost phasing, and front-loaded commercial investments. Our successful cost efficiencies program continues to deliver, enabling ongoing investment and helping to mitigate inflation, with $150 million of gross savings realized in Q1 of which almost $50 million were from SG&A. Importantly, we expect a significant slow-down in SG&A growth to a level below the rate of net revenue growth for the remainder of the year -- which will support OI margin improvement. This brings me to the outlook for 2023. Our robust Q1 performance supports visibility on strong full year growth. We continue to expect 7% to 8.5% organic top-line progression, with a targeted acceleration in HTU shipment volume growth versus 2022. As detailed in this morning’s press release, our other operating assumptions remain unchanged, and we remind you that our organic metrics do not include the contribution from Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Our updated full year adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $6.10 to $6.22 includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 30 cents. Positive estimated impacts from the Euro and a number of other currencies are outweighed mainly by the weakness of the Japanese Yen, as well as the significant depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the Egyptian Pound. This range continues to reflect 7% to 9% currency-neutral growth and does not include any contribution from a potential favorable excise tax ruling in Germany, which we would expect to add around 3 points to our adjusted diluted EPS related to 2023 tax payments. We continue to expect Swedish Match to be low single-digit accretive to our 2023 adjusted diluted EPS after financing, and for an increase of around $200 million in our non-acquisition related interest costs, despite a relatively modest increment in Q1. As discussed at full-year earnings in February, this year’s bottom-line results are expected to be notably H2-weighted. However, we expect our organic net revenue growth to already accelerate in the second quarter into the high single-digits. We forecast second quarter HTU shipment volumes of between 30 and 32 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.42 to $1.47, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 13 cents. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect close to double-digit organic top-line growth and a return to margin expansion. Looking at our full-year forecast through a different lens, after the temporary headwinds in Q1 we expect very strong performance for the remainder of the year. Despite ongoing margin headwinds and investments, we expect organic top-line growth of 8% to 10%, improving margins with expansion in H2 and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the strong underlying drivers of our transformation, with IQOS and ZYN driving volumes at a higher net revenue per unit, combined with stepped-up pricing on combustibles. Turning back to our Q1 results, our HTU adjusted IMS volumes grew by an estimated 16%, demonstrating continued strong growth momentum. HTU shipment volumes of 27.4 billion units were toward the higher end of our forecast range, with growth of 10.4%, which was well below actual offtake trends as anticipated, due to distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As implied by our full-year HTU shipment forecast, we expect the rate of shipment growth to accelerate for the rest of the year as shipments converge with consumer offtake, and to grow at a faster pace in 2023 than in 2022. Before detailing these inventory impacts, it's important to note that in certain markets, such as Germany, IMS sales volumes are not measured at the point of distributor sales to the retail trade, as the data is not available. In these cases we instead use our shipments as the proxy. This means that shipment fluctuations can impact both IMS volumes and reported market share, and may not be representative of offtake dynamics. Given the volatility seen over this quarter and from now on, where there is a significant difference between estimated offtake performance and IMS data, we may choose to provide market share metrics based on adjusted IMS to better reflect offtake, where adjustments reflect the total estimated impact of distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As you may note in the appendix to today’s earnings release this is the case for Germany this quarter, where we also provide historical figures. Coming back to Q1, HTU shipment volumes in several European markets were below consumer offtake. This is explained by the reversal of some inventory build-ups at the end of Q4, 2022 to meet the needs of ILUMA launches, as mentioned at our full-year results in February, and also to create some safety stock to mitigate the risk of production and distribution constraints due to energy shortages. As anticipated, we were able to adjust this safety stock in Q1 as the risk receded. We also decreased the level of IQOS blade HTU inventories in several markets to reduce the risk of obsolete stock given the rapid transition to ILUMA. Notably impacted markets include Italy and Germany, where underlying market share and offtake trends remained strong. Italian Q1 IMS volumes grew by 21% compared to the prior year, with market share increasing from 15.4% in Q4 to 17.4% in Q1. In Germany, adjusted Q1 IMS volumes increased over 30% from the prior year with adjusted market share up from 4.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1. Now turning back to the overall picture, while total Q1 cigarette and HTU shipment volumes declined by 1.1%, our total IMS volumes were essentially stable and grew excluding total estimated inventory movements. Our cigarette shipments declined by 3.1%, with resilient trends in many markets. The decline includes a notable impact from a high prior year comparison in Japan and the introduction of an abrupt excise tax increase in Pakistan, resulting in an increase in illicit trade and an industry contraction of over 30%. Volumes also declined in the Philippines following industry pricing, with consumer purchasing power facing ongoing pressure. We continue to target stable to positive combined cigarette and HTU shipment volumes for the year, following growth in 2021 and 2022. This notably does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 10% in Q1. Most importantly, the exciting growth combination of IQOS and ZYN presents an unrivalled platform for growth over the coming years. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust Q1 organic net revenue growth of 3%. This reflects strong pricing of 7.4% with a step-up across many markets including Germany, Indonesia, and the Philippines. With over 80% of planned 2023 combustible pricing implemented or announced, we have good visibility on the full year delivery, although some of the positive Q1 variance reflects earlier pricing compared to 2022. We now forecast a full-year variance of 6% to 7%. Our cigarette category share declined by 0.3 percentage points in Q1, which was essentially all attributable to geographic mix as the total industry declined in large volume markets such as the Philippines and Pakistan. The impact of share movements within markets was neutral, with gains including Egypt, Poland, and Turkey offset by declines in markets such as Ukraine, the Philippines, and Iraq. Importantly, we continue to target a stable category share in 2023 and over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Moving now to our smoke-free products, we estimate there were 25.8 million IQOS users as of March 31st. This represents growth of close to 1 million adult users since December with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. IQOS ILUMA has been a positive catalyst for volume and share growth across a broad range of launch markets, both supporting our strong position in the heat-not-burn category with a superior user experience, and fostering further category growth. For existing IQOS users, ILUMA drives an accelerated upgrade cycle. This enhances retention and full conversion for the future, with a temporary margin impact from concentrated device sales. Indeed, we are now approaching an estimated 10 million ILUMA users with ILUMA taking over 85% of HTU volumes in the first launch markets of Japan, Switzerland, and Spain. ILUMA is also enabling better acquisition and conversion of legal-age smokers, with market share acceleration visible in both earlier and more recently launched markets such as Italy and Korea. Since the introduction in these two markets in Q4, we are seeing encouraging trends in initial launch areas and expect this to be increasingly visible at the national level over time as it is in Japan and Greece, after a seasonal inflection in the latter. Our main focus in Q1 was on ensuring the success of ILUMA in the 16 markets launched by the end of 2022, which cover over half of our IQOS business by volumes. In addition, we launched ILUMA on a limited basis in Indonesia in February via our IQOS club members program. The IQOS club was introduced in 2019 and now has over 100 thousand estimated users across 10 cities, with a notable boost from the launch of ILUMA. We expect to progressively launch ILUMA in more markets this year. With ILUMA accelerating IQOS growth where launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present with a record high share of 9.0% in Q1. Impressively, as of Q1 PMI HTUs are now the number one nicotine brand in 10 markets with the addition of Italy and Greece during the quarter. Focusing now on Europe, which under our new regional structure includes additional markets such as Ukraine. Our first quarter HTU share increased by 1.7 points to reach 9.2% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, adjusted for estimated wholesaler and distributor inventory movements, such as those I mentioned earlier in Germany and Italy. On the same adjusted basis, IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 11.1 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong progress across the region. We expect our Europe HTU volumes to grow strongly in the remainder of the year while, as in the past, our quarterly HTU share of market can be impacted by seasonality of cigarette consumption during Q2 and Q3. To give some further color on our outstanding progress in the region, slide 16 shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe including markets with and without ILUMA. Notable stand-outs include Budapest with over 35% offtake share as well as Rome and Athens reaching the high twenties. To my earlier comments, we are very pleased with performance in Germany, where offtake share in Munich surpassed 10% for the first time. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in Greece where the Ministry of Health approved differentiated health claims for heated tobacco products. Greece is the first country outside of the United States that permitted healthrelated statements following a robust scientific assessment. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents over 35% of total tobacco with IQOS driving category growth. The acceleration seen in recent quarters continued in Q1. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points to 26.2% with offtake share surpassing 32% in Tokyo and 30% in Sendai. Adjusted IMS volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.0 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Strong performance in Japan further highlights the importance of continuous innovation and a broad consumable portfolio. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow through Q1, strengthening their position as the two largest heat-not-burn brands. We are delighted with the progress in Japan and as we look forward to further robust volume growth in the coming quarters, we would also like to remind you of the seasonality impact on quarterly share metrics. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which are now approaching 30% of our total HTU volumes. This slide highlights a selection of Q1 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Notable successes include Bulgaria with Sofia offtake share of over 16% and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo reached 7.5%. We also continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets. Now moving on to Swedish Match’s business, which delivered an excellent Q1 performance with currency-neutral net revenue growth of 14% and smoke-free products comprising 77% of total net revenues. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of ZYN in the U.S. with 47% volume growth to 73 million cans. While volume growth benefited from inventory movements, including restocking in California following the December flavor ban, underlying growth in volumes was very strong, estimated well above 30%. We are also pleased with the Q1 performance in other U.S smoke-free categories, including moist snuff which gained 0.8 percentage points category share and delivered shipment volume growth of 3%. The smoke-free category in Scandinavia continued to grow driven by nicotine pouches, albeit at a slower rate following January snus excise tax increases in Sweden and Norway, with destocking accentuating the volume decline for Swedish Match’s premium-skewed snus portfolio. In cigars, the business delivered positive pricing and robust shipment volume growth of 4% in a declining category driven by the strong development of natural leaf varieties. Finally, I would like to congratulate Swedish Match’s employees for continuing to deliver excellent results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities. The integration is progressing very well and we look forward to sharing more on our combined growth plans later this year. Now let’s examine ZYN’s recent U.S. performance in more detail. Superb progress continues with a record increase in 12-month rolling shipment volumes of 23 million cans, which equates to 40% growth. Category volume share remained essentially stable despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly, retail value share for ZYN also remains strong at 75.6%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity. There are two key engines driving the U.S. growth of ZYN, as covered at CAGNY. First is the progressive increase in distribution, with the number of stores 13% higher than Q1, 2022 at around 140,000. There remains ample opportunity to further increase this over time. Second are velocities, or the number of cans sold per store per week. ZYN velocities continue to grow sequentially and by an impressive 21% compared to prior year as the brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine users. Now, let me update you on our exciting plans to further accelerate our smoke-free journey. As previously mentioned, the full global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority. We are on track to make substantial progress this year as HTU manufacturing constraints continue to ease. We continue to work on our IQOS U.S. commercialization plans for launch in Q2 2024, in line with the principles outlined at the recent CAGNY conference. With the benefit of the expertise and commercial tools from launching IQOS successfully in over 70 international markets, and a U.S. market with a clear regulatory framework and the ability to communicate with adult smokers, we remain very positive about the opportunity. Importantly, we believe we can make the necessary investments in the U.S. business, generating additional top-line performance while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI during the investment period. In addition to our premium offerings, we are continuing to focus on BONDS, our latest heat-not-burn innovation that is especially relevant for Low and Middle-Income consumers. Pilot launches in the Philippines and Colombia are progressing well and we intend to continue taking the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Another key mid-term opportunity from the Swedish Match combination is the international expansion of nicotine pouches, notably with ZYN -- the world’s leading brand. At CAGNY I mentioned we are targeting up to ten launches or relaunches this year as we look to develop the category with adult smokers who value the convenience, specific use occasions, taste, and satisfaction. We expect this to commence in a few markets this summer, including both developed and emerging countries. While staying clearly focused on the heat-not-burn and nicotine pouch categories, which present the largest and most accretive growth opportunities, we are adjusting our VEEV e-vapor portfolio and approach. We intend to focus on commercializing in select markets and prioritizing profitability given the known category challenges. VEEV ONE is a new pod-based system providing an enhanced user experience with fully outsourced manufacturing of devices and consumables to optimize costs. VEEV ONE will replace the current VEEV product and, as a result, we no longer intend to file a PMTA for the former technology. Instead, we will focus our near-term FDA engagements on IQOS and ZYN. We will come back on future e-vapor FDA authorizations in due course. For disposables, the fastest growing e-vapor segment, we are rebranding VEEBA to VEEV NOW. All of our e-vapor products will now be under the single, recognizable brand VEEV for a seamless consumer experience. We will introduce the new VEEV ONE platform in Canada later this month and will apply an agile and disciplined approach for further VEEV roll-outs later this year. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2022 Integrated Report published earlier this month, which outlines the progress we are making towards achieving our purpose and smoke-free future. The report provides a comprehensive run-through of all our most material sustainability topics. This includes those in focus for investors such as post-consumer waste, youth access prevention, decarbonization, and our resource allocation towards advancing our smoke-free transformation. In conjunction with the Integrated Report, we also published an updated ESG KPI Protocol providing even more robust criteria on how we define success and measure ESG performance. It focuses on the KPIs included in our Sustainability Index, which as outlined in our 2023 proxy statement continue to represent 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. I am also proud to announce that we released our first TCFD Report yesterday, which updates and compiles our previous disclosures on how we are implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in one document. This will be an important topic for many companies as reporting regulations evolve. Lastly, we are also pleased that, following CDP’s triple A recognition, PMI was again included in CDP’s supplier engagement leaderboard, contributing towards achieving our scope 3 ambitions. To conclude today’s presentation, we are on track for strong performance in 2023 despite margin headwinds. Our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong, and we expect these headwinds to progressively ease through the year. Indeed, we delivered higher-than-expected Q1 results which put us on-track for the third consecutive year of high single-digit organic net revenue growth. Continued excellent IQOS and ZYN performance further enhances our position as the global smoke-free champion with leadership positions in the largest category of heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine. We are taking action through pricing in combustibles and our cost savings initiatives to recover cost inflation, as we progress rapidly toward our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business. Finally, we remain a highly cash generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you. We are now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I guess, I have a question on your guidance as it relates to Q2, it does now seem to be a bit lighter implying a lot more of the growth is now expected to be in the back half. So just trying to get a sense of how conservative your Q2 guide might be? And then really, Emmanuel, how much visibility and confidence you have that your business really can accelerate and outperform the second half? Maybe you could highlight for us some of the key puts and takes that give you this confidence and maybe where you see the greatest potential upside and also just color on [Indiscernible]
Emmanuel Babeau: Okay. No, sure, Bonnie, happy to do that. And I guess, thanks for the question, because that helps me clarify certainly the phasing of the profit generation this year. I think we are not coming with any different method from what we said back in February. We always said that we would be facing in the first-half of the year a number of headwinds on profitability that there would be some inventory movement playing. We highlighted that and we clearly said there will be margin improvement coming in the second part of the year and we are coming today exactly with the same message. We are pleased to have a Q1 that is above our initial expectation. We never gave guidance until today on Q2, but I think what we're seeing today on Q2 is coming with a lot of positives. We are explaining that we do expect an acceleration of the top line. We are talking about high single-digit growth that we are targeting for the second quarter and that's of course going to be a very nice contribution to the performance in the second quarter. That is highlighting the momentum that we have on the business that we see behind IQOS that is not capturing the ZYN growth for the second quarter. So ZYN is just coming in addition to this organic growth. So I think it gives an idea of how nicely up and running and dynamic is our business. Now in terms of margin, it is true that again in Q2, we're going to have a number of headwinds and notably at the level of the gross margin. So we're going to continue to have a number of impacts coming from inflation. This is going to be progressively corrected, but I think you should expect another quarter with a gross margin rate declining in a material manner versus 2022. And then the second part of the year will be still showing improvement again in line with our initial thought. Where I guess you're going to start seeing in terms of margin evolution some more positive impact, this is on the revenue -- sorry, SG&A to revenue ratio where we have seen a deterioration in Q1. I think I'm not saying that we will have SG&A growing at a lower pace than revenue in Q2, but I expect the growth of SG&A in Q2 to be closer to the revenue and therefore that will weight less on the operating income margin. But that's really what you should expect in terms of sequence for the year. Again, we expect very nice acceleration for the top line just confirming the nice momentum that we are experiencing in the business and we have this ramp-up on the margin that is coming progressively. It's going to show up first at the level of the SG&A on revenue. And in H2, we are expecting as we said a better evolution of the gross margin rate. So far, we're just confirming initial expectations.
Bonnie Herzog: No. That's super helpful and just sounds like you've got some pretty good visibility. So that's yes definitely helpful. And then, I guess, just maybe a quick high level question on the health of the consumer in, sort of, your key markets. If you could kind of touch on that for us? And then in the context of that, you've certainly been putting in a stronger combustible cig pricing. So just love to hear a little more color on how the consumer has been responding to those actions and really how confident you are that you're going to be able to continue to push through that pricing for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. I'm not going to say that we don't see any pressure on the consumer in the world. It is quite obvious and of course you are not talking about the U.S., which -- maybe you could deserve a separate comment. But it is clear that in countries such as the Philippines, for instance, we see some impact on the business coming from purchasing power. I think we see some of that as well in Indonesia. So they are markets where there was already some pressure on purchasing power particularly leading to some downtrading and that has continued to play as we progress through the beginning of 2023. But I have to say that in many markets, we haven't seen clear signs so far. We have to stay very cautious of course of pressure on the consumer all your massive downtrading. We don't see that. The Marlboro market share was a bit down, but I don't think that is clearly reflecting at that stage a pressure on the premium product of our portfolio. And we've been increasing price as you have seen in a very significant manner. Of course, competition not immediately or not totally responding to our price increase that can have an impact on our market share, but I would say so far, we have the feeling that in a highly inflationary environment, the consumer is ticking as normal and is not seeing as an issue to see also price increase on his tobacco product.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thanks for that color, Emmanuel. I appreciate it.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.
Gaurav Jain: So the first question I have -- good morning, so the first question I have is on FX. So in February, you had guided for a $0.15 headwind. Now it is $0.30, Egyptian pound had depreciated by Jan. And then, yes, yen has gone down a bit, but euro, which is a much bigger currency for you, is up also a bit more than that. So ruble can't be that big, right? Or is it becoming bigger this year versus last year? So could you just help us explain the effect.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Gaurav. So I think you rightly pointed to the ruble actually, if you are not going to disclose currency by currency, but if you look at the ruble, just the ruble is more than the net impact of $0.30 that today we are anticipating for the year. So I think it shows a very strong impact of the ruble. And the Egyptian pound continue to devaluate after January. So it's -- I'm not sure we had the full impact of the Egyptian pound. And actually, if you accumulate ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have 80% of the net impact of $0.30, it’s a net impact. Don't get me wrong because you have also the yen that is quite negative. And then you have the euro and a number of other categories that is positive. But I think with the ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have a pretty good explanation of the net impact. I hope it's helpful.
Gaurav Jain: Okay, sure. And second, the U.S. cigarette volumes industry level are quite weak, minus 9%. And then looking at the European data that you shared, it is -- the industry volumes are flat on what were already very strong comps. And the reasons what have been mentioned for the U.S. industry weakness, which is macro, weak consumer, stimulus payments going off, disposable e-cigarette growth, I could apply the same logic to EU consumer -- EU smoker and still the volumes are so much better than trend. So is there a -- can you explain like why are the U.S. smoker and EU smoker, why are they behaving so differently?
Emmanuel Babeau: Gaurav, I cannot -- and I will have to consider that I'm not the greatest specialist of the U.S. consumer for combustible cigarettes. So I wonder myself to given an analysis. I think it's in line with my previous comment on the fact that so far, we have been a pretty good resistance from the consumer to same price increase and coping with inflation in Europe. I'm not able to tell you why there is a difference here. We know that the social model in Europe is different. You may have some more protection, some more safety needs that are playing and maybe limiting the impact of inflation. There was maybe more compensation given from various government on trying to fight again energy price increase and sometimes compensating of agricultural product inflation across a number of geographies. So that can be one element to explain why the European consumer is resisting better. But I'm not going to pretend that I have the perfect answer to your question.
Gaurav Jain: Okay, thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Pamela.
Pamela Kaufman: I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit more on your SG&A investment for this year? What are the key areas that you are investing behind and the step up in that investment in Q1? I guess how much of this reflects structural increases in inflation driving higher costs versus incremental investment that you're making behind ILUMA and your Health and Wellness and Swedish Match businesses?
Emmanuel Babeau: Again, I'm going to try to go as far as I can, as you can imagine, some of that is super sensitive, so we're not going to share in detail what we are investing and where. First of all, trying to give you perspective for the full-year, we believe we're going to have our SG&A growing faster than revenue organically. But nevertheless, we expect a limited discrepancy between the two. So that means that as we progress through 2023, you should expect the growth of our SG&A to converge with the top line growth, I'm speaking here organic. And Q1 is really, I would say, impacted by a number of one-off both, by the way, on the basis of comparison, if you look at our Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 numbers last year, sequentially, you will see that Q1 was very low, both because we did not invest at the same moment of the year. So there is a phasing in investment and also because there was some one-off positive last year, so don't take Q1 as a reference. Having said that, we are facing inflation, of course, in our SG&A. It's a lot of people cost. And of course, we are increasing salaries. But we're also indeed generating some efficiency. So that is giving us some leeway to invest on our priority. It's about, of course, commercial investment on our priority, as you can expect. So it's everything on marketing commercial to boost IQOS. That is, of course, a big driver. It is the investment that we are making to prepare the U.S. We talk about the investment that we are making in Wellness and Healthcare. We continue to innovate a lot. We have innovation in the pipe for all our smoke-free product. And of course, that is also having some impact. So that is really what is driving this growth, and we continue to see as important this capacity that we have to cope with inflation, to invest for the future and at the same time, to have an SG&A evolution that thanks to the dynamism of the business is allowing us to still generate nice operating income and net profit growth. That's what I can share with you.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk about your change in your e-cig strategy? What prompted your strategy towards IQOS view? And how are you thinking about the category over the long-term and your participation in it?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, I think we've already been clear that while we were clearly developing some offering on the vaping category, this was not our priority. We had IQOS. And now I would say we are even more taken by two priorities, which are IQOS and ZYN. When you have such a fantastic team and the potential that they have to deliver very strong top line growth, volume growth, revenue growth and in a very nicely profitable fashion, that's really the priority. I guess you listened to us at CAGNY and we expressed the questioning that we have on the vaping category today, which are around the absence of clear regulation in many country. The fact that, that is giving way to an appropriate marketing activities, risk of underage consumption. And also the fact that this is a category where so far it's difficult. I'm not saying impossible, but difficult to see a lot of profitable model being developed. And therefore, that is pushing us to look at that and continue to work on this category and the fact that we are coming with this evolution of the range, I think, is just in line with the fact that the technology is evolving. We see the customer needs evolving as well, that's why we are developing VEEV now. But we're going to be focused. So it's not going to be across geography. It's going to be where the vaping category is relevant. It's going to be where we have a differentiation where we have the commercial strength to make an impact. And I think it is a much better strategy to do that, develop a few successes instead of exhausting ourselves in trying to develop something global today, when we don't see necessarily the ingredient of the driver for that to happen in an interesting manner, both in terms of growth, top line and bottom line progression.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. That’s very helpful.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So my first question is a follow-up to Gaurav's, please. In terms of your current FX outlook, does that contemplate another devaluation of the Egyptian pound, because my understanding is that's pretty well expected at this point?
Emmanuel Babeau: So it does not because, of course, we don't have any idea of what it could be, when it could happen. So these are really an average that we take on the spot in the day before the announcement and not taking any kind of forward-looking or whatever consensus for currency evolution. You have a lot of people today that believe that the euro is set for a nice wide against the dollar in the coming months. Frankly, we're not betting on any kind of possible evolution, but really just working on the spot.
Vivien Azer: Okay. That's fair. I understand you're not in the business of predicting currency. It just seems like this is tied to the IMS bailout. So it seems reasonable to that. My follow-up question then is on the Swedish Match margins, which came in quite nicely. I was just curious, given the incremental inventory benefit that you saw in California, like how should we think about the 1Q margin in context of a normalized margin? Was there an incremental margin benefit that we should be backing out mentally as we think about what the appropriate level of profitability is for that business? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, Vivien, I think what I can share with you is that I believe Q1 is just the bright confirmation of what we said, i.e., Swedish Match is coming with a very nicely accretive impact to the PMI growth. It is true for the volume, it is true for the revenue, and it is true for the profitability. So indeed, ZYN growing in the U.S. very nicely, and I don't come back on this north of 30% growth without the impact of California. That is driving a business that is nicely profitable, that is itself accretive to the Swedish Match average business. And therefore, of course, to PMI. And it is just very good news to have this engine for growth. Frankly, I mean, I don't want to repeat myself, but IQOS and ZYN together, that just a very exciting pair, and ZYN is coming as a very nice top line and margin enhancement role, and we expect that to continue.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrei Condrea: Hi, Emmanuel, thanks for taking my question.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Andrei.
Andrei Condrea: Hi have -- two from me, please, if you don't mind. Firstly, on the input cost inflation side of things. Obviously, your ILUMA margins will have efficiencies coming online later this year. But in terms of the other headwinds you flagged, leaf and acetate tow is there any color what you can give on just how big these headwinds are?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, they are very material, but we flagged that. And I think once again, we explained that in Q1, and we expect that to continue in Q2. This big increase in energy price, leaf price, acetate tow is going to be the biggest driver for the pressure on the gross margin. Now as we enter the second-half of the year and notably towards the end of the year, we believe that these elements will be -- well, first of all, will be facing already with some of the bad news in H2. So of course, the period-on-period comparison will be, of course, easier. And then we keep working on productivity. We may keep working on our COGS to see all optimization. So this negative pressure and nothing is going to disappear, but it's going to ease versus what we are experiencing in H1. But I would expect in Q2, the pressure to remain very strong at that level.
Andrei Condrea: That's very clear. Thank you. And my second question is a bit more long-term. Obviously, we saw one of your peers come out with a new product at the Investor Day for the nicotine pouch space for the U.S. And at the same time, your other peers bringing the European product in. Is there a scope for a similar innovation for ZYN, given the criticism -- well, rather than drawback it has -- it being of a much drier product versus the -- yes.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, I believe that with Swedish Match, we have the biggest specialist, super-focused, knowledgeable player of the oral nicotine category. So we've been adding to that amazing skill, the 13 -- you may remember that we bought this company that is specialized in formulation of product some of them, including nicotine, and that can also come with very nice innovation in the form factors. So you should expect us. Of course, don't expect me to come down with detail, but you should certainly expect us to come with nice innovation. There is certainly the appetite in some area from the consumer to try new things, new [Indiscernible] with product to develop this oral nicotine category in other spaces, probably the consumer doesn't know as well what can be done, so it's for us, it's our duty to come and make some proposal. But I guess you can expect us, and I think we demonstrate that PMI and now in the PMI per Swedish Match to be leading innovation in this category as well in the future.
Andrei Condrea: Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Matt Smith of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matt Smith: Hi, thank you for the question.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Matt.
Matt Smith: The incremental number of IQOS users stepped up in the first quarter to about 900 million additional users on a sequential basis. Can you provide more details regarding the favorable conversion trends you've seen behind ILUMA? And should we expect IQOS user growth to accelerate in the second-half as ILUMA capacity improves and you expand the geographical footprint of the product?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you. So yes, we are close to 1 million additional IQOS user in Q1. It's a nice number. It's not something that we can beat. I think that there is opportunity to further accelerate as we continue in Q2 and beyond. But first of all, I would like to have a few words of cautiousness. It's not a scientific number, that's an estimate, and that can have some variation depending on the number of elements. But I think, directionally, it is correct, and I think it shows the very strong momentum of IQOS. It is confirmed, of course, by the consumer offtake that we've been describing. It is clear that ILUMA is helping this conversion. So what we see with ILUMA is a higher capacity to convince smokers, because it is a more seamless experience. There is no cleaning. It is even closer the ritual of the combustible cigarettes. The overall experience is more satisfying. So the abandonment rate is lower. And of course, we talk about net user acquisition, so that is also helping. We have very nice progression of the consumer satisfaction in all countries. That is -- I guess, probably supporting the lower abandonment. So it is clear that the more we go for ILUMA, the more we are in the capacity to accelerate conversion. Japan, I think -- I mean, we're coming with a number in Japan and you can build the history. I think Japan is providing a lot of interesting information, because it took some time. I mean the acceleration that we have since Q3 in Japan is quite spectacular, frankly, and probably goes beyond our expectation. But it shows that ILUMA is probably -- gradually getting traction with, I don't know, it's a word of mouth. And -- but the consumer is realizing that this is making a big impact. And frankly, the acceleration of the market share to north of 26%, and I'm not talking about Tokyo, but average Japanese market share is a significant acceleration. It started in Q4, but it accelerated, and it's one year after the launch. So it shows that not everything is happening in the first quarter of the launch. I think we're showing a number of chart here showing that. And that bodes well for a nice ramp up in the coming quarters as not only do we have to start to launch ILUMA in a number of countries, but we know that this positive effect will spread over the coming quarters. So we take that as a nice driver for user acquisition growth in the coming quarters.
Matt Smith: Yes. Thank you for that detail. And a follow-up on a comment you mentioned on the call about maintaining profit growth in the U.S. as you launch IQOS. Can you talk about the investment needs in the U.S. to support commercialization? And how the $75 million or so of investment here in 2023 against this begins to build out the infrastructure necessary for a broader IQOS launch?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Well, that's the additional investment. But of course, we are already starting with some investment in the U.S. We'll come at the time of the Investor Day in September with detailed plan on how we intend to grow IQOS in the U.S. And at that time, of course, we share much more color on the level of investment that we believe is going to be necessary. I think the important message, because we have a lot of questions here is the fact that, yes, of course, in order to express what we think is a great potential of IQOS in the U.S., investment will be needed. By the way, we've been investing to build this phenomenal business for IQOS in Japan and Europe. I mean we've been investing. It didn't come by chance. So we will invest in the U.S. But what we are seeing is that, given the growth momentum that we have in the business, we think that investing in the U.S. behind IQOS will, first of all, provide even more momentum on the top line and that we can absorb this investment, while continuing to grow the bottom line very nicely. We're not ready to compromise on bottom line growth because of investment that we need to make in the U.S. If I want to repeat something that I said already, I think the question mark will be, what is the differential that we can generate between top line growth and bottom line growth? Remember, the last algorithm was 5% and 9%, above 5%, above 9%. Well, if we increase more than 5% the gross rate perspective, it doesn't mean that we're going to keep a 4 points of difference between top line growth and bottom line growth. That's the sense of the comments. I hope it's helpful.
Matt Smith: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jared Dinges: Yes. Hi, guys. I want to ask about ZYN growth in the U.S., which seemed to actually accelerate in the offtake data, despite the base continuing to grow, and it's actually pretty sizable now. Do you think there's any benefit there from the investments that you started to make as part of your IQOS preparation in terms of building out maybe a sales network? Are you also increasing SG&A investments in ZYN alone? I'm just thinking of this in the context of the brand is getting bigger, we're seeing the cigarette data has clearly been very weak, but yet the trend continues to do very well. So just trying to understand what's really driving that?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Jared, for the question. Well, first of all, yes, we are, of course, extremely pleased with the performance of ZYN in the U.S. And I want to pay a tribute to the work that the team is doing there, which is absolutely fantastic. No, I don't think that there is yet a sizable impact coming from our investment in the U.S. I think it's being developed on the merit of the great commercial plan and action. The brand has amazing traction. I think that it's extremely highly regarded by the consumer premium brand, a very nice franchise. And they are building on these two drivers, as explained, one geography. The other one is consumption per store. We just show that two things. One, of course, we have enriched the full geographical coverage. And that's where probably in the coming quarters, you will see some acceleration as we're going to put more feet in the street and more capacity to visit retail stores. And the other thing is that there is a growing knowledge, understanding and appetite for the category and for ZYN that epitomes the category, and that's what we are seeing. So, so far, no really increased investment behind the natural increase when you have such a nice growth, of course, increase investment year-on-year. So we do increase investment in the U.S., but nothing, kind of, at the stage accelerated plan and not yet impact coming from investment on IQOS that should come in the future.
Jared Dinges: Perfect. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Hello and thanks for squeezing me in. Emmanuel, I was hoping that we could touch on your cash flow performance in the quarter a little bit. It sounds like the weakness was somewhat related to timing factors, because 1Q is seasonally your weakest. But if you could just walk us through sort of what the drivers for that negative cash flow from operations figure.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, absolutely. So indeed, Q1 has not been great in terms of cash flow performance. But that was, again, expected. That is linked with the timing of shipments, excise duty payment and some of the working capital. And there was nothing surprising. I mean, I would prefer to see higher operating cash generation in Q1, but that was expected. And we are absolutely confirming the objective for the year of an operating cash flow between $10 billion to $11 billion.
Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Okay. And then just a housekeeping item. Can you give us the pro forma leverage, including the benefit of Swedish Match, for a full-year versus the reported numbers that were in the release?
Emmanuel Babeau: No, I don't think it was in the release. I don't know whether we'll communicate that. But I mean, you can come to it. I'm not sure to understand fully what your question I think you have the data to calculate things, but you can come back to us and we'll see whether we can show where the information is available.
Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Sure. I think that the sequential increase in leverage, if you put in a full-year's benefit of Swedish Match, just closer to about 0.2 of a turn versus the higher figure that was reported directionally.
Emmanuel Babeau: No, I think you're alluding to the fact that we concluded 2022 saying, well, we are around 2.9 times, but of course, that would be lower and significantly lower. And maybe about what you are seeing here, if you were to take the full-year of Swedish Match.
Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: You’re most welcome.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you all for joining today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2022 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for the smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly-comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022 and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, James and welcome everyone. We had a remarkable year for our smoke-free transformation in 2022. Despite the exceptional challenges of the war in Ukraine, severe supply-chain disruptions and global inflation, we delivered very strong financial performance and took two major strategic strides towards a smoke-free future. I would like to express my deepest thanks to all my colleagues who spared no effort to drive excellent business results during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts also continue to be with those affected by the war in Ukraine and the recent tragedy in Turkey and Syria. In 2022, PMI delivered its second consecutive year of total volume growth, reflecting continued IQOS progress and broadly stable cigarette volumes. Full-year smoke-free net revenues reached almost one third of total PMI and over 50% in 17 markets. This is impressive progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by net revenues in 2025. IQOS outstanding results continued with over 21% full-year growth in both shipment volumes and in market sales excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects broad-based momentum in the European Union Region, Japan and emerging markets. IQOS ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth in its launch markets with upgrades from existing users and new user acquisition outperforming our initial expectations. The success is supported by the increasing deployment of a two-tier heated tobacco units portfolio providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high quality alternatives to cigarettes. In combustibles, we delivered a robust performance with a 3.7% growth in organic net revenues and 0.3 percentage points higher share of segment excluding Russia and Ukraine despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free products. We also achieved two critical strategic milestones this year, reaching an agreement to take full control of IQOS in the U.S. in 2024 and successfully completing the acquisition of Swedish Match. These achievements will accelerate our smoke-free journey and further position us to lead the transformation of the wider industry. Clearly currency headwinds were extremely strong and weighed on our U.S.s dollar performance but although volatility remains, I am pleased that they seem to significantly abate in 2023. Overall, 2022 was a pivotal year and we look forward with confidence to 2023 and beyond. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for the coming year. With the acquisition of Swedish Match and securing the rights to IQOS in the U.S., we are now a global smoke-free champion. The addition of the world's biggest market and the leading nicotine pouch brand ZYN alongside IQOS provides us with significant untapped opportunities to further accelerate the growth of smoke-free products. As the strength of our IQOS business continues to grow rapidly, the full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority and we expect to make substantial progress on this in 2023. The success of ILUMA in launch market so far demonstrates the importance of groundbreaking consumer-centric innovation and we continue to broaden our portfolio with new science backed offerings. This includes BONDS by IQOS, our latest heat-not-burn device aimed at low and middle-income adult smokers. Pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines in the last quarter of last year show encouraging early results and we intend to take the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Following a successful first three years of partnership with KT&G, we also recently extended our long-term s their innovative smoke-free portfolio outside South Korea. I am very pleased to welcome Swedish Match to the PMI family. In particular, the fast-growing potential of ZYN is an incredibly exciting addition to our company. We are focused on supporting the Swedish Match team to continue and accelerate ZYN's outstanding success in the U.S. while also leveraging PMI commercial capabilities to prepare for the international expansion of nicotine pouches. IQOS and ZYN are premium brands, leading the global categories. In the U.S., ZYN is helping the American smokers leave cigarettes behind and offers great growth prospects. For IQOS, the world's biggest smoke-free market is a fully untapped opportunity and our plans are well underway in anticipation of our commercialization in the second-quarter of 2024. We will be leveraging the sales and distribution capabilities of Swedish Match and deploying our commercial model digital engine organization and infrastructure for a successful rollout. We continue to expect to file an FDA application for ILUMA in the second half of 2023. Logically, the international expansion of pouches, U.S. IQOS preparation and the replacement of IQOS 3 with ILUMA entail additional investments this year, which combined with inflationary pressures will weigh temporarily on our margins. Indeed, many of the ILUMA related costs are one-off in nature as Emmanuel will explain shortly. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions. As we have explained previously, maintaining our leadership in combustibles helps us maximize switching to smoke-free products through the connection to adult smokers and the retail trade. In terms of our financials, the strength of our business provides a robust operating cash flow, which we intend to maximize to provide reinvestment in our smoke-free business, deleveraging and growing the dividend. Finally and importantly, shaping tobacco harm reduction by providing better alternative to smokers and advocating for science-based regulation is critical to accelerate the end of smoking. Harm reduction is also at the core of our transformation, as we lead on sustainability to achieve a positive impact. We will be expanding on some of these topics at the CAGNY conference on February 22nd and we also plan to host an Investor Day in September this year, where we will go into greater detail on our strategies and future vision particularly with regard to --with regards to the U.S. Now, I will hand it over to Emmanuel, to discuss our results in 2023 and outlook in more detail.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Our business driven by the strength of our innovative and expanding smoke-free portfolio generated excellent top and bottom-line 2022 growth despite a very difficult operating environment, and currency headwinds. Our full-year net revenues grew organically by plus 7.7% excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 7.1% for total PMI, despite the impact of hyper-inflationary accounting in Turkey. This reflect the continued strength of IQOS, accelerating pricing and the recovery of combustibles in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison, notably in H1. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of our full-year smoke-free net revenue, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Our net revenue per unit grew plus 4.4% organically, excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 5.5% in total. This was driven by combustible pricing of plus 4%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 5% overall and the positive mix impact of an increasing proportion of HTUs heated tobacco unit in our overall volumes at higher net revenue per unit. Our 2022 operating income margin contracted organically by 60 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine, and by 70 basis-points in total due to a number of headwinds, which I will come back to. These headwinds were partially mitigated by the growth of IQOS, pricing and ongoing cost-saving. In 2022, we delivered gross saving of $800 million, with over $1.6 billion in the first two years of our cost-efficiency program. This puts us well on track to exceed our target of $2 billion over 2021, 2023 and mitigate recent inflationary pressures. Despite margin pressures, our excellent top-line growth and diligent cost management enabled us to deliver currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11.9% to $5.34, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes unfavorable currency of $0.85 and a small contribution from Swedish Match net of financing cost for the 50 days of consolidated results. For total PMI, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98. We also had a strong finish to the year. We delivered excellent Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 7.9%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Again, reflecting continued strong IQOS performance and robust combustible pricing. Our Q4 operating income margin expanded organically by 80 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine mainly due to a favorable comparison. On the total PMI basis, organic margin were flat including the impact of a challenging comparison in Ukraine and shipment timing in Russia. Fourth quarter currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 20.8% to $1.23, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 15.3% in total to $1.39, an excellent performance. Before discussing our 2023 guidance, I would like to provide an update on our Ukraine and Russia businesses. We continue to support our employees in Ukraine. I would like to personally thank them for their tremendous efforts to secure our business continuity during these extremely difficult times. In Russia, the environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex, especially given recent December 2022 regulatory developments. To provide more clarity to investors on the full extent of our business, we will now include both Ukraine and Russia in our 2023 outlook and reporting. Now turning to the 2023 outlook, we expect to deliver very strong organic net revenue growth of plus 7% to plus 8.5%, supported by a step-up in combustible pricing and another year of rapid progress from IQOS. This would represent the third consecutive year of organic top-line growth above plus 7% and excludes the impact of Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Including Swedish Match, we expect our reported currency-neutral net revenues to grow into the teens as its business continue to deliver strong performance. We expect excellent IQOS momentum to increase our HTU volume growth on the total PMI basis supported by the growing presence of ILUMA across our key markets. We forecast between 125 billion and 130 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 15% to plus 19% growth. This reflects an acceleration compared to the total PMI growth rate in 2022 despite an expectation of no significant progress in Russia given our decision to restrict investment and innovation. As mentioned previously, the pace of ILUMA launches has also been constrained by supply-chain disruption and the outstanding take up in initial launch markets. We expect these constraint to gradually improve through the first half as we progressively roll-out to more geographies. We expect organic smoke-free net revenue growth to have an aligned progression with the rate of HTU volume growth this year with less distortion from device revenues. Including Swedish Match and at constant-currency, we expect to deliver around $13.5 billion in smoke-free net revenue compared to $10 billion in 2022 and to approach 40% of total PMI net revenues this year. While our topline outlook is very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant margin pressure from the intensifying inflationary environment in addition to a number of specific transitory factors and investment, which I will come back to shortly. As a result, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to contract between 50 to 150 basis-points organically. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This includes a full year's positive contribution from Swedish Match net of the related interest expense. However, this benefit is offset by the increased interest cost on our non-Swedish Match debt and planned investments. This translate into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.37, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. This forecast notably, does not factor any potential favorable court ruling in Germany regarding the legality of the surcharge on the existing excise tax on heated tobacco product effective in Germany. as of 2022. We continue to account for the excise surcharge in our results and outlook. However, the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended. If favorable the difference to our forecasted 2023 excise payment would increase our net revenue by around 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth by around three point, thereby increasing our forecast currency-neutral growth range to plus 10% to plus 12%. In this scenario, we would expect our operating cash flow would move towards the upper half of our forecast range. We expect a judgment towards the end of the year. There are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook, we expect total international industry volumes of cigarettes and heated tobacco units excluding China and the U.S. to decline by minus 1% to minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product and the growth of the category, we expect to gain share and target total PMI shipment volume to be flat to plus 1%, which would represent the third consecutive year of growth. While we seek to maintain our share of the combustible category, given the current inflationary environment, we assume combustible pricing will accelerate to around plus 6% on an organic basis compared to the plus 5% realized in 2022. We also expect full-year capital expenditure of around $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2022, reflecting increased investment behind our smoke-free platform including ILUMA and Swedish Match portfolio. Let me now come back to the various factors impacting our margins. In 2022, total PMI gross margin contracted by 220 basis points organically. While growing inflationary pressures were a drag, the largest impact came from the combination of the rapid growth of ILUMA and transitory factors such as supply-chain disruption and the need to use air-freight. ILUMA drove accelerated device replacement from existing user in Japan and other launch market. Such devices sales are positive for acquisition, retention and full conversion. However, devices are margin-dilutive and this dynamic is likely to continue on a temporary basis, as we roll out to more markets this year and consumers upgrade from IQOS blade. The initially higher weight and cost of ILUMA consumable also played a role and this meant that the overall impact of our heat-not-burn business including devices was margin-dilutive in 2022. Importantly, average gross margin on HTUs remain around 10 percentage points higher than for cigarettes on the higher net revenue per unit. This is a fundamental long-term positive margin driver through the growing HTU volume mix in our business and this had a plus 110 basis-point favorable impact in 2022. Our two other key long-term margin drivers of pricing and productivities also continued to contribute favorably. Gross margin headwinds were mitigated at the operating income margin level by SG&A cost which declined by 150 basis-points of net revenues, due primarily to cost-efficiency, operating leverage and comparison effect. The picture for 2023 is quite different while our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as leaf, acetate tow, salaries and energy cost increase. An acceleration in combustible pricing and lower air freight cost will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, a time lag is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiencies and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, this underlying strength from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset combustible cost inflation in 2023, however, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our heat-not-burn business, to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024. 2023 SG&A cost would include incremental investments to drive future growth, including in the commercialization of ILUMA. Also included is around $150 million with a broadly even split between the U.S., where we are preparing our organization capability for the launch of IQOS and wellness and healthcare investment in product development and clinical trials. In addition to inflation, this mean an SG&A cost increase more in line with net revenue growth is likely with limited margin impacts. A few words now on 2023 phasing. We expect margin pressures to be weighted to the first half, particularly given the challenging Q1 2022 comparison and a progressive decrease in airfreight cost throughout the year. In addition, investment are expected to be front loaded and we know that the rollout to ILUMA can lead to a short period of slower user acquisition as consumer wait for the launch. Combined with the timing of shipment and cost saving, we expect our 2023 top and bottom line delivery to be heavily H2 weighted. Indeed, we expect the first quarter to be the most challenging with low-single digit organic topline growth and soft margin. Shipment timing and ILUMA launch impact are expected to be pronounced and we accordingly expect HTU shipment volume of around 26 billion to 28 billion HTUs. We also face a comparison with a significantly lower impact from war related disruption. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.33, including $0.10 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. Importantly, we expect margin to improve as we approach 2024 as headwinds relent and the fundamental margin-accretive driver of our smoke-free transformation continue in the form of heated tobacco unit growth, pricing and cost optimization on ILUMA. Our cash flow generation remains strong. We delivered $10.8 billion in 2022 operating cash flows representing plus 3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This include a favorable timing of certain financing item of around $0.3 billion. Given nonrecurring item and working capital movement benefited 2021 by around $1 billion, this was an excellent result. In 2023, we forecast $10 billion to $11 billion in operating cash-flow despite the notable expected impact from higher working capital requirements due to growth, global inflation and the reversal of one-off timing benefits. This put us on track to deliver our '21, '23 target of around $35 billion given in February 2021 at then prevailing rates. While our net debt is 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12 months trailing basis, this reflects only 50 days of Swedish Match results, including a full-year contribution for Swedish Match would clearly result in a lower ratio. We target robust EBITDA growth, which combined with strong cash flow allows us to focus on deleveraging, while continuing to invest in innovation and the growth of our business. In addition, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our 2022 results, both our HTU and in-market sales volume increased by around 21.5% supporting total volume growth of plus 3.2%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Q4 HTU shipment volume grew by plus 37.5%, partly reflecting the replenishment of inventory for ILUMA in Japan, following lower shipment earlier in the year and favorable shipment timing in the EU, notably in advance of new ILUMA launches. Supported by very solid cigarette performance, we delivered total volume growth for the second consecutive year, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% for the full-year excluding Russia and Ukraine. Combustible pricing increased in H2 as we continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. This resulted in Q4 organic pricing of plus 4.8%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and yielded full-year pricing in line with our expectation with notable contribution from Germany, the Philippines and Turkey, despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting. In 2022, our share of the cigarette category increased by plus 0.3 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine following category share declines in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the pandemic. This includes sequential growth in every quarter of 2022. Marlboro remains extremely resilient despite pressure on disposable income and the impact of IQOS cannibalization with plus 0.2 percentage point share of segment growth. In addition, while we have not yet seen any meaningful acceleration in down trading, our share in the low price segment increased by plus 0.6 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine. As Jacek mentioned earlier, maintaining our leadership in the cigarette category is a key enabler in accelerating smokers switching to better alternative. Our robust cigarette share combined with the growth of IQOS delivered an overall market-share gain of plus 0.6 point in 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, with notable contribution from Egypt, Italy, Japan and Poland. PMI heated tobacco unit continue to strengthen the position towards becoming the largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present and reached the number two position in 2022 with a record-high share of 8.5% in Q4. Now focusing on IQOS user growth, there were an estimated 20.3 million IQOS user as of December 31st, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflect growth of around plus 3.5 million for the full year. For total PMI, we estimate there were almost 25 million IQOS users as of year-end. Consistent with comments in our recent disclosures, user growth in October and November was slower due to higher-than-expected impact from commercial activity and lower acquisition for IQOS brand product in anticipation of the launch of ILUMA in certain key markets. However, we saw a strong rebound in December as ILUMA launches continued delivering robust user growth of plus $0.8 million for the quarter. This actually was close to our initial expectation and we look forward with confidence to 2023 as ILUMA continues to be deployed. ILUMA is driving volume and share growth across its market supporting our strong position in heat-not-burn category. We launched in eight new markets in Q4, including the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, and South Korea, bringing the total to 16 markets with ILUMA launched now represent more than half of our total HTU volume. ILUMA delivers a superior consumer experience as evidenced by net promoter scores which on average increased by more than 10 points across its different market archetypes and higher conversion rate compared to IQOS. While the rate of acceleration differ by market in both Switzerland and the more recently launched United Arab Emirates offtake share has almost doubled since launch. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of scale and optimization should allow us to bring down the cost of ILUMA overtime starting in the second half of 2023. Focusing now on the European Union where smoke-free net revenue exceeded 40% of the region for the full year. Our fourth quarter HTU share increased by plus 2.4 points to reach 8.8% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume with a modest flattering effect from timing factor. IMS volumes continue to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects success across many markets and key cities including Vilnius with over 43% share, as well as Athens and Rome with over 25%. In Japan the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 35% of total tobacco with IQOS increasingly driving its growth In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.6 points to 24.5% with offtake share in Tokyo surpassing 30%. Our two-tier consumable portfolio continued to deliver strong results. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record-high of 8.8 billion units on a four-quarter moving average as the number of Japanese IQOS users crossed a remarkable 7.5 million adult consumers. In addition to strong IQOS gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income market. In 2022, our HTU shipments grew by almost 50% excluding Russia and Ukraine. This robust performance reflects success across many markets, including Egypt where Urban Cairo exit offtake share surpassed 7% Bulgaria and Malaysia where Q4 offtake share reached 14% in both capital cities. Let's now move on to Swedish Match which finished the year strongly further confirming our belief that this combination will be accretive to our growth and margin profile over the coming years. Please note for housekeeping purposes, that my comments on Swedish Match Financial Results are based on publicly available information through September 30th and from November 11th when it was consolidated in PMI's financial statements. Swedish Match delivered excellent performance following the acquisition, with strong net revenue and adjusted operating income. Most impressive was the phenomenal U.S. growth of ZYN which I will come back to on the next slide. In other U.S. smoke-free products, moist snuff also performed well gaining almost one percentage point share of segment and growing 2022 volumes within a declining category. In Scandinavia, the overall smoke-free market and Swedish Match continued to grow, albeit helped by year end trade inventory movements ahead of a January excise tax increase in Sweden. The cigar business delivered robust performance to end a challenging year with growth in volume and category share. We are very pleased with the strong 2022 results from Swedish Match, which also included positive pricing across all smoke-free category. We look forward to reporting our combined results going forward. Now let's discuss ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Excellent progress continues with shipment volume growth of plus 37% in 2022 and plus 35% in Q4, reaching a record quarterly high. ZYN category volume share grew sequentially by one percentage point compared to the third quarter and by 2.2 percentage points compared to the prior year, further strengthening its position as the clear number one nicotine pouch brand despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly retail value share for ZYN remains strong at 75.7%, highlighting its premium positioning and high brand equity. 2023 promises to be a very exciting year. We are thrilled to have welcomed Swedish Match employee and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI, family to create a global smoke-free champion. And we will look we will work together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of the smoke-free future. In particular, bringing in ZYN and IQOS together in both the U.S. and international markets present a significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth and switching of adult smoker to better alternative. As a well-run and successful business we expect continued strong performance from Swedish Match existing operation. A key focus this year will be supporting and further driving strong in growth in the U.S. In addition, we are now preparing for the international expansion of nicotine pouches leveraging Swedish Match rich product portfolio and PMI's extensive smoke-free commercial infrastructure. In parallel, we will be actively Swedish Match U.S. distribution and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in 2024. Moving to sustainability. As we transform our company our business and sustainability strategies are advancing hand-to-hand with increasing momentum. PMI and Swedish Match have a shared vision and values. The combination helps us further accelerate towards achieving our purpose, transforming for good to make cigarettes obsolete and maximize the benefit of smoke-free products. Our goal for best in class ESG performance is aligned as we seek to address the environmental impact of our product, eradicate child labor, reduce our carbon footprint and provide a more inclusive and empowered working environment for all our employees. In December, we published a standalone report detailing our new biodiversity and water ambitions. For biodiversity we aim to achieve no low net loss on ecosystem connected to our value chain by 2033 and contribute towards to a net positive impact on nature by 2050. For Water Stewardship we aim to scale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources by 2033 and contribute towards a positive impact on water resources by 2050. I am also proud to share that for the third consecutive year we have been awarded CDP's Triple A. CDP scored nearly 15,000 companies on their climate change forest and water security disclosures, of which only 12 received this strategic prestigious score. In addition I am excited to share that we are included in the 2023 Bloomberg GenderEquality Index for the third year running. I'll now turn back to Jacek for concluding remarks.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, our business delivered both a strong fourth quarter and full-year performance despite many challenging headwinds. We achieved excellent top and bottomline growth with double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and almost $6 of adjusted EPS for total PMI. The consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottomline delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last three years. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of IQOS, which is now complemented by the remarkable growth of ZYN. Combined with Swedish Match we will have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest-growing category of oral nicotine. We expect 2023 to be a landmark year for our smoke-free transformation with smoke-free net revenues of around $13.5 billion at constant currency, approaching 40% of our company. We have exciting opportunities for growing nicotine pouches in the U.S. and internationally, along with the U.S. commercialization of IQOS next year. We expect margin headwinds will persist in 2023 before improving in 2024. However, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with - and we look forward with confidence. With an excellent performance over the past two years and our strong 2023 outlook, we expect to comfortably exceed our three year minimum CAGR targets of more than 5% organic net revenue growth, more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and broadly stable shipment volumes. Finally, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business enables us to deleverage while maintaining our steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. Thank you for your attention, Emmanuel, and I will be happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Chris.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Good morning. I want to ask you first of all, you gave some great color there and detail in your remarks. As I look at the EPS growth in 2023, just understand some of the burdens on that growth and we know about $150 million of investment you've outlined for the U.S. in your health and wellness division. What are the costs do you foresee in some of the supply-chain costs and use of air-freight available, how much are those burdening your cost for the year, if you can give some color on that?
Jacek Olczak: So maybe I start and Emmanuel will chip in, I guess. Yes, it's a 115 between the U.S., $115 million between the U.S. and the wellness healthcare, almost evenly spread between the two. Now, you have the air freight and this is more of the thing, which I think, we should start seeing some improvement in 2023 and especially as we go towards the second half of the year. I think, we should start normalize the use of the air freight, which will then obviously continue with the 2024. Now you have the inflationary pressure on the COGS, I think Emmanuel mentioned in his remarks, the leaf. Leaf, obviously is - due to our duration of inventories of the leaf and the way the leaf prices are rolling through the P&L is something which last usually longer right you have a three years above the duration of inventory. So, on a moving average, valuations I mean the spreads over the period of time you have energy, which is obviously the big hit across the number of directly or indirectly through the materials. Now we start seeing energy prices easing at least at this stage, but also you bind it by some contractual arrangements, et cetera. So I don't think that's helping '23, but I remain cautiously optimistic that as of '24, we should start seeing reversal of those. Obviously, you have a cost of the IQOS ILUMA roll out because we are at the year end, we've been at the 16 markets out of 73 markets total IQOS. So there is a bulk of a market in front of us in '23 and we don't want to stop or slow down the rollout of ILUMA. So obviously, you have a pressure on the margin coming from the extra sales of the devices, right, which obviously had a drag on the margins, and which essentially accelerating replacement of the devices at the existing consumers level, but with the very clear view now, that we have a very nice paper going forward with the accelerated acquisition, better consumption, better conversion rates. And that's the key items. So Emmanuel, did I miss something important.
Emmanuel Babeau: No, I think you were very exhaustive clearly, Jacek. Just sort of couple of further detail and clearly, in '23, we've been flagging it. We expect our heat-not-burn business to contribute positively at the level of the gross margin rate evolution. So in '23 it's really inflation impacting us very negatively at the level of all cost of goods, but on combustible, we are going to increase price that is not going to be sufficient to offset this impact. And just to give you a color, Jacek was alluding to energy price. We're not talking about even the double-digit inflation, I mean energy price between '23 and '21 we are talking about close to a 3x factor. So it's a big increase with the big impact on the P&L. Over time with price increase, we're going to overcome that, but there is just a lag as we said on matching that. Then there is a big difference also on our SG&A cost evolution. In 2022, we were flat, because we've been generating a lot of efficiencies, inflation was not as others is going to be in '23 with a lot of salary increase and probably on the basis of comparison were more favorable. In '23, we expect to grow our SG&A in line with top-line, more or less which one would expect. We continue to invest a lot in order to support the growth of the business to acquire new user, digital investment. We talk about the U.S. and wellness and healthcare and there would still be efficiency, but not at the same level. Last element that I have to add, the cost of the debt, I'm not talking about the debt of acquisition of Swedish Match because for Swedish Match, we are in line with expectation i.e. low single-digit accretion on the EPS. But clearly for the existing debt, there is also an increase in the cost and that is having an impact on the evolution of the adjusted EPS. I think with that, Chris, we are giving all the information we can on what we are facing in term of evolution on our cost.
Chris Growe: That was sure exhaustive. Thank you for that. It was very, very helpful. I had just one quick follow-up, which will be that, you have heated tobacco unit growth expectation of that 15% to 19%. I just want to get an understanding on two specs of that, is Russia, Ukraine down likely in 2023, given you're not investing there. And then, just to what degree, its capacity limited today? If you had more ILUMA capacity, could that grow even faster? Thank you for your time.
Jacek Olczak: Okay, so actually the Russia and Ukraine and obviously, Russia due to its weight even more, there were drag on our performance both in '22 and will be - and it's fair to assume will be a drag in 2023. As you know is, our decision, strong decisions today investor and essentially ILUMA is for example, is the key technology advancements, which will have, which we decided not to rollout in Russia, because it has an impact right. So that, the numbers which we now just for the visibility to the investors of the business, as is today, we're including Russia and Ukraine but above five very much Russia not contributing to the growth. So one good thing opposite excluding Russia and Ukraine, our growth rates would be at a higher level, on a comparable level, capacity, we will. I think we have - we are guiding the market that we expect the better result in the second half of the year. And that's partially reflects the moment when we think, we will be beyond the bottleneck with regards to the capacity around ILUMA. So we really managing the business on a very tight supply chain for still this year, sorry 2022 and for first half of '23 and the second half of '23, we should be okay. I could actually - again - I can bridge back to the famous air freight, et cetera, because all of these things are consequences of us riding on a very, very tight supply chain.
Chris Growe: That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thanks, hi.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning, I guess my question is on your op margin guidance and the implied deleverage. Maybe you could breakdown the headwinds you highlighted just a bit further and thinking about in the context of what you can control like the investments, you're making to drive future growth. Could you help frame that for us? Just trying to think through, how big of a step-up the investments will be this year versus last year? And then, how do we think about the investments required next year and beyond? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of the investments required to essentially roll-out IQOS in the U.S., it will take place this year versus next year. And I'm well aware of the investments you need to roll out ILUMA, but anything there would be helpful?
Emmanuel Babeau: I'm please to take that one, Bonnie. So I think, on the U.S., we've been clear on the fact that we expect something like half of around $150 million, of course it's a rounding of extra investment in the U.S. as we prepare the launch of IQOS in the U.S. that is for 2023. When we have a plan for the coming years and of course, with more detail, we will of course come to you and elaborate and detail that. Now for the rest of the business, I think we are and that was the sense of my comment on SG&A evolution. On a relatively regular basis, we are investing an extra few $100 million in ILUMA to be more specific, because, of course, very sensitive information behind the acceleration of IQOS and it's going to come, of course, behind IQOS ILUMA in 2023. So the growth, when we say, we expect SG&A to grow broadly in line with topline, there is a huge impact of inflation. I mean, I don't need to explain that inflation is in most country around high single digit and we need to reflect that on salary increase. We have efficiency on cost in front of that and that is enabling us to on top of the inflation impact to keep investing on the growth of the business and we do that in a rather consistent manner, of course, very much focus behind ILUMA in 2023.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question if I may, it's just related to the user growth in Q4 and IQOS, could you maybe talk through some of the puts and takes that you saw in the quarter. I mean, it seem to accelerate relative to Q3, despite some of the headwinds you had recently highlighted and then you did mention that ILUMA drives higher conversion rates than IQOS 3 DUO so, could you possibly quantify that for us? I guess, I'm trying to think through when that platform scales, do you expect your overall conversion to grow meaningfully possibly above your current 70% rate?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, so I maybe take the ILUMA conversion rates in the markets at this stage, [technical difficulty] run-rate conversion rates before an IQOS blade will be somewhere up in the range of a 10 percentage points. Okay, so obviously, different markets, there is some difference between the markets, but as a rule of thumb is about the 10 percentage point, which essentially means, the way we measure conversion at 10% of the devices sold through acquisition of new users, AG Snus and they should, and they are generating the recurring demand for the consumables. So this also has the - there's a better productivity on the user acquisitions and devices sold. I want to just bridge back to the - your previous question, Bonnie, if you allow me. When we look at the U.S. investment, we've highlighted, including the wellness and healthcare, about $150 million. But we shouldn't just look at the investment from the lenses of IQOS, because part of the investments, which we already started, once we committed to make this year, I believe will also benefit further growth opportunity for ZYN, okay, for Swedish Match. So it's not that we're really running business - two separate type of a businesses. We try to look at this from the leveraging and further enhancing the capabilities of Swedish Match and I believe the opportunities for ZYN in the U.S., they had a spectacular or phenomenal growth, depends which adjective you like better. But I think, there is more to come on this one. So the way we're looking at allocating the results is that, it is not just going to prepare us for the IQOS stake back in '24, but also in the meantime, can further - can be a further boost to the ZYN. Now, to your question also about the future rollout of the IQOS alone in the U.S., I think September when we meet, I hope during the Investors Day, we will be in a positions to give a more precise plan. So we obviously taking considerations the expected timelines vis a vis from FDA. We said that we're going to file IQOS ILUMA which is our - the best flagship and the best propositions we have today. And obviously, our objective - prime objective would be to enter markets, U.S. markets with a very big momentum coming from international on the best what we have, but I think, by September, this year, we should have more details and more visibility about this.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's super helpful. I appreciate it.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, good morning. So the first is on the step up in cigarette pricing, so it was 5% last years, you are saying it will be 6% in FY '23. Now Japan had 5% pricing last year, this year it will be 0, so clearly ex-Japan cigarette pricing is accelerating from four to seven approximately. So, where exactly is this biggest step-up happening in cigarette pricing?
Jacek Olczak: Japan, you pretty good single out Japan in this case, right, this is the biggest pricing from the unknow, right and it's difficult to make any assumptions in Japan, but we have already this year working pretty well with the good results on the - reversing the pricing trend in Indonesia. As you may recall, and I believe we're really turning the corner in Indonesia which always due to volume underlying size of the and the weight of the business to us is very important. I think, we have a stronger Philippines, plus the European markets also come with a strong pricing. So that 6%, which we assume in the - for this year is just the reflection of this. Now depends what's happened in Japan. I mean, all of these things will be coming on the top, but actually Japan from the large geographies is the under market when visibility for obvious reason is very limited to.
Gaurav Jain: Sure, thank you. And then on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban, which is expected to come later this year, how should we think about it? And how is it factored in your guidance?
Jacek Olczak: I mean, it's one of the events which nobody ever experienced. We have a - some sort of similarities with the flavor bans including menthol on the combustible cigarettes you may recall few years ago. And frankly speaking, that has not had any material sort of a impact on the cigarette volume, so I think here - okay we will see, what's going to happen. We think, it's going to be manageable.
Gaurav Jain: Sure, thank you so much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Gaurav.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi Pams.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Pam.
Pamela Kaufman: Can you discuss your strategy for the U.S. market this year for Swedish Match and what you - what your key priorities are? And then what are your plans for the international rollout of ZYN and the timeline?
Jacek Olczak: So obviously, you know the focus is to continue and enhance the spectacular momentum of pouches, ZYN growth in the U.S. I mentioned this before answering another question that part of the investments we are allocating to U.S., I believe also will benefit the current business of Swedish Match. I think, there should be a bigger, better pricing, especially on the cigar business, although it is not really our strategic focus, but still obviously helps the overall business performance. And the strategy in terms of long-term, the big question obviously is how we will approach IQOS commercialization, the moment when we fully take it back in that in 2024. And we know what sort of actually capabilities are missing at the Swedish Match level. So we adding them. But the real big commercial spend, I mean, it will depend on the timing and the dense and the intensity of our rollout plans, which we will share, I guess, around September, during the Investors - September this year, around the Investors Day. When it comes to the pouches, on international, I think Swedish Match and us now together have a plans, how to start addressing some share pressure especially in the Nordics, okay but on the bigger international scale, we have quite a few markets, which we will start rolling out the pouches this year but for obvious reasons, I will not mention which markets. But that was the whole purpose of acquisition of Swedish Match, as you recall, leveraged the base and our growth opportunity in the U.S., is the - is a huge relief in a sense of preparedness for IQOS but also I believe the category has the - quite a potential in there or in the regions of this product space on international basis. We will have infrastructure in most of the markets, it's - I'm not releasing really - disclosing any strategic confidential matters, obviously IQOS is present in 70 plus markets. This is where the developed infrastructure is most developed and very likely, the markets for ZYN products will be - which in the list of this markets.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then can you just talk about your strategy with the bonds product that you launched in test markets and what your early observations are and then how are you thinking about a broader rollout over time?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I mean it's a broader rollout of the bonds is more the - we've more strategically planned for the 2024, so the next year. We will have some volume, but nothing compared to be very frank to what we have about the IQOS and ILUMA product. This is by far the prime focus. But I think, the early results, which we get from the Philippines and Colombia, I mean, they are very strong, actually they are very strong, obviously our expectations after a seven or so years of experience with IQOS products are much higher than we ever had. So BONDS have to come and meet that expectations as well. The proposition essentially, we knew that the moment when we will be going more into the emerging markets, lower-income, when the afford - consumer affordability might be at a bottleneck in achieving our smoke-free ambitions. We had to also come up with a technology both on a consumables and on the device which somehow adjust the cost of the propositions to the potential pricing we can offer to the market. So obviously, the focus will be on the emerging markets, but I do believe that that proposition also nicely will help in some developed economies because across the spectrum of the smoker's audience, obviously, they also group of people who, for whom the affordability might create some constraint. So that will be a very nice complement - complementary propositions in our portfolio. And essentially it also help IQOS to continue on its extremely successful history of occupying this premium or medium plus space. This is - this mega brand, which we're trying to build, while preparing our self that one billion plus smokers in the world, I mean they are going across the different various price segments from the premium, mid, low, super-low et cetera and we need to provide the relevant propositions there. So I think, bonds is on the track and this is how we are going to play strategically in the portfolio.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Pam. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Thank you, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Vivien
Vivien Azer: Hi. I was hoping to talk about the IQOS outlook, please, in terms of the stakes and in particular, what impact is the removal of characterizing flavors on HTUs in the EU, impacting your outlook. How are you accounting for that? And what's the expected timing of that, please. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, so I partially answered that question before, Vivien. But the characterizing flavor, we had that - we had an experience with the cigarettes - combustible cigarettes in the past and it's the only reference point we might - we have today. And as you recall, the menthol and others ban in Europe, didn't really impact in any material way the volumes of the cigarette, so I think here, one can expect a similar sort of a manageable impact if you like of that ban. The second thing, it's very - but also reminding everyone that IQOS by far today is the best tobacco flavor proposition. Yes, there are some flavors, which we have in our portfolio, in the market , that propulsions might be different, but by far, IQOS on the pure tobacco flavor and this is by the way, were the bulk of the cigarette market, the rest in essentially all geographies. I mean this is an IQOS strength, so there was a portion of a portfolio, which will be impacted. But and I think for the vast majority of the smokers existing of sorry existing comparative to IQOS users and the smokers, which are still on a combustible, I mean IQOS still offers to date best in class taste and a flavor experience which is in the core of the tobacco flavor.
Vivien Azer: Thank you for that. And I apologize if I missed this, but is there any way that you can provide an update on kind of the infrastructure build-out for IQOS in the U.S. ahead of your reacquiring the commercial rights to that proposition, both in terms of the consumables as well as the devices? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I think there was look - there was a - we're looking also both as a - we are also looking at this, not only on IQOS on a standard basis but IQOS and the ZYN and other parts of the Swedish Match business. And I believe, the obvious, the questions of the optimal distribution and I believe this can pair very well and enhancements already to the distribution which serves not only in a future IQOS but can and will serve actually in growth opportunities today, there is the whole digital aspect, there is a better management of the pricing promotions. The whole consumer piece, right, which is so strong behind an IQOS success. I mean, that's something which we are preparing the infrastructure for.
Vivien Azer: Okay, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Vivien.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Afternoon, gents. Hope you all well.
Jacek Olczak: Good afternoon, Owen.
Owen Bennett: Yes my question is more a bigger picture, longer term, one around the U.S. and the overall RRP space, now you've got control of your own destiny. I was hoping to get your thoughts on how you see RRP overall develop longer-term across the different categories? Whether you see some more attractive than all these. And do you still think you could envisage or when we introduce into the U.S., obviously bearing in mind, the limited traction it got with Altria, and then just linked to these U.S. RRP plans, any update on timing for a PMTA submission with your VEEV product. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, so I start with the last one. We plan to submit the IQOS ILUMA to PMTA to FDA in the second half of this year. Now with regards to the - to potential, look, we think that an IQOS strength, which is really if you go to the core of the smokers today, when they really enjoy this pure unaffected by any flavors et cetera, tobacco flavor and so on is undisputed. Every market you go, IQOS exactly delivers on the flavor, taste expectations to this audience. And that's also I believe a critical factor in IQOS high conversion rate. And how many people fully adopt the IQOS and not only that they are leaving cigarettes fully behind them, they don't even attempt it on occasional basis to go back to cigarettes, okay, so that's the core and I believe for the audience which with the smoking audience, which you have in the U.S., IQOS perfectly fitting into this whole thing obviously the other platforms, which offer you the different ritual, different experience, the e-cigarettes and the pouches. The e-cigarettes usually more driven by the flavors, and obviously absence the pure tobacco natural type of a flavor, it's - that's the challenge, which partially in our opinion is behind more of the dual consumption that the full conversion, but also the products are under development and they're getting better. And pouch is actually on the risk continuum of the product. I mean, it's an average important offering for the consumers, who really want to reduce significantly exposure and potentially the harm by - while enjoying the product. So I think, there is this complementary, there is this complementary role of each of these platforms with, you know, also that we're working on our platform forward because technically which is Leaf and the Viva products, the electronic cigarette segments going through this own dynamics, is this mix of the flavors, disposable et cetera, it's not necessarily great for the economics, but partially also because of the slower conversion rate compared to the other platforms. So we have said it from the very beginning of our transformation, if you follow us seven, eight years ago, I recall that the - one of the first investors conferences, when we announced the purpose of that we want to go smoke free, we have said that there is the room for every platform at the different moments for different consumers and our job is at the right time to deploy this platforms and the leverage, the opportunities and the benefit to the smokers.
Owen Bennett: Great, fantastic. And just - sorry, a follow-up, the question on the PMTA was not for ILUMA, I think previously for VEEV you said, you targeted first half of '23, just any update on VEEV, PMTA submission?.
Jacek Olczak: Yes as I think, we're also thinking about the 2023, but now having also the ZYN and knowing what ILUMA can do and knowing that before we also need to make sure that we have a right PMTA submission strategy, right, it was an effort behind each of them and we need to prioritize, but the - I mean the way we are thinking, we are - sorry thinking, is more than a thinking, we are working on bringing our P4 to the U.S. as well.
Owen Bennett: Great, thanks guys, appreciate it.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Owen.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS.
Andrei Condrea: Hi everyone, thank you for taking my question, just one from me.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Andrei.
Andrei Condrea: Sticking to – hi, sticking to U.S. IQOS. We know that the U.S. menthol ban from the FDA proposed standards allows - potentially will allow for some exceptions to it. And thinking that your IQOS has the MRTP designation, which is rather unique versus all its peers, would -- were you factoring this in when you set out your ambition of I believe 10% market share by 2030 if I'm not mistaken?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, you were - I think you're quoting my words, this is Jacek here. Yes, I still do believe that IQOS by 2030 knowing how it performs on the many other international markets. The 10% is not out of - it can be a realistic ambitious - ambition or realistic dream. Now to be very frank, when we look into this, we have not been trying to factor being that there might be some flavors or menthol bans on other products. But you rightly noticed that IQOS today is two variants of IQOS outdoor iced with the menthol flavor, will this be an accelerating factor or not? Look I mean the future will tell, but I still believe that IQOS as is in the current environment due to its strength and the satisfaction it gives to smokers, et cetera has the - that big potential in from the person.
Andrei Condrea: I see very clear. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Andrei.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan.
Jared Dinges: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, hi.
Jared Dinges: A couple from me please, first, given the CapEx, step-up in CapEx that you expect for this year, I just wanted to ask, how should we be thinking about CapEx levels beyond '23? Is next year kind of a one off given the ZYN international expansion plans?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look I think, you should expect us of course to accompany the growth we are growing volume within more capacities, so the CapEx will reflect that. There is certainly, when it comes to ILUMA, a moment where we build the capacity for ILUMA and that is translating into a significant investment. So you see that in the 1.3. I would say, we are going to certainly regularly invest on the capacity for the Swedish Match overall business, so I'm not able to get at that stage. I'm not giving guidance on '24. I certainly believe that there is this transition moment where we are building the capacity on ILUMA then of course that will be accompanying the growth of ILUMA and - and we are very ambitious, as you know, on growing overall product. So that will come with investment, but, of course, they are not of the same magnitude as the one that we've been making in order to be the capacity on IQOS, smaller volume, smaller base. So notwithstanding back on the long-term anyway.
Jared Dinges: Okay, that's clear. And for the second one and maybe just on the Healthcare and Wellness segment, I mean, 2023 will be another investment year. I know you guys have talked about that that probably being a multiyear investment cycle. But I don't know if you can give any indication on when you think that business could potentially start to contribute to growth and maybe also, could you guys talk about your learnings so far in those businesses that you have acquired?
Jacek Olczak: Yes I mean, look, they obviously, been very clear about this from the very beginning, I mean, in order to develop and bring to the market of a couple of the programs and products, which we have it in mind, I mean we have to go for the investments, we talked about us prefer also have a very promising investment in the medical of - in the medical space be cannabinoids et cetera. So all of this programs that they agree to establish milestones in terms of the - the development of these products including the series of clinicals and meeting of different regulatory expectation, so that's about what's going to be. We have said historically our ambitious target of achieving this $1 billion revenue by 2025, there is a pipeline of the product but the more interesting actually, what's going to happen with that business beyond '25, because it's the longer-term, longer-term investment. Obviously, when we allocate the capital, we look first with - we allocate the capital behind the -- those things, which are in the near and mid-term for us and it's obviously heat-not-burn and IQOS, ILUMA expansions to the US, and I can go through the long list of an opportunities but they're keeping also denied. This businesses have a quite - wellness and healthcare offers us a very interesting opportunities in the longer run, when we very well leverage both our scientific life science expertise capabilities combined with the commercial et cetera. So, this is how I would look on this thing. I think when we meet on the - in September of this year for the Investors Day, we will start, obviously opening a much more longer-term horizon, how the management, how we see the future of PMI not just in the next year or two, but with the longer time of a perspective. And this is the moment when, I guess, we will share more details, by the way, also I think we'll be able to answer more precisely your first questions to Emmanuel, about the CapEx, because obviously, we open a 10 years horizon for Philip Morris, we will have to touch upon that capital allocation component as well.
Jared Dinges: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: It appears, we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
James Bushnell: Thank you. Before closing our call, I would like to remind you that we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on February 22. And as we mentioned earlier, we plan to host the September Investor Day, in Switzerland. We hope, you will be able to join these events, either in person or virtually. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you. Talk to you soon.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or "RRPs," as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI’s operations in Russia and Ukraine. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022, and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I’m joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Jacek will join us for the question-and-answer session. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Today marks a historic day in our journey towards a smoke-free future, with the certainty that we will have full control of IQOS, the world’s leading smoke-free product in the United States, the world’s largest smoke-free market from April 30, 2024. Indeed, today’s agreement with Altria removes the potential of a protracted legal process to regain the U.S. rights to IQOS which Altria previously held, subject to performance milestones, until 2029. We have ambitious plans for the full-scale launch and rapid expansion of IQOS in the U.S. market as soon as we take over and efficient time during the transition period to put our commercial model and related organization and infrastructure in place using our wealth of experience from international markets. We see IQOS as the primary vector for establishing a leadership position in the U.S. smoke-free industry and it will be followed by the other products in our smoke-free portfolio. In this context, Swedish Match offers an immediate position in the oral segment, and mutually beneficial synergies at sales force level. However, should the offer fail, we can certainly build a robust sales force as part of our commercial deployment engine during the transition period. Under both scenarios we see an accelerated path to profitability with an attractive payback period on our IQOS investment, given superior U.S. unit economics and the absence of a legacy cigarette business. I will cover this in more detail later. With regard to Swedish Match, we announced this morning an update to our offer with our best and final price of SEK 116. Our updated offer retains a 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to allow us to capture the full potential of the combination. Now that we are close to the end of the offer period, the increased offer is primarily intended to fairly reflect the higher net value to us of the portion of Swedish Match’s cash flows which are in U.S. dollars given currency movements since our initial offer was announced in May. Equity markets, the global economy and interest rates have also moved unfavorably since then. As such, we believe the updated price, with a premium of 52.5% to the undisturbed share price prior to the initial offer, strengthens the attractiveness yet further for Swedish Match shareholders while maintaining strong value creation for PMI shareholders. This is our best and final price and we hope to complete the transaction next month to achieve full ownership. Turning now to our Q3 earnings, we delivered another very strong performance this quarter, with HTU volumes ahead of our forecast, and robust growth in total volumes, market share and combustible net revenues. With adjusted operating income margins in line with expectations, this resulted in total Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53, close to our all-time quarterly high despite notable currency headwinds. IQOS’ excellent performance continued, with plus 22% growth in pro forma HTU shipment volumes, a testament to the continued strengthening of our heat-not-burn portfolio and broad-based growth across key regions. IQOS ILUMA continues to drive growth in its launch markets. In combustibles, we delivered robust performance with Q3 organic pro forma net revenue growth exceeding plus 4%, driven by accelerated pricing of almost plus 5%. Cigarette shipment volumes were essentially stable and category share grew, supported by Marlboro, showcasing the resilience of the brand despite current economic conditions. Turning now to the headline numbers, our Q3 volumes grew by 2.3% on a pro forma basis, and by 0.6% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.9% and by plus 6.7% for total PMI. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 4.5% on a pro forma basis and by plus 6.1% in total despite lower device revenues. This reflects the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and a step up in combustible pricing. Our Q3 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 100 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 90 basis points in total, consistent with our expectations. As previously communicated, this reflects the recovery in device volumes, the investments in launching ILUMA including initially higher unit costs, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine and increasing global inflationary pressures. Despite these headwinds, our strong top-line growth and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to outperform our previous currency-neutral guidance to deliver adjusted diluted pro forma EPS of $1.33, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing 8.3% currency-neutral growth. Including Russia and Ukraine, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53. Our strong third quarter, combined with a robust H1, supported an excellent delivery for the year-to-date. I would highlight our strong pro forma volume growth of plus 3.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again reflecting continued strong IQOS performance, pricing, and the recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison. Smoke-free net revenues made up around 30% of our year-to-date pro forma total, putting us on track to reach our ambition of over 50% by 2025. Our year-to-date operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We remain on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion over 2021-2023. $1.5 billion of gross savings have already been delivered, including over $200 million in Q3. This allows us to reinvest in the business and mitigate increasing inflationary pressures. Year-to-date currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 9.7% to $4.11 on a pro forma basis and by plus 8.8% in total to $4.59; an excellent performance. Now, let’s turn to the pro forma full year outlook. Given the continued growth of IQOS and robust trends in combustibles, we are revising our top-line forecasts upwards to 2% to 3% growth in total shipment volumes, and 6.5% to 8% growth in organic net revenues. While our top-line outlook remains very strong, like many other global companies we are facing significant inflationary forces in the world economy, and this is reflected in our updated adjusted OI margin forecast. Inflation in our cost of goods remained mid-single-digit in the third quarter. However, inflationary pressures are growing as we renew pricing arrangements, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy, and transportation costs. In addition, the very strong growth of ILUMA in Japan and other launch markets has an initial negative margin impact, given the higher weight of the consumables and increased cost of both the device and consumables, in the first 12 to 18 months of activation. As mentioned previously, the combination of strong demand, global supply chain disruption and the impact of cancelling induction HTU production in Russia, means our supply chain is not fully optimized. This has resulted in reduced productivity and a number of additional costs, including an approximate $300 million impact from a significant increase in the use of air freight. As a result, while we continue to expect a rebound in our Q4 adjusted OI margin, partly reflecting higher commercial investments in the prior year, we are now forecasting less expansion than previously expected, with pro forma adjusted organic operating income margin flat to slightly negative for the full year. Despite this change to margin expectations, our top-line momentum is strong and we continue to forecast pro forma adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 12% for 2022. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $5.22 to $5.33, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.87 at prevailing rates, notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. There is a slide in the appendix with further detail on the estimated exchange rate impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of almost $6, including an estimated $0.80 unfavorable currency impact. Lastly, given the continued success of ILUMA and the cancellation of TEREA production in Russia I just referenced, we are working to further accelerate our production of induction consumables. As we convert and transition capacity from blade to induction, we incur certain inefficiencies and limits on the availability of ILUMA HTUs. We are optimizing our inventory levels where possible to minimize any impact on consumer availability. However, these factors are a constraint on our shipments and we are updating our HTU shipment volume forecast to 89 billion to 91 billion units for the year. Importantly, this is a short-term supply dynamic. Consumer offtake trends remain strong and HTU in-market sales volumes are expected to further accelerate their growth to over 25% in Q4, while also growing sequentially compared to Q3. The cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional, as shown through the challenges of recent years. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We delivered operating cash flow of $7.7 billion year-to-date, representing growth of 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Today we reconfirm our forecast of around $10.5 billion in operating cash flow for the full year, despite an estimated currency headwind of around $1.3 billion. This means we expect to deliver an excellent $22.5 billion over 2021 and 2022. Cash flow was flattered somewhat in 2021 by $0.5 billion from one-off impacts and the timing factors of certain cash flows which benefitted 2021 at the expense of 2022; and by a further $0.5 billion of working capital improvements. However, our 2022 forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year. I would also like to highlight that U.S. dollar strength has a positive impact on our net debt, given that more than 60% of our financing is in euros, including derivative overlays. This serves to offset the impact on our earnings and, combined with strong cash generation, contributed to a $1.5 billion reduction in our net debt since December 2021, which is now below 1.6 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12-month rolling basis. This delivery highlights our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt, and invest in the growth of our business. In addition, we recently increased our annualized dividend for the 15th consecutive year, in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our results. Our total pro forma shipment volumes increased by 2.3% for Q3 and 3.4% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. Pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew by 21.9% for the third quarter and 15.8% year-to-date. While our shipments have been more volatile this year reflecting the current supply chain dynamics, HTU IMS growth has been consistently strong with 18.2% growth in Q3 and 19.2% year-to-date, with robust performance in the EU Region, Japan, and Low and Middle-Income markets. As I mentioned, we expect a further acceleration of IMS growth in Q4. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust pro forma organic net revenue growth of 4.1% in Q3 and essentially stable pro forma shipment volume. Our pro forma pricing accelerated to 4.9% in Q3 as we progressively adjust to the inflationary environment. This reflects notable contributions from Australia, Germany, and the Philippines, and a positive quarterly variance from Indonesia for the first time since Q4 2019. We now expect full year pricing to be around 4%. Our pro forma share of the cigarette category increased by 0.2 points year-to-date. This was supported by Marlboro, where volumes grew by almost 4% for total PMI. With a premium position in a challenging consumer environment, this represents an impressive performance from the world’s leading cigarette brand. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. The positive combination of stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of IQOS positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 0.5 points of pro forma share gains in Q3 and 0.6 points year-to-date, with notable contributions from Italy, Indonesia, Japan, and Poland. Despite increasing competition in many markets, our leading share of the growing heat-not-burn category has remained stable since the start of the year at around 75% and grew sequentially in the third quarter. This remarkable achievement is supported by the increasing deployment of a 2-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q3 of 0.2 points to a record 7.7% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 19.5 million IQOS users as of September 30th, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects growth of around 0.5 million users in Q3 and 2.7 million year-to-date. As shown on the right-hand side of this slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower pro forma user growth due to seasonal factors. The growth of 0.5 million this quarter was very robust in a historical context, noting that the high growth in Q3 2020 benefited from a catch-up effect following the relaxation of COVID restrictions on retail locations and mobility. Importantly, we expect a strong acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the EU Region, smoke-free net revenues comprised almost 40% of regional net revenues year-to-date, with a number of markets well above 50%. This performance clearly shows the way towards our ambition to be predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Our EU third quarter HTU share increased by 2.0 points compared to Q3 last year to reach 7.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. I would also highlight the 0.2-point sequential increase, which is a notably strong performance given the usual seasonality of the combustible market. Most importantly, adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 8.7 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. We expect IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. Please refer to the appendix for additional key city and market share data. With regard to regulation in the EU, we are encouraged by the increasing number of countries adopting multi-year fiscal frameworks with clear differentiation of smoke-free products, such as the recent legislation in Romania. We expect the proposal on the EU Tobacco Excise Directive to be published by year-end and hope for a similar approach. As a reminder, the Tobacco Excise Directive will require unanimous support for approval by all 27 EU member states. Now, let’s focus on the performance of ILUMA in the EU region. ILUMA continues to drive user acquisition, the switching of existing users and accelerated category growth in both Spain and Switzerland. In Q3 both markets experienced another quarter of strong sequential IMS volume growth, with offtake exit volume of TEREA now the clear majority of HTU sales in both markets. We also launched ILUMA in Greece at the end of June with promising initial results and introduced the product to Portugal earlier this month. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 2.8 points versus the prior year quarter to 23.6%. As in the EU, Q3 last year saw an optical sequential share decline due to combustible seasonality, making the 0.7-point sequential increase this quarter a notable achievement. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This was driven by the impressive performance of IQOS ILUMA and the continued growth in key cities such as Tokyo. The heat-not-burn category now represents over one-third of total tobacco in Japan, with IQOS increasingly driving this year’s growth. IQOS ILUMA celebrated its first anniversary of the Japan national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs continued to grow strongly in Q3 and strengthened their position as both the second largest nicotine brand and largest RRP brand in Japan, reaching an exit offtake share of 14.9%. Encouragingly, SENTIA HTUs have also grown rapidly since the initial launch in April and national expansion in mid-July, driving consumer acquisition in the mainstream price segment. We exited Q3 with over 25% HTU offtake share, a record high, and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which drove around 30% of the Company’s pro forma HTU growth in Q3. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. Strong growth in IMS volumes continued, and the pro forma share of our HTU brands grew 0.9 points versus the prior year quarter to 2.8% in Q3, a robust performance, considering the impact of seasonality. This reflects success across many markets, with notable progress in Lebanon, where Q3 offtake share in Beirut increased by 7 points to 18%, and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 6%. Further key city data can be found in the appendix. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in the Philippines where the government passed a new law clearly differentiating combustible and noncombustible tobacco products. Smoke-free products will be regulated separately, with different health warnings, permitted product testing or guided trials, and rules to be established for product communication and point of sale activities that will support the switching of adult smokers to better alternatives. In addition, the latest development from our smoke-free innovation pipeline is a new heat-not-burn device that is especially relevant for low- and middle-income markets. It is a simple, convenient, and affordable proposition, which can cater to local taste preferences without compromising on the reduced risk profile of the product. We are planning pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines during the fourth quarter, as we further expand our portfolio of smoke-free products to serve different consumer needs. As we continue to innovate, it’s critical to integrate sustainability through eco-design principles, circularity, and efforts to minimize and manage post-consumer waste. Addressing the environmental impact of our products is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy, which is reflected in our sustainability index and forms part of our executive compensation scheme. Our approach to reduce waste related to cigarettes, RRP consumables, devices and packaging is covered in a report, case studies and campaign published last month and available via a dedicated microsite on pmi.com. For example, we are progressing well towards our 2025 aspirations of having at least 80% of our shipment volumes covered by markets with anti-littering programs in place for cigarettes and for over 1 million cumulative smoke-free devices to be refreshed or repaired. Moreover, during September more than 10,000 stakeholders from more than 60 markets joined cleanup initiatives around the world. I am proud of our ESG performance which continues to be recognized worldwide. Our 2021 Low-Carbon Transition Plan and our Business Transformation Strategy were recently nominated for sustainability prizes, and our Chief Sustainability Officer, Jennifer Motles, was nominated for CSO of the year at the World Sustainability Awards. Moving now to perhaps the most impactful news of today, we are delighted to announce that we will soon have full control of IQOS, the world’s leading smoke-free product, in the United States, the world’s largest smoke-free market. As previously communicated, following the ITC decision last year prohibiting the import of IQOS into the U.S., we have been in discussions with Altria to find the best path forward. PMI’s priority has always been to find a solution that best positions IQOS to realize its full potential in the U.S., as quickly as possible. I am excited to report that we have now reached an outcome that achieves this goal. Let me start by briefly summarizing the key terms of the agreement. From April 30, 2024, PMI will have full control over the commercialization of IQOS in the U.S., allowing us to distribute and sell the product, and critically engage directly with adult tobacco users. As part of the agreement, we will pay a total cash consideration of around $2.7 billion to Altria. We believe this agreement represents excellent value to our shareholders, as with the previous agreement potentially stretching to 2029, this solution provides certainty by avoiding what could have been a protracted and uncertain legal process that would have severely held back the development of IQOS. It provides a clear near-term path to commercializing at scale in the U.S., with the unencumbered backing of PMI’s full strategic and financial commitment to the product’s success. IQOS is the world’s leading smoke-free product, with remarkable and rapid growth achieved across a wide range of international markets. From a standing start in 2015, IQOS is already a $9 billion annual net revenue business, having created the attractive heat-not-burn category and driving its growth. The U.S. is the world’s biggest accessible nicotine market by retail value. The estimated retail value of its growing smoke-free market is already around 60% of all international markets combined, excluding China. We have spoken before about our plans to bring a leading portfolio to the U.S. and we expect IQOS to be at the very core of our U.S. smoke-free future, just as it already is elsewhere. The U.S. opportunity for IQOS is particularly encouraging given the clear demand from American adult smokers for credible smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes. Moreover, current smoke-free products have had limited success in fully switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. In the U.S. there are ample opportunities to build adult smoker awareness and understanding of smoke-free product offers, something that is particularly true for IQOS given our MRTP authorizations. We are ready to invest behind IQOS to bring it to market at scale across the U.S., starting with full-scale launches in key cities and regions, with a plan to progress rapidly to national penetration. IQOS remains the only inhalable smoke-free nicotine product to have received a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We know from our experience in over 65 markets worldwide that IQOS’s appeal to adult smokers who have tried the product is strong, as demonstrated by high full switching rates. We have a strong commitment to build awareness and invest behind the category to drive product trial among American smokers. The true potential for IQOS in the U.S. is substantial, as illustrated by the double-digit national shares achieved in just a few years across a number of Asian, European, and other markets, all with varying demographic profiles and adult smoker taste preferences. We believe a volume share of 10% of cigarettes and HTUs by 2030 is very achievable, with potential to go much further. Importantly, the return on investment for IQOS in the highly profitable U.S. tobacco market is compelling. We estimate the total U.S. industry profit pool at over $20 billion, and with average unit margins on U.S. cigarettes more than 3 times greater than for the PMI average, the payback over the next few years on the consideration paid to Altria looks very attractive. As we do not have a legacy cigarette business in the U.S., the opportunity is purely incremental. This also reflects a current excise tax system with no differentiation for heated tobacco products versus cigarettes at the federal level, and differentials on a limited basis in only a handful of states, thus presenting a clear additional opportunity over time. We are already advanced in our plans for IQOS in the U.S., as we prepare for domestic manufacturing and for important regulatory submissions, including for IQOS ILUMA where we plan to file a PMTA in H2 2023. As mentioned previously, we target the first half of next year for the resumption of IQOS domestic supply, which will be available to Altria under our current arrangement up until PMI assumes full commercial responsibility in April 2024. Our proposed combination with Swedish Match would provide certain U.S. sales and distribution capabilities. However, in the case of failure we have a clear path forward for IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio. Indeed, the most critical parts of the IQOS commercial model center on converting adult smokers, rather than distribution. In addition, the U.S. has an established distribution and retail landscape, with a clear route-to-market. We therefore also have concrete plans to proceed autonomously in building fully controlled and managed U.S. sales and distribution capabilities over the next 18 months leading up to April 2024, in order to ensure a successful IQOS roll-out and the introduction of other smoke-free products should our Swedish Match offer fail. Indeed, we believe today’s agreement is fundamental to unlock the U.S. smoke-free market. As we have shared previously, we expect the heated tobacco category to remain the largest and fastest growing in dollar terms internationally. While the e-vapor and, to a lesser extent, nicotine pouch categories have paved the way for smoke-free products in the U.S., we know that heated tobacco comes closest to replicating the experience that smokers enjoy, with higher conversion and very low unintended use. To conclude today’s presentation, our business delivered strong third-quarter and year-to-date performance, despite some challenging headwinds, and we expect to deliver another excellent year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma currency-neutral basis. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance, with strong shipment volume and IMS growth reflecting broad-based momentum in the EU region, Japan, and emerging markets. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA, our rich pipeline of smoke-free innovation, and plans for further launches of both ILUMA and VEEBA in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine, and R&D for long-term growth, as well as behind a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. The return from such investments remains compelling, as demonstrated by the exceptional top- and bottom-line growth delivered over recent years. In addition to growth in smoke-free products, our combustible business continues to perform well, with organic net revenue growth and essentially stable pro forma shipment volumes. Despite accelerated pricing in the current inflationary environment, temporary margin pressure from inflation and supply chain inefficiencies is likely to continue in the coming quarters. Importantly, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with confidence. We have secured our near-term access to the substantial U.S. opportunity for IQOS, also forming the backbone for introducing our broader smoke-free portfolio. We are now advancing on our plans to launch at scale with or without Swedish Match. And finally, we have increased the dividend every year as a public company, through the ups and downs of economic and currency cycles. We continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders, as we advance towards our ambition to become predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Thank you. And before we start the question-and-answer session, please note that we are not able to comment on our offer for Swedish Match beyond what has been announced. All materials related to the offer can be found on the website, smokefreeoffer.com. And Jacek and I, we are now more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: I wanted to ask first, if I could, in relation to the operating margin. And I think it was up, if I have my numbers right, about a -- little over 100 basis points if I exclude foreign exchange and acquisitions year-to-date. And I just want to get a sense when you look at the operating margin now, your expectation being down a little bit for the year. Does that incorporate a weaker fourth quarter operating margin? And I guess to understand what’s behind that, if I have my numbers correct here.
Emmanuel Babeau: No, I don’t think so, Chris. We are organically before ForEx down for the first nine months with a number of impacts that we described due to the situation, of course, of strong disruption on the supply chain coming from the war in Ukraine and the situation in Russia. We have, of course, some element, of course, attached to the development of IQOS ILUMA, and that is, of course, playing. We have a lot of air freight that is impacting the margin. So, you have a number of temporary elements that I’ve been with us since almost the beginning of the year, and that drove the operating margin down. I think that it will take a little bit of time for us to be removed. But we also have seen, for the first line, something that is going to obviously stay with us, which is the inflation. We are seeing an inflation level for the time being around mid-single-digit. It could strengthen further because when we look at the number of inflation in many countries, it is above this mid-single-digit numbers. As we’ve been saying, we are entering into the renewal of a number of contracts that protected us to some extent on the way we are buying energy and the number of components. So, that means that this part of inflation is going to stay. But in Q4, actually, with a more positive mix and some maybe one-off having a lower impact, we are expecting rather a better situation on margin evolution versus the first 9 months. So, that’s the opposite. We expect the Q4 that should be in terms of margin evolution, better than the first nine months.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you. And then just a second question would be, in relation to -- you took your volume estimate up for the year, which is very encouraging. You had a very strong performance year-to-date. There’s been a lot of concerns about trade down activity, the concerns of consumers -- having discretionary spending in particular in Europe and particularly as we move forward, as energy costs continue to remain so high. Are you seeing any signs of that, any break down activity, or anything you could share that would help us get a better feeling for the performance of some of your premium brands? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Chris, it’s Jacek. Not really. If you look at the down trading type of a pressure, we still don’t see really an acceleration of the tracks, right? So obviously, we see the Indonesia, Philippines under pressure. But it’s not much really changed versus what we have seen before. Now, one could argue that in some geographies that the inflation has a bit of a lagging sort of evolution but nothing today. And you could see also from the shows of Marlboro, right, that we will look pretty strong on the premium propositions. Okay? Despite the fact that we’re taking the pricing and there will be pricing -- more pricing to come.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: So, the U.S. is clearly a large growth and profit opportunity for IQOS, and it helps that you don’t have an existing combustibles business here. How would your commercialization strategy in the U.S. change if you came into the U.S. through Swedish Match or independently? And how should investors think about the required level of investment to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. and the impact to your growth algorithm?
Jacek Olczak: So -- I mean what stands behind the success of IQOS is really the front-end consumer interface, right? That’s the commercialization aspect, which makes -- is one of the key elements of IQOS success, which we measure as the highest in the industry rates of conversion and adoption of IQOS and therefore, switching from cigarettes. Swedish Match doesn’t have it, right? Swedish Match is the component of the sales force, which is essentially in store execution, but IQOS success hinges on that business-to-consumer component. So, in above scenario, obviously, that’s the investment, which is front of us, but vis-à-vis a great -- the market size and the profitability pool -- and the profitability pool. So, Swedish Match adds the component of the sales force, which is the in-store execution. Obviously, it would be nice to have them, but this is not something which is unique in a sense that -- you cannot make it or attain it organically, for example, right, or other options can be at the table as well. The uniqueness of an IQOS is again is the commercial engine, commercial activations. If you follow us closer, we have spent enormous effort in behind the consumer journey and automating, digitalizing all touch points with the consumers. And that’s the value which we will be bringing. We’ll have to invest, but the know-how is on our side.
Pamela Kaufman: And then, I have a question about the 90% threshold for the Swedish Match deal, which appears difficult to achieve in most circumstances. Would you consider lowering the threshold in the event that fewer shareholders tender? And what would be the challenges in operating the asset with a lower ownership stake?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we have asked for some understanding, not getting the questions on the Swedish Match deal, like the fact of life is, it is SEK 116 and the 90% acceptance level, okay? And this is where we see the value of Swedish Match, the maximum of the value to Swedish Match today, and I will not comment beyond this whole fact. I think, it is a fair market price, fair valuation of the company for the both, group of the shareholders, PMI shareholders, Swedish Match shareholders, both long term and short term, and we will not comment beyond this one.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: A couple of questions from me. So, first is on the entire plan around IQOS commercialization in the U.S., and let’s assume you are doing it standalone. So, you will have to hire, and I’m looking at some of your competitors, which have a 10% share in the U.S. like Imperial. So, they have a few thousand employees. So, if you have to hire a few thousand employees and then you incur marketing investments, so should we model in like a few-hundred-million-dollar of losses in the first few years before you scale up IQOS to a big enough volume where it starts generating incremental EBIT? Much like you had when you commercialize IQOS around the world, I remember like between ‘15 and ‘17, you had like a few -- like $700 million or $1 billion kind of loss that you had identified at that time. So, is that something similar we should do as you commercialize U.S.?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I mean, look, the directional -- you’re right. I mean, obviously, building the infrastructure looking from a scratch requires several hundred thousands of employees now in the scheme of the 80,000 employees, which PMI has, it’s not the first time that we’re building an organization from scratch. And you’re absolutely right that the initial years, couple of years will be on the laws as frankly speaking, we had with IQOS in every country in which we enter. And you’re following us closely, you know that we have achieved on markets, the faster path to the breakeven that we had in the year one or two of our smoke-free journey versus what we’re achieving today. So, it’s a ton of learnings, it’s tremendous learning and capability in our organization, as I call the internal know-how and the systems, et cetera, which we don’t have to reinvent again. So, we know pretty well the blueprint. A lot of things have been attested, et cetera. So, U.S. market will enjoy or leverage that sort of the things. So, summer next year will come with the more visibility on how we see the spending and the path. I think in the release, we have said that the most logical -- based on our experience and the success on international, most logical milestone near term, so let’s say, 2030’s 10 [ph] share point of the market, which if we see where we are in other places and what we achieved six years after to date versus now I add the six years plus/minus to the current 2030, 10%, I think we will execute accordingly. We have -- and Emmanuel, in his remarks made it very clear. We’ll fully stand behind, including monetary and the human resources to deliver the success -- is well overdue success of IQOS in the U.S.
Gaurav Jain: And a follow-up question on the BAT litigation at ITC, which they won, the patent dispute. So, -- look, so that prevents you from importing IQOS devices, which is why you are now setting up the domestic manufacturing facilities. But, can’t BAT use those patent wins, because clearly, they have established, they have some strength in their patent, and go to a domestic U.S. court and also get injunctions against your selling of IQOS devices in the domestic market? So, I’m trying to understand how do you frame this entire patent litigation even around your domestic IQOS manufacturing and commercialization sort of strategy.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, Gaurav, on that one, we have to clarify. One thing is the ITC process where indeed there was a decision from ITC. But otherwise, on the federal circuit, I would say, for the time being, there is rather success on our side. One of the family of patents that has been claimed by BAT on their case with IT was actually recognized as not valid in front of a U.S. court. So, I don’t think that you can draw a parallel between what happened in the ITC and what is happening on the federal level in the U.S. And we believe that the domestic manufacturing is giving us a clear path and the capacity to reenter the U.S. market.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. And if I could just ask 1 follow-up on what you just said, the IQOS ILUMA device, does it bypass all these patents, which are under dispute?
Jacek Olczak: The case which we have with -- the ITC case with -- started by BAT is with regards to the IQOS 3.0. ILUMA is in a completely different path.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: My first question is on your guidance. Your Q3 came in better than expected, and you took up your full year currency-neutral revenue guidance. But I guess, I’m trying to reconcile this with your lower guidance on IQOS. I guess, this implies you now expect stronger results in your combustible business and possibly greater device sales. So, could you walk through this for us, especially on device sales expectations in the second half, possibly ramping? And if there’s a risk of retail inventory building that could potentially impact results next year?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Bonnie. So no, there is nothing to do with the device in the guidance. You’re right. We have slightly been moving the bracket for the HTUs volume, not massively, were 90% to 92%, and we are now 89% to 91%. So they are still part of the bracket that is the same. Clearly, we see some compensation at the level of a very robust combustible business. I think, I’ve been flagging that in detail in the presentation. And that is giving us this visibility on higher growth in volume than what we were anticipating so far, and we are raising the guidance to plus 2% to 3%. We have been raising the guidance for revenue as well with the low end of the bracket that has been raised to plus 6.5%. And then, we have the same adjusted EPS, notably because we see costs that are probably potentially a bit higher than what we anticipated a few weeks ago. So, that is giving us the same bracket for adjusted EPS. But in a nutshell, that is how the guidance is evolving.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my second question, I -- sorry, I have a follow-up question about the agreement you reached with Altria, maybe asked a little differently. I guess I’m trying to get a sense of how you got comfortable with $2.7 billion payment to Altria, which is quite a large lump sum of money. This is to get your exclusive rights to IQOS back in the U.S. So, how confident are you that you’re going to be able to reach this 10 share in the U.S. market by 2030, especially since it does feel like the ramp will now likely be slower, if you have to go it alone or even with Swedish Match? And then, finally, as it relates to this, how do you think about not being able to use the Marlboro brand name in the U.S. now?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So, with regards to the confidence, Bonnie, is that -- look, this confidence beyond -- or behind IQOS is growing every year, every quarter. I mean, you see the results on the international markets and we have the markets when we -- slower markets, when we faster. But the potential for IQOS, the heat-not-burn is there, okay? So, if we look at the U.S., I don’t think -- I cannot find the reasons why in the U.S. we cannot replicate to come close to the success of international. And the 10%, if you like, the first double-digit number, which we are obtaining after six years in any other geographies and taking into considerations that U.S. starting with IQOS 3 that we will be also working to bring faster the IQOS ILUMA to the U.S. and our international success has been built on IQOS 2.4, 2.4-plus. So, the U.S. is starting the journey with IQOS, the much better moment from a product perspective of our capability perspective, understanding this entire category that we’ve been in our international markets. So, this is what the confidence is coming from. And the second question with regards to the Marlboro, IQOS TEREA in Japan is now by X factor bigger than the HeatSticks Marlboro. And this was the last market, which we still have been using a Marlboro trademark of our heat-not-burn consumables. And as you know, at the very beginning, six or so years ago in a few markets, I recall it was Switzerland and Italy, we started with Marlboro and very early in the journey, we have almost overnight, we branded that thing and we dropped the Marlboro from the brand, from the proposition. And I actually believe that we have a Marlboro in international, and this is a great brand, but on cigarettes. And I have no doubt today that we are on the path that we can make IQOS as iconic brand on a global basis as in the past we have made Marlboro. So, I don’t see this as an impediment or bottleneck in our strategy in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question will come from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: First, I just had a quick administrative question. What is the U.S. dollar equivalent for the revised Swedish Match offer? Should we just use the current exchange rate, or would there be an adjustment for any hedging that might have previously been put in place? And then I have another follow-up.
Emmanuel Babeau: I’m not sure to understand your question, Priya. I mean, the offer is in Swedish krona, so we’ll pay it in Swedish krona. Now, what we’ve been importing is the fact that the price increase that we are offering today corresponds to the impact of the currency fluctuation since the day of the announcement in May between the dollar and the Swedish krona, noting that a significant portion of the cash flow generated by Swedish Match is in dollar. That’s it. So, I’m not sure to understand your question.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: It was just whether -- so when you announced the transaction, the dollar amount would have been $16 billion. And you’re still sort of close to that just given the FX move, but was there any incremental hedging that was put in place?
Emmanuel Babeau: We can make our calculation. We can provide you with a number of shares of Swedish Match and you can make the calculation. So, in dollar terms, I think the amount is slightly lower. But again, please take into account the fact that Swedish Match is not 100% generating cash flow in dollars. Okay? So, you cannot just take the dollar amount at 100%, to be very clear.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: That’s helpful. And then, as we think about sort of the 10% share that you’ve discussed getting to by 2030 in the U.S. market, how much of that includes contribution from ILUMA? I guess, as you put PMTA or submit the PMTA in the latter half of next year, what sort of time line are you assuming around that getting to market and getting nationalized?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean, we’re planning to file for PMTA with ILUMA to FDA next year. So, as we’ve seen recently, the factoring in the timing of outcome of dealing with FDA is a little bit of a challenge. But there will be -- ILUMA, obviously, in this 10%. I won’t give you the number now how much of the 10% is hinging on ILUMA, but let’s take it again differently. We have a few markets very successful, but still very few markets when ILUMA plays the role today in our portfolio. And if you look, for example, for the European Union, almost entirely, the success of six years in commercialization of IQOS is built on the IQOS 2.4, 2.4-plus and at 3, 3.1. So, these are the products which we have a relatively clear path to grow in the U.S. So, there will be ILUMA, but it’s too early now to say how much of the 10% will be there. Obviously, for us, it’s -- ILUMA offers benefits even further than the blade technology. But on the blade technology, this is where we are today, 6 years in PMI. So, I think we’ll -- we don’t have to solve that equation today.
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then, just final question for me. I think, as you discussed the inflationary pressure ramping from some of the contract renewals that you’re going through right now on the input side, how should we think about that headwind? Is it fair to think of that sort of mid-single-digit rising to the high-single-digits? And then, in terms of cadence, is it fair to assume sort of the greatest effect of that being on the first half of calendar ‘23 and then sort of moderating into the back half as you start to lap some of that? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, on the inflationary pressure, of course, very difficult to give a kind of definitive answer because this is a very fluid situation and with significant evolution. Today, if we assume that at a certain point in time, the inflation we are facing will be in line with the inflation that is seen in many countries. Yes, that would probably mean that the mid-single digit could go to high-single digit. It can be a bit more complex than that because, of course, it depends on which kind of element of inflation we are exposed to. But that could be in some areas an evolution for next year. Frankly, too early to say. And also too early to say when is going to be the climax of that. Is it going to be at the end of this year in terms of cost increasing, are we going to see more inflation through 2023? I think it’s too early to say. Of course, for the -- I mean, we’ll monitor the situation, but I would say energy price is energy price, but I mean there is not much we can do. We still need to buy energy. The answer for us is, of course, to react with price increase. And I think you have seen in our Q3, an acceleration of our price increase. We are getting at almost 5%, which is showing the capacity depending on what’s going to be the environment and whatever it is, to mitigate the impact of what we’re going to see on inflationary pressure with price increase.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Jacek Olczak: So, thank you very much for your attention. We’re very happy that we spent our review, especially in this very important moment for us that our key strategy focus -- strategic focus over the last good few months, if not longer, is how to find a much more clear and predictable path to the U.S. has been achieved towards the -- achieving the deal with Altria gaining the full control of IQOS. So, we’re very happy that you spent this hour with us today. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Talk to you soon.
James Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s event. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management sessions, and the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the question-and-answer from the investment community. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 second quarter results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. Consistent with last quarter, figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI’s operations in Russia and Ukraine. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022, and on a comparative basis, PMI will exclude amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James. Welcome to you in your new role, and welcome, everyone. Before I begin, I want to reiterate our focus on supporting our employees and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and above all on the safety of our people. We continue to deploy pledge humanitarian support and additional benefits for our Ukraine employees. As previously announced, we intend to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner, as the complexities of continuing to operate in Russia increase such as supply chain challenges and financial and banking sector restriction. We continue to actively work on options for doing so in the context of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment, including the requirement to obtain certain governmental approval for any transaction. Turning to our business. We demonstrated strong underlying momentum in the second quarter of 2022 with another quarter of positive volume supporting better-than-expected top and bottom line growth. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance and strong Q2 pro forma user growth of more than 1.1 million, demonstrating further sequential acceleration compared to Q1 as device limitation and COVID restrictions continue to ease. This reflects strong momentum in the EU region, Japan and developing market. Q2 RP pro forma net revenues grew by plus 11% despite the adverse shipment timing impact due to supply chain constraints highlighted last quarter, while HTU IMS volumes grew by plus 20%. IQOS ILUMA delivered further impressive results in its first three markets of Japan, Switzerland and Spain. The acceleration in category growth in these diverse geographies highlight the exciting future growth opportunity across the world, including in the latest launch market of Greece. In combustible, robust Q2 pro forma volume growth of plus 2.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 4.2% were driven by Marlboro share gains stronger pricing and the continued recovery of the market. Maintaining leadership of the cigarette category allows us to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives and accelerate our transformation into a predominantly smoke-free business by 2025. We expect the strong underlying momentum of our business in H1 to continue, and we are from an organic growth outlook for the year. We are now well on track to deliver two consecutive years of volume growth, confirming our status as a growth company in terms of volumes, organic net revenues and margins. Despite a substantial currency headwind in 2022, we expect to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS of around $6, including Russia and Ukraine. The proposed addition of Swedish Match would further boost our future financial profile. This is a value-creating offer for both set of shareholders with a compelling strategic and cultural fit, providing an additional opportunity to accelerate our smoke-free future. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q2 volumes grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 1.1% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.2% and by plus 5.3% for total PMI, reflecting both the continued strong growth of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison. As we anticipated and indicated previously, less unfavorable timing of cigarette shipment also played a role, notably due to replenishment of duty-free inventories. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 4.1% in total despite the expected delay of HTU shipments to Japan as we manage through global supply chain disruption. This incorporates combustible pricing of plus 3.5% on a pro forma basis or almost plus 5% excluding Indonesia. Our Q2 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 190 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 150 basis points in total. As expected and communicated in our Q1 quarterly results, this reflects four main factors: first, investment to further expand and match the speed of growth in our smoke-free portfolio. This includes the initial higher cost of ILUMA devices and HTUs and the transitory dilutive margin impact of higher device sales as we roll out ILUMA and replenish distribution channel as device constraint ease to support reaccelerating IQOS user growth. Second, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine, including around $80 million in additional air freight expenses. Third, inflation of around 4% in our cost of goods driven by the global pandemic recovery and exacerbated by the war, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy and transportation costs. And last, a challenging prior year margin comparison, which included substantial cost of goods sold productivity savings. Despite these typical margin challenges, our robust top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enable us to deliver plus 5.6% growth in pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS ahead of expectation to $1.32 and plus 3.8% growth for total PMI to $1.48, including Russia and Ukraine. Looking at the first half of the year now, our volumes grew by plus 4% on a pro forma basis and by plus 2.2% for total PMI. Pro forma revenues grew by plus 8.1% and by plus 7.1% in total, also driven by strong IQOS performance and the recovery of the cigarette category. We delivered organic net revenue per unit growth of plus 4% on a pro forma basis and plus 4.7% in total, again, reflecting the positive impact of growing HT volumes and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis and 90 basis points in total, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We expect better margin performance in H2, a topic I will review it shortly. Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 10.4% to $2.79 on a pro forma basis and plus 9.2% in total to $3.06, an excellent performance given the circumstances. Reflecting this strong momentum, we are raising our guidance for 2022. With strong IQOS growth and robust trends in combustible, we foresee an acceleration in our currency-neutral growth expectation relative to our previous forecast. First, we now expect to grow our total pro forma shipment volume by plus 1.5% to plus 2.5% for 2022, achieving another year of volume growth. For pro forma net revenue, we expect to deliver between plus 6% and plus 8% organic growth as compared to the plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% announced previously, despite a greater-than-anticipated drag from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. With a strong recovery in device volume, the increasing contribution of ILUMA with initially higher unit cost and ongoing global inflation, we are narrowing our forecast for pro forma adjusted organic OI margin expansion to between zero and plus 50 basis points. We are also raising our growth outlook for pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to between plus 10% and plus 12%. This reflects a range of $5.23 to $5.34, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.80 at prevailing rates notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. We'll include a slide in the appendix with further detail on this estimated impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $5.90 to $6.05, reflecting similar dynamic to the pro forma basis and including an estimated $0.69 unfavorable currency impact. Please note our 2022 forecast assumes no contribution from the proposed combination with Swedish Match, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. The outlook for IQOS growth is excellent, and we now expect to deliver full year pro forma HTU shipment volume of 90 billion to 92 billion units, representing the upper half of our previous forecast range. With growth momentum very strong, the main constraint for not further raising our HTU volume target is our production capacity, notably for ILUMA HTUs due to their outstanding initial success and the cancellation of production in Russia as we convert existing production line for induction consumable. We continue to expect excellent HTU growth in the coming quarters with a progressive improvement in ILUMA HTU capacity through the first half of 2023. We are prioritizing ILUMA launch market accordingly with further launches plan in Q4 as communicated previously. A notable further update to our outlook is an increase in our operating cash flow forecast to around $10.5 billion as compared to around $10 billion previously despite notable currency headwinds. This includes our accelerated pro forma earnings growth forecast and an assumed full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine. We delivered robust operating cash flow growth in H1 of plus 14%. And as shown through the challenges of recent years, the cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional. While flatted somewhat in 2021 by favorable timing and one-off impact, our revised full year forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year after also accounting for higher inflation driven working capital requirements and currency. This underlines our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt and invest in the growth of our business. Our net debt of $23 billion at June 30, 2022, decreased compared to both June and December 2021, despite H1 capital expenditure of $0.5 billion and ongoing dividend payment. Our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and we look forward to the additional cash flow, the proposed combination with Swedish Match would bring. We also continue to expect around $1 billion in full year capital expenditure. Moving now to the pro forma outlook for the second half. We expect to deliver strong top line growth, organic adjusted OI margin expansion and further acceleration in bottom line growth. For Q3, we expect mid-single-digit organic top line growth driven by IQOS with around $22 billion in pro forma HTU shipment volumes. While there is a tougher comparison for cigarette and a modest negative impact expected from shipment timing, we expect combustible volume trends to remain resilient by historical standards. Net revenue growth will also continue to be impacted in both Q3 and Q4 by the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. While the temporary cost headwinds in Q2 are expected to ease somewhat in the third quarter, we expect this to be broadly offset by a step-up in smoke-free commercial and R&D investment as compared to a device constraint in Q3 2021. This results in an expected Q3 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.23 to $1.28, including an estimated adverse currency impact of $0.24 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong Q4 with a rebound in HTU shipment volume due to phasing to the most pronounced as HT capacity constraint improve. The H2 recovery in our pro forma adjusted OI margin is also expected to be Q4 weighted. Turning back to our results. Pro forma HTU in-market sales volume grew strongly by plus 20% for both the second quarter and the first half, notably driven by strong performance in the EU region. As expected, Q2 IMS pro forma growth was significantly ahead of shipment volume growth reflecting the later timing of shipments I mentioned earlier. Our total pro forma shipment volume increased by plus 3% for Q2 and plus 4% for H1. As I touched on earlier, this put us well on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. With the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 12.6% of our pro forma shipment volume in H1 or 14% in total despite the anticipated HTU shipment timing impact in Q2. Our sales mix is also changing rapidly as we aim to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 30% of our pro forma total and exceeded 30% for total PMI in the first half of the year. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.2 billion of pro forma H1 RRP net revenues. This reflects higher device volume at a lower average price than last year as we expand our device portfolio with VEEV and ILUMA and price ladder, our blade device portfolio in preparation for the launch of premium position in ILUMA. The positive momentum of IQOS continues and is further accelerating in many geographies, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. We delivered organic growth of plus 8.1% in H1 pro forma net revenues and shipment on growth of plus 4%. This reflects the twin engines driving our top line in addition to volume. The first is pricing led by combustible. The second is the increasing mix of RRPs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continued to deliver substantial growth. This is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerate. Let's now turn to the drivers of our H1 pro forma adjusted OI margin which contracted organically by 110 basis points. Pro forma gross margin decreased by 280 basis points organically, reflecting the factors I mentioned previously, as we invest in our smoke-free business and manage temporary supply chain disruption and cost inflation. This margin headwind was partially offset by better pro forma adjusted marketing administration and reserve costs, which improved by 160 basis points organically. This was driven by the positive operating leverage of RRP growth and successful cost efficiency program where we generated around $420 million in gross cost savings, of which approximately $170 million came from COGS productivity and over $250 million from SG&A. With more than $1.2 billion of savings realized by this halfway point, we are well on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver margin expansion. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs digital engine and R&D for long-term growth as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year outlook, we expect our operating margin trajectory to improve in the second half of the year as temporary headwind and tough comparison in. Focusing now on combustible, our portfolio again delivered growth in pro forma volume and organic net revenue in Q2. Our pro forma shipment volume grew by plus 2.4% against a pandemic affected comparison notably driven by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. In addition, we saw a continued recovery in international duty-free outside Asia as passenger traffic increases. Pro forma combustible pricing of plus 3.5% was slightly ahead of our expectations. And while we remain cautious on the economic outlook, the pricing environment has been gradually improving. We expect to deliver a similar level of pricing for the full year. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and both the positive Q2 and H1 segment share demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. We continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Marlboro becoming the world's leading cigarette brand. With the return of social consumption occasion, Marlboro volumes grew plus 7% year-over-year in H1, with category share again surpassing 10% on a pro forma 12-month rolling basis. Of course, our long-standing success in building Marlboro's brand equity is the strength we are now -- smoke-free product as we make excellent progress with IQOS as the undisputed global smoke-free leader. The positive combination of a stable share in combustible and the continued growth of IQOS position us to deliver total market share growth over time. We capture plus 40 basis points of pro forma share gain in Q2 including gains in duty-free, Italy, Japan and Turkey. Moreover, PMI HTU strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present with a 7.5% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 19 million IQOS users as of June 30 on a pro forma basis. This reflects very strong growth of over plus 1.1 million users in Q2 and plus 2.2 million in H1, a record first half high on this basis. The acceleration of IQOS user growth compared to both Q1 and last year was driven by the reactivation of acquisition and retention program in many markets as device supply constraint receded as well as the impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. While device supply constrained has eased in recent quarter, this is largely due to the success of our own proactive effort. The global supply of semiconductors remain tight, and we continue to closely monitor and manage the situation. In the EU region, we are now approaching the milestone of 9 million IQOS users, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition and retention, along with the launch of ILUMA in Switzerland and Spain. Our second quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.6 points to 7.1% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. As noted in prior years, sequential share compared to Q1 was affected by the usual seasonality of the combustible market with the additional element of a strong year-over-year combustible recovery this quarter. Most importantly, IMS volume continued to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second half. The strong performance includes excellent user and volume growth across the region with notable contribution from Italy and Poland. Now to give some further color on our progress in the region. This slide shows a selection of the latest key city of Texas in Q2. Despite the denominator effect of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. Most impressive is Venus, the first city in the world to surpass 40% share while Athens, Budapest and Rome are in the mid- to high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by the results in London, Vienna and Zurich. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA is driving -- and our share of market continues to increase in key cities such as Tokyo. Most importantly, our IMS volume trends remained strong with continued sequential growth. As indicated last quarter, Q2 shipments were lower due to timing factors and should recover in the second half with a weighting towards Q4. The adjusted share for our H2 brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.9% in Q2 despite seasonality. While we are very pleased with these results, our share performance could have accelerated even further. The combustible category was notably resilient in the quarter and our rollout of mainline price entire HTUs for use with ILUMA was slightly slower than initially planned. However, early results were encouraging is designed to cater to its consumers switching to ILUMA and more price-conscious legal-age smokers. We also observed an increase in legal-age users switching from low price competitive product. We estimate users of competitive offering to have less average daily consumption due to lower full conversion, which we believe ILUMA should improve over time. The heat-not-burn category now represents around 1/3 of total tobacco in Japan with IQOS increasingly driving this year's growth. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth in low and medium income market. The pro forma share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, continued to grow and reach 2.9% in Q2, reflecting sustained growth in IMS volume. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. A prime example of this are Lebanon where Q2 of take share in Beirut increased by plus 8.1 points to 17.4%, and Egypt where off-take share in Cairo reached around 5% after launching less than one year ago. Other notable successes include the recently launched market of Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia and the Philippine despite pandemic restriction in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, which continued to drive increased conversion and retention rate across initial launch market. In Japan, ILUMA continued to exhibit strong growth with premium priced TEREA HTUs growing rapidly to become the second largest tobacco brand, reaching an off-take share of 14.6% within nine months of national launch. Encouragingly, SENTIA off-take share has already surpassed the level of prefectures covering around 45% of industry volume. The expansion of our device portfolio with ILUMA 1 in Q1 has also seen robust traction with legal smokers. We exited Q2 with a record high of tech share and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan for ILUMA over the coming quarters. ILUMA and TEREA HTUs also continue their super start in Spain and Switzerland. We launched ILUMA in Spain in March 2022 with very positive initial results, notably in key cities such as Barcelona and Madrid. Sequential IMS volumes grew by 27% in Q2. TEREA exited the quarter, making up over 50% of HTU sales only four months after commercialization and our national HTU share has grown to plus 1.7%. This is especially encouraging as Spain has been a market where regulatory restriction had limited the speed of IQOS growth. In Switzerland, the demand for ILUMA remains very strong. IMA's volume continued to grow sequentially, increasing plus 13% in the second quarter. A significant proportion of existing users have upgraded to ILUMA and the off-take exit volume of TEREA now exceeds 70% of our HTU sales. We continue to expand our global smoke-fee portfolio through our rich pipeline of innovation. We launched ILUMA in Greece in late June with further market launches planned for Q4. With regard to our new heat-not-burn device tailored to low and middle income market, we continue to plan pilot launches in the fourth quarter, further expanding our portfolio to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV continued to deliver encouraging results, and for example, is now the established number two closed-pod brand in Italy with off-take share growing sequentially to around 20%. This is a premium proposition with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30% as we pursue differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. In Q2, we expanded into three additional geographies, including France, and are now present in 10 markets. The latest addition to our e-vapor portfolio is the VEEBA disposable device. Responsibly marketed disposable e-vapor product can play an important role as a convenient hassle-free entry into the smoke-free category for legal-age smokers. VEEBA was recently launched in Canada with nine varieties. Our geographic expansion of smoke-free products also continued in Q2 with the launch of IQOS in Bahrain. Of course, the biggest potential near-term addition to our smoke-free portfolio is the proposed combination with Swedish Match. This would deliver a major acceleration in our transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The visions of our two companies are aligned in working towards a smoke-free future without cigarette and would create a global smoke-free champion. If completed, we would have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership position in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine with potential for accelerated international expansion. Another competing rationale for this deal is a large, attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market. Swedish Match as the leading nicotine pouch franchise, with ZYN, and a substantial U.S. operational platform, which would help us unlock the significant opportunity across other more categories over the coming years. This would be a strong strategic and cultural fit, offering significant shareholder value creation over the medium and long term. As stated in the offer document published on June 28, the waiting period for the transaction under the U.S. antitrust process has expired, meaning that we have satisfied our requirement in the U.S. to proceed with the transaction. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholders acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2021 integrated report published in May, which outlines our new sustainability strategy and ESG performance in detail as we continue to transform for good. Included in the report is our new sustainability index comprised of 19 KPIs across our most material sustainability issues. The index is weighted towards product transformation and now represents 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. The definitions, methodology and scope of each of these KPIs are included in our recently published ESG KPI Protocol, providing further transparency on how we define success and major ESG performance. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the science-based target initiative as today validated our 2040 net-zero target. The initiative also revalidated our near-term 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gas emission and our new 2025 target for 15% of our suppliers by spend to have their own Science-Based Target by 2025 a very positive development, given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. To support the achievement of these targets, we are accelerating progress to decarbonize our chain, and we have made eight more factory carbon neutral this year, more than doubling from last year and placing us on track to meet our goal of all factories by 2025. Finally, product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free product compared to smoking. We continue to support policy and fiscal framework that recognize a positive impact tobacco harm reduction policy can have on public health. Recent examples include a further multiyear tax plan with differentiated treatment for smoke-free products in Romania and statement from the Belgian Superior Health Council on the whole e-vapor product can play in switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. To conclude today's presentation, we have delivered a strong first half despite some challenging headwinds, placing us well on track to deliver robust volume growth and an accelerated currency-neutral pro forma financial performance in 2022. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA. Increased consumer satisfaction is driving higher retention and conversion, and we look forward to further market launches later this year. Our combustible business continues to perform well with pro forma volume and organic net revenue growth, maintaining our share of market over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternative and to invest for long-term growth in the development of innovative wellness and health care product will seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. We continue to enrich our pipeline of smoke-free innovation, such as ILUMA and VEEBA to expand and grow across new and existing category and geography. We are raising our pro forma growth guidance for the full year and expect to deliver around $6 in total adjusted in total adjusted diluted EPS, including Russia and Ukraine despite currency headwinds. Importantly, with an excellent 2021 performance and our strong 2022 outlook, we now expect to comfortably exceed our 2021-2023 minimum CAGR target on a pro forma basis of more than plus 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than plus 5% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenue in 2025 also remains fully intact. We are confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Finally, we continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our top priority for capital allocation remain reinvestment in the business and our progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong cash flow generation. Thank you and we are now more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Pamela Kaufman: I wanted to get a sense for what's contributing to the strong IQOS new user momentum that you've experienced in the last two quarters. Is there anything that you're doing differently? And where are you adding these users geographically? How much is driven by ILUMA versus prior IQOS devices? And then related to that, what do you estimate new user growth would be if you were not constrained by production capacity?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Pamela. So we are obviously -- and I said it very pleased with the performance of IQOS, and that is certainly being reflected in the very strong user growth of more than 1.1 million in the second quarter. We said that for H1, it's a record growth. The good news is that we are really growing across geographies. So of course, we have a number of countries such as Italy, Poland, Japan, because their size, of course, they contribute more in the quarter. But the reality is that we see very good trends across geographies. And I could mention countries such as Romania, Portugal, Hungary, I mean, these are all countries of smaller size but where the growth is really impressive. So I think it's a tribute to the fact that IQOS is making some clear customer expectation, the fact that people realize all the benefits they can get by switching from combustible cigarettes to the IQOS product. There is certainly ILUMA contributing. But as you know, we are unfortunately today, limited in the number of geographies where we propose ILUMA. It's Japan Switzerland and Spain. We've been launching Greece. So that is certainly in this country, helping the performance. But to be very clear, the performance is across the board, as I said, and including country where we haven't launched yet ILUMA. So certainly, we are improving the way we deliver a great customer experience, including digital customer, how we contact smokers, how we get in touch with them, how we start the dialogue, how we explain the benefit of IQOS and how we are leading them in the journey from moving away from combustible products to IQOS. So no doubt, we continue to improve our commercial engine, and that is helping. There is probably the impact of awareness, visibility that is growing. There are markets where when you start to reach a certain market share, IQOS become visible, more visible, you go in bars, you go in events, you go in social gathering, you see more and more people, and that triggers what we call organic growth, people who wants to discover by themselves about IQOS. They want to learn, friends explaining how it works and why they really enjoy IQOS. We are also accelerating innovation. We have been proposing new devices. We are proposing new type of references. So, we are enlarging the choice and that make probably IQOS even more desirable and attractive. So that's really, I think, all the powerful driver behind the success of IQOS. Now if I focus on ILUMA and what is the potential with more ILUMA capacity, we see it in the three markets where we have been launching. ILUMA is resolving the remaining pain point that was -- that are existing on the previous version of IQOS. It's certainly coming with a great customer experience. It is increasing the conversion, the loyalty. We expect it to increase the average daily consumption as well and to significantly reduce our [indiscernible]. We see the customer Net Promoter Score improving in the countries. So that is obviously bringing more momentum in the country where we are launching ILUMA. And I think we should see it as a kind of second stage of the rocket that we are going to launch in the various countries to sell IQOS even higher, and that we expect in the various countries where we're going to launch in the coming quarters.
Pamela Kaufman: That's very helpful. I also wanted to get a sense for how you would characterize your current appetite for additional acquisitions in the near-term in light of the Swedish Match transaction. There are additional assets for sale in the U.S. market. Are you in a position to consider more acquisitions?
Emmanuel Babeau: Today, we are focusing on Swedish Match. The time line is the one we were expecting at the beginning. We continue to expect the closing of the transaction in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. Nothing has changed. We are focusing on that. Am I closing the door in the future on other things that would further accelerate our journey to become a leading and successful smoke-free company? No. But clearly, the priority and the focus today is on Swedish Match.
Operator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on your pro forma adjusted OP margin in Q2. It declined on an organic basis. And you did highlight that the drag on your margins, at least partly was from the higher cost of ILUMA devices and then HTUs. And then you also lowered your full-year OP margin guidance. So just hoping you could give us a sense of how long margins could be negatively impacted, I guess, from the rollout of ILUMA. And just based on your FY '22 guidance, which does imply lower year-over-year EPS growth in the second half, I assume the drag on margins could be a key driver of this in the second half, but I just wanted to verify that? And just kind of thinking out into 2023, should the drag sort of ease? Or will that continue as you keep pushing on ILUMA?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Thanks, Bonnie for the question. So I mean, that's true that in H1, we've seen a number of headwinds on the margin. Needless to say that inflation, of course, is one. And we said that we are seeing around 4% inflation on our input cost. So I guess it's probably lower than inflation that we see in many countries, but that's significant. Obviously, we have costs that are coming from the disruption in the supply chain, notably coming from the war in Ukraine. We have a dramatic acceleration of air freight that is, of course, temporary. We're not going to keep air shipping on the long term. But during a period of time, we need to do that, and it's very costly at the time where the cost of freight is globally, not only for air but globally going up. So we are obviously being impacted. So that is having an impact here. And then there is a launch of ILUMA at the beginning, notably in Japan, where we had a very, very strong investment, which was really important to make on the device. And we have two devices now offering -- three device, actually, three models in Japan, and the strong volume in device has an impact on the margin level. On top of that, we said it since the beginning, we don't start the launch of ILUMA with optimized cost and weight on TEREA and on SENTIA. And that is coming at the beginning with a negative impact on margin which something that is temporary as well. So we expect in the course of 2023 seems to gradually improve. So inflation is not temporary. I think for the rest, a lot of the headwinds that we are seeing in H1 are temporary, and there will be a recovery in the future. I'm not able at that stage and we do that, of course, as we are gaining visibility to phase it in the coming quarter, but that's certainly what we that's what we are expecting. And then clearly, for H2, we are expecting an improvement on the margin. Certainly, that would be skewed to a large extent to Q4, but already the deterioration in Q3 on the gross margin would be lower, but there will be more investment as we know we are just following the growth, and we are putting the right level of investment to cope with the growth. Q4, we'll be clearly seeing a better improvement with the better mix. Remember, we've been impacted also on the margin by the fact that the volume that we should have been shipping and it should have been the P&L to Japan, and that are having a very nice margin are not in the P&L. And so of course, it's another one-off that was impacting H1, but we will have the compensation in H2. So, yes, difficult beginning of the year, it doesn't mean that everything will be back to normal in H2. That will be still with some headwind. But clearly, most of what we are facing is temporary, and they will be over time, a recovery on the margin.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That all makes sense. And yes, definitely a lot of moving parts. So that was helpful. And then just my second question is on your proposed acquisition of Swedish Match, I guess, could you give us a little more color on where things are? And then maybe what you see as potential risks of this transaction not happening? I guess I'm asking, thinking about the activist involvement other words, I guess, I'd like to hear how committed are you to this transaction? And how much flexibility do you have in terms of your leverage? I don't think you have a a target leverage ratio, but you've stated in the past you want to maintain your investment-grade ratings. So just maybe wanted to get a sense from you of what the rough, I guess, threshold for that leverage would be to maintain that.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. What I can tell you on Swedish Match is, first of all, to repeat that we have cleared the U.S. requisite in terms of regulatory approval. So that is behind us. For the rest, the processes are still ongoing in several jurisdictions according to plan. And we are confirming the fact that we expect what we said in beginning closing in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. And here, I would like to reiterate the fact that we believe that this is a very compelling offer for Swedish Match shareholder. Can I remind everybody that we offered a 40% for the premium at the time of the announcement in May, since then, the markets have been quite volatile, most of them going down, and that this offer has been approved by the Board of Swedish Match, which was confirming the fact that they thought it was compelling for their shareholders. So that's what I have to say on Swedish Match. And I have no other comment to make.
Operator: We will take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris Growe: I just had a question for you first on the timing of shipments across the second half. You've talked about the -- just over 2 billion sticks that shifted to the second half of the year. Does that shift mostly to the fourth quarter as we're thinking about your guidance for IQOS shipments in 3Q versus what's implied for the fourth quarter?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Chris, if I can try to help you, what we expect in Q3 is shipment to be much more in line with the underlying growth that we have seen on the IMS in H1, which was around 20%. So that's what we expect in shipment, but we don't expect the recovery of the shipments that have been missing in H1. We expect this recovery in Q4, where we continue to expect very strong dynamism of IQOS consumables. But then the shipment will be in Q4 above IMS to broadly align for the year, shipment and IMS. So that is the phasing that we expect for the year.
Chris Growe: Okay. And just one other question on relation to device sales. They've been a little elevated here as you had more availability. Does that remain elevated even in, say, the first half of '23 as you continue to build your availability of devices? And is that the right time line to think about the point where you'll have, let's call it, full availability of devices is in the first half of '23 based on the chip shortage?
Emmanuel Babeau: I think you have two elements, Chris, here. The first one, remember, we had some constraint on device availability that started in Q2, some impact in Q3 and last year. So of course, there is an increase in the device level this year based on low comps. So that's the first element. And I think it's really important to realize how important it is to make sure that smokers can have access to IQOS device to get converted. So I think it's important that we make commercial effort here. And I think we're doing that well. And we see that our device versus maybe some device from the competition is clearly getting a better conversion. On top of it and then the second element, it is clear that with ILUMA, there is a wave of replacement. So, we see in the markets where we launched ILUMA, a rapid replacement of existing IQOS blade device by IQOS ILUMA. And that -- this wave of replacement is creating a very strong one-off acceleration in the level of device. When people will be equipped when the core consumer will be equipped that will be behind us, but we have to go through that. And that is having, again, on a temporary basis, a negative impact on the margin.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer: So my first question has to do with the proposed elimination of menthol variants in the EU for heat-not-burn products. Could you please offer some color on your menthol mix in that geography, and then secondly, an outlook on the timing of that proposal? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, I'm not sure we disclosed the component of menthol. Of course, that's a minority of our business. What I can say about that is that we have to understand that this is a move in application from the TPD in Europe. So it's not a decision. It's an application based on the TPD of 2014, which in certain circumstances was planning for a kind of automatic ban to be implemented. Now this still needs to be approved by the parliament and by the European Council that will be in front of these two bodies later on in 2022, and we'll see what is the final decision. To be very clear, it already has happened on a combustible business with almost no impact or very limited impact. So, the consumer reorganize their taste and they switch to other products, but very limited impact. And therefore, it isn't clear that this will have a meaningful impact if it happens on our heat-not-burn business. In addition to that, we believe that we have superiority in our tobacco taste versus competition, and that's the superiority of our technology with IQOS versus the technology of the competition. So that will mean if we are left with tobacco taste that our product will look great versus competition for people who may decide to go for new product, if they have to abandon on flavor. So we are, of course, waiting to see what are the development. But as you can hear, I guess, from my comments, we have limited concern on that matter.
Vivien Azer: Certainly. And my follow-up question is on IQOS in the U.S. If we can just revisit the timing of reintroducing that product into the marketplace, please? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. We expect to be in a position to introduce IQOS in H1 of 2023. I cannot be more precise at this stage. We continue to work on the plan to be able to do that. And of course, we'll keep you posted when we have more clarity and more precise reintroduction date.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.
Gaurav Jain: So a couple of questions from me. One is on Russia. So, the way you're now guiding, you are including Russia for the full year and earlier, you had included Russia just for Q1. So can you still export devices into Russia, IQOS devices because you still have IQOS shipments there? And also, can you take cash out of Russia to pay the dividends, which you are paying in USD?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav. So yes, I confirm that we can still export our device, not covered by sanction. And therefore, you have many parts of the business that are disrupted on the supply chain, but that one for the time being because, of course, you never know how this can evolve, is not impacted. On the payment of the dividend, I'm not able to tell you because we did not try to pay a dividend. So I'm not able to answer. What I can tell you is that for the time being, we've been making the usual payment between our subsidiary and in terms of procurement in terms of any kind of royalties or intercompany normally. So that's what I can tell you at that stage.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. And my second question is on the Canadian market. So clearly, you do not consolidate Canada, but you give the volume numbers. So the market is down 16% in 1H '22 and 19% in Q2. And the retail pricing, I think, is 6% to 7%, which is not out of ordinary. And then you have mentioned in the e-cigarette cannibalization and you have launched Viva, the disposable device in Canada. So what's exactly happening in Canada? Is it that e-cigarettes are now growing very fast and cannibalizing the market? Could you just help us understand that?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. I think that is a market where you may have some basis of comparison and some one-off element, but the trend is clearly don't take the minus 60% as a reference for the market. But clearly, the trend is for combustible business to go down and for smoke-free product, including vaping, but our ambition is also to grow fast heat-not-burn to develop nicely as a substitute to combustible. That's a market on which things are moving rapidly.
Operator: I would now like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you very much for participating to this call today. We were delighted to share the very good progress that we are making on IQOS and on becoming a smoke-free company despite of fact, of course, the challenges that you all know. And we look forward to talk to you soon. Thank you very much.
James Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a nice day.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter and 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the question-and-answer from the investment community. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI’s operations in Russia and Ukraine. In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma, Vectura Group and OtiTopic. On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma, which consolidates these entities. The operating results of this new business are reported in the Other category. Business operations of our Wellness and Healthcare business are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical segments. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek. 1
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Recent months have been extremely challenging for many of us given the tragic events related to the war in Ukraine. I would like to express our sadness and solidarity for the people of Ukraine. Our primary concern is for our employees and their families and we have been doing everything we can to support them, with three priorities. First, evacuating our colleagues, we have evacuated over 1,000 colleagues and family members from the country and supported more than 2,700 others to move from conflict zones to locations away from the heaviest fighting. Second, we are delivering critical aid to people that cannot leave or who decided to remain in Ukraine. And third, we are providing accommodation, immediate assistance and a path forward to those who left the country. In addition, we have already contributed around $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country, directly to humanitarian organizations and through our own employee-led initiative, Projects With a Heart. This includes providing medicine, food, clothes, and a variety of other items to our colleagues and to the broader population, the purchase of 25 ambulances and the set-up of a mobile hospital. Based on our current visibility, we estimate an additional cost of around $25 million for additional support to employees this year. Our colleagues in neighboring countries continue to provide vital support to all people arriving from Ukraine to seek refuge. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to everyone involved in these generous efforts to help at such a difficult time. In terms of the impact on our business operations, production at our Ukraine manufacturing facility in Kharkiv remains suspended. While business activities in Eastern Ukraine have been mostly heavily impacted, we have seen some resumption in areas where conditions allow as we seek to maximize product availability and service to consumers, using existing inventories on hand. We are also now planning to import products from other manufacturing locations, although this may involve higher costs. We continue to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and to provide substantial in-kind support to them and their families. As communicated in our March 24 press release, PMI’s board of directors and senior executive team are working on options to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner in the context of a complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment. This is no easy task in view of recently introduced complex legislation, but we are committed to seeking a viable path to exit the market while supporting our employees in Russia throughout this period. It is also clear that we cannot continue business as usual in light of regulatory and supply chain disruption, which has already impacted the Russian business in Q1. We have taken concrete steps to scale back our operations, such as the cancellation of all new investments and product launches, including IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV. We are delisting 25% of our cigarette products, including Marlboro and Parliament SKUs. We have also canceled the $150 million investment in capacity to ultimately manufacture more than 20 billion TEREA sticks for IQOS ILUMA in our Russian factory. Clearly, the impact of the conflict has also created disruption in global supply chains and exacerbated inflationary pressures in certain materials and services. However, the Q1 performance and outlook for our business excluding Russia and Ukraine remains strong. On a reported basis our outlook conservatively assumes no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. To provide a consistent view, given the uncertainty and volatility of these two markets, we will now also provide adjusted results and guidance on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the prior and full current year. I will now hand over to Emmanuel to cover this in more detail.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. We delivered a very strong performance in Q1, with double-digit organic net revenue and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma basis, excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the current and prior year quarter. Overall currency-neutral results were also ahead of our expectations. Our IQOS business delivered an excellent quarter, continuing the reacceleration seen last quarter as device supply constraints continue to ease. Our IQOS user base grew by more than 1 million excluding Russia and Ukraine, marking a very strong performance. RRP pro forma net revenues grew by 23%, with pro forma smoke-free net revenues over 30% of the total company. Importantly, pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew plus 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects excellent progress in the EU Region, continued growth in Japan as well as over 50% growth in low and middle income markets. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present as our efforts on innovation, portfolio and geographic expansion drive consumer trial and adoption. The impressive start for IQOS ILUMA continues in Japan and Switzerland, with very encouraging initial take-up in our latest launch market of Spain. The initial success in these three very different markets reaffirms our confidence in ILUMA as an exciting future growth driver for our company. Meanwhile, our combustible business performed robustly, exceeding our objective of stable category share and delivering positive volume and organic net revenue growth. In addition to supporting strong financial performance, this also enhances our ability to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives. Overall, our business is off to a strong start and while currency is unfavorable in 2022, we expect to deliver another year of robust organic top and bottom line growth. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 net revenues grew organically by plus 9% in total and plus 10% on a pro forma basis. This reflects total volume growth driven by the underlying strength of IQOS, the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison and some positive timing impacts, including inventory movements. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew 5.3% and by plus 4.9% on a pro forma basis, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix, higher device volumes, and pricing. Combustible pricing was above expectations at plus 2.9% pro forma or around plus 6% also excluding Indonesia. Our total Q1 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 30 basis points and by 40 basis points excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects a lower gross margin compared to a tough prior year comparison where productivity was higher mostly due to timing factors. As flagged in our full year earnings, Q1 margins were impacted by higher device sales for increasing IQOS user acquisition, channel replenishment and IQOS ILUMA. As mentioned previously, the unit cost and weight of ILUMA consumables and device cost is initially higher as we ramp up production, with improvement expected from next year. Inflation in certain elements of our supply chain, including energy, wages and direct materials and an increase in the use of air freight, was also exacerbated by the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite these temporary margin challenges, we saw positive effects of the increasing size of IQOS, pricing, and cost efficiencies combined with our strong net revenue growth. This enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.56, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing plus 14% currency-neutral growth. This was comfortably ahead of our currency-neutral expectations, even accounting for timing benefits of around $0.06. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 grew by plus 16%. Turning now to our 2022 outlook. As Jacek mentioned, given the lack of visibility on Russia and Ukraine, we are now providing an adjusted outlook on a pro forma basis excluding these two markets for the entire year. With our underlying business reaccelerating, our growth fundamentals remain strong. Importantly, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% compared to 2021 pro forma adjusted net revenues of $29.2 billion. This is above our previous forecast trajectory for total PMI, despite an approximate half-point drag from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. This range incorporates the risk of supply chain disruption for certain materials, a somewhat slower TEREA production capacity build-up due to the production cancellation in Russia, part of which was designated for export, the remaining uncertainty on full device availability, and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. We expect our pro forma adjusted operating income margin to be organically zero to plus 100 basis points higher for the full year. As mentioned at full year results, we expect a lower gross margin as we invest in new innovations and incur temporarily higher unit and transportation costs for the fast growth of ILUMA. Since then, we have observed increased inflation in raw material and energy prices, and additional supply chain costs due to war-related disruptions including a temporary increase in air freight for both HTUs and select cigarette products. Higher expected device sales from the tremendous uptake of IQOS ILUMA, and easing of device supply constraints also have an initial dilutive margin impact. Despite these added headwinds, and a further expected COGS increase of around $300 million compared to our initial expectations we remain confident that we will achieve organic pro forma margin expansion as our strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and cost savings initiatives deliver sustainable accretion. We forecast pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 9% to plus 11%, also above our prior total PMI full year guidance. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.35 to $5.46, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.63 at prevailing rates. This compared to our previous 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $6.12 to $6.30 provided in February, with the difference primarily reflecting the exclusion of Russia and Ukraine and an incremental unfavorable currency impact. The underlying IQOS growth outlook remains excellent. On a pro forma basis, we expect to deliver between 88 billion and 92 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 20% to plus 25% growth over the pro forma prior year of 73.5 billion units. This excludes the nearly 5 billion units shipped in Russia and Ukraine in Q1, and while we conservatively assume no further such contribution from April 1, this implies a total outlook of 93 billion to 97 billion units for the year. We continue to expect pro forma HTU shipments to be modestly ahead of IMS for the year, after lagging behind in the second quarter as I’ll explain later. As outlined in today’s release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and HTUs, excluding Russia, Ukraine, U.S. and China, to decline by up to minus 1%. Given our leadership in smoke-free products, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, as well as stabilizing share in combustibles, we expect to gain share. We therefore target positive total PMI pro forma shipment volumes, within a range of flat to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pro forma pricing of around plus 3%, now including the adverse impact from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. The pricing environment is improving, including in Indonesia, although challenges remain due to ongoing pandemic-related impacts and disposable income pressures. Our other assumptions include around $10 billion in operating cash flow and a effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures of around $1 billion. Despite the impact of the war in Ukraine, our balance sheet remains strong and we remain steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With regard to the phasing of pro forma performance this year, we expect a robust H1 overall, with margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS growth weighted to the second half. In large part, this reflects the reacceleration of IQOS as device supply constraints ease, with a sharp recovery in device volumes as we replenish channel inventories for user acquisition and we supply the accelerated ILUMA replacement cycle in Japan. In addition, our average device price is lower than the prior year, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition, including the broadening of our device portfolio with LIL and ILUMA ONE. While our devices continue to be priced at a meaningful premium to heavily discounted competitive offerings, we have already seen encouraging signs in stabilizing our high category share. Moreover, as we adjust our supply chain flows to prevailing global disruptions in various materials and logistic services, combined with the effects of the war in Ukraine, there may be a risk of short out-of-stock situations on certain cigarette SKUs in select markets, and we are making adjustments to some products to reflect the availability of specific materials. The reorganization of supply chain flows will contribute to the later timing of shipments to certain markets. We notably expect Q2 to be impacted by a number of temporary or specific factors, including the reversal of certain Q1 timing benefits. Organic pro forma net revenue growth is expected to be low single-digit, with other notable factors including the delayed timing of HTU and cigarette shipments to Japan with an approximate 2 point drag on growth, and a further impact from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey, where the Q2 exchange rate comparison is accentuated. We expect total PMI pro forma HTU shipments of around 20 billion in Q2, partly reflecting around 3 billion less HTU shipments to Japan than originally planned. This compares to 18.7 billion pro forma in Q2, 2021. We expect these 3 billion units to move to H2, generating a further growth acceleration in the third and fourth quarters. For Q2 pro forma operating margins, the disproportionate impact of the catchup in device shipments will be accompanied by a corresponding step-up in commercial investments as we support the reacceleration of IQOS user acquisition over the coming quarters. In tandem with the negative mix impact of lower shipments to Japan, the highest expected quarterly increase in air freight costs of over $80 million, and other supply chain adjustment costs, we expect margins to contract further, before a significant recovery in the second half. These dynamics are reflected in our expectation of H1 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.70, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36 at prevailing rates. This represents currency-neutral growth of 5% to 7% compared to $2.86 in the prior year. In combination with our strong first quarter, H1 pro forma top line performance is expected to deliver organic growth of 5% to 7% overall. In H2, the powerful drivers of pricing, scale and efficiencies, and the receding of temporary cost headwinds, should outweigh inflationary pressures to deliver strong top line growth, organic margin expansion and an acceleration in bottom-line growth. Our strong 2022 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2021, 2023 CAGR targets on a pro forma basis of more than 5% in organic net revenue growth, and more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross cost savings by 2023, which is especially important given global inflationary pressures. Importantly, our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenues in 2025 remains intact. We remain confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Turning back to our Q1 results, total shipment volumes increased by 3.5% on a total PMI basis and by 4.9% pro forma. This reflects continued strong broad based pro forma growth of plus 18.4% as user acquisition reaccelerates from the Q3 2021 supply-driven slowdown; and an increase of plus 3.2% in pro forma cigarette volumes reflecting the continued recovery of the total industry and of our category share. The transformation of our business towards smoke-free products continues at a rapid pace. Heated tobacco units comprised almost 13% of our total pro forma shipment volumes in the first quarter, as compared to 11.6% in full year 2021. Our sales mix is also evolving rapidly, as we become majority smoke free company. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our pro forma total in Q1, compared to 27.9% for full year 2021. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of Q1 RRP pro forma net revenues, reflecting higher year-over-year device volumes as supply constraints ease and ILUMA performs strongly. We delivered organic growth of plus 10% in Q1 pro forma net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 4.9%. This growth reflects the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing, led by combustibles. The second is the increasing mix of regulatory projects in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth; an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let’s now turn to the driver of our Q1 pro forma OI margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Our pro forma gross margin decreased organically by 250 basis points reflecting the factors I mentioned earlier. Conversely, our pro forma adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 210 basis points better organically, due to the positive operating leverage of IQOS growth and successful cost efficiency programs. We generated around $180 million in gross cost savings in the first quarter, with around $80 million in COGS productivities and $100 million from SG&A. This makes over $1 billion since the start of 2021, already over halfway towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth, and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver solid margin progression. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine and R&D, as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year guidance, we expect our operating margin progression to improve over the course of the year as temporary headwinds and tough comparisons ease. Our combustible portfolio performed well in Q1, with robust pro forma growth in volumes and organic net revenues. This notably reflects a further recovery in Indonesia and the Philippines, supporting an expectation of organic net revenue growth and broadly stable volumes in our South and Southeast Asia region this year. Increased travel also supported volume growth in Spain and Duty Free. Our share of the combustible category continued to recover with a plus 0.4 point pro forma gain in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This includes gains in Japan, Turkey and Duty Free as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and social consumption resumes with Marlboro share plus 0.3 points higher. While the category is declining over time, our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. In terms of our overall market share now, ongoing gains for our IQOS portfolio create continued positive momentum. We delivered pro forma share growth in Q1 as expected, including gains in Italy, Duty Free, Egypt, Germany and Poland. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in the markets where they are present with a 7.5% share excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes the number one position in six markets. Moving now to the IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 17.9 million IQOS users as of March 31, excluding Russia and Ukraine, which had an estimated 4.8 million users at December 31, 2021. This reflects pro forma growth of more than 1 million users, a phenomenal performance by historic standards. This was driven by the resumption of consumer programs in many markets as device supply constraints receded, capitalizing on the strong underlying demand for the brand, as also evident in the very impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. We estimate that 71% of total IQOS users outside Russia and Ukraine or 12.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. We were also very encouraged by the FDA’s recent MRTP order for IQOS 3, with the full range of authorized IQOS products now classified as modified risk tobacco products. In the EU Region, first quarter HTU share reached 7.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, representing a first quarter share gain of 2 points, including a small benefit from the timing of inventory movements. Adjusted IMS volumes also continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second quarter, noting that the usual seasonality of the combustible market combined with the reversal of Q1 inventory movements is expected to result in a lower sequential share in Q2. This very good performance includes strong user and volume growth across the region, with especially notable contributions from Italy and Poland. I also want to again highlight Hungary and Lithuania where our Q1 national HTU share exceeded 25%. To give some further color on our progress in the EU Region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. While Vilnius continues to lead the way, approaching 40% share; Budapest, Rome and Athens are also well into the mid-to-high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by Vienna more than doubling to 5%, the strong traction in London at over 6% share, and a further acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of ILUMA. In Japan, the adjusted share for our HTU brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.7% in Q1. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which is also driving notable gains in Tokyo and other key cities. We expect strong offtake trends to continue in Q2, reaching around 24% market share, despite seasonality effects. Conversely, as I touched on earlier, supply chain constraints will likely result in Q2 HTU shipments below the prior year. With HTU inventories consequently reduced in the second quarter, we expect the replenishment in H2 to deliver a substantial recovery. Notwithstanding such quarterly volatility, with substantial commercial activities planned and excellent underlying momentum, we expect strong double-digit HTU shipment volume growth in Japan this year. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income markets. The share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, excluding Russia and Ukraine, grew by plus 0.8 points compared to the prior year to reach 2.7%. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents excellent progress. As mentioned last quarter we also intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn devices and HTUs tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year. A prime example of this is Egypt, where offtake exit share in Cairo is approaching 5% within 8 months of launch, as compared to total Q1 share of 4.3%. Other notable successes including the recently launched market of Morocco as well as Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines, despite pandemic restrictions in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, we are delighted to report the further outstanding success since its launch, with sales performance and consumer reactions still exceeding our expectations. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers has been rapid, with more than 30% of the large user base up-trading since the August 2021 launch, and over 20% of sales remain to legal-age smokers new to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rates, retention rates and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volumes, with premium-priced TEREA consumables the fastest growing launch in the smoke-free category, reaching an offtake share of 12% within six months of national launch; overtaking Marlboro Heatsticks and HEETS combined to become the number one smoke-free brand. We now have all three IQOS ILUMA devices in the market following the launch of ILUMA ONE, which provides multiple consecutive use at a more affordable price points. We are also introducing a new HTU brand called SENTIA for use with ILUMA, in select prefectures at a mainline price point comparable to HEETS. Results in Switzerland have again been even more remarkable, with significant sales to new users, and TEREA making up almost two-thirds of HTU sales after only five months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated from less than 6% in Q3 to 9% this quarter, with notable success in the German-speaking majority of the country. Our newest ILUMA launch was in Spain last month. While very early days the signs are also very positive with device sales to new users increasing 50% compared to the prior run rate, 10% of existing users upgraded within the first month, and TEREA exiting March at over one quarter of total HTU offtake. These results across three markets with differing consumer characteristics and level of RRP maturity are clearly very encouraging for the wider roll-out of ILUMA around the world. While device supply constraints are easing, the timing of HTU availability for new ILUMA markets has been somewhat delayed given the rapid uptake in the initial markets, and the resulting need for greater supply for each new market than was originally anticipated. In addition, the cancellation of our investment in the production of TEREA HTUs in our Russian facility has a short-term impact. As a result, further market launches are now mostly expected towards the end of H2. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables at different price tiers. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV’s promising results in the first group of markets continue. VEEV is a premium proposition, with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30%, making these results especially encouraging as we pursue a differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. We see further success in Italy reaching almost 20% offtake share of closed system pods, with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within eight months of launch. In the Czech Republic, after some temporary supply disruption at the start of the quarter which affected Q1 share, rapid growth has resumed. VEEV was present in seven markets at March 31, and we plan to add more this year, with timing subject to device availability. Separately, our re-launched commercialization of nicotine pouches under the Shiro brand in the Nordics is progressing well, with positive consumer feedback. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I’m happy to share two important developments published in our 2022 proxy statement. Firstly, our Board of Directors updated our company’s statement of purpose, expanding it beyond smoke-free, to better reflect the role of wellness and healthcare in our corporate strategy and transformation. Second, the introduction of a bespoke Sustainability Index explicitly links our ESG performance to 30% of long-term compensation. Further details will be shared in our Integrated Report on May 17, and further dedicated disclosures. Product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities, and the growing penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes, as legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free products compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal frameworks that recognize the positive impact tobacco harm reduction policies can have on public health. A recent example of this is Italy, which has established distinct excise tax categories for heatnot-burn, e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Thank you. And I’ll now turn it back to Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you Emmanuel. Despite the challenges in Russia and Ukraine, we have delivered an excellent start to the year with a strong recovery in IQOS user growth, and exceptional initial results from the groundbreaking innovation of IQOS ILUMA. As we covered recently at CAGNY, we have a rich pipeline of further smoke-free innovations to expand and grow across new and existing categories and geographies. Our combustible business is now stabilizing category share, despite the impact of IQOS cannabilization, which allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternatives. We also continue to invest for long-term growth through the development of innovative wellness and healthcare products, which seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. Our 2022 fundamentals are strong, with a pro forma expectation of 4.5% to 6.5% organic net revenue growth and 9% to 11% currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the significant inflationary pressures and disruption in global supply chains affecting first half and the full year, we also expect our organic operating income margin to expand to up by 100 basis points. In addition, we have taken the conservative assumption in our reported guidance of no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. Overall, we are very confident in the near and mid-term growth outlook and remain committed to sustainably rewarding shareholders over time as we continue our transformation. Thank you. And we are now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Hi. I just wanted to ask if I could, first, as I think about your IQOS guidance for the year and obviously reducing that for Russia and Ukraine, I just wanted to be sure, as you think about – the new guidance incorporates your expectations excluding Russia and Ukraine, is that the only adjustment that you’ve made for volume and that estimate the new 88 billion to 92 billion sticks, is that just taking out your expectation for Russia and Ukraine for this year?
Jacek Olczak: That’s correct. We’re just talking for the entire year the volumes from Russia and Ukraine. But then, obviously, for the Q1 we recognize what have been sold in both geographies, which is 5 billion. Therefore, on a pro forma for the full year excluding Russia and Ukraine looking into 88 billion to 92 billion. But if you add back the 5 billion, which we already sold during the first period, the first quarter, that directly translates to 93 billion-97 billion, which would assume or is assuming that there is no further sales of IQOS as of April 1 in neither Russia nor Ukraine.
Chris Growe: Got it. Thank you. And then I just wanted to understand a little bit about the second quarter, you’ve talked about higher device shipments in the quarter. I think that’ll be a stronger driver of revenue growth at the same time you have some timing differences, it sounds like at least in Japan where that will weigh on revenue overall. I think you’re expecting more like a low single-digit increase in revenue. So I just want to understand I guess to the degree you can help in terms of the magnitude of those two factors. It sounds like the Japan timing maybe a larger factor on 2Q revenue. And then just to understand also the availability of devices. Is it the second-half when that’s back to like a, I’ll call it full availability of devices? And is that a function of not having devices committed to Russia and Ukraine is providing more availability for the rest of the world, help that clear? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. Okay. So the first quarter shipments of the devices on the one hand, yes, you’re absolutely right, it contributes to the better help to the global revenue, but remember that the devices are putting a pressure on the margins, right. So that’s started between the devices and the impact on the one hand on the revenue and the margins. The big impact which we expect to have in Q2 is on the supply of the shipments of the consumables. So the heat sticks and TEREA. And as a result, among other constraints on the supply chain of stopping the investment in Russia, we need to resource that missing capacity to our locations and it will take us a while. And therefore, we expect that we will go lower with the inventories in Japan, mainly Japan in order to ensure that on the manufacturing side, the proper resourcing we will have when we expect quite a robust growth on IMS, and the market share. And I think, Emmanuel, on the slide have indicated that we should think we’re aiming at 24% – around 24% market share for the quarter in Japan. So it’s nothing on the consumer level on the offtake level, but we need to do this operations through the inventories in order to resume to the normal course of shipments in the Q3 and Q4. And hence, this will drive the better performance and stronger performance in the second half than the first half, which will be what we estimate to be impacted by the Q2 difference in the shipments. Now with regards to the devices, I mean, there is this continuous sale of the devices in the excluded geographies, right. So it’s not that we stopped selling, we stopped recognizing this whole thing due to the visibility and the other factors, what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. But in reality, we need to keep at least the replacement devices, right. So it’s not that you can take the volume out of Russia and Ukraine and to redirect them to other locations. We do have actually getting better and better, but not perfect visibility with regards to the device supplies. And remember, we’ve been very cautious about second half of last year. And the moment when we had the better order fulfillment and also better visibility with regards to the future orders for this year, we feel more confident about how we can realize the – fully realize the opportunity of IQOS. So that looks okay it’s not perfect, but I don’t want to misled anybody it’s not perfect, but it’s better than say at the beginning of the year. And you saw it at the moment that we have regained some, have almost full-fledged availability of devices how IQOS could accelerate its growth for the user acquisition and the market share progression in Q1. So we know that we have it, but everything hinges on a continually and undisturbed uninterrupted supplies of the both devices and heat sticks.
Emmanuel Babeau: And Chris maybe just to complement, I think it’s really important that everybody understand the evolution of the gross margin in Q1, Q2 and H1 versus H2. I’m sure you remember that last year, the gross margin in H1 was extremely high, we were at 70%. The gross margin was lower and probably more normative in H2. So what we have seen in Q1 was first of all facing very high comps. I think we’ve been describing in the presentation, the various driver for the 250 basis point reduction in the gross margin. What you can expect for Q2 is this element to continue knowing that the gross margin reference is 70% as well last year in Q2. And on top of it, we will have more device sales even than in Q1, which I think is good news because it shows the success of IQOS. We have increased air freight cost for the reason that we mentioned and the tension on the supply chain and that’s going to have an impact on the margin. And last element, you have this mix, which is a temporary element of course like air freight, by the way on the fact that the volume will be lower for Japan in Q2 with the recovery and the compensation in H2. And with that, you have the reason for increased pressure, gross margin pressure in Q2, but with the compensation that will come in H2.
Chris Growe: That was great color. Thanks so much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Pamela Kaufman: I have a question on the 2023 outlook and how you’re thinking about your targets for next year, particularly on the HTU side, should we assume a similar reduction to your heated tobacco target as the guidance reduction for this year of about 20%? And given Russia’s significant contribution to the overall IQOS business, how are you adjusting your strategy for achieving your target for 50% of revenue coming from smoke free products by 2025? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Well – thank you. We continue with the geographical and portfolio expansion of IQOS in the existing and the new geographies and obviously this we confronted with all the supply chain constraints and availability of devices et cetera. So I mean, we all know this. The good way or one of the way maybe to look at that 2023 target, so I believe you’re referring to the absolute volume target for IQOS is that, okay, let’s assume that we don’t have and the lowest assumptions you can make is that we will not realize any further sales as of April 1 in Russia and Ukraine and that’s essentially the floor on that thing. Where do we land? I think everyone will appreciate we need a little bit of a time to really have the full visibility what’s happening or what we will do with our business and our intentions about exiting Russia and also what’s the – whatever might be the longer term outlook for our Ukrainian et cetera. There will be a band in absolute numbers. It’s no questions about it. The way I look into this whole thing, we may be in a situation that we’ll deliver this target, but with about a 12 months delay. I mean, I am not in a position – my thinking is not changed the target just recognized that you maybe need a little bit of additional time to deliver on this target. All other parameters, the relative growth targets being the top-line, bottom-line and the relative growth of the – or relative contribution, which is very important target for us of the non-combustible to combustible business they remain as we have said before. And on that one I’m confident we should be in a position to deliver this. But in absolute volume, yes, I mean, we might have a miss. But the way again, sorry for repetition, I look at this, maybe I need a 12 months more to deliver the same target for other geographies and organic growth in existing geographies.
Emmanuel Babeau: And Pamela, on your question on how do we get to more than 50% in 2025. I’m sure you’ve seen that in Q1, on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine we are a bit below the full perimeter of the Group, but not that much below. So we are at 30% versus around 31%. So, yes, there is a bit more ground to cover to get to 50%. But given the dynamism that we see in our IQOS business and the opportunity we’ve been clearly showing in low-and middle-income country, we think we can catch up and deliver this more than 50%.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then a question on new IQOS user acquisition, you saw a good recovery this quarter, despite taking out the impact from Russia to 1 million user – over 1 million users. Do you expect to see a similar piece of new user acquisition over the course of the year? And how much of a role did ILUMA play in that, would there be any impact from the supply disruption on the TEREA consumables? Did you hear my question?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, I think your question was, sorry, because we all cut half the sentence. Your question was can we expect the same dynamics of the user acquisition right going forward?
Pamela Kaufman: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. So look, I mean, above 1 million acquisition this quarter, which show the growth sequentially above close to 1 million acquisition, the Q4. I mean that directly correlated to our availability of devices and a full portfolio of devices. As you know, we also play now the different price segments game, we have more expensive devices, mid-price devices, lower-price devices. So as long as we have availability of devices, I actually think that number, we should repeat the same sort of the rate, if not actually higher, because you could see from the conversion perspective and the consumer liking measured by NPS and other parameters what we’re offering today that is meeting the consumer expectations. So there’s also bridging somehow to the before questions that once we see the visibility on the devices, right, in the next quarter or so and all the dynamics, which we can achieve outside the Russia and Ukraine then we would be in a positions to revise what actually we will deliver in a year from now in terms of the total IQOS volume.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So I wanted to follow up on Japan, I’m just having a hard time reconciling two comments that you guys made. Number one that there was negative device mix in the quarter, but that you had device growth from ILUMA, because last quarter, I thought the launch of ILUMA was mix accretive in Japan, so am I misunderstanding something or did something change? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: I think that the device mix we’re talking that we’re selling three – as of now, three versions of IQOS ILUMA, you have a premium, mid and the lower price, lower price was just introduced now to the market to the consumers. So obviously in the shipments, we already had them in the Q1, because this is all recognized on the shipment. And second is that this device, I mean, the ILUMA ONE, which is the lowest price device goes at attractive price in the market, higher than the competitions, but attractive and lower than the price that we used to have on the one version of IQOS 3 before. So maybe here to Vivien we need to look into.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yeah, Vivien if I may, Emmanuel speaking. It’s a positive in the mix within the device, because it come at a higher price. But any growth in device is negative to the mix in term of gross margin, because it’s coming with of course a much reduced gross margin versus the consumables. So the more device we sell, you have some impact on the revenue, which is positive, but it has a dilutive impact on the gross margin rate to be very clear.
Vivien Azer: Understood. I think we had sales graph was the pricing tier. So thank you both for that. For my second question, I was hoping to get some incremental color on Germany, you had meaningful share growth, both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Is there anything to call out there from an activation standpoint, because the results were very strong?
Jacek Olczak: No, this again comes so we had post price increase, post price change environment in Germany, the one thing. And second is, again, I mean the Germany start benefiting from not the restricted access to the devices. So this again follows the same story that we have a continuous broad range availability of the devices. We can go into the portfolio again and hence the performance. And this is one additional comment I would make here Vivien is that Germany is still running on the IQOS free one version, which is a blade version and the reasons why we went for example to Switzerland with IQOS ILUMA before opening the larger market, which obviously will take a lot of volume of the device is how IQOS ILUMA would to performing in the similar sort of a geography. So I am very pleased with the success so far of IQOS ILUMA in Switzerland, especially the German speaking part, because I used this as a – we could use this as the proxy for German on acceleration of the – further acceleration of the growth in Germany. Now, nothing is certain in life. But I think this is as far as we can read through the consumer reactions in Switzerland.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I had a few questions on Russia, I guess, I was hoping you could share, maybe just a few more details on your exit from the country and really what the mechanics of that are? I guess, could you help us understand what’s being manufactured in the market currently? And then what about the volume your manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg exports? Can you share with us roughly what percentage of the volume is exported? And then where you plan to maybe shift that volume to and when? And I guess, I’m just trying to think about all this in terms of any costs associated with that? And then is that being reflected in your guidance?
Jacek Olczak: Bonnie, Jacek here. Judging just by the number of details, you mentioned in that question you will appreciate how complex the situation is in Russia. So one by one. Russia in terms of the so far production and export allocation was not really that significant. We had a much more significant plans of expanding Russia is that one of the key suppliers of new IQOS ILUMA and hence our decision to immediately stop that investment as a result of that we created a temporary halt for the rest of the market. Partially for Russia launch of ILUMA, which we also canceled, but also that Russia was supposed to contribute to the supply of the ILUMA consumables that are HeatSticks into other markets, including in Japan. So our first priority is how we can resource that capacity there. Obviously, that capacity means that we have an equipment installed in Russia. And we can’t – so we don’t use this equipment today. What will happen to that equipment going forward? We are also working on a certain plans, but I would stop here, I will not go into more details. Now to exit Russia in the orderly manner for us that we need to reconcile the interest first of all of our shareholders, the employees in Russia. And you know that the ever-evolving legislation in Russia puts the significant risk or constraints of our ability to adhere. And this is only in the context of the very evolving regulatory environment, both on the international, it’s obviously the sanctions, but also the legislations or legislation in Russia. So if we want to, we have a significant presence in Russia, as we all know it. We’re in the market, organically built the business over the last 30 years. This is 100% business of PMI International. We don’t have any partners contributing to the core business. We obviously are connected with the local supply chains and wholesale and distribution components. But PM Izhora and Philip Morris sales and distribution is 100% Philip Morris business. We have some shareholding in addition to this, we have a key distributor in the market together along with our major tobacco company. And to unwind in orderly manner all the strengths, which we have in Russia is a complex endeavor, but we are committed to do so. Hence, in our guidance and the decisions to look at the PMI as the rest of the business, which is doing absolutely great despite all of the headwinds, which we have and so on rather than have polluted with something which we have limited visibility and ability to act accordingly. So I know that my answer have not gave you more clarity, but that is the best which we can say at this moment. I mean, we’re working on exit, but presumably, one of the most complicated transactions in the terms of the history of the group, which we’re drawing from the board.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes, I can only imagine. I appreciate the color. And just to be clear, just in terms of the exit. Do you have a target date, the full exit of the market that you can share?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we rather not delay beyond what is necessary as long as we satisfy all the teams or the groups if you like. And again I repeat it, I mean our – we have a responsibility to shareholders. But we also have responsibility to employees in Russia. And overall, broad group of stakeholders with the various expectations and try to resolve that equation to the satisfaction of everyone that’s becoming complex exercise. But we are working relentlessly of how to move forward. I mean I would appreciate that if this was any other size of the business and presence in the market things could have looked differently. But this was a very big business for us.
Bonnie Herzog: And honestly, that kind of brings me to my second question, as I think about your new pro forma HTU volume guidance of 88 billion to 92 billion units for this year, which is assuming 22% growth at the midpoint. I guess, I’d like to understand the key drivers of that since the growth outlook is now I guess, above your previous guidance, but Russia really I thought was such an important driver of that and for your future. So I just kind of want to understand what gives you the confidence, especially also on top of the uncertainty related to the semiconductor chip shortage situation? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. Thank you. So obviously we need to make some or making some assumptions on the supply chain, as I said earlier. We don’t live today in a perfect visibility for all the remaining quarters of this year. But I think we have enough of the confidence to come up with this pro forma estimate or this pro forma guidance. Now, look, you see that continuous trajectory of IQOS growth in essentially in all geographies, including the geographies that historically were a bit tougher for us, where yet we had the progress, but they were not really growing at the group level of the growth and now we see that Japan, with that ILUMA and a few other locations with ILUMA already having a massive acceleration of the growth. We know what we have in our plans for this thereafter with ILUMA. We also know that IQOS [indiscernible] which is the currently the mostly sold device also continues to be very attractive. And this is continuously despite the fact that we offering our portfolio both of the devices and the consummables at a significant premium to any other market propositions. I think we’re getting this confidence that IQOS continue to grow and we’re looking forward also to the moment when it will accelerate its growth. Will IQOS in a near term excluding Russia and Ukraine, sorry, the rest of the geographies compensate the lack of Russia and Ukraine? I think over a longer period of time, we once notice, but in shorter period of time it might a bit challenging, okay. We’re not making any promises at this stage.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.
Gaurav Jain: [Technical Difficulty]
Nick Rolli: Gaurav, we can’t hear you. Could you repeat the question please?
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Is this better?
Nick Rolli: Yes, it’s better. Yes, thank you.
Gaurav Jain: Sorry about that. So my first question is your guidance on industry volume and your own volume ex-Russia and Ukraine. So it seems to have become better. And if I look, especially at your European volumes, they are quite strong. So we have this sort of the macro pressure on consumers and inflationary pressure and Europe might be in recession, not in recession oil price impact. So my question is that why are you seeing stronger volumes? And is it that when cigarette prices historically used to be up 4 in Europe and wage growth was 1, so cigarettes are becoming less affordable and right now cigarette pricing is still 4 while wage inflation is probably 4 or 5, so cigarettes are actually becoming more affordable and that’s why you are seeing better volume trends?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think we should – I mean, we have the information of Q1 that are pointing to this evolution. It is true, Gaurav, that there are no uncertainty on what’s going to be the growth of the global economy in the coming quarters. I suppose there is some trend in the market that our underlying trends in term of demographics and behaviors. Let’s face it there is also still the contribution of rebound after the COVID. So last year was not a normal year, we are becoming much more normal. I’m not saying we’re there yet. I mean, in Duty Free, we’re not. But in other markets, we can hope that for the coming months to be more normal and that’s going to be a positive. So I don’t know what’s going to be the impact of a potential slowdown of the economy. By the way, we’re going to have an impact on volume or more on downtrading and some countries in consumer going for cheaper offering. Today what we see and we’ve been highlighting that is Marlboro recovering market share and we see Chesterfield being very successful and we see of course great success with all our IQOS brands. So that is what is driving for us this outlook for growth in volume. And of course, starting Q1 with a very nice growth, even if we flag the fact that there were some – maybe some anticipation, but I think that the Q1 numbers are there. It shows the dynamism that we are seeing in our portfolio.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And coming to the EPS guidance and the dividend. So your dividend payout ratio will now be north of 90%. So how does that impact, how you’re thinking about share repurchases? And we keep seeing the cycles with PM every three years, you have massive adverse FX and we go back 10 years, euro used to be €150, yen was JPY70, then we had one cycle in 2014 and 2017. Now we have another cycle of FX. And clearly a lot of your costs are in Swiss franc and dollar. So is there something you can do so that the cost mismatch, the transaction FX mismatch is lesser? And we again get into the situation where dividend payout ratio is becoming very tight.
Jacek Olczak: Well, Gaurav, so yes, of course on the basis of the guidance that we’ve been giving, we would have a payout ratio that would significantly increase versus 2021. I think we’ve shown in the past, the capacity to grow in profit over time and reduce that. Our objective to go down over time and we didn’t give any kind of precise to go down to 75% is still there. I agree that given the adverse event that we are facing, it’s going to take a bit more time to get there. That’s the case, not so much, I mean, the currency is playing, but it’s really the accumulation of currency and Russia leaving the perimeter of the group that is driving that situation. Now on the ForEx there’s two elements. One is the pressure on margin and we continue to work on trying to equalize better the currency in which we’re investing and the currency in which we have our cost. We do that with the supply chain. There are some limitation, because there are a number of things that you buy in dollar, of course, we do that through everything we buy. But there is one element that we kind change that we have limited invoicing in dollar. So when the dollar is going up versus most of the currency that is an impact, which is mechanical and on which there is not much we can do. So we can work and I think we continue to work on the margin dimension. We cannot work on the fact that we have limited invoicing.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thanks a lot.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Nick Rolli: Owen, do you have a question?
Operator: And it appears Mr. Bennett has dropped. We will go ahead and take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jared Dinges: Hi guys. I just wanted to ask about the pricing environment given inflation in places like Europe is reaching levels not seen for a long time. Do you think there could be more of an opportunity to put through additional price increases given you are seeing cost inflation as well on a global basis, especially post Russia and Ukraine? Maybe we can see a bit more of a margin offset.
Jacek Olczak: We’re taking a price increase and a price variance. So the opening of the – came in be better than we initially thought. We will see what the remaining part of the year and especially the second half will bring. When we look at the inflation, I mean, we also have to look of what is the inflation of the material. So like the cost of living and what is the inflation of the income, right? Because we haven’t yet seen the inflation on the income level at the concept level. So we have to find the right spot at the right balance where do we get into this. But in most of the geographies I mean the pricing environment, I would characterize it is getting positive. I mean, Emmanuel, talk about the Indonesia. On the other hand, we have a very strong rebound in volumes in Indonesia. And hopefully also Indonesia, which used to be quite important a significant contributor to the pricing will hopefully towards the end of this year or definitely 2023 will resume this pricing contribution. We had a price increase in Germany flowing through the market, the Philippines, Turkey, okay. Now Turkey goes to the hyper-inflationary accounting. We’re trying to price it widely, looking at the inflation as the pressure. But as I said, at the beginning of the year we already started with the ahead of our own expectations pricing variance. So let’s see how that this will continue through the year.
Jared Dinges: Got it. And maybe just to follow up on Southeast Asia, clearly it’s a very strong start to the year in terms of volumes, what are your expectations there on the volume side for the rest of the year?
Jacek Olczak: Well, there is this continuous – remember this is the part of the world, which is still not out of the woods with regards to COVID unfortunately, right? So the situation is not really didn’t get back to the pre-COVID side. I believe there is some underlying growth opportunities just by the fact that if they continue to recover from the COVID situation, we should start seeing the continuously better volume. And as I said, I mean we took the price increase in, Philippines, we’re taking some pricing in, we’re taking the pricing a little bit accelerated in Indonesia, but on the other hand, we are still in the – as you remember, Indonesia take a couple of around steps of a price increase to pass on the beginning of the excise increase. So we still need a bit of time to go into the net margin improvement territory. But it’s very much hinges essentially to keep it short on continuous recovery and no further surprises with regards of the COVID situation.
Emmanuel Babeau: And Jared, as we said, we expect to grow nicely revenue in the region this year, which would be a very nice evolution.
Jared Dinges: That’s correct. Thanks, guys.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Nick Rolli: Thank you. That was the last question, operator.
Operator: And there are no further questions on the line. I will turn the program back over to Nick Rolli for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: I think Jacek had some closing remarks.
Jacek Olczak: Okay, so thank you everyone for your attention and the patients and the quarter was pretty complex and complicated for us and since due to some technical problems the earnings call also can’t somehow adjusted to the situations in the quarter. I have one on the comment toward everyone I hope is still on the line. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Nick Rolli, outstanding contribution to PMI and our former parent company over the past 35 years and particularly as the Vice President, Investor Relations since the 2008 Philip Morris International. As you all believe will agree with me, he has been a critical contributor through the journey of our company. And I know that you, our investors and analysts will join me in congratulating Nick and to wish him all the best for his very well deserved retirement. At the same time, I would also like to congratulate James Bushnell on his new role I have a pleasure because I personally was hiring Mr. Bushnell to PMI in his new role as the successor to Nick Rolli and I believe he would receive the same support and we welcome as Nick Rolli enjoy from you for the last 35 years. So welcome James, and thank you, Nick.
Nick Rolli: Thank you, Jacek. Thank you, Emmanuel. Congratulations, James. Thank you all on the call because I know we had some long relationships with many of you and I value that relationship and thank you very much. That concludes the call. And we apologize for the technical difficulties on my last call. But we’ll will resolve everything and look forward to dealing with your follow-up questions. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: See you soon, guys. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2021 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session.  Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2021 fourth-quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market share data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, OtiTopic and Vectura Group, PMI added the other category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the other category are evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone. I hope you all say on well. Our business delivered an excellent performance in 2021, reaching record net revenues, adjusted diluted EPS and cash flow with growth in overall volumes, high single-digit organic net revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This illustrates the sustainable nature of our growth based on new products and innovation, as demonstrated by the continued strength of IQOS, which delivered 31% full year organic growth in RRP net revenues. Smoke-free products surpassed 30% of total net revenues in Q4, as we progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We were especially pleased by the reacceleration of our business in Q4 to deliver a better-than-expected result. This reacceleration was visible in organic net revenues, IQOS user growth, heated tobacco unit market shares across developed and emerging markets, innovation in devices and consumables, and commercial investments and combustible share. IQOS user growth recovered in Q4 to reach an estimated 21.2 million total users, despite ongoing tightness in device supplies in the second half of the year. Full year heated tobacco unit shipment volumes grew 25% to reach 95 billion units, with broad-based growth for both our volumes and the category across key geographies, with an especially positive rebound in the EU. The growth outlook for IQOS remains very positive, with outstanding initial results from IQOS ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the only two launches so far, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In combustibles, we essentially reached our goal of stable category share in the fourth quarter despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. During the year, we laid the foundations for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in Wellness and Healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Fertin and Vectura, which provide essential capabilities for future product development. And last, bolstered by strong operating cash flow, we continued to prioritize returns to shareholders through a 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers. Our full year adjusted net revenues grew organically by 7.6% or 10.3% in dollar terms, including positive currency. This reflects the continued underlying strength of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the pandemic affected prior year. Our net revenue per unit grew 5.3% organically driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing. Combustible pricing was in line with our expectations at 2.7% or around 4%, excluding Indonesia. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points on an organic basis, in line with our expectations, with continued positive effects from the increasing size and profitability of IQOS, pricing and productivity savings. Through first half expansion -- although strong H1 expansion was tempered in the second half by the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA, geographic and category expansion investment and the Q4 resumption of consumer programs in a number of markets. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $6.08 represents 17.6% growth in dollar terms and 15.3% currency-neutral growth, which is well above our prior guidance as IQOS user growth, the launch of Illuma and total industry volumes exceeded our expectations. Finally, we generated operating cash flow of $12 billion, reflecting excellent underlying cash conversion in addition to strong Q4 business results and certain timing factors. Looking at our Q4 performance, net revenues grew by 8.4% organically. This reflects the sequential improvement in IQOS user acquisition the initial success of ILUMA in Japan and strong overall volumes, including a further recovery in combustibles. We delivered robust organic net revenue per unit growth of 4.1%, again reflecting our shift in business mix. We achieved this despite softer pricing on combustibles of 1.4% due to the factors flagged previously of continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets as well as comparison effects in Germany and Australia. Our Q4 adjusted operating income margin declined by 10 basis points on an organic basis, primarily due to the same factors mentioned for the second half as accelerating business performance opened more opportunities for investment in future growth. Despite that, our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, again grew strongly by 11.9%, also reflecting a lower interest cost and effective tax rate. Turning now to 2022 guidance. After the temporary slowdown in IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021, the device supply situation is gradually improving. While the situation remains fluid, we now expect a more limited impact, allowing us to gradually return to prior rates of user progression over the coming quarters. With the remarkable success of ILUMA in its first market, a number of other innovations planned and promising growth for IQOS in low and middle income markets, our 2022 growth fundamentals are strong, and we look forward to an exciting year. We note that the slower user growth in the second half of 2021, particularly in the third quarter, will have an estimated carryover effect on our growth this year of around 4 billion to 5 billion cubic tobacco units. This is reflected in our 2022 expectations of 113 million to 118 billion H2 shipment volume. Given this continued growth, we expect our full year H2 shipments to again be ahead of IMS volumes. We expect to deliver between 4% and 6% organic net revenue growth keeping us well on track to deliver our 2021 -- 2021, 2023 compound annual growth rate target of more than 5%. This range prudently incorporates the continuing uncertainty on full device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. For Duty Free, we assume no meaningful pickup in Asian travel, but a continued gradual recovery in other geographies. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand between 50 and 150 basis points as the positive effects of our product transformation continues, despite the expectation of a moderately lower gross margin. This is essentially attributable to temporary ILUMA related factors such as the higher initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables and the cost of devices, which we expect to decrease over the 18 to 24 months post-launch as we have experienced in previous -- with previous major innovations. We also account for higher logistic costs, where the tremendous uptake of ILUMA in Japan has led to increased use of air freight investments to grow capacity across our smoke-free platforms and inflation in certain supply chain elements. Operating income margin expansion and continued growth opportunities and in wellness and healthcare R&D will again be supported by our ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross savings by 2023. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.12 to $6.30, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.45 at prevailing rates. This is primarily due to translation effects, and this currency impact reflects notably the appreciation of the euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira versus the dollar. This guidance includes the impact of $785 million of share repurchases made in 2021, which were somewhat restricted by blackout periods. It does not reflect the impact of repurchases in 2022 as we continue to take an opportunistic approach within our target of between $5 billion to $7 billion over three years. Our guidance also reflects the impact of acquired businesses, which we expect to generate underlying operating income in line with our business plan, but with an operating loss of around $150 million or approximately 1% of adjusted diluted EPS, which we'll come back to explain later. As outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and to cubic tobacco units, excluding the U.S. and China to decline between minus 1% and minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, we expect to gain share a target broadly stable total PMI shipment volumes within the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pricing of 3% to 4% with a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. And this is clearly above 2021 levels. The pricing environment is improving but still challenging central markets with ongoing pandemic related impacts. Our balance sheet is strong. We delivered excellent operating cash flow of $12 billion in 2021, reflecting robust underlying cash conversion in addition to favorable timing and one-off impact of around $0.5 billion. With further strong organic profit growth expected in 2022, we expect to generate around $11 billion of operating cash flow, subject to year-end working capital requirements and after accounting for the reversal of timing benefits and using prevailing exchange rates. As a result, we raised our 2021 to '23 operating cash flow target communicated at the February 2021 Investor Day at $35 billion to the range of $36 billion to $37 billion. We also expect full year capital expenditures of around $1 billion, reflecting increased capacity investments behind our smoke-free platforms, including ILUMA and enhancing our digital commercial engine in addition to certain projects, which were delayed due to the pandemic. Lastly, looking specifically to the first quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. We expect robust organic top line growth and operating margins comparisons, which reflect above the very strong prior year quarter, which benefited from a high level of productivity savings and relatively low levels of investment and the Q1 of 2022 dynamics of commercial investments, ILUMA related costs and increases in some inputs such as freight. Let me now hand over to Emmanuel, who will give you more details of our performance in 2021.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Turning back to our 2021 results. Total shipment volumes increased by plus 4.2% in Q4 and by plus 2.2% for the year. This reflects continued strong broad-based growth from HTUs of plus 25% or 18.9 billion units for the full year, comfortably exceeding the decline of 3.6 billion cigarettes. The plus 2.4% increase in our Q4 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of the total industry and of our category share, in addition to a 2.7 billion stick favorable inventory movement, which mainly reflects inventory reduction in the prior year quarter. Due to the remarkable performance of IQOS, inter tobacco units comprised almost 14% of our total shipment volume in the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the year, as compared to 11% in full year 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is evolving rapidly, putting us on track to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our adjusted total revenue in Q4 and 29% for the year as compared to 24% in 2020. In 10 markets, we have already surpassed 50%. IQOS devices accounted for over 6% of the $9.1 billion of 2021 RP net revenues with a step up in H2, reflecting the IQOS ILUMA launch, outweighing the effect of supply constraint on the IQOS versions. We delivered plus 7.6% organic growth in 2021 net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 2.2%, reflecting the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing on combustible and in certain markets on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let's now turn to the driver of our 2021 margin expansion. Our gross margin increased by 190 basis points on an organic basis due to product mix, pricing and cost savings, while our adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 10 basis points better as a percentage of adjusted net revenues. We generated over $800 million in gross cost savings in 2021 with around $550 million in manufacturing and supply chain productivity and more than $250 million in SG&A efficiency before inflation. This represents strong progress towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023 and allows us to reinvest in top line growth while continuing to deliver robust margin progression. While OI margin expansion was lower in H2, this reflects the positive dynamic of our business and the ability to return to normalized investment levels compared to the pandemic affected prior year. ILUMA device and HTU shipments commenced with higher initial unit cost and we reaccelerated investments in our commercial program, digital engine and R&D as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. We intend to continue investing in such opportunities in 2022. But with the benefit of scale, operating leverage and accelerated efficiencies we continue to target organic SG&A increases below the rate of sales growth. Moving now to market share. Our share of the combustible category recovered and was essentially stable in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions received in many markets. Our leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Aside consumer growth, we accelerate, we target at first a slightly decline in 2022. For the combustible category overall, the improving total market backdrop includes notable Q4 recoveries in Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, close to stable industry volume in the EU region and a modest recovery in duty free driven by sales outside Asia. Daily consumption remains below pre-coded level in certain markets such as the Philippines, where our share of market is influenced by mobility and social consumption. In Indonesia, our share was again broadly stable on a sequential basis despite the continued growth of the below Tier 1 segment and our volumes grew over 4% for the year. The reduction from 10 to 8 excise tax year in 2022 represents a step in the right direction, and the industry weighted average excise increase of around plus 13% is slightly below the prior year. However, the playing field remained unequaled between industry players and the pricing environment remains challenging. In terms of our overall share, ongoing gain for our IQOS portfolio create positive momentum going into this year, and we expect to resume overall share growth as well as achieving broadly stable total shipment volume. PMI HTUs now have a 7.1% share in the markets where they are present, making them the third largest tobacco brand. This includes the number one position in five markets, and the number two in a further six markets. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 21.2 million IQOS users as of December 31. The improved growth of plus 0.8 million in Q4 reflects our agile commercial model, which allowed us to rapidly adjust our consumer program and assortment. As demonstrated by the performance of ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong. While we don't yet have full visibility over the full year of 2022, as device shortages ease, we expect to gradually return to user growth at or above the prior run rate of around 1 million per quarter. We estimate that 72% of total users or 15.3 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. In the EU region, Fourth quarter HTU share reached 6.4% of total cigarette and HTU industry revenue, 1.4 points higher than Q4 last year. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. This very good performance included strong growth across the region, with Italy reaching the milestone of 2 million users and positive contribution from Germany and Poland. I also want to highlight Hungary where our Q4 national HTU share exceeded 20%, following Japan and Lithuania enriching this important threshold. To give some further color on our progress in the EU region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city of offtake shares. While Vilnius continued to lead the way with 37.5% share, the 20% level was also reached in Budapest, Rome and Athens. With strong progress across the region, we are especially pleased by Vienna, almost doubling to 4%, the strong traction in London at almost 6% share, and an acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of IQOS ILUMA. We show further HTU share data in the appendix to these slides. Share growth continued in Russia with our Q4 TU share up by plus 0.8 points to reach 8%. For both Russia and the overall region, sequential growth in adjusted IMS slowed in the last two quarters, partly reflecting the more acute device shortage and lead on commercial program. In addition, the region was affected by the halting of sales in Belarus, which impacted sequential IMF growth in Q4. In this context, as mentioned in last quarter, we have seen some increased discounted competitor offerings and disposable e-vapor products. We continue to see high interest in the category and with a pipeline of exciting innovations plan, including the launch of ILUMA, we aim to resume strong growth this year. In Japan now, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus-1.7 points to a record 21.8% in Q4. And an offtake exit share approaching 23%, with Q4 adjusted IMS sequential trends, incorporating the pull forward of consumer uptake into Q3 before the price increase. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which I will come back to shortly. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up over 31% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q4; with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's 2021 growth. In addition to the strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income market. A prime example of this is Egypt where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 4% within six months of launch with other notable successes, including Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines despite funding in retraction in Manila. This low and middle-income market key city performance is especially encouraging as we achieved it despite the premium position of the current IQOS portfolio. We do intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn products tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year, which I will come back to. With this potential in mind, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free products as we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in both Morocco and Tunisia. This takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 71, of which 30 are in low and middle-income markets. We plan to add more market this year as we also meaningfully broaden our product offer and price segmentation within existing geography. This includes the expansion of feel and feet, which are now available in over 20 markets across multiple regions and our expansion of e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Following the implementation of the ITC's importation ban, IQOS is not currently available in the U.S. We continue to work on contingency plans, including domestic manufacturing and hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. It is important to remember that the ITC's decision on this patent is an outlier. We were encouraged by the U.S. patent office recent invalidation of one of the two patents included in the ITC ruling, and we expect a decision on the second patent by April 2, though this decision are subject to an appeal process. BAT has been universally unsuccessful in asserting the same two patent families against IQOS in Europe. Separately, in December, a German court ruled that BAT's GLO HYPER dual-coil heat-not-burn device infringes our patents and that we are entitled among other things to an injunction against BAT sales cells of the device. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA. We are delighted to report the outstanding success since its launch in Japan and Switzerland with sales performance and consumer reaction exceeding our expectation. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-adult smoker has been rapid with more than 20% of the large user base switching since the August launch and over 20% of sales to legal age smokers due to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high-quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rate, retention rate and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volume growth and indeed, premium-priced TEREA consumables have been the fastest-growing launch in the small free category reaching an offtake share in the three main convenience store shares change of 8% within three months of national launch and driving the growth of the heat-not-burn category following the October tax-driven price increase. Early results in Switzerland have been even more remarkable with over one-third of sales to new user and TEREA making up over one-third of HD sales after only two months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated accordingly from 6% in September to 7.9% in December. These results are very encouraging for the wider rollout of ILUMA in the EU region and around the world, and we plan to roll out gradually to more markets this year, mostly in H2. While we continue to manage device supply constraints, the unprecedented growth in Japan also means we have had to accelerate both the supply of TEREA consumable using airfreight and the conversion of our production line to support new market launches. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables across our technology at different price tiers. As I mentioned, we also plan to enhance our portfolio for future growth with the introduction of a new complementary technology towards the end of this year. This will be targeted at smokers in low and middle income market, catering to the consumer need of simple high-quality, affordable devices and consumable and specific local test performances. In terms of HTUs, after launching over 15 new ILUMA SKUs in Q4, we plan to continue expanding our portfolio across platforms, geography and price point this year. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with very promising results in the first group of markets where we started in our own channel with a limited range of test variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and the commercial faster of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and our scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we observed signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product. We see encouraging success in Italy and the Czech Republic, reaching double-digit offtake shares of close to 10 points with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within three months of launch. After launching in Canada and Ukraine in the fourth quarter, we plan to add more markets in 2022 with timing subject to device availability. We also continued preparation to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA and now prudently assume readiness for filing in early 2023, given further clarity on the required preparatory steps. An additional exciting midterm growth opportunity is in the nicotine pouch category, where we aim to become a leading player with a Shiro brand. Nicotine pouches provide convenient smoke-free alternative for adult smokers. And while still early in many markets, we see Shiro playing an important role in our smoke-free portfolio over the coming years. Following the acquisition of AG Snus and Fertin Pharma, we have established a base of product development and manufacturing expertise. Although we are still learning about the promising category, our IQOS commercial infrastructure allows for a fast rollout and we plan a number of launches over the coming quarters. The first major activity is the full re-launch of the revitalized Shiro portfolio in the Nordic this month from its more limited prior presence with full commercial activity and a broad portfolio of flavors and strength variance. Separately, following feedback from the 2021 consumer test of our Platform 2 carbon product, the design of our current technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative design for this consumer segment. Turning now to our nascent business beyond nicotine, the 2021 acquisitions of Fertin, Vectura and OtiTopic provide the base for building critical respiratory and overall product development capabilities in tandem with our existing expertise. This opened up opportunity to deliver the positive effect of existing wellness and health care molecules in a fast and effective manner. For the time being, our reported number in the other segment showed the existing acquired business, which delivered $101 million in net revenue in the fourth quarter and a marginal operating loss of $1 million. The underlying performance is in line with our expectation with reported operating expenses reflecting the amortization of intangible, deal-related items and our planned investments. Around 39% of Q4 revenue were derived from Fertin's smoking cessation product and nicotine pouch operations. While we intend to continue the CDMO activities of the acquired companies, the most significant value to PMI is in this ability to develop and commercialize new products in the wellness and healthcare segment over time. We plan important R&D investment over the course of the coming years to support the aim of delivering meaningful incremental revenue starting two to three years from now as we pursue our ambition of at least $1 billion of net revenue from wellness and healthcare products by 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we expect an operating loss of around $150 million in 2022, with revenue of around $250 million, including smoking cessation products. We recognized investor interest in our future product line in these new areas and plan to provide more color at our CAGNY conference presentation on February 23. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I'm happy to share that we recently completed a new sustainability feasibility assessment to update and recalibrate our priorities in accordance with our biggest impact on society, double maturity and extensive stakeholder inputs. While addressing the health impact of our product remained by far the biggest focus, we also identified a number of topics, which are emerging in importance or required an evolved approach. We will publish the results next week. It is increasingly important to align management incentives with sustainability materiality, performance and impact. We will strengthen this link in 2022 with the new sustainability index and plan to provide more details in the near future. Our progress on sustainability continues to be recognized by leading external stakeholders with repeated inclusion in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and the Bloomberg Generic-Quality Index, and receiving CDP's AAA score for the second year running. We also published an agricultural labor practices report, making 10-year -- marking 10 years of the program. Since its introduction, we have successfully eradicated systemic issue related to child labor, while improving living condition of farmers and farm workers. It also outlined our ambition targets such as 100% farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, making the leasing income by 2025. On our most critical priority of product impact, the grown penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes as legal age smokers reach to better alternative. I am also pleased to report further recent positive regulatory development. For example, as part of its beating cancer plan, the European Parliament special committee recognized and featured harm reduction in its last report for which the plenary vote will take place next week. In New Zealand, the government published its more action plan, expressly excluding small free product from the proposed measures. In addition, the number of countries, including Poland and Russia have announced new multiyear excise tax plan with taxation of smoke-free products clearly differentiated from cigarettes, making 15 markets globally with such plans. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial reduction potential of smoke-free product compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal framework that recognize this critical harm reduction opportunity. I will now turn back to Jacek for some concluding remarks.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, we are very pleased to have delivered excellent growth in last year in 2021 with a strong underlying momentum for IQOS as well as the record adjusted EPS, net revenues and cash generation. In the consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottom line delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last two years, which I believe we all acknowledge with pretty to volunteers. With an improving outlook for device supply, although still were an element of agility, the exceptional initial success of ILUMA and the number of innovations and growth initiatives. We look forward to 2022 with a tremendous excitement. At the same time, we're building -- we will be building our development capabilities in wellness and healthcare for targeted investment in order to support the next driver of our long-term growth. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and our share repurchase program, in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and returns to investors as we continue our smoke-free transformation. In short, we continue to see a bright future of our business. Following a very strong 2021, we remain confident in our '21 to '23 growth targets and in our ambition to be majority smoke-free by net revenues in 2025. Thank you all for your attention. Emmanuel and myself will be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference.  Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, Jacek and Emmanuel. I hope you're both doing well. I have a question on your EPS guidance this year. It's quite a wide range at 8% to 11% on a currency-neutral basis. So I was hoping you could highlight some of the key assumptions or drivers that put you maybe at the low end of that range versus what needs to happen for you to get to the 11% growth? For instance, 11% is possible even if the chip shortage situation doesn't get resolved for the next few months?
Jacek Olczak: I think Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: I'm going to take this. So, obviously, and we've been trying it in our preliminary remarks, we are still facing a number of uncertainties. The COVID does not disappear even if things seem to be improving. We don't have full visibility on the IT shortage and on the supply chain globally. And that is obviously what is behind with some certainly cautiousness on the guidance that we are giving on the top line. And then from there, we, of course, are driving a business that is seeing a good momentum. We have the traditional driver of price increase. We're going to be very efficient on cost savings. You can see what we've been delivering in 2021, already more than $800 million of efficiency on our cost. We're going to continue in 2022. And I know that is going to drive the difference between the revenue growth and the adjusted EPS organic growth. One of the headwinds that we're going to face this year, which I think we should see as very positive because it's coming from the growth, and we are managing a very nice potential of growth is that we are investing for exciting outlook. It starts, of course, with ILUMA in Japan, but globally, the launch of ILUMA, but certainly with a big impact in Japan, where we know that when we launch a new product, this is having some impact on the cost of goods because we are not at the same level in terms of efficiency on the supply chain. The productivity is not at its maximum, and we've been explaining that in our remarks. And that is going to have some impact at the launch. We talked about air freight as well and that is to have an impact. We said it with probably what we see today is a moderate decrease of the gross margin rate. Without that, it would have been from what we see today, another year of growth of the gross margin rate. But that's really what is driving the guidance. So we have some uncertainty, but we are very excited by the potential of growth that we see with all this innovation that is coming up. We have the traditional driver of efficiency that are going to help. We have some headwind, which was absolutely planned because we are coming with innovation, and we need to invest to launch this innovation. And I should add in terms of innovation, but it's certainly the fact that we are also expanding in terms of geography, what we see in Egypt bode extremely well for the potential in emerging countries, but we need to invest, of course, to build the capacity. We need to develop our commercial tools. We need to invest on the new platform, vaping and nicotine pouches. So what I think is great in this guidance and in our ambition for 2022 is that it's a year with a lot of investment for an exciting growth, but we are still able to deliver a good dynamic top line. We are able to deliver nice margin improvement, good organic growth at a good level. And as you have seen, we are hugely cash generative, and we do that at the same time, again, while investing for the future.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's super helpful and honestly makes a lot of sense. So clearly, a lot of puts and takes, but you've got a lot of levers to pull. For my second question, I maybe wanted to switch gears a bit and just kind of asked a little bit about the situation in the U.S. and just maybe an update. It sounds like you expect to get back in the market next year with IQOS. So maybe love to hear a little more color on this. And will the build out of the production in the U.S., will that be your financial responsibility? And then Altria mentioned some issues between you two in terms of the agreement you have in their fourth quarter press release. So just was hoping to better understand what that could mean. For instance, I guess, Altria fails to meet the terms of the agreement, would you then pursue distribution of IQOS in the U.S. yourselves? And/or, I guess, find another distribution partner? Can you kind of walk through that for us? And then I'm thinking on tech of a potential solution for VEEV in the U.S., assuming it gets approved.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So Bonnie, as we're working on the -- bringing the manufacturing capacity for IQOS on the U.S. territory. And that's our main mitigation plan or reaction plan to where we are today post the ITC event. As we said, we think that the summer at the beginning of the next year, we should be in a position to resume the shipments in the U.S. As we and the Altria is this close, we have some disagreements with regards whether Altria has fulfilled the certain milestones in the current contract, and we're currently in negotiations or discussions with Altria to resolve it. And so, I believe in a good faith, we should be finding some solutions. I wouldn't do know beyond speculating what other options and how we would approach the IQOS going forward in the U.S. I mean, our partner results, and I think we should see some amicable solution between both partners. Now I have said it on a number of occasions in the U.S. market is as a few other markets in which we have a very negligible and more presence of strategic importance. So obviously, you've heard us in the past, I believe that that pre-ITC ruling IQOS performance in U.S. and you know how we perform with IQOS across all essential geographies I mean it's really well below what I would expect at this stage or characterize the potential of IQOS. And if I take into this, the fact that this is then inhalable FDA authorized product, you don't really have a competition and the size of the market, et cetera, I think it's fair to say that the expectations were much beyond where we are today. But I will stop here and I believe we will find a good resolution, which will, on the one hand, enable the American smokers, cigarette smokers to have our access to that technology, and also something which will be accretive to us with the partners' results there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Growe: I just wanted to ask, first of all, on IQOS, and you had a nice acceleration in the number of IQOS users in the fourth quarter. I just want to -- and I know you talked about an acceleration of getting back to that roughly 1 million users sequentially. Can that not happen until the second half of '22? Or will supply be sufficient to where you could start to see that level of user growth in the first half of '22? I'm just trying to get a sense of that availability of devices to understand the growth in '22.
Jacek Olczak: Yes. Look, the Q4, reacceleration of coming back to the previous user growth is highly encouraging. I just confirmed that IQOS had that ability of a continued growth. Obviously, it's very much hinges on the fact that though we have unrestricted availability of the devices. And remember IQOS today has had a heat-not-burn propositions, which we have today consist of the few versions of IQOS blade product. I should mention real product coming through the other partnership with TMG and IQOS ILUMA. And all of that also rather create certain portfolio of proposition for the various target in the various consumers growth. So we regain a little bit of a flexibility of recomposing the full portfolio in Q4. And hence, Europe we've all seen the spectacular regain in the user acquisition. It is somehow reflected in our 4% to 6% growth target and the heated tobacco unit target for this year that for how many months or for many weeks in a year, we think we can have unrestricted access to the full product portfolio of the devices very much. I believe that actual IQOS can fly is higher if we're in the unrestricted moot, but some have in the product as for the next year, we should have bigger scenario, which is maybe more on the moderate side, et cetera. If this was the -- if we wouldn't have all these constraints coming from a device as a couple of other things in the supply chain, I believe would be looking at the different numbers. But at this stage, it's difficult to start taking this into something which we think we can we can deliver. So I think I'm saying the IQOS has a higher potential that growth rate, but when you really have to be the moment when we can go unconstrained. Needless to say that part of our growth is coming from Asia region. And although European Union was less than part of the one that you like, seems like it's moving COVID behind, we're still not at the stage in Japan and a few other locations. So we also have to start factoring this in. But I'm very optimistic that we can deliver 2022 and frankly speaking, knowing how much headwind we need to take on our test in 2022. I start looking actually excited about the '23.
Emmanuel Babeau: Just to complement on your question on, can we reach 1 million. I think we are simply we see rather a ramp up today. It doesn't mean that we cannot reach 1 million in one of the quarter in H1, but it's true that we see a ramp-up and an acceleration as we go through the year.
Chris Growe: Okay. And I did just have a quick question on the U.S. to follow on Bonnie's question. Is there a scenario where you prevail on the patent office review that would allow you to start importing the product again before the first half of '23? So you're getting your supply chain ready in the U.S., but is there a chance that you could win on the patents and not -- and be able to import the product again?
Jacek Olczak: Well, there it. But the whole process is -- I think it deserves separate conversations about the patent laws and the processes around this whole thing and unfortunately, we have to cope with this. I mean, every, we prevail on the invalidation of some patents, obviously, the other party, in this case, if they have a right to repeal. So the whole process is really extended in time. And by -- you need another couple of years, frankly speaking, until you have when of the parties actually can claim the full victory. Then you have to go to the ITC and establish the restrictions, if you like, which are now imposed on us. I think the fastest -- absent any other resolutions, right, the fastest route back to the U.S. is reactivating that our domestic capacity and resupplying the market from that. And then maybe that later on, we are constrained, which means that the U.S. market could be supplied from the both international and from the domestic. But I think the near-term opportunity for us is to go the route which we discussed.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Pamela Kaufman: I have a question about your outlook for combustible pricing in 2022. Pricing in 2021 was below your historical rate of growth, given headwinds in Indonesia. But can you talk about your expectations for pricing, pricing environment in 2022? And how you're prioritizing price realization versus market share in combustibles?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So we're looking for, as we said, we're looking at the 3% to 4% pricing variance this year, which is better, stronger than the last year. I think some Asian geographies to the variety of factors are still presumably driving as lower on what we think we could have normally realized a bit comparing at least to the historical trends we have there. Indonesia, you're absolutely rightly pointed out is on the negative, although the tax increases, which the industry has to pass on. I mean, give some hope that we can end up with that maybe Indonesia can return to that pricing is the important component of the growth there. But we also have to take it from the considerations of impact of recovery, the volumes and presumably talking more about the Philippines. We see how much of this thing we can unwind in 2022. And having reaching the benefits in '22 and how much we can build at a pace for '23. It's going in the right direction, but a bit of a more is needed. The last of the pricing environment, okay, so as difficult to predict, but as we characterize it's improving on all our geographies. And we have a pretty good visibility at this stage, obviously, about the taxes that is in the major volume or profit market to Emmanuel in his part of the remarks, was talking about this more and more countries are taking to the multiyear approach, which gives us better visibility and planning around. As you know, in some countries, the tax increases cannot be passed into consumers in one step. You need to have some preparatory, take some pricing before some pricing after -- so it is going into the right direction, especially if we take it in a context that every country, every market is having a huge pressure on the public finances due to the COVID situation, et cetera. So, I think we -- I mean, as far navigated pretty well there.
Pamela Kaufman: Right, thank you. My second question is on ILUMA uptake. And if you can provide some more color on how much of the new user growth in Japan has been driven by ILUMA for IQOS? And what observations you have around the user base and the interaction with prior versions of IQOS?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So -- but you might have -- if I remember that from the very beginning of ILUMA was personally very excited about that innovation. And I am so happy that it delivers on my expectations, actually is not even beating by expectations. So I will continue if you allow me to present enthusiastic voice. ILUMA does generate, obviously, the IQOS user, Blade product users, you appreciate the benefit of ILUMA the first moment, you have it in your hands and you have your fist experience. And the response from the consumers in Japan is phenomenal. Obviously, the ILUMA goes to the existing users, but we also already having the benefit of existing IQOS users switching to ILUMA because they have uninterrupted consumption during every moment a day when they or they're willing to use the product. And this also has an impact on the volumes. In other sense, if I give you the device, which is much more informative to use, reliable, much, much, much more reliable, you will have a tendency to increase the consumption versus what you have on a blade, we the patients failed to allow for having that experience. So that's a very good thing. Second thing is ILUMA, after all of these initial months, we observed a very solid higher level of conversions. And if you know, it is a very important component in the business model. I have many devices will fully convert smokers combustible smokers. How many of them will stay because it releases the pressure going forward also on the margins, et cetera. And the third one is, at this stage, I remember the number likely about 20% of the user of the ILUMA cells is coming from the people who are never in the category, not in cost. And also what I start serving recently, you also start taking back users who have temporary and migrated from IQOS to competitive products. So in whatever aspect of performance of ILUMA look like, it really delivers on every axis. So the question is again, and I know that for some might be body, do we have availability of the devices? And can we continue supplying the market and the rest, I believe so far so far is really going in the right direction.
Operator: We'll take your next question from Vivian Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: My first question is on pricing. Certainly encouraging to hear that your outlook for 2022 contemplate an improvement in pricing relative to last year, I was wondering, however, if you could just comment on how you're thinking about price gap management between your combustible cigarettes and your heated tobacco units, please?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we essentially, in most or all markets, we maintain the same sort of a positioning of IQOS today versus the cost of combustible reference point. As you know, most of the tax systems actually have that conversion mechanism baked in. So if there is a tax increase on a combustible somehow proportionally this triggers the increase on the heated tobacco units, which translates at the consumer price gaps essentially untouched. We obviously complement depend on the market situation, our portfolio, for example, KT&G, the real proposition and I think it works very nicely, especially in the geographies when IQOS reaches the levels which are above, for example, premium -- equivalent of the premium price segment in the combustible market. So we need to take affordability to the equation as well, so instead of doing something about the pricing of IQOS and the heats. We're actually expanding the portfolio to the below, but also to the above in some geographies when we think there is a bus premium versus IQOS versus heat that the opportunity. We did it very successfully in Russia in a few European markets. So I think the whole thing is that the broader we have a portfolio of horizontally from a price perspective and vertically from taste, flavor, et cetera, perspective, we're increasingly creating more attractiveness for the cigarette smokers to switch to heat-not-burn.
Vivien Azer: Perfect. And my follow-up question decision to discontinue Platform 2 TEEPS. Certainly, that product has been under evaluation for a number of years. And I was just curious to hear kind of the key take away from the consumer test. Is the problem that consumers are using a live heat force, and that's just creating a lot of confusion in terms of the reduced risk proposition? Was it product performance? Just any other color would be helpful.
Jacek Olczak: Now actually, I think that like allow me the language, it was more on the user interface rather than anything else. I don't think the past the number of the market test the proposition, the livability of the propositions in terms of the -- is the better alternative to smoking and everything goes there. The issue actually pertains to the heat pipe. As you remember, the design at the very end of the cigarette-like looking product, you have the heat size, which requires lighting, okay? And this was -- to face open this from the paper cup lighting this. And that is the question, how you extinguish the product, right, because you need to pay attention how you extinguish the product. And this was actually in our opinion, what the consumers' opinion actually, not the leading to that adoption levels, which we would wish to have an especially comparing our experience from other platforms and the mainly T1 platform. So I think we reached the moment the design of that product and this part of the technology around the heat source and operating asking the consumers, how the intern operate around this whole thing led us to the conclusion that we are seeing that design component we shut down. And I think still the proposition makes sense is understood by the consumer has the potential, but we cannot offer the product to the consumers, which they will not find convenient to use. And the convenience is either name of what the consumers want these days, and I think we need to deliver on this one, especially that our ambitions would be to also leverage the equity, which we build around the IQOS, and IQOS cannot afford product, which has this one. So I think we will come back one day to the P2. From the very beginning, you may recall our annually Investors Day when we start talking about the vision of growing smoke-free and how many platforms will be needed to compare the 1 billion small cars worldwide. This is a proposition which is more for the more conservative audience, the people who really don't want to completely walk away from the ritual experience when the combustible cigarettes are delivering. So I think in terms of our growth prospects for the item I don't think it's that much of an issue that we will be working on that by using a different approach to the design and the technology going forward, going forward. So I hope it answers your question, Vivien.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Jain: So I have a couple of questions. So first one is on your guidance. So your volume growth is minus 1:1. You are saying cigarette pricing will be three to four. And then category price mix in that slide that you have, it is plus three, assuming it is a three. So it should come to plus 5% to plus 8% on revenue growth for FY '22, but you are saying 4% to 6%. So that will imply that the category mix uplift will be less in FY '22 than was the case in FY '21. So can you just help us understand why that will be the case.
Jacek Olczak: I'm happy to try to add to, Gaurav, certainly what we are expecting in 2022 is to have another very nice difference between the volume growth and the revenue growth. And indeed, for the volume, we've been guiding to -- from minus 1% to plus 1%. So then the question is how much are we going to generate in terms of extra growth, there is this price where we have in 2% to 4%. Remember, we've done 2.7% in 2021. So, the low end of the bracket is not massively above what we did in 2021. But it's true that it could be better, and it's certainly something that we are factoring in the high end. And then there is impact of the growth of the IQOS business and it's on category where we have this positive mix impact that is playing. But here, the mix and with the launch in many new economies and new geographies and emerging country that is potentially having an impact on the differential. So, we do expect a very strong differential again, but not necessarily at the same level as the difference that we generated in 2021. Last but not least, we referred to the fact that we have, at the beginning, and its temporary higher weight on the consumables for IQOS ILUMA Ontario. And this is having an impact because the excise duty in the country where the excise duty, are based on weight is higher, and therefore, because we are coming with the same price for the consumable than it. That can generate when we have a switch but temporary. Again, I see from the fact that it's temporary, decrease -- a slight decrease on per steak. So that can have an impact as well. So that is really what you're going to have plus potentially some impact on the price which will depend on the volume of the device that we sell also on the mix of the device that we sell and also on the commercial aggressiveness that we want to have on the price of the device. So you have to take a number of things into account. Now at the end of the day, as you can see between the minus 1% to plus-1% and the 4% to 6%, we are definitely targeting to have another year with a very nice differential between volume and organic revenue growth, which is exactly how we end up.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. That's very helpful. And my second question is on the beyond nicotine segment where you will have $150 million of operating losses this year and you make also the comment that you will invest in it in future years so that you can hit the $1 billion revenue target. So does it mean that the losses we should expect to be higher in FY '23 than what they will be in FY '22? Or when could we expect that segment to break even?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think there will be an investment for the next few years, not a couple but a few years, which we are willing to do. I think if you stay with us and wait until the CAGNY when we will give you more insight of what we have, what is our thinking about is beyond nicotine wellness and healthcare business because then we will be in a position to show which products, concrete products or programs we're willing to go after what is the size of an opportunity and what sort of investment is in terms. But I think the number which we gave for this year, for 2022 in the guidance, about the ballpark sort of the investment, which we will be calling for the couple of years.
Emmanuel Babeau: It's not a one-off. It could go a bit higher, but I don't expect an explosion here. I think you have a good calibration of the cutout that we're going to invest over a few years.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jared Dinges: First, I want to touch a bit more on the nicotine pouches. How should we be thinking about the scale of that initial launch in the Nordics? And how should we think about the future market launches that you guys touched on a bit? Are you considering launching nicotine pouches in markets maybe that don't have a nicotine pouch presence today, like some of your emerging markets? And also, just looking at the potential in the U.S., would you consider a PMT application there as well?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, I would leave the U.S. aside for a second. I think nicotine pouches can play a very important role in, if you like the smoking smokers, okay? They demonstrated their variability that has that proposition in many markets. Initially, we're essentially taking share as we acquire this. And after remaking of the product and the packaging, et cetera, we'll go in the market when there was some sales of a share, obviously, not very high, but we start where we already were present. And we build on this as always, in our innovations who will look at the consumers' feedback see what else we have to improve. And we also have some product pipeline behind the initial offering which we now could accelerate to the large extent, thanks to the acquisition of the therapy. Now, Fertin gives us much broader opportunities than just the pouches because Fertin seats on the very interesting delivery systems in -- for the oral delivery. And we know that Fertin is the manufacturer of the nicotine replacement therapies like the gums, nicotine gums, but they also have interesting other technologies. So, we will be thinking we start with the pouches, but I think over a period of time, 2022. i think the oral way of delivering nicotine as a substitute to smoking is actually a very attractive opportunity, which we are very excited to start working on. So, we will go into the geographies, obviously, when the pouches are not present today. I mean, as you know, we have a geographical footprint in addition to this 70-plus markets where they have acquired quite a meaningful IQOS infrastructure. You're back in the shops, you're back in digital. You're having one in CRM, commercial consumer engagement. I believe we can start adding to that our portfolio of the propositions to smokers to the oral category -- broader oral category than just the pouches. So we focus this year on the pouches. We will be extending the presence, but I think that is more than just the pouches and the very pleased that we concluded the acquisition of rating because it gives us -- it accelerates our development by a quite good few years, which others would have to take organically.
Jared Dinges: Got it. So just to follow up on that. So you would consider the U.S. PMT application?
Jacek Olczak: I think I answered that question to Bonnie. U.S. is a very attractive market, and I believe this other strategic importance to us. And I do believe that in the market of the size of the U.S., we need to have all platforms, frankly speaking, because of the one platform which can guarantee the full success of proceeding of an opportunity. So ultimately, yes, but our focus today is somewhere else.
Jared Dinges: Got it. And the second one, going back towards cigarettes and IQOS. Are you guys worried at all about potential impacts of price elasticity especially with lower income consumers given the inflationary environment and where you guys are positioned in most markets, and we're usually more at the premium end. So maybe you can give a comment on that?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. So the price elasticity is always the concern, and as we know very well, sometimes is price elasticity on the tobacco nicotine product is elevated due to the pressures or income pressures on the consumers. So, we're now having that situation in a few markets that consumers have a pressure on the income. I mean I believe some of these pressures will unwind as the COVID will be becoming a sort of the past and I don't think it's anything systemic. It's very interesting you're asking this question because if we look in the market where we're taking pricing on cigarettes and the HeatSticks and the market has a pretty robust set of data from the past increases. I think today, products like IQOS or alternatives to smoking, tends to have a better elasticity, price elasticity than the conventional cigarette. And as you know, I guess, very well, the price elasticity on cigarettes and discard by other factors was pretty attractive, and this was a part of the building as a business model. And actually, at this stage, looks with alternative even for the -- not high but better elasticity than a combustible cigarette. Separately, not from the elasticity perspective, but from the pure affordability perspective, we were already pretty successful with IQOS in the so-called low middle income countries. But we also know that in order to make the more significant inroads. We need to come with the proposition, which directly addresses the need below-price, price segment. And we will not deliver the smokers behind alone. And before the end of this year, we having the plans to test another technology which would allow for the both devices and consumables to be more accessible from an affordability perspective, while there we're going to have reduction potential as I course as we know it today. So, we're taking those things into the very serious consideration. So thank you for your question.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Jacek Olczak: Well, this was a call longer than expected, but we also delivered the results last year better than we expected. I think somehow we match it. Thank you very much for your attention. We invite you to our CAGNY presentation, which will be in a position to give the more light, more details on the few aspects like what we discussed today, wellness healthcare, but also how we look here in a much broader in terms of the development of these categories. And I think we got filling in our, my voice and Emmanuel's voice how excited we are that '21, we delivered in that shape and form. And despite the number of headwinds, which I believe we articulate pretty well. We're still looking into the very successful and rewarding for both of us 2022. So thank you very much for your attention and hope to see most of you, if not all the recovered CAGNY presentation. Thank you, all.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. See you soon.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team, and just a reminder that the slides and scripts are available on the PMI website. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Philip Morris International fourth quarter 2021 year-end earnings conference call. At this time, you may disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Please stand by. Your program is about to begin. [Operator Instructions] Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli : Welcome. And thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2021 third quarter results. You may access the release on www. pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for reduced risk products for RRPs, as well as adjustments. Other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market share data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS or to our IQOS Heat Up Burn products, all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, Otitopic, and Vectura Group, PMI added the other category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the other category are evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments.  Today's remarks contain Forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or Forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional Forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce A - Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered another strong performance in the third quarter of 2021, coming ahead of our expectation to achieve a record [Indiscernible] quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58. Most notable was the continued excellent growth of IQOS driving +33% Q3 organic growth in RRP net revenue, and +7.6% for total PMI. HTU shipment volumes grew +24% compared to the same quarter last year to reach 23.5 billion units with broad-based growth for both our volume and the category across key geographies. This was delivered despite ongoing tightness in device supplies, due to the global semiconductor shortage, which impact IQOS user growth rates.  In combustibles, further sequential share gains supported total PMI giving growth of 2.1% in Q3. And we continue to expect total cigarette and it's [Indiscernible] goals for the year. We are firmly on track for a strong 2021 organic growth performance with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in the [Indiscernible]. We are also delighted to share outstanding initial result for IQOS ILUMA in Japan, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In the quarter, we made three milestone acquisition as we build our business for the long term to include product that go beyond tobacco and nicotine. Our smoke-free transformation is now also reflected in our financing with the launch of an industry for business transformation link financing framework. And we continue to prioritize return to shareholder through 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue grew by +7.6% on an organic basis or +9.1% in dollar terms.  This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and the recovery of the [Indiscernible] business in many markets. We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.4% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both HTUs and combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin decreased by 10 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA and increased commercial spend partly related to its launch, offsetting the continued positive effect from the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, pricing, and productivity savings. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58 represent +8.5 organic growth, and +11.3 in the last terms, a very good performance. Looking now at year-to-date performance, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost +11% in dollar terms and by +7.3% organically. This reflect the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive. We delivered strong organic growth of nearly +6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing with pricing on combustible at just over 3% or around 5%, excluding Indonesia.  Our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin increased by 280 basis points on an organic basis, an excellent performance driven by our top-line growth and [Indiscernible] of IQOS, and pricing combined with operating leverage and productivity savings. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 15.8% organically and plus 20.4% in dollar term; also -- obviously a very strong results. This brings me to guidance for 2021.  We are revising our organic growth outlook for net revenues to plus 6.5% to plus 7%, representing the upper half of the previous range and reaffirming the strong outlook for organic OI margin expansion of around 200 basis points. We also confirm our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast at the upper end of our previous range, reflecting +13% to +14% growth, or +16% to +17% in dollar terms. This translating to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.01 to $6.06, including an estimated sub variable currency impact of $0.17 at prevailing rates. Following on from our most recent comment s, as the tightness in device supplies persist, we now expect our HTU shipment volume to be around 95 billion units as we prioritize devices for user retention. Given the continued growth of HTUs and the need to maintain inventory duration, we continue to expect our full-year shipments to be slightly ahead of IMS volume s. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchases or acquisition. Share repurchases through October the 15th amount to around $117 million after some limitation during Q3 from blackout restriction.  In term of other assumptions, we are assuming only a limited Q4 recovery in duty-free following a modest improvement in Q3 with intercontinental and Asian travels still very subdued. We continue to assume fully accomplishable pricing of +2 to +3%, with a softer expected Q4 reflecting continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets, notably in South and Southeast Asia, as well as tough comparison in Germany and Australia. Lastly, in 2021, we continue to expect around $11 billion of operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rate subject to year-end working capital requirements.  We also update our expectation for full-year capital expenditures to around $0.6 billion reflecting latest launch plans and pandemic related planning factors. Before discussing depth, I am pleased to report some recent positive regulatory development further to the shares in previous quarters. For example, Switzerland adopted a new federal law on tobacco products and in cigarettes defining dedicated product category and differentiated as warnings. In New Zealand, the government has now published new regulation for smoke-free product, which allow branded packaging to be reintroduced with a specific text as warning.  In Egypt, earlier this year, smoke-free product were clearly differentiated from combustible cigarette in both Fiscal and regulatory treatment. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of non-combustible alternative compared with smoking. While fluctuations across different market are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and Fiscal frameworks that recognize this critical [Indiscernible] reduction opportunity. Turning back now to our results, Q3 total shipment volume increased by plus 2.1% and by plus 1.5% year-to-date.  This reflect continued strong growth from HTU of +24% driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched markets in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1 billion units below IMS volume for the third quarter, primarily reflecting timing around the August ILUMA launch and the October tax driven price increase in Japan. We expect this dynamic to reverse in Q4. The minus 0.4% decline in our Q3 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of total industry volume and of our market share.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco unit comprised 13% of our total shipment volume year-to-date as compared to 11% in full-year 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up almost 30% of our adjusted net revenue year-to-date compared to 23% for the same period in 2020, IQOS devices, accounted for over 6% of the $6.7 billion of RP net revenue. With a step-up in Q3, reflecting the IQOS into my launch, which outweighed the effects of supply constrain on other acquisitions. The plus 7.3% organic growth in year-to-date net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 1.5% reflect the twin engines driving our top-line.  The first is pricing on combustible and, in certain markets, on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our year-to-date margin expansion starting with growth margin which expanded by 240 basis points on an organic basis.  While expansion was lower in Q3 as ILUMA devices were shipped to Japan for the launch, the multiple positive [Indiscernible] discussed in prior quarters continue. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies are also bearing fruits with around $450 million of gross productivity savings benefit. This was accompanied by robust SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted year-to-date marketing, administration, and research costs, 40 basis points lower as a percentage of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working partly offset by increased commercial investment in Q3. With SG&A saving of more than $200 million before inflation and reinvestment, this mean we have generated over $650 million in overall growth efficiencies year-to-date.  This is strong progress toward the combined target of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. Moving to market share, sequential gains for both our IQOS and combustible portfolios give us strong momentum going into Q4 and next year, despite an approximate [Indiscernible] 3 points year-over-year drag in Q3 from market mix. Importantly, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter for HTU s with record shares across key IQOS geographies.  For combustible, the improving total market volume backdrop includes notable recovery in Indonesia, Turkey, and Mexico, and close to stable Q3 industry volumes in the EU region. Our share of the combustible category has strongly recovered on a sequential basis, moving us one step closer to our target of stable share as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions recede in many markets. In South and Southeast Asia, renewed COVID -linked measures have somewhat dampened the recovery. Though industry volume have nonetheless improved sequentially in Indonesia and in the Philippines where the year-over-year trend is impacted by a challenging prior-year comparison. Our share in the region grew sequentially albeit less than expected, primarily given pandemic-related development in the Philippines. Let's now turn to the tightness in device supply due to the global semiconductor shortage. As we communicated in September, with demand continuing to grow, this has already affected the availability and assortment of IQOS devices in certain markets in Q3, which impact our ability to run at full commercial and competitive capacity and fulfill consumer demand.  Device shipment outside Japan were limited to a 7% year-over-year increase, significantly below the growth in net sales. This resulted in slower user growth of several 100,000 in the quarter notably in Russia, given limitation on the IQOS to the 4 plus device as flagged in recent communication. At this stage, semiconductor supply forecasting remains volatile so we assume the tight supply situation will persist into the first half of 2022. We will continue to carefully prioritize necessary device replacement for existing users, followed by device sales targeted at acquisition.  The successful start of IQOS ILUMA in Japan confirmed it would be a significant driver of acquisition and retention. Nonetheless, at the beginning it triggers significant upgrades from existing large IQOS user base, many of whom don't really needed to replace their devices. This is a highly desired consumer behavior in normal supply [Indiscernible], but increases constraint in the shortage. Therefore, we now assume that additional major launches would only take place in the second half of next year. Given this evolving situation, we have continued important commercial investment in key area.  This include portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA in Japan and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category, understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development project. Including the investment already made in Q3, we anticipate around $300 million of incremental H2 spending compared to the first half. Overall, this is a temporary phenomenon and with demand remaining strong, we expect user growth to reaccelerate once shortages ease. We have a pipeline of exciting innovation on devices and consumable, including but not exclusive to ILUMA, and a number of new market entries plan. However, there are short-term shortage scenario under which the transitory supply impact on user growth could result in 2022 organic growth below our 2021, 2023 targeted average rate for net revenues, OI margin expansion, and adjusted diluted EPS. Nonetheless, with a strong 2021 as a base and a robust reacceleration port shortage, we confirm our confidence in our 2021-2023 growth targets. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.4 million IQOS users as of September the 30th. Excluding the impact of international sanction in Belarus, this reflect growth of around 0.4 million user s in the quarter with the rate of growth subdued by the tightness of device supply and the time needed to adjust our commercial programs. As demonstrated again by the ILUMA launch in Japan, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong.  Following adjustment of our program and assortment, we expect Q4 user growth to improve by a few 100,000 compared to the growth seen in Q3. The reduce user growth for the second half should therefore be broadly consistent with the potential 2 to 3 billion HTU impact flagged in recent communications. We estimate that 73% of total user or 14.9 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. The user growth again reflect acquisition across key IQOS geography, despite device constraint. In the EU region, third quarter share for each reached 5.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.4 points higher than Q3 last year. As mentioned last quarter, we expect a sequential share for HTU s to be broadly stable due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. And as in the prior year, we expect a strong Q4 in both volume and market share terms. This very good performance includes strong growth across the region with Italy, Germany, and Poland as notable contributors. Robust performance continued in Russia with our Q3 HTU share by plus 1.1 point, to which 6.9%, while lower than Q2, notably due to the seasonality of the combustible market, we expect further sequential growth in IMS to deliver strong quarterly share increase in Q4 as in the prior year. We had the largest limitation on lower-priced devices and related commercial programs in Russia.  And we have seen some increased consumer trial of discounted competitor offering a disposable e-vapor product. However, we continue to see high interest in the category and with both our existing price tier portfolio and future innovation supporting our clear category leadership, we see ample room for further strong growth over time.  There is also [Indiscernible] H2 growth across the eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakstan, and southeast Europe contributing. This slide shows the positive overall regional growth trend in adjusted IMS albeit somewhat dampened on a sequential basis by the halting of shipments to Belarus due to International sanction and timing factor in Kazakhstan. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2 points versus the prior-year quarter due to 20.8%, and adjusted IMS grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.2 billion units, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA. Adjusted sequential share fell by 0.2 point sequentially, reflecting volatility in the total market ahead of the October the 1st excise increase in addition to normal seasonality. While consumer pantry loading effect may wait on Q4 IMS, we expect further robust underlying growth in volume and a nice sequential improvement in market share. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up almost 30% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q3 with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing markets, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product as we aim to be in one other market by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in Egypt, the first in Africa, and reached an off-take exit share of 2% in Europe and Cairo. We also now add Norway and Iceland, where our recent acquisition of [Indiscernible] gives us a presence in the [Indiscernible] and nicotine pouch category. This take the [Indiscernible] snooze total number of markets where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 70 of which 28 are in low and middle-income market, which we are introducing as more robust measure of making smoke-free product available to adult smoker in emerging countries.  Again, we may have some delays in this market expansion program in the first half of 2022. Given our smoke-free leadership and global reach, let me pause and share a few words regarding the strength of our intellectual property. Across all our smoke-free product, we have strong patent and as being the clear leading innovator in the tobacco category over recent years, investing billions of dollars in the process.  Despite attempts to disrupt our business through litigation by your competitor who lags behind on R&D and innovation. We have been -- you need us to be successful in defending our product against IP challenges in all 11 ruling outside of the U.S. Including the UK high court and at the European Patent Office. The U.S.A. -- the U.S. ITC is a federal agency which, among other things, deals with import, trained to ensure domestic industry of U.S. intellectual property rights. We also note the two paths I mentioned in the ITC final determination were both drafted after IQOS had been launched. The FDA, fulfilling the exclusive [Indiscernible] interest mandate given to it by Congress for tobacco product, has already found that IQOS is appropriate for the promotion of public health and expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. We are hopeful in the current presidential review period that the U.S. Trade Representative will consider the impact on current American IQOS users and the many more that would be denied access. In the scenario where the ITC determination is upheld, where the financial impact of this time is in material, given the early stage of the U.S. IQOS fallout, this would unfortunately meaning that U.S. consumers would be unable to buy IQOS for a bit of time. Meanwhile, our contingency plans are underway and include domestic manufacturing.  The U.S. patent office is also reviewing certain claim of the patents in question with initial ruling expected in 2022, and by subject to an appeal process. While the ITC ruling may cause near-term disruption to the U.S. availability of IQOS, we continue to see a large opportunity for IQOS in the United States over the coming years. The global IQOS innovation story took a historic step forward in August with the launch of two ILUMA devices and a range of [Indiscernible] HTUs in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 Dual, we believe the simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for [Indiscernible] edge smoker using SmartCore internal induction heating technology.  While -- with the national roll -out taking place at the start of September, initial results were outstanding with device sales well ahead of all comparable past launches at the same stage despite some limitation on device availability and the proportion of new users growing to 18%. [Indiscernible] purchases are growing rapidly, exiting the quarter at over 10% of total PMI HTU of tech volume. Consumer feedback has also been very positive, with meetings increases in the net [Indiscernible].  Following the success, we plan to launch in our second market of Switzerland next month and look forward to additional major launches in 2022 when circumstances allow. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with good progress in the first group of markets, where we started in our own channels with a limited range of taste variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience. And the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows it to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see sign of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback related to competitive products. We see encouraging early success in Italy where VEEV reached an estimated 7% national exit volume of tech share of crude system product -- system put, sorry, despite not yet being available nationally.  And in the Czech Republic with an estimated 8% national volume of tech exit share. We also launched in Croatia in Q3, Canada in October, and plan to launch in Ukraine before year-end. We also continue preparations to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2022. Turning now to our strategy to moving to new business areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, which focuses on leveraging and complementing our existing capabilities in the health care and wellness space. We see significant opportunity in adjacent area with our two focused corridors of self-care wellness, including botanicals and inhaled therapeutics, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, Otitopic, and Vectura enabled us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities with over 250 scientists, infrastructure, technology, and expertise in innovative enameled and oral product formulation while continuing to grow CDMO activities. As shown on this slide, this opens up a number of highly complementary opportunities and new focus areas. This acquisition will fully leverage PMI 's existing capability like science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to innovation. We look forward to updating you more in the future on our plans and progress in these exciting new areas. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, we continue to make good progress throughout our [Indiscernible] through advancing our transformation and addressing our most material impact on society.  We broaden access to our smoke-free product by increasing the availability to adult smoker around the world with new product launches across the growing range of market and smoke-free categories. In addition, our recent acquisition build our human intellectual and social capital, adding smoke-free capabilities and laying the foundation for a strong business in areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, as we strive to develop commercially successful product that seek to have a net positive impact on society. I am proud to highlight the recent publication of our business transformation linked financing framework. And subsequent refinancing of our revolving credit facility. The framework which follows ICMA principal and receive a second party opinion from S&P, links our financing to [Indiscernible] targets in our transformation. Last, we remain on track to achieve carbon neutrality of our direct operation by 2025, five-years ahead of our 2030 target. In addition, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference approaching, we plan to publish a robust, low carbon transition plan and white paper on climate justice, which highlight the connectivity between environmental and social issues. Overall, we are on track for excellent top and bottom-line growth performance in 2021 with strong underlying momentum for IQOS and robust cash generation. We are investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product portfolio and geographic reach. This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our three recently announced acquisitions, which provide a comprehensive development platform in safe care wellness and in health therapeutic, and strengthen our position in modern oral nicotine.  We have increased cash return to shareholders in Q3 through higher dividend and our share repurchase program in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and return to investors as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free Company. For 2022, we have a pipeline of exciting innovation for both devices and consumable. And we expect IQOS user growth to reaccelerate when device shortages ease. We continue to see a strong future for our business and remain confident in our 2021-2023 organic growth targets. Thank you very much, and I'm now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants please keep a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow-up questions may be taken. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.
Gaurav Jain : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.
Emmanuel Babeau :  [Indiscernible]
Gaurav Jain : [Indiscernible]. My first question is on the -- unit 2022 comments around growth rate being lower than the range you have given for 2021-2023 because of the issues around device supply. Now, if device supply is lower and your IQOS acquisition is lower, then doesn't it imply that your commercial investments are also lower and so it should be beneficial to your EPS, or is that a correct way -- incorrect way of thinking about things?
Emmanuel Babeau : So thank you, Guarav, for the question. First of all, let me repeat that this is one scenario, the fact that the constraints are going to stay with us in H1 next year. This is not the only one, so you have more favorable scenario. And at that stage, frankly, it's a fast-moving, super-fluid situation. So we don't know, but I think it was really important to share the possibility that the pressure on availability that we are seeing in H2 2021, we're still going to see it in in H1 2022.  So that's the scenario you are referring to and in this situation we would see after this six months second half of 2021, we'd see another six months period with reduced acquisition that is the underlying potential that we have seen in H1. In this situation, no doubt that, of course, the spending would be impacted by the fact that the number of launches or a number of commercial activities, that's happening, that's very clear. But at the same time, I think we've been very clearly saying it today, we are absolutely sure of the very strong potential of IQOS. And we think that this potential remained absolutely unchanged by what's going on. So there will be when the shortage ease, a very nice acceleration.  On top of that, we will be coming at the same time with very exciting innovation. You know ILUMA, there is more in the pipe. So we're going to make sure even when there is some limitation on availability that we keep building awareness, we keep building the category, but also the IQOS franchise. So not all cost will go away because we're going to -- I mean, we are here to make a success. As you know, on the long time and not managing only 6 months. So yes, there would be in this scenario -- once again it's one scenario, among others. They would be reduction in investment. But as you can see in Q3, we continue to invest even when there is some limitation because we are building this long-term success that is extremely clear in the outlook that we have.
Gaurav Jain : Thank you. And a follow-up question on your U.S. strategy. And there are number of almost like cross-currents going on that you're partnering with Altria for IQOS and they're now you have lost the lawsuit versus VAT. And there is a potential that you have to do domestic production of your devices. Then you are also planning to file a PMTA for IQOS VEEV later next year, so that could also be a potential new product than the U.S. market. And then you've also acquired Fertin, which also gives you to capability to potentially launch a modern oral product in the U.S. if you file for that PMTA as well. So how should we think about, in some parts you will be partnering with Altria, in some other parts you could potentially be competing with Altria. So how does it all fit together?
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Guarav, for the question. Let me clarify it again. We have commercial partnership with Altria and each of them tobacco products, so that's very clear. And we're going to see what is the final outcome of this ITC question. I will not rest with the final conclusion. We are at the time of the presidential review. We frankly think it's going to be a defining moment for the objective of the FDA of tobacco on reduction. I think the administration has a great opportunity here to flag how important this tobacco harm reduction policy is. And that would mean to protect IQOS, which is the only [Indiscernible] inhaled nicotine product that is today benefiting from [Indiscernible] in the U.S. So we are still hopeful that we're going to get a positive conclusion after the presidential ruling for us. In the case that it was not the final outcome, of course, we'll continue to work with Altria. The development would be a bit delayed. We'll find a solution to overcome the ITC decision. And we've been flagging the fact that it could go for local production. And, as I think I've been saying during my notes, we remain absolutely convinced of the very strong potential of IQOS in the U.S. So that's one thing. And then you have the other Altria category where indeed we have ambition and you've said it, we are going to file for a PMTA for VEEV.  We could be considering launching modern oral product at a certain point in time as well. And on this one, all the options are open, so we don't have any commercial agreement today. And we will decide in due course how we want to launch and with which kind of set up or partnership. But no decision has been made at that stage.
Gaurav Jain : Thanks a lot, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Guarav.
Operator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with, I apologize, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now active.
Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau : Hello, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog : I had a couple of questions on IQOS ' performance during the quarter. First, is there any sense of how much stronger device sales could have been in the quarter without the supply constraints? In other words, curious to hear from you how strong orders might be for new invites -- devices, especially on ILUMA. And then maybe if you could share how big of a backlog there is. And then surrounding this issue, I just was curious to better understand what gives you the conviction that these issues are going to subside by the second half and just thinking about the risks. These shortages last longer. And then finally on his topic, are there any consent -- contingencies you guys might be working on, or any way for you to be less dependent on the semiconductor suppliers going forward?
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you Bonnie. So first question on the IQOS potential in term of sale of device during Q3 without the constraint. We are seeing that we've been missing several 100,000 of sale of devices. So it's obviously very, very material and we've been reporting the fact that outside Japan and really we have to look outside Japan because Japan with the launch of ILUMA was a specific situation. So outside Japan, devices have been growing by 7%, which is, of course, very, very significantly below the underlying growth of our markets.  And we are growing still close to 25% even in Q3. So that I think give an idea of the kind of GAAP that we may have been facing during this quarter. We believe, as I said, that during Q4, as we now have a better, I would say, grip on things, we've been managing on the reassortment, reallotment. We have a better understanding of the kind of commercial actions that are giving the best possible return. We have a very clear view on how we're going to prioritize. So we believe that we are growing even still with the severe restriction on devices, I'm not able to say whether that would be exactly the same level, but let's take that as an assumption, the same level as Q3, we believe that in terms of user growth, we could do better than in Q3. And we mentioned a few 100 thousand better user growth acquisition. So altogether, that mean that if you believe that the [Indiscernible] underlying growth rate was between 4.5 to 5 million user a year that we're seeing in each one, we're going to miss anywhere between 1 to 1.5 million user growth in H2 altogether.  And that is absolutely consistent. So that was something that was already here in September -- at the beginning of September, that is consistent with the 2 to 3 billion impact that we mentioned at the beginning of September. But I hope it helps you have some understanding -- better understanding of the impact of the device shortage. And how you should -- you should see it. On -- we are working, I can tell you, around the clock to manage the shortage. We are using all possible lever. So of course we are in very intense discussion with our suppliers exploring old possibility.  We are dominantly optimizing the planning and of course it's quite complex because we talk about shortages on various type of IC, and they are not all entering into the same kind of reference of our range. So we're managing that as well. We are looking at the split by market as well, and we've been buying a little bit and maybe we could be able to have even more success there. So we are really putting all the lever we can to minimize the impact. And today what we are hearing is that the number of capacity should kick in in the first half of next year. And I would tend to think there is a kind of consensus on the fact that H2 next year should be much better in terms of constraint, if not fully back to normal. So this is an assumption that we have today. But I have to admit that we've seen the situation moving fast, rapidly. And as I said, maybe things are going to improve faster because something is going to happen in the overall demand of the economy in the next six months. So maybe that could be even an improvement in H1. That's a scenario. Does it mean that another scenario that H2 could be with more question mark? Well, maybe. What we are hearing when we talk with our partner and supplier so far. But I have to admit that nothing is totally clear on that stage.
Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Super helpful. If I may, I'd like to maybe squeeze in another quick question. Just during this period of slower IQOS device sales and new user acquisition, how should we think about your total volume growth? So is it safe to assume your combustible cig volume will be elevated during this period of slower IQOS device sales and essentially be strong enough to more than offset this? And then given this dynamic, how should we think about this mix impact on your margins in the next few quarters? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau : Sorry, your line was not very good, but you were asking how we should expect the impact on user acquisition versus volumes, correct?
Bonnie Herzog : Sorry, if it didn't come through -- more so on the mix, Emmanuel, because I'm thinking during this period of slower IQOS device sales, combustible cig volume could be elevated.
Emmanuel Babeau : Yeah.
Bonnie Herzog : [Indiscernible] thinking that mix dynamic can impact on margins.
Emmanuel Babeau : Look, we continue to target very nice growth of IQOS and [Indiscernible] is a brilliant category altogether. And of course, as the EPS leader of this category, we see that continuing in the coming quarters. And as you know as well, that is coming with a very nice mix in terms of revenue per stick, and it's still very much visible in our Q3 numbers. And we also flagged the fact that that was positive in terms of gross margin rate for the consumable business, the IQOS business. So maybe if the growth is a bit weaker because of the situation, the positive mix will continue to evolve; has already, but at a lower pace. But that's going to continue to be nicely positive. And on top of that, of course, then there is a question of, okay, what are we going to spend in terms of SG&A in this kind of situation. So it's difficult to say that it's going to be necessarily as in a negative impact on the margin. We are talking about very powerful driver on our financial performance. And even once again, is the growth rate is going to decrease a bit, still going to be significantly higher than any evolution on [Indiscernible]. And it's going to still continue to deliver a positive impact on the mix.
Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you so much again.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Pamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up question --
Emmanuel Babeau : Good morning.
Pamela Kaufman : Good morning. I have a follow-up question about the outlook for next year and the scenarios that will drive the risks to be below your midterm target. It sounds like you're anticipating weaker 1H supply and an improvement in the second half. Would this scenario drive your results to fall below the side and 9% revenue and earnings growth target, or would supply conditions need to worsen relative to these assumptions?
Emmanuel Babeau : Of course, we can play without limits with that very scenario. We have to admit that we've been seeing already in Q3 a weakening of user growth. And as we said, versus -- even if we expect in Q4 an improvement versus Q3, it will still be below the underlying trend. And then, you know, in the scenario that we are describing, we say if the shortages continue in H1 next year, that's when we're going to face this pressure on growth. So it's difficult for me to just comment one scenario. But [Indiscernible], that's the accumulation of what has been happening in H2 this year, 2021, and what could happen the beginning of next year, so H1 2022, that could drive a reduction in the potential growth rate next year. Which would be temporary once again, and when there is a rebound, the [Indiscernible] will come, but that would be the combination that would trigger something that could be below our average growth targets.
Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. That was helpful. My next question is on the ITC decision. Can you elaborate on your contingency plans for making IQOS available in the U.S. What would be the timing of manufacturing IQOS in the U.S. And just to clarify, does the ruling also pertain to ILUMA technology? In terms of bringing ILUMA to the U.S. market, is there an opportunity to bridge IQOS 's PMTA application for ILUMA to accelerate its entry into the U.S.?
Emmanuel Babeau : So regarding the ITC contingency plan, if eventually the presidential review was not favorable, but I want to repeat before answering you that we are hopeful that this presidential review will have a positive outcome for us for the reason I mentioned previously. I cannot elaborate further, unfortunately, but that clearly -- it's part of what we described, the fact that we could have some local production as an element, but I won't elaborate further on how this could happen and how we would get there. On the ILUMA PMTA, a PMTA, frankly, we will need to have a discussion with the FDA on the process and all the process would be carried by the FDA. And at this stage, I'm not able to answer you. So we will certainly require -- ask for a PMTA on ILUMA at a certain point in time, but not in a position today to comment on timing.
Pamela Kaufman : Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you Pam.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer : Hi, thank you. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau : Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer : I apologize for belaboring the ITC issue, but I've got a question on that too. You've noted your track record of success in terms of defending against litigation internationally. Two questions, please. Number 1, are there current cases that are still pending internationally around IP litigation? If so, can you outline where those exist. And number 2, can you just clarify that the litigation that you've successfully defended addresses the exact same claims that were reviewed by the ITC? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau : Well, there are a number of cases pending, I won't elaborate on that. Not all of them are public. And notably in Europe, I just want to repeat that so far in Europe, we've been on 11 cases, trial or at appeal, we've been successful. So I think it tells a lot about the strength of what we've been doing. And yes, some of the patents on which the ITC based their decision before proceeding for review but then that have been reviewed by a number of courts in Europe. And it to be the UK court. And they already have the [Indiscernible] and the UK court precisely has invalidated two family of patent that are at the original ITC decision. And the European Patent Office already evaluated one of this family of patent, so even fundamentally on the merit of the patent and the validity of the patent, we have been going through success in Europe.
Vivien Azer : That's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is on combustible cigarettes. The outlook is getting modestly, it's better; pricing, you've reiterated. If I recall correctly, as we kind of started the year, I think there was a point of caution around pricing with COVID uncertainty, etc, etc. What is your view of the consumer? I know it's a broad question; you operate in a lot of markets. But if you were a little bit conservative or cautious on pricing, when we started the year, what is your feeling about your ability to take pricing today? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau : Well, you have to still give me the remaining weeks for the year before I can elaborate on next year. I think it's still quite unclear what's going to be the environment. One might think that inflation clearly accelerating in many countries, we'll maybe build a global environment that could be better than what we thought initially, but that's still early time. So I'm not able to comment at that stage, so I will keep a cautious stance, which was built, you probably remember on the aftermath of the COVID and the impact of many economy are being under shock.  So we were seeing that that was probably not making a great landscape for price increase. But I have to admit that I don't know what's going to be the impact coming from what seems to be a general increase in inflation. And maybe that is going to create a more favorable situation, but bear with us, it's still a couple of months before we can have a clearer view on that one.
Vivien Azer : Understood. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thanks, Vivien.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris Growe : Thank you. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau : Hi Chris.
Chris Growe : I had a question. Hi, Emmanuel. Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up on the supply shortage. Sorry to keep going there, but I did hear some effect on the 2.4 device. I know it's limiting ILUMA's launch in some markets. Is this chip shortage true for all your products, those 3.0 and duo. Just to be sure, are those also affected by the chip shortage?
Emmanuel Babeau : Well, Chris, that would mean that we will need to enter into great detail of how we are prioritizing our portfolio, and I don't think I want to do that because, of course, that's quite strategic for us. What is very clear is that we have one, North Star, if you want, which is to first protect our existing IQOS user and to make sure that we make device available when they want to renew the device. And second, of course, we want to optimize any commercial action to make sure that we have the highest return on a new device that we are selling and that we avoid as much as possible selling device with a very low percentage of utilization afterwards by the consumer.  And certainly for us, moving and taking the benefit of that to step up the blade technology and move IQOS 3 as a priority instead of IQOS 2.4+ was one of the moves that we have decided to make. And that explain why we have some more limitation on top of the fact that due to component issue there was also more pressure on 2.4, but obviously in these kind of moment s where a lot of things are on the table, you are managing constraint and long-term strategic vision as well. That's what we're doing.
Chris Growe : Thank you for that color there. And just a separate question in relation to some of your beyond nicotine and tobacco acquisitions, Otitopic and Vectura, in particular respiratory drug companies. I just had a simple kind of high-level question. Do you need more pieces to fit that vision you have for respiratory drugs? And just to understand kind of what stage we're at in terms of your acquisitions, to understand if you need to do more here in the short-term, if this is a good base to which you can build this element of your beyond nicotine sales.
Emmanuel Babeau : So globally, we think that we have put on beyond nicotine great platforms if you want, and notably in term of R&D. And I think there is a lot we're going to be able to do already with this acquisition. Now, does it mean that in the future, we could think of other [Indiscernible] acquisition that would bring additional capacity that we don't have here maybe, but I think for the time being, we're going to focus on making sure that we integrate this acquisition and we maximize the synergy. In the interview as I said, in terms of R&D, which were really two big objectives to combine strengths on R&D. And we optimize by putting -- know our all skills, talent together, we optimize what we can do already in therapeutic, but I could make the comment as well for 13 and self - care wellness.
Chris Growe : And just to be clear, these acquisitions should not take you away from your separate goal of repurchasing you shares? That's kind of the main thing I was looking at just to understand future capital commitments through your [Indiscernible].
Emmanuel Babeau : Nothing. No, absolutely. Nothing has changed on our buyback program. Absolutely.
Chris Growe : That's great. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Callum Elliott: Thanks for the question. I was just [Indiscernible] Emmanuel, could you talk please about the tax situation for IQOS in Germany, recognizing that the political landscape is still shrouded in some uncertainty. It does seem like the proposed tax changes would be a material headwind to price mix and profitability next year, so just hoping that you could frame the magnitude of this impact. And then maybe sort of slightly bigger picture, do you see an increased risk of contagion for this kind of big IQOS tax increase in other markets?
Emmanuel Babeau : Well, on Germany what I can certainly you repeat is the fact that it's a mixed feelings about the German decision because on one side, we are very happy with such a prominent country as Germany, putting in allows the fact that this project are better and should be treated differently than cigarette, and I think it's really great that this tobacco harm reduction principle is recognized. At the same time, 20% differentials seem too low. Yes of course it will have impact as we are progressively impacted by it.  And it's too early for me to give an idea of what's going to be the impact next year. But there will be some impact of course, [Indiscernible] it's not going to derail our fundamentally the trajectory on IQOS and profit growth. But we believe that 20% is not enough. So we are hopeful that at a certain point in time and it's too early to say, of course, the new coalition is yet form, even if things are getting clarified.  But we know whether there is the possibility that starting from these 20% differential. There is a plan to grow it over time, and that could be a possibility. Now, in term of contagion, we don't see that today. We see, on the contrary, when we look at the latest country, they are now coming to a differentiated treatment when it comes to each of them versus CC, we see normally most of the cases significantly higher even, differential versus Germany. So more than 20%. If I take just one example, that's the case in Egypt for instance. So in the recent decision taken by authorities, they are clearly making a bigger difference, which I think to a large extent is much more in line with the reduction in exposure to toxicans. You have a 90 to 95% if you wanted to have a rule to determine what could be the difference. Well, maybe that should be the guideline. And I think we are happy to see a number of country, regulatory government moving to the differentiated treatment between CC and [Indiscernible] and taking a big difference on tax treatment.
Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the program back over to Nick Rolli for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli : Actually, I think Emmanuel has a few brief remarks.
Emmanuel Babeau : Yes. Thank you, Nick. Just give me a moment to wrap up with some brief closing comments. First of all, 2021 is on track to be a great year for the growth of IQOS and the financial performance of our business. We see continuation of strong underlying fundamentals, demand, and momentum for the IQOS brand. And last, but certainly not least, despite near-term challenges with device supply, we remain on track for our 3-year growth targets supported by a rich innovation pipeline. So thank you very much for your time today and we look forward to talking to you soon.
Nicholas Rolli : Thank you very much, Emmanuel. That concludes the call. If you have any follow-up questions, you may contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again. Have a nice day.
Emmanuel Babeau : Thank you. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.
Operator: This does conclude the Philip Morris International Q3, 2021 earnings call. You may disconnect at any time.

Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a very strong performance in the second quarter of 2021, coming slightly ahead of our expectations to match Q1's record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic.  Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenues compared to 24% in the prior-year quarter. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% and plus 12% compared to the same quarter last year and the previous quarter sequentially to reach 24.4 billion units with strong growth across key geographies.  We also continued converting adult smokers at a good pace surpassing an estimated 20 million users, of which almost 15 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Combustible net revenues grew by plus 4% in Q2 on an organic basis, reflecting a partial volume rebound against a weak prior year quarter and solid pricing partly offset by market mix.  Our adjusted operating income margin expanded significantly in both the second quarter and first half overall, and while we expect commercial investments to step up in the second-half, this puts us firmly on track for a strong 2021 performance organically with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in dollar terms.  Importantly, this outlook also allowed us last month to confirm our share buyback program, where we target $5 billion to $7 billion over 3 years. We are also delighted to announce that IQOS ILUMA, the next-generation of IQOS, will be launched in Japan next month.  As we covered at Investor Day in February, this represents a major step in category innovation as we seek to accelerate our journey toward a smoke-free future. With regard to long-term growth, we also took important steps to build our modern oral and beyond nicotine business in recent weeks through the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura, which I'll come back to later.  Turning to the headline numbers, our Q2 adjusted net revenue grew by plus 11.6% on an organic basis, or around plus 18% in dollar terms. This reflects both the recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the heavily disrupted second quarter of 2020, including the need for higher inventory levels and the continued strength of IQOS with plus 35% organic growth in RRP net revenue.  For combustible, while certain geographies and channels remain significantly affected by the pandemic, notably in South and Southeast Asia, South America, and global duty-free, re-openings in much of the world have led to partial recovery in social occasion and a sequential recovery in our market share.  We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.1% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 270 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, higher combustible volume, the positive impact of pricing, productivity savings including lower device costs and lower commercial spend due to the pandemic.  Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 17.8% organic growth and plus 21.7% in dollar terms, a very strong performance. Looking at the first half overall, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost plus 12% in dollar terms, and by plus 7.1% organically.  This was achieved despite the tougher Q1 comparison and reflects the Q2 factors I just mentioned, and the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive, notably including the doubling of users in the EU region since the end of 2019.  We delivered strong organic growth of nearly plus 6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin increased by 440 basis points on an organic basis. While we plan to increase commercial investments in the second half, as we noted at Q1, this remains an excellent performance.  Our H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 19.6% organically and plus 25.6% in dollar terms, also a very strong result. This brings me to guidance for 2021. We now expect an even stronger organic performance for the year than previously supported by improved total industry volume for combustible following the easing of pandemic restrictions.  For net revenue, we are revising our organic growth forecast to between plus 6% and plus 7%, representing the upper end of the previous range. We continue to expect organic adjusted OI margin expansion of around plus 200 basis points, and we are raising our organic adjusted diluted EPS growth range to plus 12% to plus 14%, or plus 15% to plus 17% in dollar terms.  We also continue to expect HTU shipment volumes of between 95 billion and 100 billion units. Given the strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the roll out of IQOS ILUMA, which uses different consumables, we expect our full-year HTU shipment to be slightly ahead of IMS volumes.  This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately $0.18 at prevailing rates, translates into an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.97 to $6.07. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchase or acquisitions.  We recently received Board authorization for the launch of our three-year share repurchase program where we target $5 billion to $7 billion starting in the period following our Q2 earnings release. Please note this program is not affected by the proposed acquisitions of Fertin Pharma or Vectura.  Turning now to some of the key H2 assumptions underpinning the guidance. We assume that many of our key markets will have largely emerged from COVID restrictions, supporting better industry volume.  Where significant pandemic-related challenges remain, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, and certain markets in South America, we assume no significant further deterioration from the present situation. We continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year with Intercontinental and Asian travel still subdued.  A rebound in travel within custom areas such as the European Union has limited effect. In addition, following combustible pricing of around plus 3% in the first half, we anticipate a somewhat softer second half progression. We continue to expect the full-year volumes to be plus 2% to plus 3%.  This reflects continued pandemic-related challenges in certain market, notably in South and Southeast Asia. H2 also faces tough pricing comparison from the 2020 VAT reduction in Germany and new excise tax terms in Australia. The global semiconductor shortage continues to put constraints on device supply.  And while the overall impact remains manageable, we have adjusted our device assortment to limit the effect on consumer availability. This dynamic is included in our guidance, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.  Despite these factors, we have multiple growth drivers in our business, and we are confident in our ability to deliver continued robust, top-line progress. This revenue assumption includes higher expected device shipments and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which will contribute to less gross margin expansion compared to the first half.  As mentioned previously, we will also step up our commercial investment in key areas, including portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development projects. We anticipate around $300 million to $400 million of incremental spending, compared to the first half, which will impact our H2 OI margin, but overall, still expect to deliver a very robust expansion of around plus 200 basis points for the year. For Q3, specifically, we expect EPS of $1.50 to $1.55. Lastly, we continue to expect around $11 billion in 2021 operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirement.  Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight some of the positive regulatory development in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction.  Example in recent weeks includes the passing of a broad, differentiated regulatory framework for RRP by the Philippines House of Representative, and the institution of differentiated excise treatment for heated tobacco product in Pakistan. In Mexico, the ban on the import and export of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System no longer applies to heated tobacco devices, which will allow us to resume imports of IQOS devices.  While we are encouraged that the German government has recognized the important principle of differentiation between combustible cigarette and smoke-free product on the basis of potential health impact, we view the announced excise tax changes on heated tobacco as misguided, providing less incentive for consumer to switch away from cigarette to less harmful alternatives.  We also note the differing views among the key political groups in the country ahead of the fall election, and we are hopeful a new government could revisit the decision. In the EU marginarily, we remain optimistic, that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater hamornization in the scriptural approach to non-combustible product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states.  Turning back now to our quarterly results. Q2 total shipment volume increased by plus 6.1% and by plus 1.1% for H1. This reflects continued strong growth from HTU s of plus 30% to reach 24.4 billion unit in Q2, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1.4 billion units ahead of IMS volume for the second quarter, reflecting the need to maintain inventory duration in the growing business, sea freight lead times, and the first shipment of ILUMA consumable.  The plus 3.2% growth in our Q2 cigarette volume reflects the recovery of a number of key markets compared to a notably week prior-year quarter when pandemic-related disruption was at its peak. While our cigarette share improved sequentially, we continue to face some specific market share headwind in addition to market mix effect, which I'll come back to.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS Heated Tobacco Units comprised 13.3% of of our total shipment volume in it's run as compared to 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. We expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth.  Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenue in the quarter and in H1, compared to 23% in H1, 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.4 billion of RRP net revenues, reflecting longer replacement time and fewer second device purchase for existing user due to improving battery life, functionality and reliability, and lower device prices in certain markets as we prepare for IQOS ILUMA.  The plus 7.1% organic growth in Net1 net revenue on shipment volume growth of plus 1.1% reflect the twin engines driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned.  Second, the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at IO Net revenue per unit continues to deliver substantial growth, and as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates.  Let me now go into the driver of our first half margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by plus 340 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers, as explained in prior quarters, including the mixed effect on HTU and pricing across our portfolio. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruits, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $300 million of gross productivity saving delivered in H1.  This represent a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021, 2023. This was accompanied by strong SG&A efficiency with our adjusted H1 marketing administration and research cost, 90 basis points lower, as a %age of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis.  This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $120 million towards our 2021, 2023 target of $1 billion in growth SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestment.  Focusing now on combustible, we hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths. This give us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise, and ability to communicate with adult smoker where permitted.  It is therefore important to maintain our leadership through selective investment, as we also drive return through pricing and efficiency. Despite good results in markets like Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, our Q2 cigarette share remained below the prior year, with over half of the share loss due to market mix, reflecting our high exposure to market, like the Philippine and low presence in certain emerging markets with strong rebound, such as Bangladesh.  Importantly, our share improved sequentially compared to the first quarter and we expect this positive trajectory to continue through the second half. This reflects a partial recovery from the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro over-indexes, border closures, and travel.  However, the expected recovery is also supported by portfolio initiative, including in the value segment and the enduring strength of Marlboro. We continue to target stabilization in our cigarette category share over time, with HTU gains coming on top.  I will know turn briefly to the South and Southeast Asia region. As covered last quarter, after a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, volume headwinds have been moderating. However, the pandemic remains a major issue in the region, with renewed lockdowns in a number of areas. Daily consumption patterns are still below pre-pandemic levels, and the pricing environment remains challenging.  We continue to expect volume growth in Indonesia this year as the industry improves, with encouraging recent share gain within the Tier 1 segment where we participate. Our overall share in both Indonesia and the Philippines was sequentially broadly stable in Q2, with our portfolio initiative geared at further share recovery over the balance of the year. In RRPs, IQOS continued to grow strongly in Metro Manila with an exit share of over 1% for HEETS.  For the region overall, we remain on track to deliver positive organic net revenue growth over the April to December period as outlined on our Q1 call. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.1 million IQOS users as of June 30th.  After the exceptional addition of around plus 1.5 million adult user in the first quarter, we added a further plus 1 million in Q2 and plus 2.5 million year-to-date, building on the step-ups in the second half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off.  We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device session. We seek to achieve even higher conversion rate overtime with the introduction of innovation such as IQOS ILUMA.  This user growth, again, reflect widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new products and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering.  In the EU region, second quarter share for EHTS reached 5.5% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.6 points higher than Q2 last year. As mentioned, last quarter we expected sequential share for HTU to be broadly in line with the first quarter due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market.  Underlying trends remained strong, with Q2 HTU IMS volume growing plus 50% year-over-year, and around plus 11% sequentially when adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements. We expect to see similar dynamic in the third quarter, with broadly stable headline share versus robust underlying growth.  This excellent performance includes strong growth across the region, with Italy and Poland as notable contributors. We continued to grow our EU region IQOS user base, doubling since the start of 2020 despite the pandemic, to reach over 6.3 million.  Strong performance continued in Russia with 8% sequential user growth in Q2, and our HTU share by 1.3 points to reach 7.3%. As in the EU, sequential share can be distorted by the combustible market. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movement, this reflects close to plus 30% year-over-year IMS growth. After the excellent progress and geographic expansion of IQOS in recent year, the heated tobacco category in Russia is now large and growing. This very positive dynamic naturally attract competition, and as seen before in markets like Japan, heavily discounted competitive offering can generate initial consumer trial. We continue to grow our user base, and with both our existing price tier portfolio and the future launch of IQOS ILUMA, we see ample room for further strong growth.  While we have historically focused on Russia in our earning calls, there is Negative Noise broad HTU growth across the Eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Southeast Europe significantly contributing. We show here the excellent overall original growth trend in adjusted IMS.  Note that following recent international assumption, IQOS is no longer available for sale in Belarus where we achieved a Q2 uptake share in means of almost 7%. We continue to see sequential volume growth for both our HEET and Fiit lineup in Russia and Ukraine. Moreover, this solid and fit consumable continued to supplement user acquisition.  In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS, benefiting from our IQOS conversion infrastructure.  With this success, we also introduced LIL SOLID in 5 further market in Eastern Europe this quarter, with additional markets plan later this year. Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.3 points, that was the prior year quarter, and by 0.2 point sequentially to 21%, highlighting the strength of our pricier portfolio and broad range of [Indiscernible] following the October 2020 price increase. IMS volume adjusted for estimate trade inventory movements grew by around plus 5% sequentially, after accounting for fewer selling days in the first quarter. We continue to expect robust underlying progress in user growth and consumer uptake supported by the launch of IQOS ILUMA in August.  As in prior years, with an additional excise increase in October 2021, there may be volatility on the timing of IMS and consumer uptake between the third and fourth quarters. In H1, the overall heated tobacco category made-up around 29% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market, with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the large majority of the categories' growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing market, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an ever increasing amount of adult smoker, as we aim to be in android market by 2025.  Our second quarter launches in Kyrgyzstan and with Uzbekistan with both IQOS and LIL offerings, take the total number of market where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 67, of which over half are outside the OECD. Core driver of our continued success in smoke-free product is innovation.  We are very excited to launch IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, next month in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for legal age smoker using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. As outlined at Investor Day, ILUMA will come in multiple device formats, and have its own range of HTU consumables.  The ongoing success of IQOS review, almost 2 years after launch, demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on gross. We plan for further market launches of IQOS ILUMA through the remainder of this year and in 2022.  Naturally, for a major new innovation and as seen with earlier version of IQOS, the unit cost profile of IQOS ILUMA devices and consumable begin at a higher level. but we expect this to improve over time as scale increases. This dynamic is included in our guidance assumptions.  We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with a good progress in the first group of market, where we started in our own channel with an initially limited range of test variant and nicotine level. IQOS VEEV is a premium product providing a superior experience.  And as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product.  We plan to launch in further market later this year, and we'll continue to test edge verification technology in select markets. In addition to heated tobacco and eVapor, we announced in February our intention to enter the small but fast growing nicotine pouch category this year.  To complement our internal development, we have two important acquisition to establish a base of capability in science, technology, and manufacturing, and build our platform in Modern Oral. The first of these was AG Snus completed during the second quarter.  AG Snus has a relatively small branded portfolio of Modern Oral product, which provide us a foothold in the category. In addition, the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma will give us access to a range of promising oral delivery technology and capability, some of which could be applied to the modern oral Nicotine space.  We will return with further news on our commercial plans in this area later this year. I also want to come back to our Beyond Nicotine strategy, which we first outlined at Investor Day. We see significant opportunities in adjacent areas with our two-focus corridors of self-care wellness, including botanical, and inner Therapeutic, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura can enable us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities in innovative, in health, and oral product formulation while continuing to grow their respective CDMO activities. Fertin has a range of promising oral delivery technology, including pouches, gum, and lozenges, which can be applied in both the Modern Oral Nicotine and Beyond Nicotine areas, notably for self-care wellness product.  With Vectura, we would gain access to differentiated proprietary technology and pharmaceutical development expertise to deliver a broad range of complex inhaled therapies. Vectura has highly complementary human capital, technology, high quality infrastructure, and deep know-how of inhalable formulation and device design development and analysis, drug device combination, and pharmaceutical management processes and system.  These proposed acquisitions would fully leverage PMI 's existing capability in life science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to inhalation. Such acquisitions can also enhance our progress on important sustainability priorities. Firstly, building our capabilities in Mordern Oral is a key enabler of broadening the reach and access of our smoke-free alternative to other smoker around the world.  And secondly, building a strong Beyond Nicotine business is a major objective as we strive to develop commercially successful product with a net positive impact on society. On ESG and sustainability, more broadly, we are firm believers in the power of investor engagement to drive positive change.  Given PMI 's unique sustainability and transformation story, we have increased our own outreach. We published our second integrated report in May, which provides the comprehensive detail and transparent disclosure of how we create sustainable value and how we are progressing toward our purpose and target, including our most important commitment of all; to phase out cigarettes.  We also had a dedicated sustainability webcast on June the 2nd, where we covered the fundamental alignment of our transformation and financial performance with addressing our impact on society.  We shared the latest studies using real-world data on a possible association between accelerated cigarette volume decline and certain disease reduction in Japan. We also reaffirm our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as an essential enabler of future success.  We continue to make progress on our 2025 roadmap with notable development in Q2 being our second certified carbon-neutral factory in Switzerland, taking us one step closer to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, and the publication of our eco design principal, as we seek to play our part in the secular economy. In closing, after delivering 1% total volume growth and 7% organic revenue growth in H1, we have raised our 2021 organic growth expectation to plus 6% to plus 7% in net revenue, and plus 12% to plus 14% in adjusted diluted EPS.  We are on track for an excellent performance. Moreover, we continue to invest in the future. Most immediately, this means the launch of IQOS ILUMA in Japan next month and in more markets later this year. We are also investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product, Portfolio, and geographic reach.  This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative, with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our two recent propose acquisition, which provide a comprehensive development platform across our Beyond Nicotine focused areas.  Finally, we are also committed to returning cash to shareholder through dividend and share repurchase in line with our [Indiscernible] to deliver sustainable value and return to investor as we continue to, as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free business. Thank you very much. I am no more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator instructions]. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep it to a maximum of two questions each. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chris Growe: Hi. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Hi, and nice quarter there. I do want to ask you two questions if I could, please. I want to start first with, you have IQOS ILUMA launching soon in Japan, and I assume you'll go into more markets. I think in this quarter you had shipments above consumption.  Would you expect that still to be the case? I know you've mentioned building inventories. Would that still likely happen in the second half of the year or we've already built inventories sufficiently to handle that launch?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Chris. No, I think there was an element of preparation for the launch in this Q2. For the rest of the year, at that stage, we expect IMS and shipment to be more aligned, so we don't expect to have further material differences at that stage emerging in H2.
Chris Growe: Okay. And just a question on the combustible business, and I know you gave some good detail on that. I guess my question would be that you did have a softer market share overall in combustibles. I think you mentioned you expect your share to stabilize there over time. I just want to get a sense if you thought that you could stabilize your combustible market share this year?  And I think related to that, just to maybe give a little more color around the pricing environment and how competitive it is right now in combustibles, I think there may be factor that's contributed to less pricing for your business in that area.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Chris. On this objective to stabilize our market share in the CC segment or CC category, that's a clear objective that we have. Of course, it's a year-on-year stabilization that we want to reach. We are stabilizing sequentially quarter-on-quarter, and it's good to see that the Q2 market share is showing this kind of improvement versus Q1.  We are not there yet in terms of stabilization year-on-year. That's an objective that we have gradually for the coming quarters. We'll see when we are able to reach it, but that's clearly something that we want to pursue. On the pricing environment, as you have seen we started nicely the year.  Q2 was still quite good. I would cite in Indonesia, we are reporting a price impact of about 5%, so clearly positive. H2 is more difficult as we've been flagging it in terms of basis of comparison. There was a VAT decrease in Germany. There is a different pattern in excise duty increase in Australia, so that is going to play.  And we are also going to monitor what is the situation as hopefully we are exiting the COVID crisis, which exactly what is the timing and how is the exit, but we know that many economies would still stay quite impacted by that. So, we’ll be of course monitoring the capacity of our customers to follow price increases and that will be certainly driving our decision when it comes to price increases.  So, I would say we're going to monitor the situation. We're going to see what is happening. There would be certainly a question on evolution of inflation here and there as well that we're going to take into account. So, a lot of unknown at this stage, but we'll take that into account to monitor and decide on price increase. Nevertheless, we have been flagging the fact that after a 3% increase in H1, we do confirm the overall bracket of 2% to 3% for the full year, which means that we expect notably and partially because of tougher comps in H2, an H2 that could be less favorable in terms of price increase than H1.
Chris Growe: Thank you for all the perspectives.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler. Co.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Michael.
Michael Lavery: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on Indonesia. One, it follows on some of the pricing discussions, I guess. You called it out, obviously, as an offset to some of the favorable pricing. Can you just help us understand a little bit better the dynamics there and what to expect looking ahead?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. So remember Indonesia was a very tough market last year, really hit hard by the pandemic. It doesn't mean, unfortunately, that the country has exited the crisis. And until recently, there has been new announcements of lockdown and restrictions. It's probably the impact was so strong last year that we're comparing to probably favorable basis of comparison, but the situation is certainly not back to normal there.  Nevertheless, what we are seeing is certainly an improvement of the situation, again, based on probably favorable comparison. We are doing well ourselves when it comes to the premium market, what we call the Tier 1 with more excise duty, and we are gaining share there, and that explains that we are able to grow our volume this year.  But we are also, unfortunately, at the same time seeing the Tier 2 category, the one enjoying lower taxes, that is still gaining ground and probably getting close to 30% market share. It used to be, at the end of last year, around 25%, 26%. So, that is playing the other way around, and hopefully this is going to be corrected with evolution [ph] on the excise duty policy put in place by the government.  But, of course, we don't have any news on that and we don't know if and when it's going to happen. That is a situation that we are facing. And in Indonesia, there is clearly improvement versus last year. It doesn't mean that the environment, when it comes to possibility of price increase, is becoming favorable, but at least it's no longer the kind of very negatively oriented market that it used to be for us last year.
Michael Lavery: And just to confirm then on your pricing, are you saying that you're not getting any increases or have you actually lowered prices?
Emmanuel Babeau: We are impacted by the increase in duty, so we are increasing price, but it's still having a negative impact, and that's why there is a difference between what we are reporting in terms of price impact with Indonesia and without Indonesia. So, overall it's still having a bit of a negative impact.
Michael Lavery: I got it. So, your increases aren't fully offsetting the duty increase?
Emmanuel Babeau:  That's correct.
Michael Lavery: And then just on IQOS in Indonesia, I know you haven't called out a launch there, and the Internet can be a funny creature [ph]. But we find about a dozen stores in Jakarta that all look quite proper and have really official sounding language. Are those resellers of products they are getting somewhere else or do you have a sort of a quiet launch there? Can you just give us a status of how IQOS sits in Indonesia today?
Emmanuel Babeau: So, there is no official launch of an IQOS club where we may gather some user. As you know, Indonesia is first and foremost a kretek market. And while we certainly have the objective to develop a specific heat-not-burn device for kretek, we haven't been launching it yet.  So, we do that, of course, addressing only part of the population, the one with the purchasing power that can afford the current devices, and also a small group of people that are non-kretek, if you want, smoker but that's a very small fraction of the consumer. So, that could be the element that you are referring to, but there is no offficial global launch, if you want, at that stage.
Michael Lavery: Okay. Thanks very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Gaurav.
Gaurav Jain: Hi. A couple of questions from me. One is on the guidance that you had at Investor Day, you know greater than 9% EPS growth over 2021 to 2023, and you are clearly coming quite ahead of that this year at almost 13%. So how should we interpret it is what I'm trying to understand that there is a slowdown in the next 2 years because you have these tax gap closures in Germany which will impact the high cost realization in that market next year and potentially in some other European markets or could be that [multiple speakers] independent --?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you for the question, Gaurav. I think you're going too far. We've been sharing this three-year guidance and objective at the time of the Investor Day, more than 9%. We are off to a strong start because we are targeting indeed for the first year 12% to 14%, it's clearly above the 9%, so I think we're compliant for the time being with the overall beyond 9%, and that means that we are certainly on good track to deliver the more than 9%, but I don't see a contradiction between the more than 9% and what you said the new good news, which is the strong start in 2021.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And there is more of these tax gap closures in Europe, how would that impact your potential to achieve this EPS growth guidance?
Emmanuel Babea: I mean, of course, you can make whatever scenario, and it's difficult to react to the most extreme scenario. But I think we are taking into account and we have always said that, that there could be some reduction, gradual reduction, to the gap between CC, and even on other product when it comes to excise duties. That is absolutely factored in our guidance. We have the capacity to increase price. We've been repeating the fact that IQOS and the consumable that are coming with IQOS is a premium product, that is already a superior expense for the customer. And that is commanding a premium in terms of price positioning as well. Today, thanks to the lower excise duty, very often you're going to have consumable at a cheaper price than the premium combustible product like Marlboro. That is something that, of course, could be changed and we could increase price. And at the same time, we continue to see more and more governments and regulators saying that there should be a difference between combustible and heat-not-burn because heat-not-burns are better product, and that should be used, certain ly, as an incentive to a smoker switching to heat-not-burn category and to move to better product for them. We certainly believe that there will be some decrease in some country, but it's not going to be necessarily the case everywhere. We could also envisage increase in the gap. We haven't seen that recently in the EU, but we've been seeing that being installed in other country. And on the long term, we continue to believe that there will be still some nice difference between the two that is fully justified by the fact that these are better products. [Indiscernible] to say that we are ready to cover for certainly possible reduction in the gap. We think that some of that is going to happen anyway for sure, Germany being one example. And at the same time, we believe that there will be growing, I would say, consensus on the fact that there should be a clear differentiation between combustible and heat-not-burn product.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. If I can ask a quick one on Japan. We have this [Indiscernible] right gap closure, the?task? gap closures in October, and that will throw up a lot of volumes up in the market which will be moving, and you're launching IQOS ILUMA. There is a potential to launch a lower priced IQOS variant, maybe reposition IQOS 3 DUO at a lower price point to capture these volumes from the cigarette low category which will probably move.
Emmanuel Babeau: Certainly, Gaurav, with IQOS ILUMA, we are going to enrich the premium category for [Indiscernible] product. And as we keep saying, that's going to be a real, I would say, major change for customers, and it's going to represent for them clearly a big, big progress, killing the remaining pinpoints. And therefore, of course we focus on that for the time being. We believe the potential is huge as we've been highlighting. Now, depending on how the market is evolving, certainly we'll see what is the interest of launching new devices with a different positioning. The ultimate goal, as we also said in several instances, is certainly, in any case, to have a full coverage of the spectrum of the market, from the most premium positioning to certainly more value for money designed to cost simple product that are of course delivering an experience that is not at the level of the prime experience, but that is value for money and good enough experience for other type, I would say, of customers So Japan will make no exception in our willingness to cover once again, the full market from premium to medium and even low price positioning.
Gaurav Jain: Thanks a lot.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog, from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel.
A - Emmanuel Babeau::
Bonnie Herzog: I wanted -- Hi, I wanted to circle back just on guidance. I just have a couple of questions. I -- thinking about this, Ukraine your EPS guidance for the full year, as you expect, industry volumes are improving, but it still does?imply? a decent step-down of growth in the second half despite lapping a relatively easier comp. Now, you did call out a few things, you called out incremental cost associated with the rollout of ILUMA and maybe some gross margin pressures as you expect to sell more devices in the second half. So I just want to make sure I understand all of the puts and takes, or any incremental pressures you're Operating in the second half, half. And then I just wanted to also clarify as it relates to I buybacks. You did mention your guidance doesn't include a material impact from any share buybacks, but just wanted to verify. Does this mean you're not going to be buying back as aggressively, in the second half of this year you're just just including buybacks at all:ot including buybacks at all in the guidance? I just wanted to make sure I understood that.
Emmanuel Babea: Sure, Bonnie. Very clear. Maybe starting with the buyback to make it clear. No, no, we're not making any kind of guidance on what's going to be the buyback or assumption. As we said, we want to be really, super flexible. And frankly, all scenario for the magnitude of the buyback in H2 can be envisaged. But precisely because we want to keep flexibility, we don't want to put any kind of assumption on the amount of buyback for H2. That's really the way you should understand it. Now on the H2 margin versus H1, because I guess that's really your question. I think you started to summarize well the reason for the different margin evolution profile, but I'm happy to go through all the element. Certainly, what's going to be common between H1 and H2 is strong dynamism in top line with continued favorable evolution, of course, on our IQOS business. We are still facing on the CC business, also, some relatively easy comp last year, so that should have an impact on theour on of our CC business. We continue to have the nice mix impact driven by the IQOS growth on our revenue first week, so that is going to stay. And of course, that's the reason why we are raising the guidance on the revenue organic growth to 6 to 7. It's our confidence on the continuation of strong dynamism on revenue growth in H2. Then on other element that could be different, there is, as I said it answering a previous question on price, we see H2 possibly being more challenging than the 3% price increase on the CC business that we delivered in H1, so that's clearly one element. Another one is the level of productivity. You have seen the number 300 million. In H1, we target 1 billion over a 3-year period. Obviously, the 300 million is not necessarily a sustainable amount if you want for a 6 months period. So there was some front-loaded element in productivity this year. It doesn't mean that we don't intend to generate a nice productivity in H2, but not necessarily at the same level as the 300 million in H1. That's going to be another element. Then there are all the impact of the launch of ILUMA. And I see indeed on the margin to impact, One is the fact that when you launch a new product, it's true for any business, any industry. Your cost are not optimized. You don't have yet the volume to fully amortize all the investment. You haven't been optimizing all your processes. So there will be an impact on the gross margin coming from increased cost as we launch ILUMA. This is going to, of course, disappear overtime. I'm not able to tell you exactly how long it's going to take, but let's say 18 to 24 months is the typical, I would say, horizon to get to full productivity when you have some innovation. This is going to have an impact on H2. Then, we said it as well, the fact that we're going to sell more device, an ILUMA device, that is going to boost revenue, but it's not going to have the same impact as consumable on the gross margin, and, of course, with an impact on the gross margin rate. And last element that I have certainly top of mind, these 300 million to 400 million increase investments in H2 versus H1. me iAnd these investments are going to be obviously where it's going to make an impact for the Company. So it's about innovation, it's about commercial and marketing capacity, it's about digitizing further our business and the Company. That's where we're going to put that money. So you need to take all these elements into account to understand the different profile of margin evolution between H1 and H2. But having said that, obviously, we are still targeting a very nice growth of our revenue OI and adjusted EPS in H2 obviously.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that was really helpful and I appreciate all that. Obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes, but broadly, given the raised guidance, you've feel pretty darn good about the momentum and just the improvements in industry volumes. That's encouraging. If I may, I wanted to ask a second question just on the competitive environment, especially as I think about what Japan Tobacco is doing by launching their new Ploom X. And it sounds like they plan to launch it at a pretty steep discount to drive trial. Now, this coincides with the launch of ILUMA in Japan. I just wanted to understand your strategy in terms of positioning ILUMA especially as it relates to price. Maybe overall, how concerned are you with stepped-up competition and how confident are you that you're going to be able to maintain share and ultimately continue to take share? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Bonnie, Certainly, that's of course a very good question. I happy to elaborate on it. First and foremost, and that's probably the most important in my answer, we are really happy to see competition really taking now the bih tategueyas a big priority. And showing, I think increase commitment engagement beyond the category. We think that the shared vision on the fact that we need jointly to phase out cigarette and develop better product for smokers is a way, certainly, to accelerate the journey to end smoke the world. To see competition realizing that this is a great category, this is answering smokers need and expectation, putting more innovation, more investment there in the category, that's just great. And I think we can start seeing in some geography where competition increase investment, we can see the overall growth of the market accelerating. And of course, as we take a lion's share of that, that is very good news. Having said that, obviously, what is important for the smoker is the capacity to find with it heat-not-burn tech nology and proposal. Something that is mimicking, to the closest way possible, the experience versus combustible cigarette. And that's where our technology, our capacity to innovate, is making a big difference. And that's where probably some of the competition is struggling a little bit, and that is the reason why some of them believe that they have to discount their product to get some traction. So what does it generate? At the end of the day, it generates the fact that you may have a trial because the device is coming almost for free, the consumable is cheaper. But then if it's not satisfactory, if it doesn't provide the same pleasure, the same benefit as what you have with an IQOS experience and we love further more with IQOS ILUMA, then whether you switch back to IQOS, or you may just be back to combustible cigarette because as you're feeling that that's not satisfactory versus what you really enjoy. And therefore, it's not whether playing the role of converting smokers to heat-not-burn, and you create lot -- lower average consumption device and lower loyalty. So we continued to be a firm believer that at the end of the day, just the right technology, the right experience will convert the majority of the smokers to switch to better product and to heat-not-burn category. And we believe that this is exactly what we are offering with IQOS. And that make us confident on our capacity to retain big market share. It doesn't mean that we're not going to propose also, simpler device, always with our capacity to innovate. Targeting, as I said, different purchasing power, different expectation. But certainly we will continue to lead the way when it comes to a premium product delivering a superior experience.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright, very helpful again, thank you so much for all of that.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Pamela Kaufman, from Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Pamela.
Pamela Kaufman: I was hoping that you could elaborate on your plans for increased investment in the second half in terms of what initiatives you will be spending behind, how much will be for ILUMA versus VEEV or the other reduced risk offerings. And then in terms of the level of spending, the $300 million to $400 million, is that primarily related to the launch in Japan? And should we think about annualizing this level of incremental investment for next year as you expand into additional markets?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pamela. I have to say, I fully understand your curiosity and that you want to know more about this extract in order to form an opinion. But I'm afraid I will have to disappoint you because, as you can imagine, that is super sensitive and we don't want to disclose the detail of that. Nevertheless, I'm certainly happy to say that we are putting investment in places that are going to move top-line, i.e. growing more volume, more conversion on a smoker switching to IQOS. Certainly, part of the amount is going to be behind the launch of IQOS ILUMA. But not only, there are also commercial activity. As we see, a number of markets returning to a certain normalcy. I will not say we are fully there, but certainly more reason to reaccelerate a number of marketing and commercial activity. And that's going to be important. We are also accelerating in term of innovation, and we are putting more money in life science and to build more presence in RRP category notably, so that's part of the accelaration. And we also signal it's going to be much more marginal, but that we may have to very selectively reinvest here and there on CC where it's possible. I would say it's going to be a small fraction of the extra investment, butt we have this objective of stabilizing our market share. So I think with that, Pamela, you have really what is behind the 300 million to 400 million. No, you don't need to necessarily annualize that, but let's be clear we're going to launch ILUMA in many more country next year in 2022. And And I'm not able to elaborate at that stage on what's going to be the plan in term of investment, but I would expect that, yeah, we'd certainly want to invest with a great return on this new offering and new technology. S that would have some impact on our investment next year. Remember, nevertheless, we have a very ambitious program to generate 1 billion efficiency on S G&A. We have ambition to be very dynamic on revenue. And therefore, our goal over a three-year period is to reduce nicely the SG&A on revenue ratio to create a driver for increased profitability. And of course, including all this investment that absolutely remained a big ambition that we have.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful. And my other question is, can you discuss the rationale behind the new management structure in the America s? I'm just curious how, if at all, it influences the Company's priorities in the region. Should we anticipate any changes to the way that IQOS ' U.S. rollout is conducted, or any changes in the Company's strategy towards the U.S. market, particularly given that Deepak Mishra 's background is in strategy and M&A?.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you for highlighting the great talent of Deepak and we're all very pleased to see him taking his new responsibility. I think it just highlights, certainly, the potential that we see globally for Americas but notably, of course, for the U.S. We want to keep working in close interaction with Altria on IQOS. We flagged the fact that we could have, certainly, for IQOS VEEV some ambition. You will allow me not to elaborate more on that, but that certainly mean that we see the U.S. as actually a country where reduced risk product have a great potential and we want to participate in that potential.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: You're welcome.
Operator: Our last question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen. Please, go ahead.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi. My first question is on VEEV. I was wondering if you could expand and offer any preliminary insights. I know that it's still early days, but for the consumers that are engaging with that product, are they skewing towards legacy IQOS consumers, are they newer IQOS consumers, new consumers to the platform in general? Any other insights would be very helpful. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Vivien. Indeed, we -- on VEEV, this is what I could call a soft launch for a number of reason. We want to learn the category. We are learning in many dimension including age verification, which we see as absolutely paramount. And the obvious initial move from us was to put VEEV as the nice complement for some of the already IQOS [Indiscernible] been user in the case of polyusage. And that was a natural move from people who were knowledgeable of IQOS already, the technology, the great experience the IQOS brand can provide. I think we are moving now to new dimension. We have beyond this initial move some great feedback coming from consumer that show that it's not only the elegance of the design, but the overall experience, the quality of the product that is comparing very well when we do test versus competitors. So time to certainly accelerate in our ambition that will come with more launches, of course, development of more flavors. So after this first step in the category, you should expect us to certainly increase ambition on vaping.
Vivien Azer: Perfect. Thank you. And my followup question is just on capital allocation. It's been a while since we've seen the Company be this acquisitive. In short order, do you feel comfortable that you've filled white space or knowledge gaps in your portfolio, or should we expect more bolt-on acquisitions going forward? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: My view would be, Vivien, that with the proposed acquisition of Fertin and Vectura, we would certainly really build a very strong platform on which for our 2 ambitions on inhale therapeutic and on self-care wellness, we would have indeed very strong platform, and notably from life science perspective. For the life science, that would be great. That's certainly the view that we have today on that topic.
Vivien Azer: Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Alright. Well, let me leave you with some key messages then. First, despite the slower recovery from pandemic in certain markets, we are happy to report a very robustful first half performance with a record high adjusted diluted EPS and raised 2021 guidance. Second, the impressive growth of IQOS continues. And we remain on track to deliver our target of 95 to 100 billion units for the year. Third, our Combustible Business is improving sequentially as the recovery from the pandemic infraction in many key markets. Lastly, we are building towards important milestone in our Beyond Nicotine strategic vision, as part of our business transformation. Thank you again for joining us and talk to you soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2021 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2021 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI IR app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for Reduced Risk Products or RRPs, as well as adjustments other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures, and additional heated tobacco unit market share data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted to the website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. All references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Please also note that growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a strong performance in the first quarter of 2021 well ahead of expectations, reaching a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57, despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and 28% of our net revenues compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. We continued converting adult smokers at a very good pace and reached an estimated total of 19.1 million users, of which 14 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% compared to the prior year quarter with record market shares in key IQOS geographies, 12 markets with double-digit national share and the share of 7.6% overall in IQOS markets excluding the U.S. Our operating margins were also significantly above the prior year quarter, and while somewhat flattered by timing factors, the bulk of this improvement reflect strong underlying performance. The resulting combination of strong organic net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth leads us to raise our outlook for the year. From a product standpoint, we continue to broaden our smoke-free portfolio and saw encouraging progress from new device and consumable offerings across multiple markets. We expect to benefit from further innovation through the course of 2021. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q1 net revenues grew by plus 2.9% on an organic basis. This was an excellent performance in the context of an essentially pre-COVID prior year comparison and incorporates better than expected HTU, IMS and shipment volumes, which drove plus 32% organic growth in RRP net revenue. We also saw some higher-than-expected pull forward of shipments, predominantly cigarettes in the EU region, ahead of the Easter period and in Russia ahead of the April 1 discount ban. We saw strong organic growth of plus 6.9% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Combustible tobacco pricing was plus 2.7% of prior year combustible net revenues, reflecting solid pricing in many markets, partially offset by Indonesia. Excluding Indonesia, combustible pricing was over plus 4%. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 580 basis points on an organic basis. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS; the positive impact of pricing; productivity savings, including lower device cost; lower commercial spend due to the pandemic; the favorable comparison in Eastern Europe and certain other timing factors. Combined with a lower effective tax rate, our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 21.5% organic growth, a very strong performance. We estimate the timing factors in the quarter, such as the earlier shipment mentioned and cost phasing had a positive impact of around plus $0.08. Although one-time factors accounted for an estimated further plus $0.02 increase. This brings me now to guidance for 2021. While the speed and shape of the global recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain, the strong business results and underlying momentum of the first quarter, notably from our IQOS business, lead us to raise our outlook. We continue to account for a range of outcomes in our outlook for organic growth in net revenue and EPS. This range, assume that even in the event of renewed or prolonged restriction, we will not see a return to the depressed consumption level of Q2 2020. While we have not been affected thus far by the current global shortage of semiconductor, the guidance assumes a limited impact on the supply of electronic devices to consumer. This is a fluid situation which we are monitoring closely and where any constraint may arise, we intend to manage our inventories accordingly and prioritize device sales to other smokers who are new to the category. Regarding duty-free, a rebound in global travel is likely to lag the improvement of in-country mobility. Our guidance continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year. We now expect organic net revenue growth in the range of plus 5% to plus 7% versus plus 4% to plus 7% communicated previously and organic adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11% to plus 13% or plus 15% to plus 17% in reported terms. The strength of IQOS is the main driver for this revision. We now expect to deliver HTU shipment volume of between 95 billion and 100 billion units, representing the upper half of our previously targeted range for 2021. Given the continued strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the rollout of IQOS ILUMA that uses different consumable, we expect our full-year shipment to be slightly ahead of our IMS volumes. We also raised our assumption for organic adjusted OI margin expansion to around plus 200 basis points. This includes the expectation of greater investment in the second-half as our innovation and commercial activities step up. As detailed in this morning's press release, our other main assumptions remain unchanged. This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately plus $0.20 at prevailing rates versus plus $0.25 assume previously, translate into a raised adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.95 to $6 or $5. This guidance does not include any impact of share repurchases. However, we remain on track to resume repurchases in the second-half of the year subject to Board approval. Looking forward to the second quarter, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting strong topline growth against a weak prior year comparison, continued margin improvement and a partial reversal of certain Q1 timing benefit. For the second-half, assuming that many of our key market will have largely emerged from COVID restriction, we expect continued robust top line growth. This include the contribution of higher expected device shipments, which will result in less gross margin expansion, compared to the first-half. New product launches, investments in distribution and the phasing of productivities will also play a role. We will also step up our commercial investment in the future growth of RRP through portfolio and geographic expansion, including product launches such as IQOS ILUMA. We anticipate around plus $300 million to plus $400 million of incremental commercial investment compared to the first-half and consequently expect our organic OI margin expansion to be lower in H2, but overall, to deliver a strong expansion of around plus 200 basis point for the year. Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight a few of the positive regulatory developments in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction. Example, so far this year includes the reversal of a long-standing import ban on heated tobacco product in Uruguay and the integration of the harm reduction principle in Lithuania's tobacco control agenda. We also note the recent report from an all-party parliamentary group of MPs in the UK, calling for the WHO to return to the founding principle of the FCTC, which includes harms reduction rather than the current prohibitionist stance. In New Zealand, we are reviewing the content and detail of the consultation paper published last week. The policy recognizes the role of innovative product in harm reduction, while at the same time, ensuring strict control to prevent youth access. In the EU, we continue to be hopeful that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater amortization in the effort to smoke-free product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states in this area. Here and around the world, we continue to support differentiated regulatory and fiscal framework based on the relative risk to health. While there will on occasion be actions or proposals that do not incorporate harm reduction objectives, we believe that facts and science will guide policy over time and we continue to see positive changes in many geographies. Well, turning back now to our results, Q1 shipment volumes declined by 3.7% on the total PMI business. This reflects continued strong growth from HTUs of plus 30% to reach 21.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine and an encouraging start from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipment and IMS volumes were broadly in line for the quarter. While pandemic-related restriction persisted around the world, total industry volume declines of 0.7% were relatively benign incorporating over plus 25% growth in the heated tobacco category where we continue to have a share of over 80%. Though less severe than in Q4 2020, our cigarette volume declines reflect specific share headwind in certain markets, which I'll come back to. We expect better combustible share and volume trends in both the second quarter and second-half of the year. The strong performance from IQOS led to heated tobacco units, comprising 13% of our total shipment volume in Q1 as compared to 9.6% in the prior year quarter, 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free products made up 28% of our total net revenue in the quarter compared to 21.7% in Q1 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of RRP net revenue, reflecting longer replacement time for existing users due to improving battery lives and reliability, and lower device price in certain markets as we are preparing for IQOS ILUMA. The plus 2.9% organic growth in Q1 net revenue on shipment volume decline of 3.7% reflect the twin engine driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned. Second, the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit continue to deliver substantial growth. And as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our first quarter margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 390 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers as shown in green on this slide, including the mix effect of HTU within IQOS impact, in particular, our significant efforts on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruit, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $150 million of gross productivity savings delivered in Q1. While somewhat front-loaded in the context of 2021, this represents a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021-2023. As part of these savings, our gross profit increase was boosted by better absorption of manufacturing costs given a high level of production in the quarter and lower device costs with combined impact of around plus $60 million. Gross margin expansion was also accompanied by strong SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted marketing administration and research costs 200 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $60 million towards our '21-'23 target of $1 billion in gross SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestments. The pandemic also impacted SG&A costs in the quarter through the later timing of certain projects and reduced commercial and overhead costs due to ongoing restrictions. These latter factors accounted for around $100 million of the organic improvement. Focusing now on combustible, we continue to hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths as covered at Investor Day. This gives us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise and ability to communicate with other smokers where permitted. It is therefore imperative to maintain our leadership through selective investment as we also drive returns through pricing and efficiency. Our cigarette share underperformance in Q1 can be attributed to the combination of several factors. This includes the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro overindexes; border closures and reduced travel; and instances of downtrading and competition in the mid and low-price segments in certain markets such as the Philippines and part of the EU region. This performance does not reflect our objective to maintain our share of cigarettes, net of cannibalization. We expect a strong sequential cigarette share recovery through the remainder of the year supported by portfolio initiatives and the enduring strength of Marlboro especially as pandemic restrictions ease. Accordingly, we target cigarette share to be about stable on the year-over-year basis for the next nine months, despite the impact of cannibalization. Share gains from HTUs will come on top of this. I will now turn to the South and Southeast Asia Region. After a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, headwinds are now moderating. In Indonesia, volume trends are improving with double-digit growth in hand-rolled kreteks, where we are the market leader supporting stable PMI share in the Tier 1 segment. Indeed, with industry volume recovering, we are targeting volume growth for our business here in 2021. Pricing remain the main headwind in Indonesia. New excise duty rates came into force on February 1, and while all major players have taken some pricing, progress nonetheless remains slow. Despite the negative consequences for government revenues, there has not yet been a significant move to level the playing field between the Tier 1 and below Tier 1 segment, which continues to grow. We remain hopeful that the government will address this issue over time. The Philippines has performed well in recent years. For this quarter, further industry pricing in H2 2020, a slow economic recovery and pandemic-linked restriction gave rise to a double-digit market decline. Our share loss reflects downtrading from the mid to low-price segment, with premium-priced Marlboro which make up over two-third of our volume growing share. Notwithstanding these challenges, we have plans to address the share decline and are targeting close to stable organic net revenue in 2021 despite the total market weakness. I'm also pleased to say that IQOS is off to an encouraging start in Metro Manila, with an exit share of almost 1% for HEETS after full launch in Q3 2020. Overall, this region delivered strong growth pre-COVID. While it may not be a meaningful growth driver in 2021, we expect far less of a drag on group result compared to 2020. We target regional organic net revenue to be at least stable over the next nine months. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 19.1 million IQOS users as of March 31. This represents the addition of around 1.5 million adult users since December building on the step-up in the second-half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off. We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device versions. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we seek to achieve even higher conversion rate over time with introduction of innovation, such as IQOS ILUMA. This user growth again reflects widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new product and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering. In the EU region, first quarter share for HEETS reached a record 5.7% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflects 46% year-over-year. IMS growth and around 10% sequential IMS growth accounting for fewer selling days in the period. I would also remind you of the sequential quarterly share dynamic, which can be distorted by the seasonality of the combustible market in addition to pandemic-related situations such as border closure and other social restrictions. With the region likely to reopen somewhat in Q2 and increase the total market, we expect further strong underlying HTU growth, but for share to be broadly in line with Q1. This excellent performance includes strong growth in Italy, surpassing 10% share, with the large majority of user acquisition coming organically as the increasing awareness and prominence of the product build its own momentum. Germany and Poland were also strong contributors. We added a further 700,000 EU region IQOS users in the quarter to reach 5.9 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. We continue to see phenomenal progress in key cities across the EU region, with a number of examples on this slide. HTU share in Rome is now approaching 20%. Warsaw and Lisbon reached 15%, Munich 8%, and London 5%. While a smaller city, the progress in Vilnius at 36% share is also a global standout. As covered at Investor Day, key cities are a good indicator of national share growth potential and I would also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU market and global key cities. Strong performance continued in Russia, with our HTU share up by 1.2 points to reach a record 7.7%. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflect plus 35% year-over-year IMS growth and around plus 8%-10% sequentially once estimated consumer pantry loading effects are factored in. We continue to see sequential share growth for both our HEETS and Fiit lineup with good traction for the regular HEETS and super-premium HEETS creation variants. Moreover LIL SOLID and Fiit consumable continue to supplement user acquisition. In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS. This bodes well for our ability to reach adult smoker in the medium and below price segments for whom purchasing power may be a barrier. Margins on midstream-priced HTUs such as Fiit remain attractive compared to cigarettes sold at the same price, and while the volume of Fiit remains small compared to our total HTU volume in this market given our large IQOS user base, we expect LIL to grow further in 2021. With this success in Russia and Ukraine, we plan to offer LIL SOLID in additional markets later this year. In Japan, on a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share for our HTU brands increased by 3 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 20.8%. Both HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks grew market share following the October price increase, highlighting the strength of our price-tiered portfolio. We expect to see further HTU volume growth in Japan over the remainder of the year underpinned by ongoing user acquisition. For the second quarter in particular we expect robust sequential IMS growth. We also expect a recovery in the total tobacco market as the elasticity effect of the substantial October price increase fade, including on consumer pantry-loading. As such, while year-over-year share growth is still likely to be strong, Q2 share may not reflect this underlying sequential growth performance and may be broadly stable versus Q1 on an adjusted basis including cigarillos. In Q1, the overall heated tobacco category made up over 28% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment. IQOS HTUs also reached an offtake share of 26.1% in Tokyo, after surpassing the 25% milestone in December. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an even increasing amount of adult smoker and as communicated at Investor Day, we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. After launching in 12 new markets with IQOS in 2020, we added Aruba in the first quarter and launched our new e-vapor product IQOS VEEV in Finland, which takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 66, of which over half are outside the OECD. We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with Q1 launches in Italy, and as I just mentioned, Finland. This follows the initial launch market New Zealand and the Czech Republic in H2 2020. One of our key priorities is guarding against youth access for all our products and we are targeting for all our electronic smoke-free devices to be equipped with age verification technology by 2023. We will be testing this technology with IQOS VEEV in select markets this year. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. Our other market -- major innovation for 2021 is the launch of IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, as announced at Investor Day. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher condition for legal-age smokers using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. We continue to plan for the launch of ILUMA in the second-half of the year. As we roll out both IQOS VEEV and IQOS ILUMA, we carefully plan our manufacturing and supply chain activities to manage expected demand, and external factors such as the current tightness of global semiconductor supply that I mentioned previously. The ongoing success of IQOS 3 DUO more than two years after launch demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on growth, and both our recently announced 2023 HTU shipment volume target, and the upward revision of our HTU target for this year reflect this confidence. Our transformation is the bedrock for both business and sustainability performance. We do not have separate strategies, phasing out cigarettes by replacing them with better alternatives such as IQOS drives our growth and addresses our biggest impact on society. Our unique commitment to phasing out cigarettes is underlined by the new transformation targets announced at Investor Day, which are aligned with the 27 Business Transformation Metrics provided for stakeholders to measure and verify the pace and scale of our progress. This includes our ambition to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025, our aim to commercialize smoke-free products in 100 markets, and to generate at least $1 billion in net revenue from beyond nicotine products as we move into adjacent business areas with a net positive impact on society. Our best-in-class performance on ESG allows us to further our leadership in sustainability. I am proud to see increasing external recognition for example on our efforts to develop a fully sustainable supply chain and our commitment to address gender inequality. Further, we recently of data that was zero deforestation manifesto, strengthening our ambition undertaking to conserving forests across our entire value chain. We remain strongly committed to providing the highest level of disclosure on the key ESG and product impact areas of our company via integrated reporting and we released our 2020 disclosure on May 18. We recognize that EFG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors with a significant potential impact on financial performance and thus better inform investment decision. To further maximize the value of investor engagement and aid understanding of the significant positive impact PMI's transformation can have on society, we plan to hold a sustainability webcast in early June, building on our recent Investor Day. Please do mark your calendars. To conclude, we've had a strong start to the year and look forward with confidence despite the continued uncertainty on the operating environment due to COVID. This is the same concluding slide I presented at Investor Day in February, as I believe our start to 2021 demonstrates all of the key elements of our longer-term trajectory. Through IQOS we are building a business with multiple levers to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming year through improved volume dynamic, excellent topline growth, strong margin expansion and fast-growing earnings. Moreover, while every adult smoker who switches to IQOS is good for our business, it is also a clear positive for our impact on society and public health. We manage our transformation with care and responsibility for our stakeholders, guided by our sustainability materiality framework to maximize our positive impact across our Tier 1 ESG and product areas. This is essential for the sustainability of our business, and for delivering superior returns for shareholders over the long term. The increase in our organic growth outlook for 2021 is another step on this journey, also putting us nicely on track to achieve our 2023 financial and HTU shipment targets. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So given some of the headlines coming out of the U.S. yesterday, it might be helpful, please, for my first question, if you could just level-set on IQOS' designation in your international markets in terms of the type of tobacco product from the tax perspective? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: So, I guess, Vivien, if I understand, well, your question is, how is our heat-not-burn offer and product classified versus combustible cigarette in our non-U.S. geographies. Correct?
Vivien Azer: That's correct. Yes, please.
Emmanuel Babeau: Right. So I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to give one general answer because the classification can be different from one country to the other. I would say, today, probably the fact that the excise duty applied to our IQOS product is differentiated in the vast majority of the markets show that the treatment is differentiated, so the product is addressed already in a distinct manner on that particular element recognizing that it's a different product with a different feature than the combustible cigarettes. So we are, of course, going to see some situation that can be different from one market to the other. We are certainly welcoming a regulation that will further clarify the fact that these heat-not-burn products are clearly different and a better alternative to combustible in the future. And as I think I mentioned, we see the regulation progressing nicely country after country to take that into account, have been taking a few example during my previous speech and we expect that to continue. So, we expect more and more government regulated to further clarify distinction between heat-not-burn and other reduced risk products and combustible cigarettes and come as well with different regulation. And as you know, we are calling for a differentiated approach on two items. Certainly, on the way, we can communicate on these better alternatives and better product than the combustible cigarette. And also, of course, on taxation to make sure that we have an incentive to push the smokers to this better alternative for their health.
Vivien Azer: Certainly. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then my follow-up, if you could just provide your assessment of the risk of other countries potentially implementing a nicotine cap on combustible cigarettes. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I think that is something that as you rightly say, Vivien, is not implemented anywhere today. And I think it's an idea that certainly would have to be investigated in all its dimension. I think that could have a number of impact in term of illicit trade, in term of people smoking, actually more combustible product to get to the same kind of nicotine dose and of course, therefore with negative impact. So I think at that stage, frankly, it's too early to say whether this is something that could have the right intent. In any case, that would have to be coupled with very strong awareness, availability of better alternative and certainly, starting with heat-not-burn if we were to work, and that should be perceived as an incentive for people to quit smoking or to switch to this better alternative and certainly, heat-not-burn being the first one that could be perceived as a nice and satisfying alternative for smokers wanting to go for better product. So, I think that the idea is -- and it's not new, because I think the FDA had put the idea on the table already in 2017. I don't think that much work has been done so far on all the potential consequences. We believe that a lot of work would have to be done on the impact and the loss of scientific evidence would have to be gathered and studied on that. And in any case, for us, that would have to be coupled with a very strong awareness, availability and present that as an alternative for people who don't want to quit, but want to keep consuming nicotine.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Good morning, Emmanuel. Hope you are well?
Emmanuel Babeau: How are you?
Owen Bennett: Yes, good. Thank you. And I just wanted to focus on the incremental commercial spend in the second-half. Could you maybe give some more specifics around what this will be behind? Will it largely be focused on the rollout of VEEV and ILUMA? And then linked to this, I was just wondering how many markets realistically are you targeting for VEEV and ILUMA to be in by the back end of the year? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Sure, Owen. So on the commercial spending, of course, here it's expecting, we believe realistically, that in many markets, the situation on COVID will gradually improve. So everybody believe that in many markets with the vaccination and positive evolution starting in the summer, we're going to see a switch to a gradual improvement. So, as you know, during a significant period of time, because of COVID, we've been somewhat limited restricted in commercial action, I would say, across the portfolio, but of course, starting on our IQOS business. So as we see the market opening up, it will, in a general manner, be time to be back on communication, on making our IQOS product known, build awareness, again, around IQOS is absolutely key in building our IQOS business and obviously, that will trigger more commercial and marketing activity. On top of that, you're absolutely right, that will be a period of very important launch with ILUMA and VEEV. Although VEEV has been started to be launched, we expect a number of markets in the second part of the year. We see exactly what is the final number. We want to make sure that we do that well with the right focus. On ILUMA, you can expect key market to be first on the priority list for launch. So I'm not going to disclose at that stage the names, but you shouldn't expect key market for us on IQOS to be coming very first on the list. And of course, that will require specific investment to make sure that smokers or other already RRP user understand what is the benefit of ILUMA, why it is an even greater product than the IQOS 3 DUO and generating more conversion, more loyalty to our product, so that we require nice investment in the second part of the year. So that is really what is behind this $300 million to $400 million that we are mentioning here.
Owen Bennett: Thanks very much. Very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to ask maybe...
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: …a follow-up – hi, a follow-up on ILUMA. Just trying to understand as you roll this out, what's the expectation of how incremental this can be? I mean, I guess I'm wondering from your expectations internally, are you expecting to see a lot of current or dedicated IQOS users upgrade to this device? Are you expecting for a lot of new users coming into IQOS? And then since you're introducing this broad range of consumables with ILUMA, how -- should we assume that there is some level of incremental costs view related to that and therefore a margin drag or not necessarily just trying to think about how accretive this could be for you?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, sure, Bonnie, happy to answer on these two points. So on the impact of ILUMA, we broadly expect ILUMA to be positive. Well, first of all, of course, on acquiring new smokers, and converting new smokers, because you're going to find more intuitive, easier to use products and we make on convince with ILUMA smokers that we did not manage to convince so far. So that's the first element. Second, of course, we're going to also have a number of IQOS user or other heat-not-burn tobacco product user switching to ILUMA because it's really a severe product with a lot of benefit for the consumer. And lastly, because we believe that in term of loyalty and people fully adopting the heat-not-burn practices and not moving back to cigarettes, the fact that it's a better product is also going to play a very nice role. So we expect to have people abandoning and switching back to cigarette to be nicely lower once again because it's much easier to use, it's an overall better experience and we think it's going to be really having a nice impact on that one. So as you can see, we expect several drivers behind this ILUMA innovation to further boost our performance on the IQOS globally. Regarding consumable and globally as a launch, I would say you should expect like always when you launch a new product, you are coming with a product [ph], not fully optimized in term of manufacturing productivity. It's a new product; at the beginning, the volume are low; you've made some investment; it takes some time to be fully optimized. So there will be beyond the cost of launching the product for marketing and commercial reason. There will be some impact at the gross margin level at the beginning because it's a new product and there will be a ramp up on the profitability of this new product and on the consumable margin on this new product. And that is of course taken into account in our guidance.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then, I wanted to circle back to some of the news that came out yesterday regarding a potential cap on nicotine levels on cigarettes in the US. So I guess my question is wondering if there is anything you can do to accelerate the rollout of IQOS in the US, since I imagine if a nicotine cap would ever be implemented, as I see it, IQOS would have a distinct advantage. So I'd love it if you could touch on that. And then, maybe your latest thoughts on potentially entering the US market with VEEV. Wondering if that might now become more of a possibility. And if so, will you or have you submitted a PMTA? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: So just on the second one, on VEEV, It is certainly our intention at a certain point in time to submit PMTA. We have not done it yet, and I don't have the timeline yet when we do that, but yes, it is certainly our intention to do that at a certain point in time. Now on growing the IQOS business, of course, we will work with our partner, Altria there. Remember, we are not commercializing IQOS in the US. We have licensed the IQOS commercialization to Altria. Let's not overreact to what is even [ph] not the news, I think it's a press article yesterday and therefore we should not run too fast to a conclusion or believe that the world is going to change overnight. I think it's just a press article. But now, we are convinced that the FDA has one clear objective, which is to promote a policy for harm reduction that will go through innovation and based on scientific evidence and they want to supervise that, the MRTP that we received on IQOS 2.4 signal [ph] that they see IQOS as a positive contribution and according to their own world, that it's appropriate to promote public health. So that means that we have with IQOS a role to play that we believe that this vision of the FDA is something that we can accompany and that we can foster and help to develop with our innovation and with IQOS, and of course, we'll make sure that with Altria, we try to maximize what we can do there
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you, again.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is on IQOS market share. Now in the first couple of years, you've seen very good growth in 4Q versus 3Q and 1Q versus 4Q. And then market share has storms, and you can see that for example in Slide 19 and Slide 21, that sort of 2Q and 3Q, there's been no growth in Japan or a little growth and in the EU and in Russia. And I guess the question is should we expect the same sort of pattern in 2021? In other words, great growth in 4Q, you just have [ph] a great growth in Q1. But then the market share will be pretty stable for the next couple of quarters in your key markets.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Adam. Well, I think certainly the element, but I'm sure you have that in mind that you need to take into account is, first of all, that there is an underlying seasonality in many markets that is impacting the volume on CC and therefore the denominator being impacted that is even if IQOS continue to grow and globally heat-not-burn continue to grow very nicely that is impacting the overall market share. And in addition to that, the COVID impact on border closure impacts, impact on illicit and some market that was not tracked that emerge and that was mainly CC business, of course, there again, changing the denominator has been impacting the market share. So it's going to be a mix we believe in 2021 still with impact from the COVID of this normal seasonality plus the specific impact linked to the COVID. Now, we target a progressive growth overall, but it's true that on certain markets, we may have after a very strong acceleration in one quarter, for all this reason, the following quarter that could be with the lower growth and even stable -- of course year-on-year, it's still very strong growth. But you appreciate that. It's sequentially that the market share is potentially not growing at the same pace. It doesn't mean of course that the volume even sequentially are not growing either [ph] you can have volume growing as well with the market share stable. So I think market share has to be taken with a pinch of salt and should be appreciated over a longer period of time to be meaningful in what they say [ph].
Adam Spielman: Thank you. That's very helpful. And my second question is around your quarterly EPS guidance. And really the question is whether you're worried that people are beginning to disregard it and sort of consensus is just sort of, well, [ph] not consensus, but the way the market thinks about you is no longer under your control. Now, let me try to explain that question a bit more. In the past two or three years, every time you've given guidance on a quarter [indiscernible] massively. Are you currently no longer take Massimo's [ph] office or at least if you give a guidance for certain out [ph] of EPS, I think it's probably going to come in 10% or 12% more, but it started again this quarter and yet the shares are fundamentally flat. Now, there might be other reasons for that, but it looks to me as if the market is sort of disregarding your EPS guidance on the quarter. And to me, that seems quite a dangerous situation for you. As I was wondering if you think that's right, if you're worried about it, why you didn't actually -- you're going to bet [ph] for new ships more at the end of the quarter and you didn't tell the market, and how you think this dynamic is going to play out going forward?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, Adam. So taking your challenge on guidance and what we deliver, I would identify two sources for -- and two reasons, two [ph] driver for beating often the guidance. The first one and I think it's a good one, is the fact that we are often surprised by the strength of the IQOS business. So we expect something and it's coming even stronger, which is a case in this Q1 for some of the beat. So we are trying to make a fair assessment of what we can expect, and then when things are coming better, we take that as a good news, but it's true, we've been too cautious in the way we've been forecasting. The other one, which I hope everybody understand, is that in today's environment, it's more difficult to anticipate, predict things because you have a lot of volatility, and we've been -- it's true, surprised by things that we did not necessarily anticipated well and that can be a spending that we thought we would do even in March and that we eventually did not do, and in term of investment and we are going to do that later in the year or some movement in market that were not well anticipated. Again, with the COVID impact creating a lot of nervousness, volatility, and frankly, somewhat a roller coaster in some of the attitude of the trade and then -- and even pantry-loading from customers. So that would be really the true driver explaining why we've been beating on the few occasion, our guidance. And when we know early in the quarter that we're going to beat, I mean we share with that when it really happened at the end of the quarter, I think we believe that it's -- it becomes clear at the stage where we say we're going to -- we see that very close to the communication if [ph] you want. Now, on your challenge of -- or your question of, does it mean that the market is no longer following you. Well, I don't think this is a case. I think everybody understand the specificity of this COVID situation and accept that there can be volatility and things that we don't anticipated -- anticipate well. And then you know on the strength of IQOS, I think everybody can have a view on what we can deliver. I think we are today revising towards [ph] the guidance on the number of HeatSticks for the year to 95 billion to 100 billion. I think based on the Q1 that's really sharing with all investors, shareholder analysts, the best possible assumption that we can make and really reflecting our vision at that stage.
Adam Spielman: Okay, thank you. It was a tough question. Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.
Michael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Michael.
Michael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to your comment about pricing on HeatSticks and how you've begun to differentiate a little bit more there. And I assume if I heard you right, you said you're now doing both above and below the original price points you'd had. Obviously, in Japan, we saw what's the HEETS launch lower price point introduced, but could you give a little more color on how you're doing above where you have been price point? And is there additional new brands you have or a second or a third one? And just how that's positioned and if it's not too, too early what you're seeing so far with that?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Mike. Happy to do that. What is happening on our IQOS business and on the consumable is typically what you would expect in a market -- consumer good market where things start to mature a little bit. And I'm using this word with a lot of cautiousness of course because it's a very young market still, but in a few markets like Japan, for instance, a few other markets where we are not double-digit market share, it's maturing a little bit. So typically, the consumer -- the customer will expect based on his purchasing power, based on his personal lifestyle and what he wants to enjoy or what he wants to say about his life or her life around him. We'll want to have different I would say positioning on what he is consuming. So when you go for innovation, what we did with the HEETS consumable, you have one single reference at the beginning. And then rapidly, you see the need for segmenting the market, there is a category of the consumer that will be very keen to have an even severe experience. So to get to an even better consumable and ready to pay more for that, so to have higher expenses that's what we have with whether the Marlboro HeatSticks in Japan or HEETS creation in Russia, you keep the premium below the hyper [ph] premium if you want. And then, at a certain point in time, there is also a need for a medium and probably later in the future for a medium minimum positioning because other consumers will be keen to have an inferior overall experience but still great rewarding versus what they used to have with the same category of combustible and of course, at a lower price point. So I think we're just doing the right commercial marketing job to make sure that we give satisfaction to all the expectation of our customers. It happens gradually, it's relevant yet in every country. But as more and more country are becoming a bit mature, that will become increasingly relevant in more and more market in the future.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That's a really helpful color. And on your sort of quote mature Japan market where you grew three or four share points year-over-year, I just want to make sure I understand some of the dynamics there. You gave the adjusted share which of course excludes some trade moves but also cigarillos and then the other share. The gap between those has widened a little bit over the five quarters you show, it's like 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.9, and then 2.6. Unfortunately, we don't have great visibility on cigarillos. Is it just growth in that segment, that's the key driver there or is there also a little bit of an inventory build we should have in mind as we think about modeling 2Q and beyond?
Emmanuel Babeau: No, Michael, there is no concern of inventory bill whatsoever, that certainly the level of cigarillo, remember that is a specific category. The tax advantage will fully disappear next October but there is still, until now, a very dynamic category in Japan. So what we are, as I said, seeing in Japan has been following the October excise duty increase and price increase. A very, very nice reaction from our IQOS business altogether both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS, we've been gaining very nice market share at the end of the year 2020 in Q4. It continued in Q1 and therefore we are disclosing very positive and genuine market share growth during the last two quarters and we are very happy with it.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Questions were asked. I have just two quick ones for you. I was just curious in relation to IQOS, you've had really strong development of market share in Russia and the EU. Those were also markets where you continue to build your availability of the product. Do you have a rough approximation of how widely available IQOS is, say in the EU and Russia? Is there still more distribution potential in those markets to get it in front of more consumers?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, clearly, we said it in Russia, we have not a full coverage of the country yet. In the EU, we have a number of countries where we are in the big cities, but not yet with an important full coverage, I would say with a lot of capillarity I think Yatsik [ph], at the time of the Investor Day, highlighted the market share that we have in key cities and signal that if we look backwards, the market share a few years upstream are good -- in big cities are a good indication of where you can get the whole market, a few years down the road. So, I think that's a pretty good indicator of the fact that we manage, of course, to get an even higher market share in key cities and the overall country and the fact that we have done that in key cities mean that we are very likely if we continue to do a good job to reach the same kind of market share globally for the country. But of course, it's not the end of the road because at the same time, we kept increasing share in the big cities, so it's an ongoing improvement if you want. But that's I think the way you should be looking at things.
Chris Growe: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just one other question in relation to combustibles in an area where you've had a little bit of share pressure again this quarter, and there's some reasons for that. But I just was curious when I think about commercial investments in the second-half of the year, I was thinking that in relation to IQOS and reduced risk products, do you need to apply more money, more attention, whatever the right word is towards combustible cigarettes to try to shore up some of that market share decline? I know some of this is being generated by the success of IQOS but just curious how you're looking at that and is there any kind of change in the competitive dynamic you're seeing in combustibles.
Emmanuel Babeau: I mean we are certainly seeing competition quite active on combustible because for many of them, they have only little presence in RRP. So they are trying to protect and build their business there and especially sometimes they are under pressure because of the growth in the heat-not-burn category. Chris, we are just reminding everybody that maintaining our leadership in CC is an absolute priority. We need this leadership in order to make sure that we keep the link with the smoker that we want to convert in order to keep the impact with the trade to bring our RRP offering to customers and of course, for the financial resources that it provide in order to invest behind RRP, so you should expect us to continue to invest on CC to maintain this market share. It is clear that, although it's not going to be the majority but there will be some investment in the second-half on the CC business as we defend our business. And as we see some of the markets where we've been sometimes hit hard by the COVID and we talk about the social consumption that has been hitting [ph] Marlboro. Well, as we think the world is back to more social life in the second-half that will probably be a time to be back on making sure that we maintain and further strengthen the leadership on Marlboro as an example.
Chris Growe: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for the color.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: So I just wanted to come back to understanding your guidance and the cadence for this year given the strength in the first quarter and outlook for Q2, your guidance for EPS implies a moderation from about mid 20% growth in the first-half to high-single-digit growth in the second-half, and obviously, you pointed to added incremental investments, but are there any other factors impacting the second-half outlook? Because even when adjusting for the added incremental spend, it implies a notable moderation in growth. So just trying to understand what's considering the fact [ph]...
Emmanuel Babeau: So, Pamela...
Pamela Kaufman: [Multiple Speakers] how conservative it might be?
Emmanuel Babeau: Happy to take that one. So I'm sure we've highlighted the fact that the Q1 margin has been helped of course by some deferral of investment on SG&A and we signaled the fact that we'll be much more active in H2, and the $300 million to $400 million extra investment versus the first-half but we also signaled that gross margin has been -- I mean, the performance on the gross margin is absolutely impressive in Q1, and we're going to deliver a very strong performance on gross margin rate improvements through the year. But we flagged the fact that Q1 has been boosted as well by non-recurring element on manufacturing productivity and therefore we think that as it's not going to be reproduced, we're going to have here a moderation. We also are going to face -- and that was Bonnie's question previously, some impact coming from the launch of ILUMA and the consumable of ILUMA where there will be some pressure on gross margin because of it is -- of the launch and the time for the ramp up on manufacturing productivity and we will have also a number of investments that will be in the gross margin on distribution in the second-half. So, if you combine the fact that Q1 was exceptional for a few reasons and the fact that there is boost [ph] at the gross margin level in Q2, some element that will be impacting negatively plus increase investment that is driving the outlook for the margin in the second-half. Although, as I said, we're going to keep with a very nice margin improvement but I'm sure you've noted that already.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. Also, I just wanted to ask about IQOS VEEV learnings and performance in your initial launch market. I understand you're leveraging your existing IQOS platform to commercialize VEEV. So how are you steering consumers across the various products?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So as at stage, Pamela, it's very early stage, few market very preliminary. We have very good feedback from customers reflecting the fact that it's a superior experience versus most traditional vaping experience. So we are collecting the data we are reviewing the first information coming from these markets and when we have a bit more element to share, we'll do that. I would say for the time being on the limited number of markets and with very small volume, we are happy with the qualitative feedback that we are getting from these markets.
Pamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, thank you. Good morning, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Gaurav.
Gaurav Jain: Coming back to the questions which have been asked on repeated earnings beat and earnings coming ahead of guidance, how does this impact your thought process around the magnitude and timing of share repurchases?
Emmanuel Babeau: I don't think that this is having a meaningful impact, Gaurav. I think we've signaled previously that we are absolutely on track, provided of course that we receive board approval to start share buyback in the second-half of the year as announced at the time of the Investor Day. I'm not sure that at that stage, we are building a strategy based on that. As I said, I am hopeful that with the COVID headwind abating, we're going to be a better forecaster in the future for our quarterly guidance. So I don't take that as a kind of element that would be here to stay.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my second question is on -- and maybe I'm incorrect in what I'm saying, but as I understand, a part of IQOS is [ph] about 6 grams of tobacco, while a pack of cigarettes has 16-gram of tobacco. So does it imply that a pack of IQOS has lower nicotine versus a pack of cigarettes, which could therefore be something which helps you in this debate around nicotine caps?
Emmanuel Babeau: No, Gaurav, not necessarily. It has an impact on some time in some country, not everywhere on the excise duty because excise duty is on the weight of tobacco in several countries in the world, but the weight of tobacco is not directly going to guide the nicotine content that you're going to inhale through IQOS consumption versus combustible consumption.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. Brilliant. And thanks a lot.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Nicholas Rolli: That concludes our call today. Sorry, Emmanuel, unless you had a comment.
Emmanuel Babeau: No, no, I was just to thank everybody for attending the call today, and we look forward to talk to you soon.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you, again, and have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Bye-bye. Bye, everybody.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 16:03:04) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2020 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about an hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. . I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. 
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a robust performance in 2020, despite the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up over 10% of our volumes and almost 1/4 of our net revenues for the year.  The daily consumption of HTUs by IQOS user saw minimal impact from social restriction, and despite significant constraint, we were able to continue acquiring new user in switching from cigarettes at a very good pace to reach a total of 17.6 million, of which 12.7 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.  HTU shipment volumes grew 28% compared to the prior year, with record market shares in key IQOS geographies in Q4. Moreover, 10 markets exited 2020 with double-digit national share in December. Our rate of user acquisition was again strong in Q4, propelled by the increasing sophistication of our digital commercial model and the positive word-of-mouth effect from this increasing prominence, despite tighter restriction in a number of markets. 
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. . Our first question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, everyone.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, and congratulations, Andre and Jacek. I guess my first question today would be on margins. And I guess, Emmanuel, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expectations around margins, I guess, in terms of any favorable fixed cost absorption you expect as you amortize the investment behind IQOS over this increasingly larger accelerating volume base.  And then as I'm thinking about that, in the context of your variable costs going lower as you touched upon thinking about the progress you've made with digital, so could you just talk about that and how big of an impact this could be or big of an opportunity this could be in the future? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Happy to do that. It's going to be only a teaser versus what we're going to see next week. So bear with us, and we'll elaborate with much more detail. But I can certainly anticipate a few headlines on what we'll share next week.  I think what is obvious in our number for 2020 is the fact that, beyond the great performance of IQOS, we have also used efficiency on cost as a powerful lever to generate performance. That's really showing up very clearly in our numbers. So we are delivering in two years, instead of three years, the overall at least $1 billion savings. And what is good is that we are working on cost efficiency on several levels, and many of them, of course, are related to IQOS, but not exclusively to IQOS for some of them.  If you look at the gross margin level, it's quite obvious that we are being very successful in generating manufacturing productivity, and that's a great driver for further margin improvement. And here, we are working globally across the portfolio, I would say, on margin improvement. So it's not just on IQOS, even if probably on IQOS, because that's a business that doesn't have the same maturity, we have more runway, if you want to improve the productivity. And we are certainly making extremely good inroad in that respect, but we are also generating manufacturing productivity on CC.  And then on our SG&A, I think you could identify two drivers on cost efficiency. One, I would say, it's probably something you're going to find in many companies today. We are working to be a more efficient and agile company. So we work on being more digitized, we work on simplifying the way we work, we automate, we standardize, and that is allowing us not to be cost cutter, but just to take cost to be a better company and deliver overall higher performance. And then you have elements that are indeed connected with our commercial performance and not only to IQOS, but certainly mainly to IQOS, and you have two elements. One is all the investment that we made in the past, and that is a great platform on IQOS. And I'm not saying that the investment is over. We're going to keep investing. But, of course, we have now an investment that we amortize over a fast-growing base. And we are not growing the level of investment at the speed of the growth of the IQOS business.  And then there is this great work that we are doing. Thanks to digital and thanks, of course, to all the learnings that we are making on the IQOS business, where we very nicely reduced all the variable per user cost. But I will stop there because we will elaborate on that next week.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then my second question is all the progress you've made with IQOS in growing the base, and it's so large. But as you look out, could you talk about further segmentation of markets with your different platforms or possibly different price points as you continue to convert more smokers? I mean you touched on that. My guess is you're going to touch on that more next week.  But just as I look at your business, it implies that your user base is probably going to need to double in the next maybe three-plus years based on our analysis for you to hit your aspirational target of that 250 billion units by 2025. So love to hear any strategy there, insights because if I think about it, I assume more of the conversion is going to come from other reduced-risk technologies. And how do you anticipate your mix evolving over time? Thanks.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes. I'll give you the first shot. I still believe, over the next three years, Bonnie, as I said many times, that heated tobacco technology will be the prevailing technology because it has the highest ability in terms of taste and satisfaction to convert people.  Now in terms of segmentation, I believe, in most markets, we will need one or two heat-not-burn technologies, if I stay with this segment, and probably two to three, over time, consumable price segment, so we can cover mostly the vast majority of the market. There will be exclusions where you need to cover four price segments with probably two technologies. And we'll talk next week about the next step in technology for aerosolization in heat-not-burn, which will address many of the pain points consumers have today.  Now clearly, the heated tobacco product is one category. I think that's the fastest growth, both in terms of revenue and bottom line and volume. The second is obviously e-vapor. We are entering this market because I believe there is consumers there that want to switch trade to these products. There is a lot of dual users, and we see also dual users between heat-not burn and e-vapor that, obviously, we would like to capture. I think we can also capture consumers for every e-vapor products.  The key there is clearly to leverage the infrastructure and the brand name of IQOS. I think the product is very good, and that's the first reactions we get, but we need to build equity because that's a problem for the category, as you know, and also consumer loyalty because for the economics to be at best for e-vapor, you don't only need to be premium positioned, but you also need to have loyal consumers because if you discount just products and you sell them, and then a consumer has 10 different products from 10 different competitors and consumes half a cartridge of your product per week, it's very difficult to make the turn and, more importantly, it's very difficult to maintain an infrastructure. Now we have the advantage of having a lot of infrastructure with IQOS that we can leverage. The equity of IQOS is undeniably the best in the RRP, so I think that's helpful. Technology is good. We are premium, so I think we can make inroads in this category.  And then obviously, we were also going to expand in the pure nicotine products like nicotine pouches or the P3 over time, although I think this is more occasional use products or non-predominant use products. So that's a little bit -- and again, sorry to cut this here, but we're going to elaborate this more -- in more -- extensively next week, okay?
Bonnie Herzog: I expected that. So very helpful. Thank you so much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.
Michael Lavery: Just wanted to touch on IQOS again. And the Philippines, you have a 20 basis points share, which, of course, is small, but it's very early there. And if I understand it right, you launched there without any stores initially. You also touched on the call about some digital launches in Estonia and Kuwait and the Maldives.  And so just would love a little more sense of how some of those digital efforts work. And it's certainly seen in the Philippines, they're ready to be pretty quickly effective. Can you just bring to life a little bit of how you're going to market there?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. It's Jacek here. So yes, we started this year in Philippines, to be very precise, in the Manila, not even greater Manila. And the product as expected actually responded pretty well. This was one of the first fully digital, if I may, launch, also driven by the fact that we had to change the strategy last moment due to the COVID restrictions and the whole COVID impact.  And the product starts getting good tractions. I think we'll still stay for a while in Manila, which is, frankly speaking, not the major secret because we're following the same path of the same strategy for the rollout in every geographies, right, especially if you go to the sizable geography like Philippines.  But product is well received. I think the taste characteristics, et cetera, fits very well. We're also testing the different route-to-consumer models, as we're entering the countries when you have a stick purchase. There is a lot of consumption on trade rather than just off trade. So we need to come up with very good solutions there. But I'm very positive on that part of Asia, which is still unchartered for IQOS.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And just a second one on buybacks. Helpful clarity that there's no consideration on that in the guidance. But with some currency tailwinds now and the balance sheet where it is, it certainly seems like that could be -- it could come into play. Can you give a sense of what you would need to have in place or see before you might trigger resuming with buybacks?
Emmanuel Babeau: Look, if you bear with us until next week, we'll have a global review of our capital allocation strategy, and we'll address all components at that stage.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That's no problem. If I could just maybe swap that question then. Could you give any sense of where you stand on Platform 2 with TEEPS? Any update on that?
Jacek Olczak: On TEEPS on the Platform 2, I mean, we will be further conducting that this time the market commercial test this year in 2021.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.
Vivien Azer: I wanted to also drill down on IQOS. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what the mix looks like for the consumables from traditional tobacco flavors and some of the novel flavors that you have in the market.
Jacek Olczak: That's Jacek here, Vivien. It varies market by market, okay? Obviously, as you know, we have flavors of menthol. We have some other flavors. But still, IQOS, frankly speaking, in most of the places is very much attractiveness is coming from tobacco flavors.  I mean, at the end of the day, most of the segments which we are targeting at this stage, and we are operating at scale, I mean most of the segments are the flavor -- tobacco flavor type of segment, right? So IQOS really has a very winning proposition. There also has a great proposition in menthol and our flavors.  So that varies by the country, and you can't really -- I think if I give you the international share of the flavors, it will be just misleading. The average doesn't make that. But it follows, typically, if you have a predominant menthol market like Japan, the dominance of menthol if you are predominantly full -- I mean, cigarette markets without menthol, then you are predominantly there. A bit sometimes over indexed in menthol in general because it has a bit more impact for people, so it's easier to switch.
Vivien Azer: Understood. And my follow-up also on IQOS, please. In terms of the market share progression that you saw in Japan, either in the quarter over the course of the year, can you contextualize the contribution from the Marlboro brand versus the HEETS brand?
Jacek Olczak: The Marlboro brand is still the major contributor of the overall volumes and the growth, so we're very pleased that on the course of the last year, we continue growing Marlboro.  Obviously, HEETS, which is priced not below the Marlboro had a bit a better dynamics than Marlboro, but the above actually contributing to the growth. And it's very interesting, Vivien. You're asking because this is the first market which we try the dual -- or double -- dual positioning of the consumables, Marlboro and HEETS in Japan.  As you know very well, we also extended HEETS in a couple of Eastern European geographies, in Russia. When first, we brought the above premium propositions to HEETS, the HEETS Creations. And the HEETS Creations contributes. So we like premium rise further to HEETS in Russia. And HEETS Creations in Moscow constitute now about 10% of the overall HEETS volume. So that's very good.  And then we complemented on the notch below price segment by bringing the lil Fiit proposition. So with now in Russia, we're testing can IQOS operate on the free essentially price segments on the devices. And the spread is pretty phenomenal because IQOS devices will go from $60 on the premium device, and then we go down to the $20 on the lil device. And then we have a coverage on the consumables spreading from RUB 170 per pack to RUB 130.  So it gives you the hint how broadly we now -- why we can go with IQOS touching the segments above medium and below medium. And this is despite, as you know, that we have a competition in Russia. But frankly speaking, competition in terms of the devices is essentially close to 0.  So it's a little bit of a very aggressive promotions, but we continue delivering the strong growth on IQOS, both in terms of user acquisitions measured by the device sales and by the HEETS -- further expansions on the HEETS. And what is also good in places like in Russia that we continue growing in the top cities, which we started a few years ago. So we have a continuous growth in the cities, and the expansion doesn't need from that growth which we have in the Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other main cities.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain with Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: So on the organic margin improvement, which you are guiding to for FY '21 of 150 basis points, that is on top of 240 basis point improvement in FY '20. And this saw benefits like production and travel expense, there was a cut in German VAT, et cetera.  So what I'm trying to ask is that is your underlying margin improvement closer to 200 basis points, not 150 basis points, and that is clearly happening because of high cost. So is that how we should be thinking about the next few years as well?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, so for the medium term, again, we'll elaborate next week on more outlook. For the year, Gaurav, I'll let you make your assumption. I think we are clear on the kind of one-off savings that we have seen because of the COVID, so you can factor that in your model. And then I think we are also clear on what are the driver for margin improvement. So it's about the positive impact of the growth of IQOS in terms of per stick revenue, in terms of margin and then everything that is happening on cost efficiency.  That is really what is driving -- that has been driving the margin improvement in 2020, and that will continue in 2021. As you can imagine, beyond 2021, but we'll elaborate on that next week.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. My second question is on the European Beating Cancer Plan, which was released earlier this week, and they talk of things like flavor ban, plain packaging, increasing taxes on heated tobacco to -- equal to cigarettes. So how do you think of that? And how do you incorporate these sort of risks in your outlook?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, this is a plan, and there are many positive aspects also in this plan in my view. First of all, we don't talk about taxes. I mean, this is subject to directives. The tobacco excise directive that governs the excise tax and the tobacco product directive, that is the regulation of the products, okay?  The first is the tobacco side directive today does not foresee reduced risk product category, so it has to be amended under all circumstances, okay? And we're not talking about increases. It's creating a framework under which member states can tax.  Our view is that absence of combustion, for example, is a key criteria on how to tax differently cigarettes to other products. And then within that major cliff of change in toxicity and exposure, member states can have different tax rates for these products. But this product should not be, by any means, higher than any combustible category available, okay, as a minimum criteria. But this has to happen.  Nobody said that taxes will increase or hit the tobacco products, frankly speaking, at this stage or in vapor product, okay? So all this has to be defined, and the discussions are going to start in the course of this year and continue in next year, in any case.  So that's for -- and then the tobacco product directive been served, I hope that there will be a bit more regulatory clarity in there regarding RRPs because -- and e-vapor product because just now, we left it up to the member state to regulate, which, frankly speaking, is not harmonizing a directive, one; and secondly is a pain for all the industry participants because every country has a different regulation. And we always advocated serious regulation on these products, provided that this is differentiated from cigarettes, okay?  Now there are voices that say that these products should be the same thing as cigarettes. But at the end of the day, it was very clear also in the cancer plan that all -- in the Q&A that only based on science and evidence, they will take decisions. So I wouldn't be particularly worried about this at this stage. And I think the outcome may be positive actually because it's an opportunity to discuss all these things. Now in the longer term, we discussed very often, I believe tax differentials will be maintained because it makes sense for public health, it makes sense for the consumers. And as we also explained, we have room even to pass taxes if, by any chance, differentials close somehow because IQOS, also in order to pass part of the tax benefit to the consumers, it's mid-price position, essentially, if you take the weighted average of the countries, number one.  And number two, its price productivity is much, much higher than cigarettes, so passing on a tax is triggering less price increase than passing on tax on cigarettes. So that's in a nutshell the way we should look at it, but we have to assume that excise taxes will increase over time also for RRPs as governments need money, and that will apply to heated tobacco products that's already taxed substantially and, potentially, in some cases, to e-vapor products in the future. But that's all baked in, in the assumptions.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And if I can ask one last question. It's on a minority interest, which has been increasing at a higher rate than your EBIT, and that's driven by Philippines. So is there an opportunity to reduce your minority interest, considering your partner in Philippines, it trades on the exchanges at like some 6x PE?
Andre Calantzopoulos: No, we don't envisage this. Not in the -- I mean if our partner wants to sell one day, we can discuss. At the moment, they're very happy with us.
Emmanuel Babeau: We're very happy with our partnership in Philippines.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman: So the first question, I think you said in your guidance that you're expecting to take less pricing variance on combustible cigarettes than usual. Now for years and years and years, it's been 6%, and I think you said it's something to do with COVID that you want to take less pricing. I'm really surprised by that.  You also said the pricing model has been broken. So I suppose the question is, if you take less pricing in combustibles this year, 2021, what would it take for you to have another low year in 2022? That will be my first question.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, we didn't say we will take less pricing. We will also -- where the pricing opportunity, we'll take pricing, and I think the model still works very well. Elasticities are the same, everything.  We had to make some, in my view, reasonable, conservative, you may say, assumptions regarding what's going to happen in Indonesia and Russia because of the tax increase. And Indonesia has never got it carryover from last year, which makes the comparisons year-to-year problematic, okay? Plus, in Germany, we had a VAT, I would say, tax break, which we assume is not going to continue this year. So if you exclude all these elements, I think we're still back to a normal pricing in the other markets.  So clearly, in terms of post-COVID, I would say, assumptions, we have to watch more carefully the price gaps, that's clear, at the mid- to low end of the market, but that doesn't mean that we're going to take any severe pricing decisions at this stage anywhere. I just -- this is a watch out.  If there is down trading, which is happening between the mid-price typically and the low-price segment, also because we have absence of contraband and all these things, that's something to watch in certain markets. But overall, I think we're in good shape.  Also both on IQOS, on heat-not-burn products and combustible, the excise taxes are now in, if I'm not mistaken, everywhere. So we have pretty good visibility of where we are, okay? So I don't think it's super COVID related. What is COVID related in the guidance is the range we gave because if you look, Adam, at what happened last year, if we assume 2% to 3% underlying industry decline, even baking in Indonesia, we had a 6.7% industry decline.  So we're missing consumption for mathematically 3.7%to 4.7%. That's on average, $100 billion for the industry. So we don't -- that will rebound, in my view, one day, but once the restrictions finish.  Now we gave a guidance for this year of 0 to minus 3, which is at 0, you have some recovery. At minus 3, you have super underlying negativity, maybe exaggerated. I don't know at this stage, but that's plus/minus 20 billion units for us. So that's plus/minus 2.5 revenue points.  So that's where the volatility is, okay? And if pricing comes better in Russia and Indonesia, that much the better. We may end up at the high end of the range.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Well, I think that leads to my next question, which is, to be blunt, I don't really understand the EPS guidance, and there are many aspects to really understand about it.  So first of all, you're saying in Q1, where your comp is insanely hard, you're going to have flat organic sales, you're going to have margin expansion, you're going to have 8% like-for-like EPS growth. You then say because the comp is really easy in Q2, you're going to have a great quarter, or you imply that. And yet the full year is only 9% to 11%, and it seems to me that if you can do so well in Q1 and you don't do well in Q2, then the 9% to 11% is very conservative.  And another way of asking the same question. Every single time you've given guidance of any sort on EPS since 2018, you're being smooth. This is -- this quarter, you gave guidance. It wasn't a range. It was a point estimate.  You said you were going to do about $1.20 for the fourth quarter, and you said that in December, And yet you beat it very handsomely. Now that would suggest that the way you give guidance is systematically incredibly conservative.  You either you can't forecast, which I don't believe, or you're systematically incredibly conservative. To that point, the fact you've always been conservative with the price very well in Q1 against a really tough comp suggests to me that the guidance for the full year is also super conservative. Is that fair?
Andre Calantzopoulos: I wouldn't say conservative, but it's not bullish either, okay? I mean, I understand what you are saying, but we're at the beginning of the year, okay? Many things can happen regarding COVID because it's not finished.  So last year, as Emmanuel said, we had more than $150 million exceptional expenses because of COVID, okay? So you need to put some cushion in the bottom line regarding unexpected costs. And if we have a rebound, I would call, not a very gradual recovery, we may need to invest a bit more money towards the end of the year to accelerate acquisition. You can physically do that. If we physically can't, then clearly, the money will go to the bottom line.  So at this stage, we gave this range, okay, which, by the way, if the dollar stays where it is, it's not bad at all because it's 14% to 16%, and the revenue line would be 8% to 11%, which will be phenomenal, I would say. So I don't think this is conservative. It's just I don't have a crystal ball to foresee everything that's happening in every month of this year, okay? We're still not in normal situation. That's all. So I understand and -- but -- and it's just how I can further explain.
Emmanuel Babeau: Just in the sequence, please factor in that -- I mean, as we say, we talk about a gradual recovery that we are expecting without being able to, of course, design exactly what is going to be the trajectory, but that would mean certainly more investment in H2.  Remember, we've been, of course, limited in commercial activity. As you know, we say H2 could be a better moment overall with a number of restrictions being eased. There will be also more investment skewed towards the second part of the year.  So you have to take that into account, and that explains as well why Q1 maybe is expected today better than one could have expected initially. But the investment will need to happen in the year.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Any case, I would love to be conservative and as the quarters unfold, we'll get more. But I think I gave the parameters. The pricing, that still can come more favorable. That goes straight to the bottom line. If we have bit more combustible, that's fine. It goes to the bottom line, but we have to assume that. So as the quarters pass, we will give you better outlook.
Operator: The final question will come from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS.
Robert Rampton: Hello? Hello?
Operator: Robert, your line is open.
Robert Rampton: How to come in the queue actually?
Nicholas Rolli: Operator, can you put Robert Rampton in queue from UBS, please?
Operator: His line is open.
Nicholas Rolli: Robert, can you join? Okay. We'll get back to Robert after the call, operator. If we can just go to the final remarks. Andre, I think you have some closing remarks.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes. I mean, thank you all for joining. I think we had a rather complicated 2020, but the results came out much better than I would have thought when we were talking for the first time in March.  I think we look at a very good recovery in relative terms in '21. IQOS continues to grow strongly. The momentum is excellent, in my view, and we will see some rebound, hopefully, in cigarette volumes in the next 1 to 2 years. I would love to see positive total market maybe in '22.  And we look forward to sharing with you more on the long-term growth and more on understanding the profitability of IQOS in -- next week, actually. So have a very good day, and thank you for listening to us.
Nicholas Rolli: I just wanted to add that, well, if you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team and look on our website for the instructions on how to log on to the Investor Day event. It starts at 8:30 Eastern Time on February 10. You can register on our website. And again, thank you very much for joining the call. Have a nice day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Bye.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-20 09:00:00) =====

Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call and those close to you are safe and well. Our business delivered an even better than expected performance in the third quarter despite the ongoing circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the excellent momentum of IQOS continues. HTU volumes have grown 28% year-to-date with a positive mix effect on our net revenues, where RRPs again made up almost one-quarter of our business in Q3. IQOS user acquisition outpaced the prior year quarter to reach an estimated total of 16.4 million users at the end of September. While still below pre-pandemic levels in most places, our combustible business recorded an improved sequential performance. Underlying industry volumes were better across both developed and emerging markets, reflecting increased consumption occasions. This was notably the case in market with a significant proportion of daily wage workers like Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines. Despite these better industry volumes, Indonesia remains challenging together with Duty Free. We must also retain a degree of caution around a second wave of the pandemic and its overall economic consequences across all of our markets. Our operating margins were again significantly ahead in the quarter and on a year to date basis, despite the challenges in our duty-free business. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Our cash generation was also strong with $3.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter putting us on track to reach our target of at least $9 billion this year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue declined by 1.5% on an organic basis, making -- marking a significant improvement from the decline of almost 10% in Q2. While this was somewhat aided by certain timing factors, including the revaluation of distributor inventory in Japan ahead of the October price increase, it nonetheless reflects the continued strength of IQOS combined with a sequential improvement in our combustible business. Indeed, the positive effect of the shift in our sales mix towards RRPs can be seen in the 6.5% organic increase in net revenue per unit. Combustible tobacco pricing was 2.1% up reflecting solid pricing in a number of markets, partially offset by timing differences with the prior year, a strong prior year comparison in Turkey, and headwinds in Indonesia. These timing differences included the effect of delayed pricing in some instances, such as the Philippines where we took a price increase this month rather than August in 2019. Given this net revenue decline, we were pleased to deliver such a strong adjusted operating income margin expansion of over 300 basis points on an organic basis. I will cover this in more detail shortly, noting that we saw a further benefit versus our prior expectation from additional cost efficiencies and some delayed spending in the last month of the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.42 increased by 5.6% excluding currency; better than our prior expectation of a flat organic development. The primary driver was the above cost benefit as well as better industry volumes in Indonesia and the EU region, where increased mobility coincided with the reopening of hospitality settings and warm weather. I also want to reflect on our strong performance over the first nine months of the year. This was clearly a challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. Our net revenue declined by only 0.9% on an organic basis, an exceptionally resilient performance given these unprecedented headwinds. We estimate that Duty Free and Indonesia alone were a mid-single-digit drag on our top line growth. Despite these factors, we saw very good organic progression in our net revenue per unit from the increasing weight of RRPs and solid pricing in combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 260 basis points to deliver 7.4% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on an organic basis. Let me now go into the driver of our Q3 margin expansion in more detail, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 180 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers. First, our ongoing transformation is delivering an increasing mix of RRPs in our business. Second is pricing on combustible. Third is our focus on overall manufacturing productivity, where our focus on efficiency, quality, and footprint more than offset the impact of lower combustible volumes. The positive gross margin development was augmented by our focus on SG&A efficiency with our total marketing administration and research costs, 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenues on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our RRP commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. There was also a benefit from the timing of certain costs as I already mentioned. Despite the challenges of 2020, we are today raising our expected full year adjusted diluted EPS range to between $5.05 and $5.10, reflecting around 5% to 6% organic growth. This excludes an assumed unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.32. As stated in our earnings release, we have also updated certain guidance assumption. We now expect a total industry decline of 7% to 8% and a like-for-like decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 9%, both of which factor in the better Q3 development in the EU and a smaller expected market decline in Indonesia. We assume an organic expansion in our adjusted OI margin of around 200 basis points, also reflecting the above factors and ongoing cost efficiencies. We expect capital expenditure of approximately $0.6 billion and an effective tax rate excluding discrete item of 22% to 23%. We also assume no recurrence of national lockdowns in our key international market in the fourth quarter and remain vigilant with regard to the pandemic as economic uncertainty remains and localized social restrictions are being tightened in some geographies. Focusing now on the fourth quarter, we assume underlying consumption trends should be broadly stable versus a robust Q3. In many markets, including the EU region and Russia increased consumer mobility, the opening of hospitality settings and summer conditions provided a helpful backdrop to our performance. However, there remains continued pandemic-related uncertainty as we now see localized restriction tightening in certain countries with potential impacts on both mobility and economic vitality. The delay of certain SG&A costs from Q3 will also have an impact on our fourth quarter results. In addition, it's worth noting that while the price increase in Japan took effect on the 1st of October, the majority of the impact this year was realized in the third quarter through the revaluation of distributor inventories. I should remind you that Q4 2019 presents a strong base of comparison. This is notably due to pricing in Indonesia ahead of the January 2020 excise tax increase and an exceptional share gain in Saudi Arabia due to market disruption ahead of new plant packaging requirements. As such, while we expect around 5% to 6% organic EPS growth for the year, we expect the organic progression to be flat to modestly negative in the fourth quarter, excluding $0.04 of estimated unfavorable currency. I will now cover our third quarter performance in more detail. As with net revenues, our combustible shipment volumes sequentially improved, albeit the year-over-year decline remains greater than historic average. This was supported by better industry trends in all regions. Conversely, our HTU shipments volume continued to grow strongly to reach a record 19 billion units driven by the EU region, Japan and Russia. I also want to touch on the year-on-year inventory movements in the quarter, which negatively impacted our shipments on both cigarettes and HTUs vis-à-vis consumer offtake. The reversal of trade build-ups in H1 in markets like Germany and Russia was one contributing factor. Specifically for Japan, there were reduction in distributor inventories in Q3, following increases in both Q1 and Q2 of this year in anticipation of retail and consumer loading before the October tax-driven price increase. As such our shipments in the quarter were less than our in-market sales volume. Importantly, inventories for cigarettes and HTUs in Japan are now aligned to the expected market size following the price increase. The main positive impact of the price increase on our Q3 results was the revaluation of distributor inventory. This strong performance from IQOS means that heated tobacco unit made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first nine months of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as the positive momentum on RRPs continues and remain well on track to achieve our target of 90 billion to 100 billion units in 2021. Our mission is to grow the RRP category globally and transform the mix of our business. With $4.9 billion in sales year-to-date, RRPs are now approaching one quarter of our total net revenues. Indeed, while this percentage was just over 23% in the quarter, if we were to adjust for inventory movements, Q3 would have almost reached 25%. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue year-to-date, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new users to existing users, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, particularly in the third quarter. In some geographies, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced original IQOS 2.4+ device, and we have now introduced lil SOLID in Eastern Europe. The East Asia and Australia region provides an illustration of RRPs operating at scale and is on track to deliver over half its revenue from RRP this year. While the investment phase of building commercial infrastructure can weigh on margin as scale is built, the strong margin expansion over recent years shows how powerful scale and experience in RRP can be as investments start to pay back and the commercial approach is optimized. Focusing now on our total international market share, the developments were very positive for the bulk of our business. Before the impact of Duty Free cigarettes and Indonesia, our share increased by 0.4 points. This was driven by higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.8 points to reach 3.1%, only partly offset by lower share for cigarettes. In markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with few exceptions. It follows that our combined market shares increase in the EU region, Japan and Russia. However, our total international market share was negatively impacted by Duty Free, where our share is higher than the PMI average, resulting in only partial recapture of volume in other markets, and by Indonesia, which I will come back to separately. It is also true that in many markets, Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasion, which are naturally lower during COVID related restriction. While the easing of measures is uneven across market, we saw aggregate Marlboro share start to recover sequentially in the quarter. I turn now to Indonesia. While the challenges related to the excise tax structure remain, underlying consumer trends improved in the quarter. Industry volumes declined by 6% excluding trade inventory movements, a notable improvement from the 22% decline in Q2. This primarily reflects a recovery in daily consumption from depressed level as confinements eased. Given the continued rise in COVID cases and the possibility of more localized restriction, such as those temporarily introduced in Jakarta last months, we do not assume significant further improvement in the fourth quarter. However reflecting the better third quarter industry volume and exit rate, we now expect the total industry decline on a shipment basis to be around 11% for the full year versus 15% previously. While a smaller industry decline has a commensurate effect on our volumes, our market share remains under pressure, despite improved performance from the higher margin A Mild, Dji Sam Soe Magnum and SKT brands. This is due to the same dynamic mentioned last quarter. Most notably, the growth of tax advantage below tier one brands continues as tax-driven pricing and the pandemic have increased downtrading. To illustrate this issue, the tax per stick on our tier one A Mild brand is more than 60% higher than on a comparable tier two kretek brand with a similar resulting difference in the retail selling price. With the segment now at 26% of the market, this represents a serious and growing threat to state excise revenue and a diminishing return on this year's tax increase. The correction of volume-based tax tiers remains urgent. We are hopeful that the government will take steps over time to ensure more predictability in tax revenue and level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise structure. The process of minimum selling price implementation also continues to progress slowly hampered by the pandemic. Full enforcement may not be complete until the end of the year at the earliest. I move now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 16.4 million total IQOS user as of September 30. This represents the addition of around 1.1 million adult users since the end of the second quarter and over 4 million since the same time last year with more users added in both Q3 and year-to-date than the corresponding period in 2019. This is an exceptional achievement given the circumstances, where our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement is paying dividends. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.7 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. This again reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region and Russia. As our user base expand in markets like Japan and Russia, we are increasingly enriching our offer and segmenting the market with new product and more price points. We plan to bring more exciting innovation from IQOS in the coming quarters. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of Modified Risk Tobacco Product reduced exposure orders for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The success of IQOS in global key cities, where our commercial strategy typically has a strong initial focus, serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. In many such cities across a wide range of market, our share is now well into double-digit and still growing. This provides an excellent base from which to further grow our RRP business as we innovate and broaden the IQOS offer. In the EU region, we added a further 0.4 million IQOS user in the third quarter to reach 4.7 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. While most adult menthol smokers have switched to non-menthol cigarettes since the ban in May. We have seen some incremental switching to RRP over the May-September period and continue to see further opportunity to convert these consumers. Third quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. This was in line with Q2 2020, but sequentially increased by 0.1 point when adjusted for estimated retailer inventory movements and consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential IMS growth, also on an adjusted basis was plus 16%. This reflects strong absolute growth in Italy and Poland. It also include further progress in Spain and in the UK, where both national and London offtake share continue to grow with the latter exceeding 3% in September. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU markets. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with our HTU share up by 1.8 points to reach 5.8%. On a sequential basis versus the second quarter of 2020, share decreased by 0.2 points reflecting a cigarette market, which grew 6% on the same basis, aided by seasonality of consumption and lower illicit prevalence. Sequential HTU in-market sales, adjusted for trade inventory movements increased by more than 9%. With the introduction of HEETS Creations in Q1 2020 and Fiit consumables for lil SOLID this quarter, we now have a price tiered portfolio to cater to a broader range of adult smokers across the socio-economic spectrum. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco unit reached 20.5% in the third quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS such as the recent launch of Marlboro Black Menthol. IQOS users grew to an estimated total of 6 million, of which an estimated 4.4 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2.6 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.2 points sequentially to 18.9%. Q3 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 7.3% sequentially. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow with the large majority of this growth driven by IQOS and now makes up almost 26% of the total tobacco market. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of IQOS continues. We leveraged our digital capabilities to launch in four new emerging markets; Costa Rica, Georgia, Jordan and the Philippines. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 61, of which over half are outside the OECD. The launch in the Philippines was initiated digitally before adding retail touchpoints and is focused on Metro Manila where consumer purchasing power is higher. While the geographic scope is limited, we are encouraged by progress so far. We have also now started the commercialization of IQOS VEEV, our new evapor product which was launched in New Zealand during the quarter. Initial adult consumer feedback is positive, and we plan to roll out to further markets in Q4 and 2021. The commercial infrastructure of IQOS will allow us to deploy efficiently and at scale. We place great importance on guarding against youth access for all our products. In this category in particular, we will be testing age verification technology in select markets. As part of our mission to build and accelerate the global RRP category, we aim to offer a choice of experiences, formats and price points to adult smokers and consumers of other nicotine products. Our collaboration with KT&G is consistent with this goal, as demonstrated by the first launches of lil products through our IQOS infrastructure. We introduced the lil SOLID heat-not-burn device and Fiit HTUs in both Russia and Ukraine during the quarter. As we reach shares approaching 15% to 20% with IQOS in key cities such as Moscow and Kiev and we expand to areas with lower purchasing power, a simple, affordable proposition can play an important complementary role in reaching more adult consumers and maintaining a strong rate of user acquisition. Early results are encouraging with positive feedback from adult users. This means that in both these markets we now have HTU brands at three price points within the heat-not-burn category. Super-premium HEETS Creations/Dimensions, premium HEETS and mid-priced Fiit, all of which present attractive margins. We will also shortly be launching the lil HYBRID device, Mix consumables and nicotine-free liquid cartridge in two Japanese prefectures, offering adult consumers a differentiated premium experience, which combines the satisfaction and rich flavor of heated tobacco with added sensorial elements. There is a consumer segment in Japan looking for such an experience, and we believe this will be the best hybrid product available in the market. I want now to emphasize the deep alignment of our business with sustainability and ESG objectives, which sit at the core of our mission and strategy. Our most important ESG issue is the health impact of our products. By innovating with significantly better alternatives, such as IQOS, we have a historic opportunity to substantially reduce this impact by switching adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to reduced risk products. Through deploying RRPs at scale we can improve public health and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 3 Good Health & Well-Being. We also have best-in-class practices across a range of central ESG issues, where the other three of our four sustainability pillars are focused. We believe this provides a unique combination, whereby sustainability is a true driver of innovation and growth. By embedding sustainability into the core of our business, we can create value for our shareholders, and society at large. To conclude, our Q3 results were stronger than expected, and we have raised our full-year guidance to reflect around plus 5% to plus 6% organic EPS growth. We are building a business through RRPs to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming years. The continued momentum of IQOS through the challenges of the pandemic demonstrates these structural growth characteristics. We are also committed to maintaining the competitiveness of our combustible business. We have a number of levers for growth in our top and bottom lines. First, the powerful mix effect of RRPs. Second, pricing, which will remain important for combustibles and, where appropriate, for RRPs. Additionally, efficiencies in our manufacturing and SG&A costs are further levers as we continue to hone our business model. Moreover, with the launches of the IQOS VEEV and lil products, we are broadening and stepping up our product offer and innovation in 2021. You can also expect us to bring further exciting innovation to our IQOS heat-not-burn platform. As I just mentioned, sustainability and ESG are at the heart of our smoke-free strategy and we continue to work tirelessly to further our mission. As we all know, there remains continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic, the impact of social restrictions and their economic aftermath. However, when COVID-related headwinds abate we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rates in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth on an organic basis. In short, we look forward with confidence and we will expand on these topics further at our next Investor Day, which we plan to hold in early 2021. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hi. Thank you very much. So, my first question. You've reiterated that you're very, very comfortable with 90 billion to 100 billion target for 2021 for RRPs. Are you still comfortable that you will exceed 250 billion in 2025, which is your other longer-term target? That's my first question. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Adam. We definitely are repeating our ambition to reach next year 20 -- 200 billion stick in the heat-not-burn category, and I think that the growth that we deliver quarter-after-quarter is clearly pointing to that direction. Then you are alluding to the 2025 objective of 250 billion plus, which is I think here aligned with what I've started to detail on the presentation, which is really the fact that we are broadening the portfolio when it comes to RRPs product, and we are going to of course come with more enrichment, more segmentation, more offering when it comes to heat-not-burn. We are entering the evaping category, and all that is going to put us on the track to deliver that ambition. And I think everything I've been seeing in term of segmentation of the devices now that we are coming with the lil offering, what we have started to do now in Japan, in Russia, when it comes to the consumables, it shows that clearly now the market is getting a bit more mature, of course, it's still at an early stage in most places, but in a few places we have some first element of a bigger market, it is time now to enrich the offering and broaden the spectrum of what we can offer to, I would say, concur and convince more smoker to switch to our product, and therefore that is what is going to put us on the right track for this ambition for 2025.
Adam Spielman: Excellent. Thank you very much. And then [indiscernible] I don’t want to remind you, I want to put words in your mouth, but your market shares in Russia and Japan, they grew in Q3, but sequentially less than in Q2. And I'm wondering why that was do you think, and whether it really is significant or it's just sort of random quarterly fluctuations and we should just ignore that one?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, I don't think that there is anything to be read there. I think that we are very happy with the performance on the key market. Of course, you know what has been and depending on the season and the consumption pattern and what has been happening on the borders, we know that some borders were closed. We talked about illicit trade being stopped, I mean, that can be disruptors to the evolution if you take a kind of flash or split quarter view. But I would say the trend that we are seeing in Q3, we are very much in line with a nice strong trend that we've been observing over the first part of the year over H1. So, I don't think that there is anything in Q3 that would be signaling a slowdown in the way we are gaining share in an underlying manner.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. Very clear, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning. So, there is obviously a lot of ongoing uncertainty, but as you just reiterated, you are on track for your heated tobacco target for 2021. I guess broadly how are you thinking about how you're positioned for growth next year and do you anticipate accelerating growth as you lapped the performance this year and see benefits from the enforcement of minimum price increases in Indonesia?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, thanks for the question. Obviously, it's very early stage to start talking about next year. I think you very rightly said it, 2021 is full of uncertainty and we even recognized that the last months of 2020 has a fair share of uncertainty as well. So, difficult to of course start to elaborate on 2021. The only thing I can say at this stage is that we are going to enter 2021 with the strength of our RRP business that is clear from this first nine months performance. There will be certainly a number of low comps in the basis of 2020, but as we don't know how the markets are going to be in 2021, and if I take the example of duty-free, which of course you could say we're going to have nine months with very, very low business in duty-free in 2020. So, one could argue well that's an easy basis of comparison, but nobody is able to say today what's going to be the rebound next year of duty-free. So, it's just difficult to say which kind of growth trajectory at that stage it designs if you want. I hope we'll know more at the beginning of 2021, when we will comment on our full-year 2020, and at that stage we can share more details with you, but I think that for us, the main element today that I would say is a kind of for sure whatever is the environment, it is a very, very strong performance of our heat-not-burn business.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. And also obviously very strong margin performance in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to that in terms of lower marketing and administrative costs? You pointed out manufacturing efficiencies. How are your IQOS customer acquisition costs trending and how much of the lower cost is temporary versus sustainable going forward?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, happy to do that. Well, the margin improvement is and that's probably the strength of the performance is not coming from one element. I think it's a collection of drivers that we have to add to the topline evolution, nice margin evolution. And that is coming first, of course, from the growth of RRPs, and I think we are showing this quarter's impact on the gross margin of the positive impact on the mix of the consumable in heat-not-burn. And as we keep growing the business that is of course a nice mix positive impact, clearly helping the margin. There is also everything we are doing on price and we keep clearly working in the direction of improving nicely price on combustible. There is -- and I would be happy to elaborate further if you want. Then there is, of course, everything we do on manufacturing productivity, which is also a nice driver, and then below the gross profit, you're right, we have this very positive evolution of our SG&A, where we managed to decrease on an organic basis SG&A by about 7% when the decrease of the topline is only 1.5%. So, we have a nice leverage if you want between the two. And here you have a mix of things. First of all, yes, of course, we are working on the efficiency of our -- all functions, all teams are working on working in a simpler, more efficient, more digitized manner. We are platforming our work. We are standardizing, we are automating, we are using digital in all capacity in order to work in a more efficient manner. So that is contributing to certainly some saving. Then on top of all this effort, you're absolutely right. We have increased efficiency as we turn toward a more digital commercial engine on RRPs. And that is of course something that is going to accompany us on the long term. We build at the origin the IQOS business with a business model you know with a lot of physical cultures and based on having some retail places that we were owning and that was great to start. We needed to do that, but of course, as we are growing the market, as we are learning about it and as we are developing our digital skills, we are indeed developing a tool, which is really efficient both in term of digital customer experience and in term of digital trade experience and that is allowing us to be much more efficient in contacting smoker that we can convince to switch to IQOS in explaining and accompanying them on answering all their question and coaching them in a digital manner for them to understand how it works, how it is a global experience. To answer that question, we have been creating communities where people switching to IQOS can exchange their impressions and their tips. And then once it is done, of course, the job is not done and we are moving to retention and really build this intimacy through having a lot of data about our customer of IQOS and really being able to bring them the best overall experience and keep them as customer of our heat-not-burn business. So that's what we are doing today and absolutely that is translating into reduced cost of acquisition and reduced cost of retention. We are certainly not at the end of this improvement, but that is nicely helping the performance in 2020 for sure.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.
Michael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you. You've launched in some markets this year and certainly it doesn't seem like the easiest of circumstances to really get those going with pandemic closures and restrictions, but you've got some like Saudi Arabia already at 40 basis points of share obviously small, but France took several years to get to that. Mexico also 20 basis points. It's early but these look like they're a pretty good start. Can you touch on some of what's driving that? I know you just mentioned some of the digital things. Is that really the key, are there other factors? What's just getting some of these markets going a little bit more quickly than we've seen in the past?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I think it's -- each market Michael is different. So the answer probably could require long explanation and entering the various type of dynamic. And starting with the regulation, of course, the capacity that we have to speak about IQOS and explain how it works. In some market we have this capacity to explain to smoker that a better alternative does exist in other country, we are much more limited. So that is clearly having an impact. Then certainly there is an impact as you grow the visibility of IQOS, as you people starting to see friends, family around them using IQOS, you may have a kind of snowball effect maybe it's a little bit of a caricature, but I think to some extent it can play like that and that can accelerate the evolution of the market. You have also the cultural dimension, which is quite important, in some country people will be proud of having discovered IQOS and they will want to share that with their friends and they will become our best salespeople I would say about IQOS and taking themselves the time to explain and convince friends and relatives. In other culture, it would be very different and that won't happen because they will believe that it's a personal choice and they don't want to interfere on that. So, all that to explain the very different pattern that we are seeing in terms of development of the business. Having said that, you're absolutely right. The more we're going to be able to go digital and have great digital tool to contact smokers talk about IQOS be able to engage them in what is the IQOS experience. The more we are going to be able to grow the market and clearly developing the digital customer experience is going to be key hopefully in accelerating the growth in several market. But let's not underestimate the fact that regulation can be a pretty significant restriction nevertheless even when it comes to using digital tools. So again that explain why I think there is certainly no market where we are not seeing that we have the ambition to make them RRP market, but certainly in some market it's going to take a bit more time.
Michael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And then we're about five months into the menthol ban in the EU for cigarettes. You mentioned a little bit of incremental momentum on IQOS menthol especially in a market like Poland. There's been a big share jump there. How much is that related to menthol success getting cigarette smokers to switch and how much more runway is there for that to go?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Michael. What I can share with you is that, so you remember that menthol was roughly speaking 10% of the EU market altogether. I think the vast majority of the menthol smokers have been switching to other type of combustible cigarettes. And so I don't think that there has been certainly not maybe what was all in term of people stopping to smoke. It's probably a few percent, but no more than that. And when it comes to switching to other alternative like heat-not-burn and IQOS in particular maybe around 5% of the people have done that so far. It doesn't mean that we are giving up. We think that we can certainly convince more people, but I think the impact has been relatively limited. You're right; probably helping a little bit in Poland. Maybe in the UK as well which two big market for menthol. But I would not say that it has been having a big, big positive impact so far on our IQOS business.
Michael Lavery: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. I appreciate all the detail around digitization and IQOS user engagement seemingly a lot of the hard investments you guys made early and then the incremental investments are paying off. I was wondering if we could kind of pull that altogether and perhaps quantify the evolution that your IQOS user acquisition costs in particular over the course of 2020 given COVID? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I understand the question, but at that stage you know I think we are not going to enter into more granularity. I think we are giving through this set of numbers and presentation more detail on the driver for profitability. So I'm sure that you are able to capture through the gross margin evolution and other element that we are giving some elements. But it's obviously, as you can imagine, a relatively strategic information sensitive and therefore it's not something that we can share, but I'm certainly happy to confirm that we are seeing a significant decrease and that we have ambition for more significant decrease in the future. So I'm just reiterating my comment that you should expect more improvement on the ramping up of the profitability of our RRP business in the future, which is really great because we are combining a big, big driver for the top line growth quite obviously and in addition, a nice driver for profitability improvement.
Vivien Azer: Okay, that's fair. Thank you very much. My second question is just on price gaps in the heat-not-burn category, it makes a lot of sense to me that you would want to introduce a tiered portfolio as your penetration continues to mature, if you will. How are you thinking about those price gaps relative to combustibles though? I mean you've used the same kind of descriptive language in terms of the price segmentation in Russia. Are we meant to take that to understand that you're going to match price gaps against combustibles with a tiered heat-not-burn consumable portfolio or is there a reason to think it might vary? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, as you know, globally we have a position because it deserves it. Our RRP business as a premium business. It's a unique consumer experience and that fully justify a premium price positioning. Now, of course, as you know in some country as well, the excise duty level is lower, sometime materially lower on RRPs and heat-not-burn then on combustible cigarettes. And therefore that is also justifying a lower price point. So, I would say, as a rule we have our combustible that are priced at the price on Marlboro or sometimes even a bit below Marlboro and I think it's a good positioning. The sweet spot to really reflect the overall experience and the value for the consumer, but also the specificity of the heat-not-burn category and heat-not-burn products. And in segmentation, we are going to do the same. It's of course related to the customer expense as well and all three consumable are under the same and not deliver the same experience. And exactly like we have been doing for decades on consumable depending on the level of, I would say, benefit value for the consumer. We know what is perceiving the overall pleasure and positive dimension for him. We'll have different price positioning that will be aligned with that. I don't think we should expect anything really materially different there.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hello, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Your quarter was stronger than expected and you're seeing a better demand environment and then you also took up guidance again. So I guess I'd like to get your thoughts on resuming your share buyback program and if this might be realistic next year? It seems like you have flexibility and I guess I think of it as an important positive signal for the market that probably would be viewed favorably. So I just think it would probably help to support your stock price. So I'd love to hear what your current thinking is on this?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks for the question, Bonnie. We haven't changed our mind at that stage on the buyback and we've announced as you know 2.6% increase of the dividend to $4.80 a year. So we continue to reward the shareholders. And I think we stated in the past and we are very much on that line that we would not start to share buyback that could potentially endanger the rating. And I'm not sure that today we have a huge flexibility on that rating with the balance sheet that we have today. So we have a very strong balance sheet and we want to keep that. I don't think that we would love to be losing some nudging the rating because of buyback. So I'm not closing the door on the long term of course it's a moving situation. And as we keep generating cash and strengthening the balance sheet, we may together with the Board decide to change that, but for the time being, this is not on the agenda.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. And then I know it's early, but I was hoping to get maybe your thoughts on what you see as the key tailwinds or maybe headwinds as we look out into '21? I guess as I'm thinking about your business and what you've accomplished during this pandemic? It seems like the setup is quite positive especially as I think through a few tailwinds, such as, for instance the one you have in Japan. I'm not asking for guidance for next year, but is there a way that you could just kind of layout a few of these tailwinds as you see them for your business and/or possibly headwinds? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks Bonnie for not asking for a guidance because we will not give you anyway. Trying to elaborate on tailwind and headwinds. I think the tailwinds are quite obvious. We have this RRP business that is you know almost one-fourth of the business. So it's very material in term of share of revenue, that is going very strongly. We talk about growth of about 28%, 29% year-to-date. We see a number of market that are actually contributing to the dynamism. We are, as we said, enriching the offers. So we see that we start to enter into new phase of this ambition of creating this category that we think one day will be, I would say, putting an end to a smoking world by this segmentation enrichment of the offer. So we have here a very powerful tailwind that is going to help us as we enter into 2021. And as you have seen, it's not only, as I said positive for the top line, but it also nicely positive for the bottom line, because we are ramping up the profitability on that business and that is a business that has the potential to be super nicely profitable. Then of course you know I said it you have all these very low comps that we're going to have in few markets. We have this Q2 that has been very difficult. You have the duty-free business that is extremely depressed. So one could argue that if things were to start gradually in 2021 to be back to normal, but that could provide easy comp for growth. Now that unfortunately the segue for headwinds, because we don't know what's going to be the environment. More and more people are saying that we're not going to be back to normal maybe until the summer of 2021. Nobody knows what exactly it means, by the way, but people are saying, when the vaccine will be available, which could be summer 2021. That's a condition to be back to some more normality and therefore we don't know how it's going to play out globally on the business. But I think we are taking comfort and confidence from the fact that I mean the 2020 will not have been a walk in the park, that for sure, and despite that, we are delivering what I consider to be a robust performance and targeting our nice organic growth for the adjusted EPS. So it shows that even in a difficult environment, we managed to deliver a nice performance.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel. So couple of questions. One is on the CapEx. So CapEx was again reduced to $600 million and now it is meaningfully below depreciation, which runs at about $950 million for your company. So is this the new run rate of CapEx and can you depreciate a step down in the future?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Gaurav. So, no, this is not the new normal for the company. We are obviously going through stormy water. So it's an adjustment and there is number of project by the way that given the environment we prefer to postpone, so that explain why we are now targeting $0.6 billion for the year. I think you can expect us when we are back to a more normal environment, to be back to a more normal CapEx amount that I would say probably to be around $0.8 billion. So that could stay below the level. You're right of amortization and depreciation that is north of $900 million today. And of course overtime if it continues like that, that will mean that this amount will decrease as well. You're absolutely right. I'm not able to give you a phasing for that, but that should be over time a natural evolution though of course with the carryover effect it will take some time.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And my second question is on your travel retail business, where you have booked zero revenues on high cost in the Middle East and Africa line. And clearly the market is not down 100%. So you are supplying out of inventory. So is there any risk of inventory write-down in travel retail?
Emmanuel Babeau: I think at the end of September, we have been taking care of the potential impact of that. So I would not expect anything major for the rest of the year.
Gaurav Jain: Okay, brilliant. Thanks a lot.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Hi. I just had a question for you, if I could on some of the inventory adjustments that occurred in the quarter. And just to understand so IQOS had an inventory drag that weighed on its volume in the quarter that you reported an even stronger performance for that brand excluding the inventory changes. Our inventory say for IQOS I guess I'd be curious for your business overall. Are they at the right level or are there expected changes to occur in the fourth quarter on inventory perhaps to building inventory?
Emmanuel Babeau: No, Chris. I think that you're right. And I think we flagged in H1 that there was a number of country with some anticipation on inventory. We got the reversal of that in Q3. You're right. If you retreat the shipment by that, we have a record around 20.5 billion stick of in-market sales which is, I mean, it's quite a symbolic threshold, but to be above $20 billion is quite nice, and we believe that we are globally at the right level at the end of September. So we're not expecting today in Q4 any material impact on inventory for heat-not-burn.
Chris Growe: Okay, thank you. And then, just a second question on VEEV and kind of just to understand the degree to which you can undertake a wider scale launch in more markets in the fourth quarter. Are there production limitations? There obviously I'm sure there are at this point, but just to understand how you think about the progression of that launch in more markets starting in the fourth quarter?
Emmanuel Babeau: So there could be very limited number of market launch in Q4. I think we're taking the time to have all the lesson learned from what we've seen in New Zealand to make sure that when we launch, we are super ready and very successful. There is certainly things around age verification on which we are still working and which are very important for us as you know. So we are still working on these various dimension. So don't expect too much in Q4. I think the big new launches will be more for 2021.
Chris Growe: Okay, thank you for your time.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Afternoon, Emmanuel. Hope you're well.
Emmanuel Babeau: Owen, hi.
Owen Bennett: And first question please. I just wanted to come back to Adams in the $250 billion target by 2025. So you mentioned the role, the expansion of the portfolio into evapor will here and obviously very different economics between heated and vapor. So how do you see that $250 billion being split between the two categories? I know very early days, but I'm kind of a rough idea internally how you see that evolving?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure. And so we haven't been splitting the $250 billion. So I won't do it now. I think we believe that quite obviously each RRP category has a play in getting there, but there is no doubt that we continue to see the heat-not-burn category as being I would say the majority of this $250 billion. So we certainly intend to develop e-vaping and IQOS VEEV and other things that we could launch from now until 2025. But I think you should expect still a big part of this -- a big majority of the $250 billion to come from heat-not-burn. Remember I mean this is an aspiration that we've been sharing. I think as we progress we'll make sure that we put more detail around that. So bear with us. We're going to certainly continue to give more vision, more visibility. But at this stage I cannot split further the $250 billion and quite obviously we want to develop things in a profitable manner. So that also drives the choices and the final number in the split of the $250 billion.
Owen Bennett: Okay, thank you. And second one; I was hoping you could give me the ex-inventory heated volumes in Eastern Europe that Q1, Q2 and Q3 you just see how that kind of progressing shipping the inventory impacts out?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I don't have that with me, but I can see with the team maybe as to whether there is something that we can find the one for you.
Owen Bennett: Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And, thank you, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Bye.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated all references to IQOS, are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. In addition, please note our estimates for total industry and market share for the quarter are subject to limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data in certain geographies during pandemic-related restrictions. Comparisons presented on a like-for-like basis reflect pro forma 2019 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., effective March 22, 2019. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call and those close to you are safe and well. Our main focus remains the health and well-being of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate. During restrictions, we have implemented stringent policy and measures to minimize risk for those who continue to work in our facilities and offices. For all our employees, including those working from home, providing guidance and support is also essential. We are now facilitating a gradual, carefully managed return to the workplace in some location, where local condition and authorities restrictions allow. The strength and spirit shown in this challenging time by the people that make up our organization continues to be a real inspiration to me and the PMI management team, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for their outstanding efforts. I now turn to the business, which delivered a robust performance in the first half of the year despite the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the continued momentum of IQOS was excellent with an estimated 15.4 million users at the end of the second quarter. Our commercial model pivoted rapidly to digital and remote engagements, while preserving high rates of IQOS' user acquisition and brand retention. With volumes of heated tobacco units growing 24% in Q2 2020 compared to the prior year, RRPs made up almost one quarter of our net revenues. In addition, after two very difficult months in the quarter due to the pandemic, our combustible business is now improving. Industry volumes started to recover in June and the beginning of July, reflecting the gradual easing of confinement in many countries. The improvement was particularly driven by the EU, our largest region in term of net revenue and adjusted operating income. The main enduring headwinds linked to COVID-related restrictions are the absence of recovery in duty-free; and in Indonesia, where this is compounded by pricing dynamics. Economic uncertainty remains and we all hope for no major resurgence of the pandemic. Notably, despite additional COVID-related expenses, our operating margin has been strong in both the second quarter and first half. This reflects the increasing mix of RRPs in our business and their improving profitability. Productivity savings in manufacturing across RRPs and combustible, SG&A savings from the pivot to digital, the elimination of -- or postponement of certain lower priority projects and the operating leverage of higher RRP volumes all contributed. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the three regions where RRPs have a strong presence are driving this margin performance. We reached a truly historic milestone for IQOS, our mission and our future growth prospect on July 7 with the FDA's authorization of IQOS as a modified risk tobacco product. IQOS is the first electronic nicotine product to receive an MRTP order. Following a review of our extensive scientific evidence package, the agency found that an exposure modification order for IQOS is appropriate to promote the public health in the United States, demonstrating that IQOS is fundamentally different product from combustible cigarette and a better choice for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. The agency concluded that issuing the order for IQOS is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both user of tobacco product and person who do not currently use tobacco product. A critical enabler for the future growth of RRPs is the implementation of differentiated regulatory framework that can help encourage adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to instead switch to better alternatives, in line with the harm reduction principle. The authorization allows a version of IQOS to be marketed with information confirming the validity of our scientific studies with regard to the significant reduction of exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful chemicals contained in cigarette smoke. The FDA decision and subsequent comprehensive post-market controls and monitoring, focusing on use prevention provide an important example of how government and public health organization around the world can implement an inclusive, science-based approach to help rapidly shift adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking to better options while simultaneously guarding against unintended consequences. With investors increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance aspect, I would like to highlight our recently published Integrated Report for 2019. The report covers a variety of important ESG topics and measures, including our business transformation metrics. Notably, our expanded aspirational targets now include new goals for the number of users of our smoke-free product in non-OECD countries and youth access prevention. The report is available on our website at pmi.com. Let's turn now to our strong performance over the first half of the year. This was clearly a very challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. I am proud to say that our organization has the strength and agility to withstand this with limited impact on supply to our consumer and trade partners. Despite these unprecedented headwinds across many of our key markets, our currency-neutral net revenues helped by a strong first quarter were close to flat versus the prior year on a like-for-like basis. Driven by pricing in combustible, manufacturing and SG&A efficiency and the dual RRP margin effect of growing weight and improving profitability, our adjusted operating income margin increased over 200 basis points to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on the like-for-like ex-currency basis. I focus now on our second quarter performance. The effect of confinement on mobility impacted daily consumption pattern in certain markets, including those of daily income workers in developing countries and disrupted the retail trade. This led to significant industry volume decline in a number of geographies during April and May, which primarily impacted our combustible business. As expected, duty-free sales were weak. The March build-up of trade and distributor inventory largely reversed in the first part of the quarter, and we had to delay a few pricing decisions. This period also coincided with a challenging prior year comparison. Notwithstanding these challenges, our performance was better than we expected when we last updated our guidance on June 11.  Currency-neutral net revenue declined 9.5% compared to our assumption of around the high end of minus 8% to minus 12%. Given this net revenue decline and the strong prior year profitability, we were pleased to maintain a stable adjusted operating income margin. This was supported by growth in the net revenues and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Combustible pricing of 3.3% also contributed and reflect robust pricing in many markets, partly offset by Indonesia and a strong prior year comparison in Turkey. Reported diluted EPS of $1.25 was notably better than the upper end of our previous guidance range, including a lower currency impact of $0.06. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.29, excluding reporting adjustment for asset impairment and exit cost, which represents an ex-currency decline of 7.5% compared to the prior year. There were three main drivers of this better-than-anticipated performance. First, the recovery of industry volume in June, notably in the higher-margin EU region, benefited our net revenues and margin. Second, IQOS user acquisition grew substantially in the same month with markets such as Russia back to pre-COVID rate and overall IQOS acquisition for the quarter only 35% below pre-pandemic levels. Last, we had the benefit of certain non-underlying factors. These include trade inventory movement in June ahead of tax and regulatory changes in Germany, Russia and Saudi Arabia, cost phasing, and a lower tax charge, largely driven by a reduced corporate income tax rate in Indonesia, as well as changes in our earnings mix. These data [ph] factors accounted for approximately $0.10 of the better EPS performance. Before we come to guidance, I will outline some of the dynamics for the second half of the year. We expect a gradual underlying improvement in the combustible business coupled with continued robust growth for IQOS. The pandemic continues to present an uncertain operating environment with a potential for tightened restriction in localized areas. While not included in our guidance assumption, there also remain a non-negligible risk of a resurgence in the virus and the return of national lockdowns. The full economic fallout of the various restriction is also unclear. This said, we observe relative stability in term of pandemic restriction and improving visibility across a number of geographies in recent weeks. Conversely, visibility remains lower in some areas such as Indonesia and Latin America, in addition to the absence of any recovery so far in Duty Free, which as a reminder represented close to 4% of our net revenues in 2019. In term of our cigarette business, while underlying industry volumes are gradually improving as restrictions ease, we assume that the return to a normal level of consumption occasion for consumer will take time. We do not assume significant widespread increase in down-trading with such dynamic currently concentrated in markets were a trend already existed due to elevated price gaps. It is reasonable to expect some delays in the timing of pricing in certain markets due to the pandemic situation. In RRPs, sales of devices and HTUs are performing strongly, reflecting the better-than- expected IQOS user acquisition and continued strong brand retention and conversion. Our unique commercial model has demonstrated the flexibility to accelerate the shift to digital and remote activity and we continue with high level of such engagement in markets where stores are reopened. Despite the exceptional headwinds of 2020, we expect to grow our full year adjusted diluted EPS between plus 2% and plus 5% on the currency-neutral like-for-like basis. This corresponds to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.92 to $5.07, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.31. This forecast assumes a total industry decline of 7% to 9%, excluding the U.S. and China, and a decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 10% on the like-for-like basis due notably to Duty Free and Indonesia. With regard to net revenue, in like-for-like ex-currency term, we assume low-single digit growth, excluding Duty Free and Indonesia. Due to these two factors, our overall net revenue may see a modest decline. The forecast also reflect expansion in our ex-currency like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of more than 150 basis points. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, 2020 operating cash flow of at least $9 billion and $0.7 billion of capital expenditures. All these estimates assume that national lockdowns will not recur in our key international markets in the remainder of the year. Specifically for the second half, while underlying trends should gradually improve, we expect the recovery in our growth to be skewed towards the fourth quarter. This assumes the progressive easing of restrictions across the remaining markets with commensurate greater industry recovery towards the end of the year and the compound effect of increased sequential IQOS user acquisition. In the third quarter, we expect the reversal of certain one-time benefit from the first half, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.10 and a net revenue impact of around 1%. The continuation of headwinds in Duty Free and Indonesia, the timing of 2020 pricing in certain markets and the phasing in of costs are also included in our assumptions. We expect to see a good sequential improvement in reported net revenues in the third quarter, but a decline compared to the challenging prior year comparison. For adjusted EPS, also due to the timing of certain SG&A cost and the one-off item of the first half, we expect Q3 2020 to be broadly in line with Q2 2020. Sequential improvement in reported net revenue should continue in the fourth quarter although likely still in slightly negative territory compared to 2019. Growth in adjusted EPS will also be driven by a greater expected realization of cost efficiency from new initiatives. I will now cover our second quarter performance in more detail. As expected, our shipment volumes were weak, driven by the effect of marked industry declines on our combustible volume due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. Notable market contributors to this decline were Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines, all of which were impacted by restrictions, loss of income for daily wage workers, and significant price increases. Conversely, our HTU shipment volumes continued to grow strongly to reach a record 18.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, and Russia. While overall volume in the quarter was weak, the sequential recovery seen in June and the beginning of July is more encouraging. Our combined June in-market sales volume was the highest monthly total this year and grew 2.8% compared to June 2019. Though this growth includes an estimated 3 billion unit effect from inventory movements, it mainly reflect better industry dynamics across many geographies, notably the EU region, which declined by 7.3% in Q2 overall, but grew in June. We are also encouraged by the sequential improvement in HTU volumes, which exhibited positive year-on-year growth throughout the quarter. This strong performance from IQOS mean that heated tobacco units made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first half of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. While somewhat flattened in Q2 2020 by weaker combustible volume, we expect this proportion to grow over time as our positive momentum on RRPs continues. RRP net revenues reached $3.2 billion in the first half, reaching almost one quarter of PMI's total net revenue in Q2. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue in the second quarter due to a lower ratio of new user to existing user, given pandemic effect, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, as in some countries, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced IQOS 2.4 Plus device. Turning now to market share. Our total international share declined by 0.1 point to 28% in the second quarter with higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.9 points to reach 3%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. Our market share was negatively impacted by Indonesia and the market mix effect of Duty Free, where volumes dropped sharply and our share is typically much higher than our overall international share. The cannibalization effect of out-switching to IQOS were essentially offset by positive impact elsewhere, and in markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with almost no exceptions. It follows that our combined market share increased notably in the EU region, Japan, and Russia. It's also true that in many markets Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasions, which were naturally lower during COVID-related confinements. We expect Marlboro share to recover as restrictions ease. Indonesia cigarette market saw an accumulation of headwinds in the second quarter. A pronounced impact from pandemic-related restriction on daily consumption added to the effect of tax-driven pricing and retail disruption. Industry volumes declined by 22%, excluding trade inventory movement whereas our shipments declined 28%. Our share decline can be attributed to three broad dynamics. First, within the Tier 1 segment, price gaps remain elevated, given our price leadership of the past 18 months and the delay in the enforcement of the minimum retail price. Combined with COVID effect, this has contributed to the end of performance of our premium-skewed portfolio despite better sequential performance from A Mild. The process of minimum selling price enforcement has started. Government inspectors have returned to the field. However, the full enforcement and subsequent trade flow-through of compliant product may not be complete until the fourth quarter. Second is the strong growth of the tax-advantaged below Tier 1 segment, which in conjunction with the tax-driven pricing and pandemic situation of 2020, has led to increased down-trading. This was designed for small players with production below a certain volume threshold. However, the segment is not operating within the spirit and intent of the law. With the segments now at approximately 25% of the market, this represents a serious threat to government excise revenue and the correction of volume-based tax tiers become urgent. Third, the stricter public mobility restriction in urban areas, where our share is higher, has disproportionately impacted our portfolio. However, our market share sequentially improved in June, supported by strength of our brands. While we see sign of improvement in the market, the situation remains challenging. We now assume the total industry decline will be approximately 15% for the full year, reflecting progressive sequential improvement in daily consumption from the particularly weak second quarter. We are fully committed to improving our performance in this key market. We have a number of ongoing commercial initiatives to leverage equity of our brand portfolio through the remainder of the year. This includes the introduction of new variants in the growing SKT and full-flavor SKM segments such as the Dji Sam Soe 12 launched in March and Marlboro Filter Black 16 launched this month. However, with enforcement of the minimum retail price now underway, the main outstanding structural issue is the volume-tiered tax system, which clearly advantages growth of the super-low segment. In the status quo, this will have a significant impact on government excise revenue this year. We concur with the public policy expert and economist that urge the government to create more predictability and a level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise tax structure and enforcing the minimum retail selling price without exception across Indonesia. Overall, while short-term challenges remain, the structural headwinds in the market are addressable through government action. The headwinds directly related to the pandemic are likely to be temporary in nature and our brands are strong, giving us a solid platform to rebuild our share. I shift now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 15.4 million total IQOS users as of June 30, compared to an estimated 14.6 million last quarter. This represents the addition of around 4 million adult users since the same time last year, a phenomenal achievement given the circumstances. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region, and Russia. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.2 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. We observe early indication that the propensity of smoker to switch to RRPs is trending positively since the pandemic began, and we will see how this develops in the coming period. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of the modified risk tobacco product order for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third largest brand in the second quarter with 6.3% share, increasing from 4.5% in Q2 2019 on the comparable market footprint. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in many markets. In the EU region, we added a record number of IQOS users in the second quarter to reach 4.3 million, an impressive performance given the context of the pandemic. This includes strong growth in Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, and in historically slower markets such as the U.K. where HTU volumes increased more than five-fold over the prior year quarter and Spain. National offtake share surpassed 1% in both of these latter markets despite limited disruption -- distribution, sorry. Second quarter share of HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, which was depressed by an estimated 0.2 points, due to consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential share increased by 0.3 point on an adjusted basis, with in-market sales volume 5% higher compared to Q1 2020. I also refer you to the appendix, where we show share for key EU markets and global key cities, which serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with its share up by 3 points to reach 5.9%. On a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2020, HEETS share decreased by 0.6 points, reflecting a higher combustible market in the quarter due to increased daily consumption in the warmer months and a trade inventory build-up ahead of the July introduction of the track-and-trace system. A more reliable indicator is a sequential in-market sales, which increased by approximately 12% compared to 3% sequential growth in the first quarter. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units reached 20% in the second quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS. IQOS user grew to an estimated total of 5.8 million, of which an estimated 4.3 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On an adjusted total tobacco view, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 18.5%. Q2 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 4.9% sequentially. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to second quarter total tobacco share of over 25%. In addition to strong RRP growth in existing markets, the geographical expansion of IQOS continues. Despite pandemic-related restriction, we leverage our digital capabilities to launch in four new markets; Austria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Saudi Arabia. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 57. Importantly, we still plan to expand our portfolio of smoke-free offering in the second half of the year with the launches of IQOS VEEV in the e-vapor category and of licensed KT&G product in select markets. To conclude on the today's presentation, our growth prospects remain strong. The continued momentum of IQOS through the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID pandemic demonstrates the structural growth characteristic of RRPs and we are on track to reach our 2021 target of 90 billion to 100 billion shipments of heated tobacco units. RRPs now make up almost 25% of our net revenue and we expect this percentage to grow over time. With digital efficiency, operating leverage from scale effect, and productivity saving simultaneously driving up the profitability of RRPs, this is a very positive dynamic for our margin outlook. The historic milestone of modified risk tobacco product authorization for IQOS is a further testament to the integrity of the product and brand proposition and underlying the need for government to implement science-based regulation. In addition, after a difficult April and May, the industry recovery has now started, providing better visibility for the rest of the year. It is also now clear that the effect of the pandemic on the Duty Free business and the specific dynamic in Indonesia will persist for at least another quarter. These factors are reflected in our expectation of sequential improvement through the second half of 2020. We assume the global economic backdrop is likely to affect total cigarette volume and induce some down-trading in certain markets. This is a dynamic we have faced before in a variety of markets where we have demonstrated robust business performance. As a reminder, we expect the unprecedented declines in Q2 2020 to reverse next year easing comparison. We also remain committed to increasing our market share through the growth of RRPs and by maintaining our leadership position in combustible. This is supported by a continued sharp focus on costs. We remain on track to deliver our target of over $1 billion in efficiency by 2021 through both manufacturing productivity and SG&A savings. We have additional opportunities on top of this from changes in our post-pandemic way of working, including the acceleration of digital activities. Importantly, our balance sheet and financial position are strong and our commitment to the dividend remains unwavering. Last, when COVID-related headwinds abate, we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rate in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning and nice to hear from you, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Babeau: Good morning.
Chris Growe: I like to -- good morning, I like to commend you for giving guidance for the year. I know there's uncertainty, but we certainly appreciate your outlook even amidst the uncertainties in the market today. So, thank you for that. I had a question if I could first of all on the -- on IQOS performance. Obviously, it was very strong in the quarter. I'd like to understand how you approached your IQOS investment. Did you pull back on that in the second quarter? Obviously, some of the stores were closed, and did you restart that in June in the third quarter? Just to understand kind of the momentum behind that product line as we move into the second half of the year.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Sure, Chris. Well, of course, IQOS remains our our top priority and we are focusing our efforts and investments behind IQOS. So, even in this challenging environment, we kept investing behind IQOS. Of course, we had to take into account the evolution of the environment and there was a number of investments that had to be postponed because they were no longer making sense. So, it was not possible to adjust and do them. There were a number of things on the commercial model that we had to revisit, and notably, when they were involving face-to-face contact. There were launches of new product that we were working on that we had to delay. So, there were clearly versus initial plan some reduction in the investment, but we absolutely stayed committed to keep increasing investment behind IQOS. I would say for me, the good thing of this Q2 and the H1 as a whole is that we see that the investments are getting an increasing return as we are, first, on that, what I would call the fixed part of the investment, the structure that we have to invest behind our RRPs and IQOS, we are growing volume. So, we amortized this investment over a larger volume and sales. So, we decreased the first, fixed cost, if you want, and we increased profitability through that. And there is also a variable part on the investment in term of consumer acquisition or retention, and here I would say through the crisis, we are of course already working on that. Wecertainly have been accelerating the usage of digital customer experience and way to engage with them in a more efficient, more digital manner, and that is going to be more scalable, that is going to reduce this variable cost per user, which is also very good news for the future of IQOS and IQOS profitability.
Chris Growe: Thank you for that, and I have just one follow-up question if I could. And in relation to pricing, which was a little stronger than I had expected in the quarter, which was great. I'm just curious, you talked about maybe delaying some pricing decisions. Are those just a delay? Have you had a pull back on pricing decisions as you've seen some down-trading in some markets? I'm just curious how that -- how you approach the pricing dynamic there?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. Well, of course, we have to take into account the environment when it comes to price increase. It is clear that in markets that are severely disrupted, where the trade is disrupted, where there is some very challenging evolution in some places because of the lockdown, we have to revisit plan for increasing price. So, it is clear that we take that into account. It doesn't change the potential of price increase that we absolutely retain and that once the COVID has passed, we will continue to implement. But clearly, in this environment, we are seeing that we were planning in a normal environment that are neither, I would say, desirable nor doable in the current environment, and that could include some delay and I think we are flagging that for Q3, where there was last year a number of price increase; and this year, I think it could be more skewed towards Q4 when things are normalizing hopefully.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for your time.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. I have three questions. Number one is that in EU, you are talking of an acceleration in June, particularly in IQOS, and we know that there was a menthol cigarette ban in May. So, was there any benefit that IQOS saw, because it is still available in flavors, especially you are highlighting Poland, which is a big menthol market? So, I was just curious on that.
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. As you all know the menthol ban came into force on the 20th of May. And really, that means that it has played over the month of June. I think it's premature to say that we have benefited from that. As you know, we have an under-exposure to the category. So, that is probably a positive evolution for us in terms of evolution of the market. I would not say that the IQOS evolution is obviously impacted by that. I cannot exclude that it has been helping a little bit, but I would say IQOS in the EU behaved well through the quarter; once again underlines the strength of IQOS in the EU through this second quarter. And I would expect probably Q3 to bring more answer on the impact of the menthol ban both on IQOS possibly and on the impact on the rest of the CC category.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. My second question is on your guidance, and your assumption is that there are no further national lockdowns during the remainder of 2020. I appreciate you are not commenting on 2021, but if we were to assume that that's the case in 2021 as well, then Q2 '20 will create a very favorable comp because you had national lockdowns in Q2 '20 and most likely there won't be. So, could there be a year in 2021 when volumes are flattish for you?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, if you allow me, I'm not going to enter now into the comment of 2021, we'll do that in due course. But I can like you come to the pure look at the fact that indeed we have a depressed Q2. We have a market Duty Free that is very severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and if things were back to normal next year, that would globally mean a favorable basis of comparison. But at this stage, I will keep with this simple fact-based possibility, if this was a scenario being confirmed, and in due course, of course, we'll share with you what it could mean for our '21 outlook, but it's too early to comment.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my last question is on your travel retail business. Can you talk a bit more in detail as to what exactly it is? Because we know travel retail is not big in U.S. and you're not there in China. So it does seem that a lot of it is probably within EU travel. So, is that what we should focus on that what are the travel dynamics within EU to be able to forecast what's happening in your travel retail business?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, EU is certainly important, but I think we have a global exposure. You're right, we're not in the U.S., we're not in China, but it doesn't mean that we're not benefiting from U.S. and Chinese travelers when they're traveling to other airport. So, EU, I would say, area is important, but our exposure is much, much broader than that, and therefore, it cannot be summarized to European exposure if you want.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. But what I was curious is that is it like 50% of your businesses is intra-EU travel or 30% or 40%, is there any way to quantify it?
Emmanuel Babeau: No. Well, I don't think we give that split, but I can tell you that this would be 12% [ph], if I was to characterize it.
Gaurav Jain: Okay, brilliant. Thanks a lot.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hello. I wanted to circle back on the new user acquisition and just hoping you could give us an update on the progress you've made on the digital front in terms of some of the virtual guided trials you mentioned and really how that's impacting consumer engagement? And then, I'd be curious to hear what percent of your new users are coming from digital at this point?
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Bonnie for the question. Of course, we can share what we can share both by the way for confidentiality reason because it's part of the recipe of the success and as we gather the information, clearly, we've been accelerating on engaging with our customers through digital. So the initial model, as you know, was first -- not only, but first center around personnel contact through shops, through coaches and engaging into explaining to smokers the benefit of switching to IQOS. Truth, it has started, we did not discover that with the COVID crisis. But, of course, in front of market that where lockdown and people confine at home, we had to accelerate the plan on digital engagement and to develop all the tools through all the digital contacts and people were, of course, at home using a lot Internet to develop full interaction and full capacity to contact first, explain, follow and, of course, using a totally remote experience for our consumer. So, I'm not able to give you and I'm not sure that we would like to share that because it's quite sensitive, but I can tell you that we see the percentage of IQOS and fully managed customer through digital, which is increasing very fast and becoming very important. And, of course, the beauty of that is that it is easily scalable at a cheaper cost, which was probably more difficult when it was a full human-related experience. And again, I think that this H1 2020 will remain a landmark for our IQOS business for a number of reason; the MRTP decision is one; the improvement on profitability on the RRP business is another one; but, certainly, the acceleration of our digital model on acquisition and on retention for our IQOS customer is another one.
Bonnie Herzog: That's really helpful color. And I think it's pretty impressive just thinking through how this has really accelerated your efforts potentially in just your learning. So, as I think about what you were able to do in the quarter and during this environment in terms of acquiring more new users than you originally expected, does it suggest that your quarterly new user rate, which has been about 1 million new users each quarter in the last several quarters, do you think that this could step up as the world starts to reopen? In other words, have you learned something new in terms of strategy to accelerate the conversion?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I would not go as far as to say that we are now at that stage coming with a vision that is going to accelerate things. But it is, certainly, confirming that our ambition is absolutely legitimate. We are confirming the 90 billion to 100 billion stick next year, and this is going to come from the continuation of a very strong acquisition of new IQOS users. No doubt that this digital play is going to help us achieving that goal, and as I said is going to do that at a cheaper cost, which is definitely good news.
Bonnie Herzog: Now that's great. And then one final question from me, if I may. I just wanted to touch on the MRTP that you received and I just want to hear from you maybe next steps in terms of -- if there are chances to get to the next level of reduced risk approval. Just wanted to understand that from [indiscernible] and then timing, possibly. And then wanted to maybe better understand how you might use what the FDA granted in terms of altering or modifying your marketing plans going forward? How you might try and include that? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Bonnie. Well, as you all can imagine, this MRTP authorization is a fantastic news and I would say both for us and for the consumers because I think it's coming as a game changer, as I know I use the word landmark. It, of course, start by validating all the scientific evidence that we have put together, and it's going to be an important element in -- and that's I think the sense of your question, how do you use this MRTP. Maybe starting with your question on the next level, of course, the FDA has left the door open to continue the dialog with them on precisely the next level. We intend to do that in the coming months. And I would say the question is whether the reduced risk authorization for marketing can come through a modified claim or through providing additional study or maybe a combination of both. That's what we intend to discuss with the FDA in the coming months and, of course, we are impatient to have this dialog with them. Now on what it means globally. Well, first of all, but it's quite important, we hope it's going to start the discussion on whether IQOS and heat-not-burn technology is a better product than combustible cigarette. I think that it's very, very important confirmation. And it really should put the focus on how we make this better alternative for the smoker as fast as possible, I would say, and in the broadest possible geographies and that's really what it means. So we think that as the FDA is recognized as a very highly regarded regulator, as they are coming from me with the right approach, where they are both dealing with review of reducing arms on tobacco-product and at the same time, the continued restriction on tobacco usage, we think that this is the right approach that we are going to be able to, I would say, share with other regulator and we are hopeful that, of course, people will look at this decision and will draw conclusion on that. Let's be clear, we already have this type of decision with several regulatory in the world. So we think it's just going to amplify that. And we are beyond the U.S., where now we have the authorization to market as a reduce exposure. We are already in other country communicating on that reduce exposure of our IQOS product. So it's going in the right direction to, I think, really define what should be the right priorities, and hopefully, it's going to accelerate things globally.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.
Robert Rampton: Hello, three questions from me. The first is on Indonesia, can you help me understand where the Indonesian market should be from a revenue perspective? If price enforcement takes place, should revenue perspective reach 2019 levels, but from a lower volume base, or is that market just going to deliver 20%? Has that revenue from that market has been rebased down 20% till the lower price tier ratio with these results [ph]? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Hi, Robert. If I understand well your question, you're asking what we should think about Indonesia beyond the COVID crisis and what we should understand. So, let's be clear, you have really two dimension that we need to explain on the situation in Indonesia. Well, the first one, of course, is everything related to the COVID crisis. To start with, remember that we started the year before the COVID crisis flagging the fact that Indonesia would be difficult in 2020. There was a double, I would say excise duty increase at the beginning of the year. We have been leading the price positioning in the market for quite a while in Indonesia and we have not been increasing price at the end of 2019. So, that's what's creating difficulty and we were saying that this difficulty would last until the minimum retail selling price is implemented. Then the COVID crisis started, and obviously, that has been creating a total disruption of the market. We have seen what we have seen in other new economy with impact on the consumption driven by daily wage worker, reducing their daily average consumption. I mean, is it 20%, 30%? Difficult to define. But that has been impacting, and as we flagged, it has been probably more impactful in urban areas than in the countryside. We have seen some down-trading as there were some pressure on purchasing power and there has been also in the regions of market some evolution to well certain category where we have a lower representation again in line with down-trading. On top of that there was this second-tier system on the excise duty due to or corresponding to low volume or supposed to be low volume company that are benefiting from a much lower excise duty and which can generate a price differential of 40% to 50% versus the Tier 1 system. So it's very substantial. We talk about a market where this cigarette of the second tier system can enjoy a significantly lower price. And, of course, at the time of down-trading consumer has been looking for cheaper alternative, and this market was supposed to stay at a very low level because this was supposed to only be granted to very small level of production. There has been some abuse on the way this has been played, and this second tier category has reached in Q2 25% of the market, which as you can imagine on something which was based on reduced volume was not at all the intention, and that has further disrupted the market. Now when we see these various headwinds that we have been facing, what can we expect? Well, first of all, regarding the minimum retail selling price implementation, it has now started. It's going to be implemented through Q3, but we don't expect really to impact in Q3, and therefore, we can expect to see the benefit of that in Q4. So that's going to be a first element that is going to improve the situation. Second, we are, of course, being active in trying to make sure that we developed our brands and we launched offer in the most dynamic part of the market, and I've been referring to Dji Sam Soe and Marlboro on which we are launching extension in dynamic part of the market. We expect globally as the COVID crisis pass and we know that next year people, economists are expecting a strong rebound of the Indonesian economy, so we expect globally also the pressure on down-trading to reduce as the economy is improving; the daily consumption to also improve, so that should help the trend. And last element that, of course, we don't control is this second tier category where we will need and we think is going to happen because otherwise, it's going to massively decrease the income of the country, but there is a need for reform to limit the benefit or change the structure of the excise duty depending on the values category. Well, at the end of the day to create level playing field and for all players to be playing on the kind of equal basis and we are certainly hoping that it's going to impact -- is going to arrive as soon as possible. If everything that I've just been described -- describing happen, well, there is no reason why we cannot rebound in Indonesia and be back to our market share that we experienced in the past years. Our brands are extremely strong. We have an incredible commercial machine in the country, and all that are, of course, the strengths on which we will build our rebound in the coming quarters.
Robert Rampton: Great, thank you. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Robert Rampton: Sorry, my next question -- my next question is on down-trading, and I know you flagged Indonesia and that you don't expect down-trading going forward, but are there any more -- can you flag which markets you have seen down-trading? Is it mostly EM [ph]?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. What we flagged is that down-trading may have accelerated in a few countries where it was probably already visible before the crisis started, so we talk about Turkey, we could talk about Mexico. These are typically in addition with Indonesia. These are the markets where we have seen I would say increased pressure on purchasing power triggering down-trading. Now for the future, of course, nobody knows what's going to be the impact of the economic crisis that everybody is forecasting. We've been there before, so that will not be the first time that we are managing a very tough environment and we have shown in the past that we have an absolute capacity to manage this kind of environment with the agility, with the headroom and with the levers to manage this kind of environment. So we would see and we will adapt to the situation.
Robert Rampton: Great. Thank you very much. That's it for me.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Can you update on the HEETS launch in Japan? And just you called out I think a little bit of mix pressure that surely would have come from that, and we saw the share gains, but maybe give us a sense of how it's tracking relative to your expectations and what sort of margin impact that has on your business there?
Emmanuel Babeau: Sure, Michael. So, probably, Japan is at the forefront of what you can expect in many countries as it get more mature, I would say, on the growth of the heat-not-burn and IQOS. I think it makes sense to have several offering for the customers. And in Japan, I think, probably, my first comment will be on the fact that the market did perform well. Clearly, in H1 and in Q2, we have been growing double-digit our shipments and end-market sales in Japan in Q2 for heat-not-burn globally. So as you can see, it's a market that continue to grow very nicely, and certainly, HEETS has been a contributor to that. So the fact that we are playing with both Marlboro and HEETS enable us to really capture maximum opportunity in the market. And we see a very, very positive trend on HEETS, which has captured close to 4% of the market. So you see that it's already a sizable part of our RRP business in Japan, and that bodes very well for what we can do with two brands in the country.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks. Could you also just clarify, in Indonesia, you gave color that in your guidance thinking you don't expect enforcement of minimum prices at least until September? As far as 4Q goes, what's your base case thinking? Is your thinking reflected in guidance that there is no enforcement all year, or is there built-in some assumption that does improve?
Emmanuel Babeau: No. What is taken in the guidance is essentially that we should have a large part of the benefit in Q4. So, we're not expecting anything in Q3, but we think a large part of the benefit of having minimum retail selling price should be seen in Q4.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. And just one last one. On Mexico, where the government has banned the import of heated tobacco devices, can you just give us a sense? You had just been getting underway there with your IQOS launch. So it's sort of maybe hitting it before hits momentum, but how you navigate that and how does that look?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. So -- you're absolutely right Michael. So the good news is that we had the right level of inventory before this ban happened. So we are not facing out of stock situation. So, of course, we hope it is not going to last too much because we are not saying that we have some devices or inventory for several years, but for the time being, it's not an issue. We are hopeful that Mexico is going to look at the FDA decision and that will influence their decision on [indiscernible]. But it's -- as you know, it's not targeted to IQOS. So we're just unfortunately here the [indiscernible] of a broader decision, if I may say. Hopefully, they will come back on that one rapidly and that will allow us to resume the export to Mexico of devices.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hi, thank you very much. I've got three questions for you. The first one is really about EPS guidance. In June, you forecasted, sorry -- in June, you forecasted EPS at below $1.10, it turned out that was wrong by about $0.20 for the quarter that ended in June. You're now giving guidance with a $0.15 range. And I just wonder why you think that range is appropriate given your inability to forecast even a month ahead accurately. So, that's the first question. It is about the range, I mean, of why...
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes. No, I understand, Adam. Thank you for the question. Well, let's face the reality of number, it's not $0.20 because what we are saying is that we have, I would say, a big half of the $0.20, as you said, that is coming from one-off factor that's going to be compensated in Q3. So it's not as if we had missed the landing, it's just that the number of fact that we could not anticipate at the beginning of June happened at the end of June and that helped the landing of Q2. Now, you're right, there is approximately $0.08 to $0.09 that we deliver above the anticipation at the beginning of June and I would say, that's -- I mean, the month of June has been very important, because in fact, we all realize that all the lockdown and the confinement last until beginning of June when things were gradually released in many, many geographies, and even if there was still a number of disruption, I think that when we look, for instance, like people not all being back to work physically, I think that we don't know when all that is going to be back to normal. So, let's assume that June was probably giving us a pretty good visibility on what we could expect for the coming months. And that's really on the basis of that that we have come to this capacity to come with this vision and guidance for the full year. So again, June has been important, the learning of June has been important and the miss has not been $0.20 but rather $0.10, and of course, the first weeks of July, as we've been saying, is confirming this kind of understanding of the environment in which we are for the time being.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Well, fine. Okay. And implicit in that answer is there won't be a sort of unexpected $0.10 movement by the end of December. And I suppose that's an interesting point. Does that mean to say that you also basically if it looks like it's going $0.10 above, you'll somehow control it, or is it that there could be at the end of December, as there was at the end of June around $0.10 movement?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, and I'm of course you know I've broken my crystal ball, so I'm not able to tell you whether this kind of thing could happen. I think we're coming with a carefully considered range for the landing with a number of scenarios behind it and I think that's encapsulating several possibility and pluses and minus, as always, when you build a guidance, and we think that this is at that stage. With all the information that we have, the right guidance and the right vision for the landing, and I'm not able to say more. If there are things that we haven't been anticipating in our various scenarios that happen, that can always happen, of course, and the last months are here to remind us that we are not able to anticipate everything, well, we'll see. But for the time being, with again all the information that we have, the June till mid-July vision, we think that this is the right guidance for the end of the year.
Adam Spielman: Okay, well, thank you very much. And it's a question that's really tough to answer than I phrase it. Can I talk about something completely different, which is the growth of margin, specifically in the RRP portfolio. So, you said in this quarter, you've been really pleased, partly because RRPs are a higher percentage of the whole business, but also within that, RRP margins have gone up, partly because you sort of moved so -- surfaced towards digital. And I guess the question is, within RRPs, how should we think about margins? So obviously, there is a whole mix thing, that's not really the question. The question is, do we think that you got to good level and yes, it will grow from now but perhaps more modestly than it does in Q2, or do you think each quarter we can see really impressive gains in RRP margins, I don't know, for the next sort of two or three years? It's a slightly long-term question, it's not a 2020 question.
Emmanuel Babeau: No, it is, Adam and it's a very fair question. Let me be start by reminding what is the model of IQOS and RRPs. It starts with the consumable that are, as you know, enjoying today higher value on the per stick basis, okay, which is absolutely intrinsic to this RRP business and that's a business on which as well versus CC, we are also improving the way we are producing, improving productivity, and therefore, when you look at the gross margin on the HTUs, there is some positive -- so we're starting from, of course, this favorable situation that I described and there is a possibility of, I would say, a positive evolution. Then, you have the devices, okay, which we've seen is a small percentage of the total, but it's a material one. And on this one, I think, we've been clear on the fact that the margin by type of device can be different, but we can accept to sometime not make money or in some condition even lose some money, because at the end of the day, it's part of the investment that we make to acquire new customers. So that's the starting point. And then below that, of course, you have the old machine to acquire in order to convert smokers to IQOS and then to retain. And on that machine as well, we're going to improve things as we are growing the top line on RRPs. We are gaining in efficiency, we use more digital, we said it, and we are, I would say, polishing the machine, increasing at the same time the strength of the engine, but also, I would say, reducing the cost of the engine. So, that's going to keep playing positively. So, I don't know whether I should take impressive and I don't know what you put behind impressive, but you should certainly expect us to keep growing the margin on the RRPs gradually in a meaningful manner as we continue to grow on IQOS and RRPs. That's certainly our objective.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Let me try and be a little bit more precise about impressive. You clearly not going to tell me or what the margin is precisely, but it's also clear the margin has grown very dramatically in '20 -- in the first half of 2020 versus last year. And so, I suppose the question is really should we expect something like a similar uplift again in 2021 on -- just on the RRP business, or is it going to be much more modest than the uplift was in 2020?
Emmanuel Babeau: Adam, I won't comment on that, whether it's going to be above, below. What I can tell you is that we believe that we have some significant headroom to keep improving margin, but I won't comment further.
Adam Spielman: Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. Thank you. My first question is on Marlboro. I appreciate the commentary around some modest down-trading that you had already been seeing in markets like Turkey and Mexico. I'm just trying to square that comment -- and those are good Marlboro markets, I'm just trying to square that commentary with the assertion that you believe that Marlboro market share will recover given its outsized exposure to social occasions. So, just wondering how much of the margin pressure do you think is really, excuse me, the market share pressure is coming from down-trading in select markets that have a high degree of exposure to Marlboro versus the social occasions? Thanks.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, I think that, you're right that you have the two drivers behind Marlboro and that has been -- Q2 has been a difficult quarter for Marlboro, has been losing some share both because of, you said it down-trading, and it's few markets where we can see that, but also I think to a large extent in many markets where Marlboro has a big market share because of the social movement that have almost entirely disappeared during Q2. And at the same time, by the way, you have market such as the Philippines, where Marlboro has been growing nicely as well. So, it's a mixed picture, I would say. It's not one direction and it's a bit more complex than that. But we are certainly confident that Marlboro is going to be able to rebound nicely first with everything around the social consumption, and we are going to certainly see some rebound as well even in countries, where we have seen down-trading during the period when the COVID crisis hopefully ease. When it comes to the down-trading, is it really Marlboro downward or more mid to low? So, I think even the real impact of, and I was talking about Philippines, which has been a market where the conversation has been difficult and despite that we've seen good evolution for Marlboro. I think Marlboro has been getting 3 points of market share in the quarter. So, it's quite good. So, I would say, when we talk about down-trading, I'm not sure that this has been the main impact on Marlboro, but rather again, down-trading is rather mid-pricing going to lower pricing, and the biggest impact on Marlboro we see is this absence of social moment where Marlboro is an important brand. So, we hope that will enable a good and fast rebound for the brand.
Vivien Azer: That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is on the IQOS development and looking quickly at your number of users and juxtaposing that against your volumes, it seems like perhaps there is a little bit of degradation in terms of average volumes per user. Is that a function of just new countries coming online and you need consumers to ramp their perhaps consumption or is there like a structural shift in terms of per capita consumption in new geographies in combustible cigarettes that would translate into HeatSticks relative to existing IQOS geographies? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, Vivien, I'm not sure that we have any information that would clearly point to that. We know that Q2 has been impacted globally in the tobacco market by a lot of disruption that has been potentially influencing the daily consumption and that maybe in some markets, it can have an impact on few markets for IQOS, but frankly, we have no data and nothing pointing to that based on all the data that we have on Q2.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: I just wanted to ask how you are thinking about the puts and takes of the current excise tax environment. There has been a number of developments during the quarter, including the Saudi Arabia VAT increase and Germany VAT reduction. So, what is the impact of these tax changes? And are you passing them through to consumers? And I guess looking forward, what is your outlook for excise taxes as a result of the economic environment and what did you see in the past following prior economic downturns?
Emmanuel Babeau: Yes, thank you for the question. So, as a general rule, yes, we are passing on this tax evolution whether on excise duty or VAT, that's a general rule. But maybe more important is the comment on what we can expect for the coming quarters in term of evolution of the tax environment. Well, it is true and that's certainly the sense behind your question that many countries are going to face higher deficit -- budget deficit because of the crisis and the temptation could be there to try to find way to finance it. First of all, this type of decision is usually made in the fourth quarter of the year. So, probably end of the Q3, beginning of Q4. So we know more at the time. But I have the feeling that versus maybe what happened in 2008-2009, here, the environment is quite different and many governments are rather trying not to depress the consumption and you know that when you increase price, at the end of the day, you're not too sure about the net impact you're going to get on your -- on the money that you're going to receive. And therefore, it remains to be seen what's going to be the decision in term of tax increase of all nature. I think it's not clear. Well, if it was the case, as I said, we've seen that in the past in 2008/2009 as -- again, there is probably a different way to approach the crisis, as seen a lot of excise duty increase in many countries and I think we've shown our capacity to, of course, weather this kind of environment, and I would say, overcome this kind of headwind and we have no doubt that if it was the case, we would do that again. But, and I reiterate my but, it could be quite different this time and that is at least what we are hearing from a number of politicians and governments.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. And then I was wondering if you could provide more color on the trends that you saw exiting the second quarter. You highlighted that there was a particular recovery in Europe. And can you comment on what trends you're seeing across other regions? And then, I guess more broadly, how are you thinking about the volume trends across markets in your 7% to 9% industry volume forecast for this year? I guess what are the differences between emerging and developed markets and the drivers behind that forecast?
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, sure. I should probably be back to what we've been sharing about our expectation for Q3. So, we are, as we said in June and first weeks of July, seeing a kind of gradual improvement of the market, the global lockdown are over. We -- doesn't mean that we are back to normal, but as I said, we start to see the market operating maybe in a more consistent manner and with a bit less disruption. So, that is a trend that we've been flagging on June, but -- so that is why we are saying that we expect for Q3, net revenue that will be in sequential improvement versus Q2. So, that's exactly what is behind our vision for the rest of the year. It doesn't mean that we're going to be back on the growth year-on-year, and also, of course, in addition to that, we have some negative impact coming from H1 that's going to play on the top line and we said about 1% in Q3, but we are going to continue to see in Q3 some year-on-year negative evolution because lot of market remain extremely disrupted, and of course, I've been talking about Duty Free, Indonesia, but many other markets are going to be disrupted because of the COVID crisis, because of the restriction, because of potentially some impact on the economy. So, all that is going to play and impact us. I'm not going to enter into trajectory by market, but certainly we would expect the mature economy and that's probably what we've seen in -- at the end of the quarter to show some good resilience in this environment and maybe less disruption versus a new economy. That would be in the ballpark our feeling. And then, if we enter Q4, as we said, we continue to expect an improvement on net revenue for Q4 versus Q2 -- Q3, so sequentially, we're going to keep improving the net revenue number, but nevertheless, Q4 could still be negative year-on-year. And so, we really have to make the difference between the quarter-on-quarter trend, the sequential trend and then the year-on-year comparison.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. And just my last question. Russia has been an important market for IQOS growth. Can you comment on what you're anticipating from the economic environment and its impact on IQOS adoption in Russia? And what has been the performance for your super premium HeatSticks launch? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, IQOS has been doing very well in Russia in Q2 in this environment. So it's, of course, I cannot say that there was no impact from the disruption, some lockdown in Russia, but we continue to grow share for IQOS and we are pleased with the evolution of our RRP in this market. Altogether, the Russian market has probably been impacted but in a minor way by the evolution. So, when you look at the volume, it was down, it was not with a strong acceleration in the underlying decline in volume that we have seen in Q2. So, that's a market that has resisted pretty well through this COVID crisis, and again, we are very pleased with the IQOS development. I'm not going to elaborate on what is going to be the trend in the next two quarters. We expect the IQOS market share to keep growing and that we're going to continue to perform well on IQOS. The good news is that we also maintain market share in CC at the same time. So, that was a nice achievement.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Good afternoon and hope you all well. I'll keep this very quick. So, I just wanted to come back to the sequential industry volume improvement in the EU in June. I was just wondering is it possible to break that out between cigarettes and IQOS and what was the main driver there? Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Well, yes, indeed we have seen in June, with the end of the lockdown in many countries, an improvement of the trend. I would say IQOS has been doing well, as we said, through the quarter. So, of course, we've seen some acceleration in June, but the whole quarter has been good for IQOS, and clearly, we have seen some acceleration in the CC business, which has been quite impacted by the lockdown in some geographies and we've seen some improvement in June. All markets are not being equal, and notably, the markets that are impacted by lower tourism have been more penalized and I talk about Southern Europe here. Of course, the markets typically see a lot of purchase being made abroad and a lot of cross-border activity with the border being closed. I mean, they've been globally doing better through the quarter. So, this is a kind of trend that we have seen in Europe.
Owen Bennett: Okay, very helpful. Thanks very much.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you.
Operator: And that was our final question. I'll turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again. Stay well and have a great day. Thank you.
Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. And thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app.A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, additional heated tobacco unit market data and our business transformation metrics are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products.Comparisons are presented on a like-for-like basis reflecting pro forma 2019 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc., effective March 22, 2019.Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please note we now also include additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19.It’s now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer and Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, both of whom will be available for the question-and-answer session. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. These are unprecedented times for all of us, and I hope everyone listening, and their families, are safe and well. I would also like to express our deep appreciation for the life-saving efforts of medical, social and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.Our main focus at this time is on the health and wellbeing of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate. We have implemented stringent policies and measures to minimize risks for those who continue to work in our facilities and offices.For all our employees, including those working from home, providing guidance and support is also essential. We recently announced a new set of guiding principles to reassure employees of the Company’s commitment to job security throughout the global pandemic period in three areas: Employment stability; financial stability; and special recognition.The strength and spirit shown in these challenging times by the people that make up our organization is a real inspiration to me and the Philip Morris International management team, and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank them for their outstanding efforts.Indeed, our people continue to generate ideas on how they and PMI can contribute skills and resources to the wider societal effort. Ongoing and planned initiatives in more than 60 countries include providing protective equipment to our trade partners, support to care communities, procurement support to purchase items essential to fight against COVID-19, and financial support to institutions and non-government organizations working to end this crisis. In addition, our employees in many countries are volunteering to help elderly, low-income, and other at-risk populations, and some of our factories are producing hand sanitizer and masks for their local communities. Lastly, but very importantly, we have also taken steps to ensure the continuity of supply to our customers and consumers, and to support our suppliers through these challenging times.Let me now comment on the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business and outlook before I hand over to Martin, who will cover this impact and the performance in the quarter in more detail.We started the year with a very strong first quarter, with minimal disruption to business performance and continued structural growth momentum. While we have had a number of temporary shutdowns at different manufacturing facilities and some additional complexities in our route-to-market, we have activated contingency plans, where required, to ensure sufficient inventories and consumer access to our products. Allied to a healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, our ability to generate cash will allow us to continue investing in our business, retire maturing debt and pay dividends.Turning to the outlook. The inherent uncertainty in the global economic picture makes forecasting much more challenging than usual. With social isolation measures placing day-to-day life on hold for much of the world’s population, this temporarily impacts our operating environment. The most direct effect is on Duty-Free sales due to reduced travel, with additional impacts from delayed IQOS user acquisition and regulatory price enforcement in Indonesia. In total, this is likely to have a negative impact on our 2020 currency-neutral performance, with recent exchange rate movements a further drag.As visibility on the duration and extent of lockdown measures across the world is extremely limited, we are withdrawing our annual forecast and replacing it with quarterly guidance, where visibility is relatively better. Martin will talk through the key moving parts, and our EPS guidance for the second quarter, when the most impact is likely to be felt.We are confident the strong momentum on IQOS user acquisition shown in recent quarters will start to resume as restrictions ease. In the meantime, our digital and commercial engine allows us to serve our existing adult consumers, maximize the conversion of adult smokers under the prevailing circumstances, and tailor our investments as required to optimize costs.There is also considerable uncertainty as to the magnitude of the economic consequences of the current situation and the speed and shape of the recovery, including the impacts on disposable incomes and unemployment. While it is too early to fully assess potential effects on market dynamics in terms of consumption and down-trading, we have to assume there will be some impact. We also sense, in certain developing countries, difficulties in ensuring business continuity for some smaller general trade players, which may lead to localized out-of-stocks. However, as in previous times of economic and social turbulence, we expect to show resilient performance through these challenges. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, André.I’ll start with a headline summary of our first quarter performance, which was very strong in terms of like-for-like ex-currency growth before any pandemic impact. We estimate COVID-19 effects, primarily distributor and trade inventory movements, accounted for 2 points of net revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted operating income margin and 6.8 points of adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.Heated tobacco unit shipment volume grew 45% to 16.7 billion units, reflecting continued broad-based share gains. Total combined shipment volume decreased by a modest 0.6% on a like-for-like basis, benefiting from inventory movements. Currency-neutral net revenues grew by 10%, reflecting the volume growth and positive geographic mix of HTUs, in addition to a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%. This robust revenue growth, combined with a positive margin mix, scale effects of higher HTU volumes, cost efficiencies and cost phasing drove a 510 basis-point increase in our adjusted currency-neutral operating income margin, and30.1% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS.This excellent start to the year, with encouraging progress in both our combustible and reduced-risk product businesses, is particularly important as we consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.While we expect our core existing operations to continue performing well, there are three main areas of expected impact from temporary changes to our operating environment, in addition to the impact of currency movements, which I’ll come back to. The first, and likely longest in duration, is on Duty-Free sales, due to severely curtailed global travel. For context, PMI Duty-Free, with a market share of 37%, contributed almost 4% of our 2019 net revenues. It also enjoys higher unit margins relative to the global average, given the skew to premium brands such as Marlboro and HEETS. Consumer offtake trends exited March with declines of over 80%, and we expect similar trends to continue until travel starts to recover.Due to the premium skew of our Duty-Free sales, we assume that only a portion of the volume will be recovered by our own brand portfolio in local markets, usually at lower margins.The second impact is on the rate of IQOS user acquisition. Lockdown measures and other restrictions hamper our ability to engage adult smokers. Our IQOS retail touch-points are currently closed in a number of markets, and even where open, retail footfall is significantly down. Our investments in digital capabilities over recent quarters are now coming into their own, and we are reallocating further commercial spend to digital where required. Our commercial sales experts and coaches, although very limited in terms of physical consumer engagement, have a number of tools at their disposal to conduct virtual guided trials. However, based on trends since lockdown measures were introduced, we expect our rate of user acquisition to be on average around 50% lower than previously anticipated, for as long as widespread restrictions continue. Variations by country also make the mix difficult to project. To be clear, we believe this is delayed rather than lost growth and we expect the strong underlying momentum witnessed in recent quarters to pick up as restrictions ease. Importantly, given our digital capabilities, we do not expect customer retention or conversion rates to be affected.For illustrative purposes, each 1 million users acquired have an annualized consumption of around 5 billion heated tobacco units and, using pre-COVID market mix including device sales and cannibalization effects, would generate on average over $350 million in net revenues and over $200 million in incremental contribution.We are also able to flex our commercial initiatives, and accordingly the timing of plans for IQOS VEEV, our improved e-vapor product, and the licensed KT&G products later this year could be delayed depending on how events unfold.The last main area of impact is in Indonesia. As explained previously, 2020 was already a year of catch-up on excise tax and pricing. A positive structural element of the new excise tax was a larger percentage increase at the mid-to-low segment of the market, with a new minimum retail selling price due to come into effect on April 1st. However, the government has now said the enforcement of the new minimum price is delayed until June, due to COVID-19 restrictions. The prolonging of unfavorable price gaps is an added headwind for the risk of down-trading, the timing of price increases and for our market share.While the effects of pandemic-related measures on our operating environment, such as travel restrictions, are tangible, there is greater uncertainty as to the social and economic impact on consumer purchasing behavior during the crisis.In developed markets, like the EU region or Japan, which tend to have strong social support programs, we have so far observed only a limited impact. There have been instances of pantry-loading in certain markets around the introduction of restrictions. However, these have been generally short-lived in nature and had a minimal impact on Q1 performance, with distributor and trade inventory movements being the bigger influence.In certain developing markets, the high prevalence of daily wage workers, lower resources for social support and thus greater fragility of incomes create more vulnerability. We observe some initial signs of down-trading and reduced daily consumption in some countries. The most significant for us are Indonesia and the Philippines, the latter of which has the added dynamic of being a stick market. We have to assume these trends will temporarily continue while pandemic-driven restrictions last.As André mentioned, given less developed route-to-market infrastructure, we also sense potential difficulties in certain emerging markets for some smaller general trade outlets, which may lead to temporary localized out-of-stocks.Our own manufacturing and distribution operations continue to function well despite current challenges. This is made possible by the incredible efforts of our supply chain and market teams, who have implemented a number of contingency measures with regard to production and customer supply. On average, inventories of our products remain healthy, with over two months for heated tobacco units, over three months on IQOS devices and over one and a half months for cigarettes, including distributors.After the one week suspension of production at our Bologna HTU facility in late March, all our HTU factories are currently operating with sufficient capacity. Around 20% of our cigarette production capacity is currently affected by temporary shutdowns. However, we do not currently foresee any out-of-stocks in major operating income markets. One watch-out is Argentina, where we will be facing out-of-stocks if the factory does not reopen soon.Given investor focus on the liquidity of listed companies in the current environment, I want to highlight our robust position. We continue to have ample liquidity sources through the ongoing cash generation of our business, cash on hand and access to commercial paper. Our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.Our balance sheet remains strong with a well-laddered bond portfolio and net debt of 1.9 times adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2020. We repaid $3.6 billion of maturing bonds during the first quarter and distributed a total of $3.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in January and April.We also expect that strong cash flows will exceed cash requirements, including the funding of dividends, to which we remain fully committed. Our ability to invest appropriately in our business and retire debt is fully intact. However, further deleveraging of our balance sheet, at prevailing exchange rates, may be somewhat delayed versus our previous expectations.It’s also worth mentioning that our cost efficiency programs continue, and that we remain well on track to deliver over $1 billion in efficiencies by 2021. These programs are also flexible, and we are reprioritizing activities as events unfold. Related to this, we expect to reduce capital expenditures to approximately $0.8 billion for the year, with the reduction unrelated to RRP investments.We turn now to guidance. As covered in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our previous reported diluted full-year 2020 EPS forecast of at least $5.50, which absent COVID-19, our business was well on track to deliver. However, as we stand today, there is simply not enough visibility on the duration or extent of lockdown and social isolation measures, and their wider consequences, to provide a sufficiently reliable full-year earnings estimate. Given comparatively better short-term visibility, we are therefore introducing quarterly guidance, one quarter forward, in its place.As previously flagged, we already expected a weak second quarter, notably due to an unfavorable prior year comparison, market dynamics in Indonesia, and cost phasing. We also expect the biggest quarterly impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to occur in the period, which we additionally factor in.Consequently, we expect Q2 2020 reported diluted EPS to be in a range of $1 to $1.10. This forecast assumes unfavorable impacts of $0.12 for currency, at prevailing rates, reflecting the devaluation of many of our operating currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, notably including the Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah and Mexican peso; $0.10 for inventory movements, primarily reversals from the first quarter; $0.09 for lost Duty-Free sales, net of domestic sales recapture, assuming no recovery in global travel in the period; and $0.05 to $0.15 for the delay in Indonesia minimum price enforcement and other COVID-19 related factors, including temporary reductions in daily consumption and down-trading in certain developing markets. These assumptions also reflect ex-currency net revenue declines of approximately 8% to 12%, with the expected decline being wholly attributable to COVID-19 related impacts, including on device sales.Let me now run through some of the main elements of our first quarter performance. We estimate the total international industry declined 2.9% in the period. However, we recorded a total like-for-like shipment volume decline of only 0.6%, with cigarette declines of 3.8%, largely offset by the impressive 45.5% growth of heated tobacco units, with notable contributions from the EU region, Japan and Russia.Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume declined by 3.7%. Inventory movements reflect two main factors: Firstly, the prior year comparison where shipment volumes in Q1, 2019 were below in-market sales; and secondly, net distributor inventory build-up in Q1 2020 to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 related disruption.Importantly, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 3.9% sequentially versus the fourth quarter, reaching over 17 billion units in what is typically the lowest volume quarter of the year. This strong performance means that heated tobacco units now make up nearly 10% of our total shipment volume, as compared to 8% in 2019, and almost nothing in 2015. We expect this proportion to grow further as our positive momentum on RRPs continues.Turning to our financial results. Net revenues increased by 10% excluding currency, driven by pricing in combustibles, a favorable comparison versus Q1 2019 and growth in heated tobacco units. We estimate the COVID-19 effect of higher trade inventories and, to a lesser extent, consumer pantry-loading contributed around one-fifth of the growth in net revenues, operating income and EPS.We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%, with no significant impact of COVID-19 and notable contributions from the GCC, Germany, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey.Adjusted operating income increased by 25.5% ex-currency, while currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 510 basis points. This strong margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for HTUs. Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles, cost phasing and the underlying impact of cost initiatives.Adjusted diluted EPS increased strongly, growing by 30.1% excluding currency. With regard to currency, we should point out that the unfavorable impact of $0.13 in the first quarter includes $0.07 of transactional impact occurred in March, primarily from the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in certain markets, such as Russia, where the local currency has seen a significant devaluation. Such effects would only recur in future quarters if further sharp devaluations took place.RRP net revenues reached $1.6 billion, or close to 22% of PMI’s total net revenues, with IQOS devices accounting for approximately 10% of RRP net revenues.Turning now to market share. Our total international share was slightly lower to 27.9%, with higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.9%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 1.1 points reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS and lower share notably in Argentina and Indonesia, due to price gaps with tax-advantaged local competitors, trade inventory movements in Pakistan and an unfavorable prior year comparison in Turkey.Let’s turn to Indonesia, where industry volumes declined by only 0.6% in the first quarter due to trade loading effects, which are likely to reverse in the second quarter. Pricing was taken on all main premium and mid-price brands, with PMI price increases since October of 2019 representing approximately 85% of the weighted-average pass-on of the 2020 excise increase. Our share declined, despite a recovery in premium A Mild due to smaller price gaps with directly competitive brands. These gains were outweighed by our mid and low-priced brands, which lost share to super-low price manufacturers who are tax advantaged due to smaller scale.It follows that the delay in the enforcement of the minimum selling price extends this temporary share headwind. The prevalence of daily wage workers in Indonesia also introduces some uncertainty as to the effects of social restrictions on daily consumption. As such, we have to assume the total market decline will be higher than our previous estimate of 6% to 7%.Turning now to RRP performance. We estimate that there were 14.6 million total IQOS users as of March 31st, representing the addition of more than 4 million adult users since the same time last year. We further estimate that 73% of this total or 10.6 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, Russia and the EU.The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third-largest tobacco brand in the first quarter with 6.6% share, increasing from 5.5% in Q4 2019. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets.In the EU region, first-quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, with an estimated 0.2 points due to consumer pantry-loading. On a sequential basis, share growth was also very strong, increasing by 0.7 points, with in-market sales volume 13% higher compared to Q4 2019, despite a typically lower quarter. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares by key EU market and global key cities.IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia, with HEETS share up by 3.5 points to reach 6.5%. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2019, HEETS share increased by 1.5 points, while in-market sales increased by 3%. With limited social restrictions in Russia in the period, there was minimal estimated impact of pantry-loading.In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2.1 points to reach 19.1% in the first quarter, supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in our Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line-ups.On an adjusted total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share of our HTU brands increased by 1.1 points versus the prior year quarter, and by 0.6 points sequentially, to 17.7%.Q1 2020 adjusted in-market sales volumes for our HTU brands grew 6.2% compared to an adjusted total tobacco market which declined by around 1%. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a first-quarter total tobacco share of over 24%.Lastly, following the 2019 launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria, in March, we submitted a supplemental PMTA for the IQOS 3 device to the FDA to further support the efforts to convert U.S. adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke. FDA’s review of the Company’s Modified Risk Tobacco Product applications for the IQOS tobacco heating system, which is separate from this PMTA application, continues.Let me now hand back to André for closing remarks. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Martin.In summary, the continued strong underlying momentum in our business, especially the impressive growth of reduced-risk products, is again evident in our first quarter results.The world has clearly now changed, with considerable uncertainty as to the development and duration of the pandemic and its economic and social consequences, including those which impact our operating environment and our consumers.Our business has historically proven remarkably resilient, and we believe we can deliver a solid performance under the current challenging circumstances. Importantly, we remain confident in our structural mid-term growth prospects and, when these headwinds have passed, expect to resume growth consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex-currency growth targets of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted earnings per share growth.Crucially, our organization, liquidity and balance sheet are strong. We will continue to protect and support our employees, serve our consumers and reward our shareholders, which clearly includes our strong commitment to our dividend.We remain resolute in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that we’ll emerge stronger from this crisis.Thank you. Martin and I are happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Thank you for the question, and I hope you are all doing well.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Pam.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. I was hoping to get an update on where you’re seeing the most significant impact on new IQOS user growth in 2020. And is there any markets that are surprising you in terms of the resilience of IQOS performance in the current backdrop? And then, separately, are you seeing a negative impact on IQOS usage among existing users?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Let me take a minute to give some context here on what we’re going to discuss during the call. Okay? The first thing is that we do not see any structural business fundamentals kind of problem. It’s more delays, slowdowns, as you mentioned, in the acquisition, and one-offs during the duration of the pandemic. The second thing, we have assumed that in this quarter, because that’s where we can see, we’ll have lockdowns continuing essentially through the end of April and the vast part of May with some gradual recovery during the month of June, and then it continues. Okay? So, that’s important to remember when we discuss the context.So, what we observe with a high degree of certainty is that Duty-Free impact because there’s no traveling essentially worldwide.The second thing we’ve seen to your point, Pam, is a slowdown in the acquisition of IQOS. That varies market to market obviously because some have stricter restrictions and others much less. So, we have big differences I would say between Japan, who are almost operating with normality with some slowdown and Europe, where we have more slowdown as physically our coaches cannot engage with people and our stores are closed today. So, that’s why I’m saying on average we are around 50%, sometimes higher. Okay? So, I find this, given the circumstances are that the people are confined at home to be very resilient actually, especially since as I said, stores are closed and the coaches cannot physically interact with people, and that’s the right thing to do.We see a much bigger increase -- a high sales through our digital channels. And as Martin said, we’re gearing more and more resources from the other channels obviously to those. That’s for acquisition.For retention, we don’t see any problem. Actually in certain markets, we see people increasing average daily consumption and retention rate and some of dual use being reduced during this period. So, there is no issue from that perspective. And we don’t have also an issue regarding the sales of IQOS, heat to tobacco unit in the market. So, I don’t know if I answer your question.
Pamela Kaufman: Yes. Thank you.
Martin King: I’d just add to that. Pam, we’re also not seeing any drop-off in conversion rates. Conversion rates, in fact, they’re looking quite strong. So, the underlying business and retaining consumers and conversion consumer is going great. Obviously, your ability to have the face to face interaction has little bit slowed down, but we’re switching as fast as we can to more digital channels.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then, how should we think about the balance between your planned cost savings realization for this year and the investments that you’re making in the business to drive IQOS adoption? Are there delays in your cost savings plans? And I guess, how are you thinking about changes in timing of your investments and what you’re investing behind?
Martin King: The first principle that we’ve undertaken is that our investments need to align in the new situation. In other words, we are, if anything, putting more money into those aspects which will help us recover momentum and get back to growth as soon as the lockdown ends. Hence the focus on where we can add some investment around digital and around the programs which will have a bigger impact later. But clearly, we’ve gone through our projects as well to see which ones are hampered by our inability to operate right now and need to be retimed and move some of the spending further later in the year or even into the next year. And we’ve also looked again at our list of projects to prioritize the ones that maybe had not as good a return and try to mitigate some of the impacts of what we’re seeing from the COVID-related.So, overall, our cost savings are on track. If anything, we will accelerate some as we can. And then, our investments part is also lining up to the new situation and giving us the biggest bang for our buck. So, we are looking long term and looking towards the growth momentum that we can attain as we come out of this.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman, Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hello. Thank you very much. So, I have three questions, if I may. The first one is about illicit and cross border. So, I am a little bit surprised -- or rephrase it. I would have expected the clampdown on borders and transport to result in much reduced illicit figure adds and also legal cross border. And I would have thought that would be quite a positive impact in Q2 and Q3. But, you haven’t mentioned it. So, I guess, am I wrong or is that a positive impact? How should we think about that? That’s the first question.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Again, Adam, some of these things we try to lay out are based on observations. And you’re right. Our markets report some reduction in illicit trade for the reasons you mentioned. Now, we cannot cautiously take the European Union has 10% illicit trade and say this is going to all disappear and appear in the domestic market. So, we may see some, but -- and reasonably so. But, I’m not sure we have taken this all in the number because we are just three weeks essentially in the month of April. And I prefer to remain a bit cautious. But you are right. We are observing this and we should see some impact.
Adam Spielman: Okay. That’s very helpful. Next question is on Indonesia. You -- obviously, the minimum price was going to be imposed on April 1st. You’ve now talked about that being delayed till June, but I noticed you didn’t give a specific date. Is it possible -- or how likely do you think it is that if it’s delayed further -- if we see really quite a nasty recession in Indonesia?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I’ll ask -- generally, what we know is the government said that because they cannot send inspectors out to inspect physically outlets because of the COVID, they have to delay and they gave a date. That is June. That’s not any firm date in June. So, if they get out of a situation or restrictions earlier, I assume they will do it earlier. If it continues, it may continue a bit longer. That’s why we have uncertainty in this whole as a matter of principle. Now, I don’t know, if Martin you want to add something?
Martin King: It’s exactly right. It’s a matter of when they can get out there and start inspecting. It’s not a matter of not wanting to do it. It’s purely for their issue with their inspectors.
André Calantzopoulos: Now, in Indonesia, we have these, and obviously in Indonesia -- is in the category of these developing markets. Martin mentioned in his remarks and myself that we have a lot of casual -- or many people work on a daily salary essentially. And if they can’t work, clearly their consumption has to adjust to the situation. So, we have to assume here that we may have some impact also on consumption coming from COVID. Other Southeast Asian markets can be impacted; Africa as well. So, we observe this phenomenon. And we had to make a forecast in our numbers of what that impact is going to be. You all appreciate it is rather difficult.And if I take, for example, a market we know very well, like the Philippines, this confinement clearly has some impact also in daily consumption. Also, it’s a very broad trade with very small players, sometimes they run out-of-stock. And if we take markets with stick sales also, if we have an average stick sale -- an average consumption of sticks of or 9 per day, you go to 8 that’s a 10%, 11% impact temporarily on the market. Now, how precise to be on this? I don’t know. That’s why we gave a broad range in these areas; I think some will happen. The people are not going to be immune to the confine. That’s why we try to bake some numbers in. And I think it’s reasonable to assume it at this stage. If it’s better, it’s better.Third question?
Adam Spielman: Do you just -- following up on that André. So, I hear people with -- I’m not talking about Europe, which is obviously much more profitable for you. I hear people -- some people saying, people at home would smoke more, they’re anxious, they’re bored, they are not traveling that end up smoking more. And I hear other people saying they smoke less because they’re concerned about the impact on possibly catching this disease. Do you have a view of sort of what individual consumption will do? I’m thinking more developed markets than EMs now in the lockdown?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, in the developed markets, we don’t see any impact on consumption. You appreciate these early days and you don’t have data on it, granular consumer research. But all of the elements you outlined are correct. Technically, people staying home have more opportunities than when they are in the offices for the people that work in offices. But, we don’t -- should not forget in certain countries, you are with family and children. So, also you have to be a bit more respectful, so one may compensate the other. That’s why we don’t see any change in the pattern at this stage. But, we all need to appreciate guys that I think we’ve been through many crisis and difficulties. But having people confined at home and not going out is not a situation we have ever faced. And some adjustments may happen in the daily consumption. I don’t think that structure or anything else. We know that markets recover cigarettes after crisis, but this I have no experience to be very surgically precise.But everything you described is correct. And if we go to developed market -- developing market, I mean, we also saw in some countries, as I said, more IQOS used at home, okay, because people are more respectful of families and children and so on. So, that’s where we are today in the developing markets, as I said. Okay. We also need to know, in some cultures, smoking in front of parents and some women may be less -- more reluctant to fully consume. That’s compensated obviously, as you say, by some opportunities more. So, all-in-all, that’s the best estimate we can make today. And I’m trying to be as transparent as possible on what we know at this stage.
Adam Spielman: Thank you very much. Final question, just very quickly. In the spirit of transparency, I know you’re not giving EPS guidance for full year, but can you maybe say what the FX impact would be? I mean, should we just see the $0.13 in Q1 and $0.12 you’ve guided to for Q2 and then put another two quarters of $0.12? Is that how should we -- should think about the FX for the full year on EPS?
Martin King: Adam that’s pretty close to Q2 estimate of $0.12. It will be roughly that in Q3 and Q4 at prevailing exchange rates, $0.11 to $0.12 something like that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Thank you for all the detailed commentary. I just wanted to double back to André some of your comments on down trading. Obviously, this is get a market by market commentary. But, I’m just curious, in any market where you’ve seen it pretty apparently. Has it happened faster than say like the last financial crisis or if it was an Asian market relative to a SARS or any other kind of market disruption that you’ve seen? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, first of all, the only down-trading we can say we’ve seen is the continuation of what’s happening in Indonesia due to the price gaps. Okay? Here in my assumption that some may happen. Now, on one side, you say some people, if they have less disposable income for a period of time, and I’m still referring to developing countries, they may down trade for a period of time. On the other side, we know in periods of uncertainty, especially the current one, people go for trusted brands from safe sources and they tend to trust the known brands. So, that’s contradicting what I said previously and you need to find the right balance. That’s the same thing is about illicit trade. It’s not only availability of illicit trade, there is also no trust in the sources of illicit trade that may reduce it. Because there is this tendency to buy what is essential and what is trusted. So, I assume some down-trading. I’m not saying I’ve seen it. Okay?
Vivien Azer: That’s helpful. Thank you. And as you think about kind of the quarter-to-quarter guidance, Martin, that you’re going to be offering, implicit in there it seems like you guys are taking an appropriately conservative approach around volumes and changes in per capita consumption. Can you comment at all around the underlying assumptions around price elasticity embedded in your 2Q EPS guidance? Thanks.
Martin King: Yes. I mean, when you look at the second quarter for example, we already had expected a pretty weak second quarter due to the dynamics out there on how we were wrapping pricing in Turkey for example where you had a big market gains before in the previous comparable periods against a 40% price increase that we’ve had since then. We were looking at Mexico with the different timing on the price increase and the way the trade inventory we were working being a pretty big headwind. So, we already had looked at Indonesia. We knew that the big impact was coming in Q2. So, the Q2 guidance we’re giving is actually if you unpick it, it’s actually what we had expected before it’s purely the COVID-related. We would have ended up without COVID after the first half being right on track with our full year numbers and hitting 9.5%, 10% EPS growth, right in with what we had thought we would end up for the full year.So, when you go forward and say what are we going to do for the rest of the year? We’re going to basically be giving you each quarter one quarter ahead, what the COVID-related impacts are and trying to adjust to new news around lockdown timings and recoveries from consumers and so forth. And that’s what we thought was more prudent, given that the underlying business is in fine shape or doing exactly what we thought. But it’s very difficult to predict how this COVID-related piece is coming out. So, we can’t really give you the full-year look right now, but we can give you each quarter ahead as best we predict what will happen given the latest news that we have.
Vivien Azer: Understood. And then, just a follow-up on that and then I’ll drop back into queue. As you think about the COVID specific related impacts to 2Q, are you assuming a degradation in price elasticity just given some of the potential headwinds to the consumer, given unemployment rate?
Martin King: No, we have some -- as André mentioned, we have some watch-outs in there, around average daily consumption, around down-trading in certain markets. But, it’s not really a price elasticity point of view. As far as pricing goes -- price timing, we have to be cognizant that in the case of lockdowns and in certain periods, it may not be wise to take some of the pricing at exactly the same timing we had in the original plan. So, we will have to look at the timing of pricing in certain markets. In some markets, we will likely need to delay some planned pricing. On the other hand, we will look forward out into the year and see what we can do to try to compensate for that. So, it’s more around timing of price increases that have to be rephased and rescheduled. And there may be -- likely will be some lower total pricing during the year than what we had originally planned just because you run out of runway, as you give up some of the windows due to the lockdowns, et cetera. You run out of runway to make up for some of the pricing that you will not be able to take over the next, say couple of weeks, months because of lockdown.
André Calantzopoulos: I mean, all they are assumptions at this stage, but they’re not relating to price elasticity, in my view. It’s restating to do you go, and will governments allow that you take in one or two places a price increase in the middle of a crisis, I don’t think psychologically from a consumer point of view is a right thing. So, these are a couple of months or a month delay. But in the vast majority of the places, we don’t see any price elasticity in the short-term. Now, in the long run, I don’t know what the impact of COVID is going to be on the world economy. But, if the world GDP comes down substantially for a longer period of time, you may need to revise elasticities. But as you know, in cigarettes, it is very rare that we need to revise elasticities, except in very big price increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: So, I have a couple of questions. So, one is just on your -- the supply chain and your factory footprint inventory levels. Do you think the current crisis changes the way you think on those issues long term?
André Calantzopoulos: That’s a very good question but doesn’t only apply to us. Okay? I’ve said it many times. Resilience equals a little bit of redundancy in the system in general. And thank God, we had inventories and we had action plans to obviously build inventory, so we saw the crisis arrive and materials and everything necessary to make it happen. Not sure that’s the case for every business with just in time deliveries and trying to -- so, I think that would be a learning here for everybody.Now, as you know, in our business, as I said, we operate with fairly large inventories of tobacco, by the nature of the business, and we have the capability and the flexibility to build sufficient inventory. I think I don’t see anything that we should revise at this stage on our footprint, given the fact also that in cigarettes, we are limited by trade blocks and input duties. So, we think it’s rather optimal. But as a cautionary principle because I don’t think COVID will disappear in one afternoon, it will come back, we have-to-have the caution that this may be repeated at the scale it was repeated this time because we were absolutely not ready as humanity for that. But we have to take our own conclusions of how build even more flexibility in the system. So far, I think we’ve done pretty well. And you don’t see what is behind the scenes on keeping everything flowing. I think, the guys in the Company have been miracles, given the circumstances.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. My next question is just on IQOS device pricing. Do you think the upfront pricing will become an issue to acquire new consumers in a recessionary environment?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think, we can adjust the pricing obviously when necessary. My view is, pricing plays a role in the IQOS acquisition. But as I said many times, it’s also a lot about convincing people to make the step. And sometimes pricing is the excuse. If you remember the remarks we made in February, the only place we can really see, they need both to have a tiered system in terms of device pricing. And at a certain stage in terms of consumables is Russia where in certain cities we’re reaching really the limits of the premium consumer. And we are doing this with IQOS 2.4 plus being at the bottom end of our range, although more expensive than any other competitor. But as we always said, we maintain flexibility of this and we can adjust pretty rapidly once we recover business. Just now that’s not our issue. Our issue is more the limited ability to have the contact with the consumers and the point of sale.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And if I can just sneak in one last one. So, you have given this range of $0.05 to $0.15 EPS impact from the delay in minimum price enforcement in Indonesia and COVID-related cost including down-trading. So, should I read it that $0.05 is the impact from minimum price enforcement because that you have visibility on and the range -- the extra $0.10 range is because of issues around down-trading and other COVID cost because you don’t have visibility of those?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think we should look at this as one piece rather than trying to cap it because I don’t have the super exact science in dissecting this. So it’s an estimate. But, as I said, even if we look at the other numbers in there, even if I take inventories, we assumed in inventories that the buildup of safety stocks we’ve done in certain countries, invest in the course of the month of March, will be fully paid back. Now, it may not happen, and we also have a reduction in inventories that we’ve seen in certain countries and Duty-Free because retailers got a little bit worried about the situation, we will not recover them during the quarter.So, we’ll put probably the worst scenario in there to be on the safe side. But, all these are flexible fixes. I can’t predict them in time. So, we’re trying, as I said, I repeat, to be as transparent as possible in this day, given the uncertainty. And I would stay there because me venturing any particular number, I can only be wrong.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Guys, I hope you are well and glad to hear you’re safe and healthy. I just had a question if I could, first of all. You’ve seen some seasonality in your shipments between Q1 and 2Q and 3Q. And I’m just curious how social distancing and isolation, those kind of things would affect that sort of seasonal lift you normally see in the second quarter. I guess, you mentioned that you’re not seeing much of a change in daily consumption rates. Could that change going forward, if these social isolation moves are in place?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I mean, notoriously, the first quarter of the year is the lowest consumption quarter in every tobacco product. Okay? So, even if we look at the in-market sales for IQOS, we have to put them in this context by definition. Okay?
Chris Growe: Yes.
André Calantzopoulos: And that’s why in my view they’re even better than somehow the numbers are in absolute terms. Okay?
Chris Growe: Sure.
André Calantzopoulos: Now, what is going to happen in the second quarter, other than what I explained, I can’t say, I -- we don’t see in most of the markets any change in average daily consumption, except for the developing markets that have the specific things that I mentioned. We have not measured it. And it’s very difficult, if I pick a market like Philippines. Okay? Yes, there is some sales decrease just now. It is possible that is part of the average daily consumption because it’s a stick sales market, and people have less money. It’s also possible that in some areas, we had some temporary out-of-stocks because it’s a cash economy with a lot of retailers going to wholesalers to buy. And until the whole system recombines and starts working properly, it takes some time. So, I wouldn’t attribute the lower sales, if you wish to, on the average daily consumption. But, I have to assume people that don’t have a job for a period of time and they cannot have the daily salary, they will buy less for a period of time. And in my example, I said, okay, if average daily consumption is nine cigarettes in stick sales and you go to eight, it’s a big difference for a month or for weeks. Okay? That’s how I see it.Now, if we assume we come out of the crisis gradually as of June, we should see the situation coming back. Okay? And probably the economy that can recover faster in this casual economy because it will just -- the limitation of people to move and do business as usual, once that resumes, I assume, we’ll recover it. Now, the question is temporary, as I said. And we don’t know how temporary is temporary. It’s not unlikely worldwide that we’ll see an ease by government because now the health system starts getting to a point, they can handle an increase number of cases. But we may have another slowdown in six months. God knows. Okay? That’s why we said, we give quarterly reviews. And as we advance, if we have any better data for the shareholders meeting that is forthcoming, we’ll give you an update as well, we’re learning as we speak.
Chris Growe: Sure.
André Calantzopoulos: But, I don’t see any structural effect. That’s what I’m saying.
Chris Growe: Yes. Thank you for that color. It was very good. I do want to ask very quickly about your outlook for the second quarter, you talk about IQOS devices -- device sales being down. Did you have a lot more users year-over-year? You don’t expect to accumulate as many users as well, I get that. But I was trying to understand what would cause your device sales to be down in the second quarter. Is that just a function of less incremental users or are there any returns or that kind of thing going on as well?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, it’s primarily due to lesser acquisition during the period. Okay? Also, as I said, as the device life expectancy increases over time, we have less replacement. But clearly, during this period, our focus has been, and we repurpose part of our sales experts, if there is a problem with a device, we repurpose the people to do the delivery and service to consumers. So, we don’t have an issue from that side. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job from that point of view. I think it is essentially related to lower acquisition as we have assumed if it happens.
Chris Growe: Okay. And I just wanted to quick follow-up, which would be just to understand, embedded within your guidance for the upcoming quarter for Q2, there presumably are lower costs as well, whether it be lower -- less travel and lower maybe SG&A cost, that kind of thing, as well as obviously you’ve kind of changed your IQOS investment plans here as well. So, is that sort of incorporated in the guidance that you framed that -- and you’ve got a lot of cost savings coming through as well? Could you frame those factors that are helping support Q2 earnings on top of the negative effects you have coming through?
Martin King: Yes. I mean, the Q2 number range we gave you is all in and includes our best estimate for basing of the cost and spending, including the additional focus on digital and some of the other areas where we can invest now to help us retool and be able to recover more quickly. So that number is all in because it includes things like, yes, lower travel, other cost spending categories that just aren’t happening because people are working differently. It’s all in there. Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.
André Calantzopoulos: Hello?
Michael Lavery: [Technical Difficulty] on IQOS. And I think, you even touched on digital demonstrations…
André Calantzopoulos: Can you just stop, because you broke at the beginning of the question?
Martin King: Could you repeat your question, Michael? You were breaking up at the beginning of your question.
Michael Lavery: Yes. Sorry. You mentioned using more digital for IQOS. And I think, you even touched on digital demonstrations. And I guess, I just would love to understand maybe how creative and flexible you can be there. Do you mean a case where you deliver or loan a device to the consumer to try it at home or is that just watching someone do it online, or how should we think about how robust your digital interaction can be?
André Calantzopoulos: Yes. We do loan devices, obviously with super accrued sanitary measures for the devices are new. And then, we do the guided trial by digital means. The coaches or the sales experts are operating from home and teaching the consumers. Currently, the consumers may have a bit more time. So, it’s much easier to do it than in normal times as well. And that’s how we operate. And I think, I was surprised that we maintained such high level. It may be a blessing I would say because that helps everybody, consumers on one side and our organization to move more and more into digital and learn in this crisis that you can do a lot of things from remote as well learning by operating from home by the way. So, that’s a good thing. And maybe we can further increase the sales this way, which over time would allow us to optimize the infrastructure costs that we have. And we’ve just gotten a boost I would say in a direction we’re going in any case.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And just one more on IQOS. You mentioned in Russia and EU that you already had lower device prices in the past quarter. Can you just describe what actions you’ve taken there and are those temporary or permanent price rests?
André Calantzopoulos: I’m sorry. I’m not sure we changed our device price, we had some promotion…
Martin King: I think it’s more of a comparison year-over-year, just because we had some adjustments on device prices in the second half of last year. But, we’re now comparing and lapping to the first quarter of last year when those adjustments hadn’t occurred. When you come into the second half, I think you’ll find the device pricing much more stable versus the prior year.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.
Robert Rampton: Hello. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first is, looking at your 2Q 2020 revenue assumption. Can you let us know what the revenue -- the assumption was before? I think, you mentioned that 1H would have been 5% ex-COVID, which I guess would have implied to 3% for 2Q. Is that thinking correct? Thanks.
Martin King: Yes. Q2, absent COVID impacts, net revenue would have been pretty much flat, a little bit. But the impacts of these other volume events that I mentioned, like Mexico comparison, Turkey comparison, impact of Indonesia, we’re already going to pull our combined volumes down, minus 5.5% or so,, 6%. And therefore, the net revenues would have been just a little bit positive, not much, but a little bit positive, almost flat. So, what you’re seeing now with the COVID-related impacts layered in is it’s already built on a fairly weak quarter pace that we had flagged already going back to CAGNY and to year-end call as well. That’s the first quarter. So, you have to look at the two in the context and take them. That’s why I made the comment that if you average the first two quarters, absent the COVID impacts, we were right on track with our guidance, even frankly, a little bit ahead.
Robert Rampton: Got it. That’s very clear. And then, I guess, the longer term, I mean, think about 2021, 2022, should we start to expect excise tax increases and maybe government’s closing the tax gaps as they look to raise revenue?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, we haven’t seen any of those things today, obviously. I think, governments will look for money, but they also know that regular tax increases are the best way to maximize revenue. And frankly speaking, if we look at the packages, the world is pledging to deploy, I don’t think cigarettes will cover even an infinite fraction of it. Now, it’s something to watch. This is pretty clear. But, we have no signs today of anything of this nature. That’s what I can see at this stage.
Robert Rampton: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Martin King: Hi, Bonnie.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Bonnie. Hope everything is okay.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes, everything’s okay with me, hope for you guys too. I just wanted to clarify something that you said a lot earlier in the call. You touched on this. But, I wanted to clarify in terms of recruiting new users for IQOS that if you’re able to touch consumers virtually and converse with them, you’re not seeing any reluctance from them to convert to IQOS in this environment. So, that’s the first clarification. And then, assuming your recruitment efforts for new users of IQOS remains pressured for the rest of Q2, as you discussed, just trying to understand how you see this impact in your core cigarette business.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think, to your first question, I haven’t heard of any difference in what we call the adoption funnel. Once a person is contacted, typically we have a very high purchase rates, because very often the people that come to the stores or the digital assets are people that are aware and frankly convinced. And obviously, the ones that come to our digital channels now are the most convinced. So, actually maybe we’re higher, I don’t have the numbers, we can come to you, than we used to be on average before, which is normal. Now, cigarettes is a bit more difficult to predict. Clearly, I see for IQOS, the momentum is there. And once we can resume the direct contacts also to people, we’ll get back on track. Because I don’t see any change in the momentum. I’m very impressed actually that during the period we are where we are in terms of new consumers switching to IQOS.If you look at cannibalization rates, obviously, it would be less cannibalization if there is less acquisition of IQOS. But if that lasts a couple of months, I don’t see that will dent any of the two. Okay? That rest is all the micro thing side discussed during the call, the temporary reductions in average daily consumption in some places. And then obviously it depends on where the world is going to end this crisis, we will see if there is any longer term recessionary impact. But as you know, cigarettes are very resistant to recession in general. So, it’s more a question for a long-term perspective, which today is very difficult for any of us, frankly speaking, to evaluate. Okay? But we don’t see any changes in the dynamics.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, I may have missed this, but should we assume that your IQOS HTU volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion sticks is still reasonable by 2021? I know, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but do you still -- are you still leaving that I guess target out there?
André Calantzopoulos: If the restrictions last for the quarter, I think we’re still okay. If they last for a year, obviously, we need to delay the whole thing by a certain period of time. I think, the underlying trajectory is there. So, for the moment, I think that’s how I see it.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then, just a final quick one for me. In terms of marketing spend, you mentioned on the call that you guys are adjusting and investing more dollars in areas where you think you’re going to get the biggest buck, if you will, probably digital. But, I’m curious about the total dollar spent in 2020. I think you had targeted incremental, was it $300 million to $350 million this year. And I’m just curious if that amount has changed at all, given everything?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, just now, this investment in quarterly basis is a bit slowed down, obviously, because we don’t have all the opportunities available. And obviously, we have flexibility because it is variable. Now, at this stage, we need to see when we come out of the crisis and if we need to double the Q1 resources for a period of time in order to catch up and if that makes sense from an investment point of view. So, we have flexibility there. If there is no opportunity, we will not spend all this money. And obviously, it will move to next year. That’s how I see. Just now, it is a slower spending, obviously. The difference is despite the incremental investment in digital that is reallocating money.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you so much.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: And that was our final question. I’ll now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Thank you all for joining the call. I understand there are exceptional circumstances for all of us. I would like to say that we don’t see any problem in our business fundamentals, actually they remain very strong. I believe all of these things are temporary, but the temporary is the uncertainty. We tried to be as transparent as possible and give you as much granularity as we can. I think, overall, as far as the PMI operations are concerned, we are in fairly good shape, given the circumstances. And I hope that we move out of the crisis as soon as possible, so we resume business. But overall, I think the outlook for me on the longer term is -- remains the same as very positive. And we’re very committed short term, to make sure that our operations continue, our employees are safe. And I think we’ve done well there, because that’s what will make our business stronger when we come out of the crisis.So, we’ll keep you up to date. As I said, we have the shareholders meeting. If there’s any news, we’ll let you know. And bear with us in this period of uncertainty.
Nick Rolli: I have one final comment, André, if you permit me to. I want to let everyone know this is Martin’s last earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. As I think most of you know, he will be taking on a new role as the CEO of PMI America. So, I think, I speak for everyone at PMI, the organization, certainly the finance organization that works with him on a day to day basis to thank him for his service, his commitment, and his good sense of humor. We’ll miss that. But, we also look forward to welcoming Emmanuel Babeau as our new CFO as of May 1st and joining us on these calls in the future. So, congratulations, Martin and best of luck to you.
Martin King: Thank you very much, Nick.
Nick Rolli: So, that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Stay well, stay healthy.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2019 Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App.A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and our business transformation metrics are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Comparisons are presented on a like-for-like basis reflecting pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. effective March 22nd, 2019.Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, will join André for the question-and-answer session. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our 2019 results continued to reflect strong underlying business performances from both our combustible and smoke-free portfolios.IQOS is performing strongly across a broad array of geographies and remains firmly on track to meet our 2021 heated tobacco unit shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units.Meanwhile, our combustible business continues to perform well underpinned by solid pricing. We achieved several important milestones in our transformation to a smoke-free future. This notably included the authorization for a version of our IQOS product from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration through the pre-market tobacco product application pathway and the subsequent commercial launch in Atlanta and Richmond under our licensing agreement with Altria. IQOS is now Commercially available in 52 markets worldwide.Let me now take you through the main elements of our full year results, starting with volume. Industry total volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units declined by 2.0%, broadly in line with the historical trend and slightly better than our prior forecast of around 2.5%.Our shipment volume declined by 1.4%, in line with our previously communicated forecast decline of 1% to 1.5%. The outperformance of the industry was driven by heated tobacco share gains of 0.6 points which helped offset cigarette declines, partly impacted by heated tobacco unit cannibalization.Focusing on the fourth quarter, I would also like to highlight that while the effect of inventory movements across the year was small, the greater shipment volume decline of 4.4% in Q4 2019 partly reflects unfavorable combustible cigarette inventory movements of 2.3 billion units compared to the prior year quarter, notably due to the European Union region and Japan. We anticipate a partial reversal of this effect in these geographies in the first quarter of 2020.Fourth quarter in-market sales volumes declined by 3.1%. As previously anticipated in our third quarter remarks, this in-market sales decline primarily reflects the impact of recent pricing in Turkey and the Philippines.In Turkey, our cigarette volume decline was due mainly to the impact of two price increases during the year, taken in April and August -- totaling five Turkish Lira per pack, or 44% which disproportionately impacted our share given the timing of our pricing vis-à-vis the competition, in addition to the industry decline. In Q4 2019, our share improved on a sequential basis, but the total market was weak due to a rise in illicit cut tobacco consumption.In the Philippines, our cigarette volume decline mainly reflected a lower total market in the immediate aftermath of industry price increases. Though from a volume/mix perspective, this was partly compensated by a strong share performance from Marlboro.Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 44% to 60 billion units in 2019. This performance including shipments of over 17 billion units in the fourth quarter, reflects broad-based growth across our launch markets with notable contributions from the EU Region, Japan and Russia and keeps us well on track to deliver our 2021 shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units.This excellent performance means that heated tobacco units, now make up nearly 8% of our total shipment volumes, as compared to almost nothing in 2015. We expect this proportion to grow further, as our positive momentum of reduced risk products continues.Turning to our 2019, financial results, net revenues increased by 6.4% excluding currency, driven by strong pricing from -- for our combustible product portfolio and growth in heated tobacco units.RRP net revenues reached $5.6 billion or close to 19% of PMI's total net revenues with IQOS devices, accounting for approximately $0.7 billion or 13% of RRP net revenues.As highlighted previously, this lower proportion of device revenues primarily reflects favorable geographic mix of heated tobacco unit volume. The longer lifespan of the latest IQOS devices and the impact of device retail price changes in select markets.We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 6.5% in 2019, better than our initial expectations for the year, helped by a broadly rational excise tax and competitive environment.There were notable contributions from Germany, Indonesia and Russia, in addition to the aforementioned pricing, in the Philippines and Turkey. This was in line with the average historical variance, since the 2008 spin.On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 11.2%, while adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 170 basis points. This margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for the heated tobacco unit.Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles and the impact of our cost initiatives, where we're firmly on track to reach over $1 billion of efficiencies by 2021, helping to finance growth investment, behind RRPs.To this point, we implemented all of our $400 million planned incremental RRP investments in 2019, with the net increase in spend, partially offset by higher efficiencies realized as part of our overall cost program. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased strongly, growing 9.9%, excluding currency and exceeding our prior forecast of around 9.5%.As explained in the third quarter results, the lower currency-neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to adjusted operating income, reflects higher non-controlling interest and a higher like-for-like tax rate.Our strong operating cash flow of $10.1 billion, increased by $0.6 billion, benefiting from a number of working capital initiatives and the timing of certain cash costs related to our Berlin factory optimization. Capital expenditures of $0.9 billion came in slightly below our full year assumption of around $1 billion, benefiting from production efficiencies.Turning now to market share, our total international share grew by 0.1 point to 28.4%, with lower share for cigarettes, including the impact of cannibalization, more than offset by higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.2%.The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 0.5 points, reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS, particularly in the European Union Region and Japan, coupled with lower share, notably in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea and Turkey.Further, despite this out-switching, Marlboro's share of the cigarette category increased by 0.3 points to an all-time high of 10%, driven by Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.IQOS is now commercially available in 52 markets, representing 44% of the total international market, where our weighted-average geographic coverage within these markets, is approximately 60%.This follows the addition of 8 new markets in 2019, including Hungary, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and the fourth quarter launch, in Mexico, initially focused in select areas, of Mexico City.In the latter part of the year, we took another important step in our journey towards smoke-free future, with the launch of IQOS 3 DUO, which is now available in all of our international IQOS markets, supported by our new Simply Amazing brand campaign.The Simply Amazing campaign focuses on everyday, relatable moments and emotions, by showcasing to adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke the benefits of switching to IQOS.This latest addition to the IQOS family was designed with enhanced features to help adult smokers switch more seamlessly from cigarettes. IQOS 3 DUO allows two consecutive uses without recharging the holder, while it's charging time is significantly faster compared to IQOS 3 and IQOS 2.4 PLUS.We have seen positive initial effects on rates of conversion and consumer satisfaction, from the roll-out of DUO, which offers us encouragement on consumers' response to innovation, as we start 2020. We continue to nurture a strong pipeline of future product improvements and innovations for the core IQOS platform.Turning now to a more detailed discussion of RRP performance. We estimate that there were nearly 14 million total IQOS users as of year-end, representing the addition of four million adult users over the course of the year. Based on our current momentum, we expect this rate of acquisition to significantly increase in 2020.We further estimate that 71 of the total or close to 10 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. This reflects widespread user growth with highlights including a near doubling of users in Italy and Germany, a near trebling in Poland, very strong growth in Ukraine and the addition of 1.7 million users in Russia to reach a total of 2.5 million.Let me now take you through the performance of IQOS in 2019. The overall share performance for IQOS heated tobacco units continues to see excellent progress. Indeed in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS heated tobacco units were the third largest tobacco brand in the fourth quarter with a 5.5% share, increasing from the number four position in the third quarter. This has been achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets as mentioned earlier.The continued excellent growth of IQOS reflects progress across a broad range of market. Our commercialization approach starts with a focus of the key cities -- on the key cities within a market, building adult smoker awareness, trial and conversion.On this slide, we see the strong off-take share momentum in a number of key cities. This gives us further encouragement as to the potential future growth at the national level as we see increases in both our geographic reach and rates of consumer awareness and trial.In the EU region, fourth quarter share for HEETS reached 3.2% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, an increase of 1.5 points but near doubling, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.On a sequential basis, share growth accelerated in the quarter increasing by 0.7 points. In-market sales volume also grew 16.1%, compared to the third quarter 2019. This growth reflects continued strength across a broad range of markets as detailed in this slide. It is worth noting that IQOS is only present in geographic areas, representing approximately 57% of industry total volume in the region.The quality of consumer acquisition is also high with conversion rates and registration rates improving over time. IQOS continued strong performance in Russia in the fourth quarter with HEETS share up by 3.3 points to reach 5%. On a sequential basis versus the third quarter, HEETS share increased by one point, while in-market sales increased by over 20% to reach 2.9 billion units.HEETS share growth in the quarter was consistent with the pace of adult smoker adoption and our geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in cities, representing approximately half of the market by total industry volume compared to an estimated 40% at the end of the second quarter.In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2.4 points to reach 17.6% in the fourth quarter, supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in a Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line-up.As we have previously mentioned, total industry and share metrics in Japan are currently somewhat distorted by the low price cigarillo category, which grew rapidly over the past two quarters to reach a total tobacco share of 6% in December. These products presently enjoy a significantly preferential tax treatment though the tax council of the ruling party has recently announced the closing of this gap over two steps in October 2020 and October 2021. While the growth of this category is likely to be temporary, we plan to enter with the Philip Morris brand in the current quarter to capture our fair share.On a total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share of our heated tobacco unit brands increased by 1.5 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.6 points sequentially to 16.9%.2019 in-market sales volumes over heated tobacco unit brands grew 4.2% compared to a total tobacco market including cigarillos, which declined just over 3% after adjusting for the estimated impact of trade inventory movements. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a fourth quarter total tobacco share of almost 24%, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements.In Korea, there remains a lingering impact on the heated tobacco category of the consumer confusion goes by the Korean FDA's 2018 communication on tar. The category also remains highly competitive, particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions that are also present in the cigarette category.HEETS share in the fourth quarter declined by 2.2 points or by 1.4 points on an adjusted basis. However, on a sequential basis, fourth quarter adjusted share was essentially stable and our segment share continued to grow, supported by IQOS 3 DUO and recent launches that expanded the flavor line-up. While we are encouraged by this trend, we still have a lot of work to do to reinforce the heated tobacco category's benefits and build upon IQOS' leadership position.A key development in 2019 was the launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria. The first IQOS retail stores opened in the initial launch markets of Atlanta and Richmond, marking a historic milestone in providing better alternatives to the 40 million men and women in the United States who continue to smoke. While it remains early days in the lead market commercialization, we're excited about the significant opportunity.As a reminder IQOS is currently the only heat-not-burn product on the market authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so the PMTA pathway as appropriate for the protection of public health. We also plan to seek an additional marketing order of the IQOS 3 device in the coming months, which will further support the efforts to convert U.S. adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke.Building on the success of our heated tobacco portfolio, we plan to launch our e-vapor product IQOS MESH 2.0 this year. Following consumer confusion around e-vapor in the later part of 2019, we took the decision to postpone our initial commercial launch. Unfortunately, these misperceptions although moderating, still persists and as such, we now plan to launch in the third quarter of this year when we will also reach the optimal capacity to deploy at scale.As a result, we plan to -- a faster acceleration of commercial rollout through the second half of 2020. It's worth pausing briefly to consider the dynamics of the international e-vapor market in which IQOS MESH 2.0 will operate. The existing market is concentrated in a small number of geographies with 10 markets making up around 70% of the approximately 25 million international adult users, which despite numbering almost double that of heated tobacco, contribute less than half its retail value. This reflects the heavy existing skew to open tank systems, a low degree of product differentiation and a low rate of full conversion relative to heated tobacco products.Of these 10 markets, seven also have a meaningful limit on nicotine concentration. The IQOS MESH product has been designed to address this dynamic and will be able to leverage our existing RRP commercial infrastructure and capabilities to drive consumer trial and repurchase. In summary, we're optimistic that IQOS MESH will deliver a superior experience and drive further growth in our business over time.Lastly, in terms of the commercialization outlook on RRPs, we also recently announced a global collaboration agreement with KT&G for the commercialization of their smoke-free products outside of Korea. The key rationale for this agreement is to accelerate the growth of the smoke-free category, which will require multiple products, providing a wide array of brand, taste, price and technology choices to adult smokers.The capabilities we have built around RRPs in term of commercial infrastructure and know-how, technology, scientific substantiation and regulatory engagement are best-in-class. These capabilities can be leveraged to broaden our strong portfolio and innovation pipeline to further drive category growth including partnerships with others when it makes strategic and economic sense to do so. KT&G has a range of smoke-free products, which we see as complementary to ours. We have responsibility for all elements of commercialization of product supply under this agreement and we intend to apply a market-by-market approach to deployment.The agreement will run for an initial period of three years with the intention to expand the market footprint based on commercial success. While we don't disclose the financial terms of such arrangement, this is a royalty based agreement. Products sold under the agreement will be subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched as well as PMI's high standards of quality and scientific substantiation of their harm reduction potential. We are now working towards the first launches later this year. There are no current plans to commercialize KT&G products in the United States. With this agreement and our own IQOS MESH launch in 2020, we have an active and exciting year ahead.Turning to 2020 guidance. We forecast reported diluted earnings per share to be at least $5.50 at prevailing exchange rates compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $4.61 in 2019. On a like-for-like basis and excluding an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.04, at prevailing exchange rates, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8% versus pro-forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.13 in 2019.In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect EPS growth, and net revenue growth, to be particularly strong in the first quarter, and notably softer in the second quarter, 2020. The first quarter will benefit from the timing of pricing in the Philippines, and a favorable comparison with first quarter, 2019, which included the absorption of a substantial excise tax increase in Turkey.Conversely, performance in the second quarter will likely be impacted by, both the comparison to a strong performance in second quarter, 2019, and the most pronounced effect of the tax-driven pricing in Indonesia. It's also worth noting that the higher weighting of growth to markets with significant non-controlling interests seen in the second half of 2019 will continue into the first half of 2020 due to annualization effects.Let me now explain the dynamics in Indonesia in more detail. As we said in December, the industry faces an atypical year of catch-up on excise tax and pricing. The 2020 excise tax took effect on January 1st, implying a weighted-average excise tax increase of 24% industry-wide, with a 46% increase in the minimum banderole price.While the potential tax pass-on is relatively steep at 14% of the weighted average price, in the context of a two-year stack, with no excise tax increase in 2019, the average percentage increase is broadly in-line with historical levels. The tax increase and the higher banderole price should also give us the opportunity to address the price gaps which impacted our 2019 share performance. So far, between October and January, we have announced pricing of 8% on a weighted-average basis, or approximately 60% of the pass-on.To date, some of our competitors are lagging on pricing, and will require a larger catch-up to comply with the new minimum retail price that is effective April 1st. We should also highlight the one-time impact on our pricing variance from the lack of any excise tax increase in 2019.With minimal pricing taken in the first nine months of last year, we will not benefit this year from the usual annualization effect of increases taken in the prior period. This exceptional dynamic effectively creates a one-off drag on our 2020 pricing variance of over $200 million.In line with our prior comments, we expect the total industry, measuring 307 billion units in 2019, to decline by around 6% to 7% in 2020, with the highest impact likely in the second quarter, as the new minimum retail selling price takes effect and the new prices work their way through the trade. With the resumption of pricing this year, we expect market dynamics to improve in 2021.Our 2020 guidance reflects certain key assumptions. The most significant, as we just noted, is the pricing roll-out in Indonesia, which at this stage, we assume to dilute our combustible pricing variance to approximately 5% in 2020. While lower than our 2019 pricing variance, this is still very robust and is supported by a generally rational excise tax environment.In combination with the projected total market decline of 6% to 7% in Indonesia, at this stage we cautiously assume currency-neutral net revenue growth of around 5%. However, I would reiterate that we remain very confident in our guidance of at least 8% currency-neutral earnings per share growth.One of the reasons for this confidence is the positive margin outlook; where our efforts to deliver over $1 billion in annualized cost efficiencies by 2021 are bearing fruit, led by important initiatives related to productivity, cost category management, a project-based organization model and other cost efficiencies.In 2020, we expect cost efficiencies to fully offset expected net incremental RRP investments. With the growing scale and geographic reach of our RRP business, additional investments now primarily reflect variable costs linked to new consumer acquisition and existing user retention, plus new market entries.Consequently, the cost per user is improving, with an expected decrease of 25% in our acquisition cost per user in 2020. We expect the increasing leverage of our commercial platform to contribute to an increase in currency neutral operating income margin of at least 150 basis points in 2020.Moving to the industry volume backdrop, our estimated total market decline is around 3.0% to 4.0% for the year. While this is weaker than the historical average of 2.0% to 3.0%, this very much reflects the temporary situation in Indonesia, which represents around 11% of total industry volume. An additional factor comes from the present growth of the cigarillo category in Japan, which is not included in the cigarette total market calculations.As shown on the chart, we assumed 6% to 7% market decline in Indonesia has an expected effect of around 0.7 points on the global industry, with a further 0.3 points from the growth of cigarillos in Japan.While there are the usual puts and takes elsewhere, together these two temporary impacts fully explain the deviation from the historical average with underlying fundamentals remaining unchanged.An additional upcoming development included in our industry forecast is the Tobacco Products Directive ban on menthol cigarettes in the European Union, effective May 2020.Menthol and menthol capsule variants make up for around 10% of consumption in the region. And while we do not expect a significant impact on the overall industry volume decline of 1% to 2%, there is a further opportunity for IQOS given that menthol HEETS variants are not covered by the ban.We expect PMI shipment volumes in 2020 to again outperform the industry trend, and anticipate a total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline of approximately 2.5% to 3.5%. We expect our shipment volume trends to be slightly better in the second half compared to the first half due to the dynamics already mentioned in Indonesia and Turkey.While we're not providing a specific 2020 target for heated tobacco unit shipment, we expect continued broad-based growth and remain well on track to meet our shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021.We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23%, consistent with last year, and a relatively stable net interest expense compared to 2019. We're targeting 2020 operating cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements and currency movements.This includes the expected one-time adverse impact of new excise payment rules in Australia, and the timing of certain cash costs related to the Berlin factory restructuring.Together, these two factors account for an expected unfavorable cash impact of approximately $350 million. We project total capital expenditures this year to be approximately $1 billion.Summing up a strong year, we made very significant progress in our transformation to a smoke-free future in both our organization and our 2019 business results. Just over four years since the first full-scale IQOS commercial launch in Japan in September 2015, we already have $5.6 billion in RRP net revenues, making up almost one fifth of our business.Importantly, RRP revenues are increasingly accretive to our profits, as evidenced by the strong margin growth seen in 2019, and expected in 2020. IQOS continues to perform strongly, with 35% growth of HTU in-market sales volumes from an increasing number of markets where close to 10 million adult smokers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS.We project the number of new users over the course of 2020 to be significantly higher than 2019 and at a cost per user that is lower, as the large RRP infrastructure investments of the past several years are mostly completed.We are also very focused on maintaining the leadership of our combustible tobacco portfolio, which is delivering robust performance and pricing power. Despite the temporary headwinds in Indonesia, we are confident in our 2020 guidance and remain well on track to deliver our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex-currency growth targets of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted earnings per share growth.Finally, we are confident in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that our current and future RRP portfolio continues to provide us with the single largest opportunity to accelerate our business growth and generously reward our shareholders over time.Thank you. Martin and I are now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Michael.
Martin King: Good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Good morning.
Michael Lavery: Can you touch on IQOS, and some of what's going on in really sort of two different ends of the adoption curve? I guess, on the one hand you see a market like Hungary, for example, that has four share points plus in just a year out of nowhere. But then you're also talking about the lower costs of acquisition per user that you've mentioned in the past comes from scale and growing word of mouth. I guess I'd love to just understand both dynamics a little bit more. One is, how are you driving some of the rapid adoption in select markets. And then second, what are some of the key drivers of your efficiencies as they get a little bit more mature.
André Calantzopoulos: Yes. Well, I guess, as a learning organization, every time we launch in a new market, we apply what we learned from the previous one. So the time where we start growing faster is shorter and shorter. And I think we showed a chart like this recently and will explain that in CAGNY next week. So it's a learning organization. The deployment of more digital skills that makes that every new market, we open starts growing faster than the previous one, and that's fact of organization knowledge.Now as we have also the infrastructure in place, clearly, the cost per user will decrease and does decrease this year in 2020, we have to invest a little bit more money in retention. I would say, although the cost of retention will also go down as we have more people. But clearly, you know, and the cost of acquisition is higher, so it makes sense. Now that we have enough people in our CRM base to invest a bit more there, because losing a consumer that we have acquired is much bigger loss than not acquiring someone by definition. Okay. And also because now we have the digital infrastructure, we can start enlarging beyond over time the offering beyond accessories and just special editions and normal products to more things that can help us build a different type of business over time as we have data on consumers and so on.So I'm optimistic that, although we will continue investing Michael, incrementally in the RRP, so we grow the number of users. This cost per user is going to go further and further down and obviously you know, we retain more consumers, so that's all on the positive side and that's how I see it define. Was that clear?
Michael Lavery: No. That's very helpful. Thank you. One just quick follow-up related to that. When you look at the evolution of IQOS usage of consumers, you've shown the charts that it's pretty consistently show around 70% of users who fully convert. But obviously, you're also adding new users constantly as well who have obviously just gotten started. What amount of time does it typically take for somebody to transition and maybe related to saying it kind of a different way, for users that began using the product, say, a year or two ago, is the amount that's fully converted more like 75%, 80% or 85%, or how should we think about that dynamic?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, for the new users clearly, on average, we say two weeks to a month depending on the individual, sometimes people take much more time to fully switch. Okay. They start using the products immediately obviously, because they bought it. Now, regarding retention over time, it's fairly stable, I would say, and I think with the new programs, we have in our CRM, will increase this retention. Now it depends also on the market as you know.In markets, where we have a lot of competitive activity, we get some dilution of consumption, because people buy other devices typically vastly cheaper from competition and they try a few products, but if I compare markets where the competition is not yet successful, I think we have very good retention, and I think we can further enhance this retention as we now deploy a much better CRM program during the year. So I'm really happy with what we have and we can improve from here.
Michael Lavery: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS.
Robert Rampton: Hello. Three questions for me. The first would be in – outside Korea and Japan, are there any markets where IQOS volumes have declined sequentially and then on the flip side, are there any markets where sequential growth has accelerated?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. I mean, except for Korea, I would say, we have growth in every market. Okay. Korea is a particular phenomenon because there is a confusion of consumers around the heat-not-burn category that is not dissimilar to what happened in many markets on the e-vapor category and that happened at the beginning of last year in June, when the Korean FDA, although they found a very significant reduction in the toxicants of heated tobacco product compared to cigarettes, very similar to what we have communicated, they kind of confused consumers by saying yes, but the tar of this product is very similar to cigarettes, although, we're comparing apples with oranges, because there is two different paths. The one is water and glycerin, and the other is but chemical.So this has stalled the category, and I think will take a bit of time to restart the process. I think sooner, or later there is realization by the authorities in Korea that that's not the right thing to do with consumers and the alignment we have now much more with KT&G, after the agreement, I think they will help grow the category, but except for Korea, I don't see any other place where we have an issue.
Robert Rampton: Great. And then just in terms of the margin expansion. So, if we think about, how much of your 2020 expectation is driven by say cost saves, pricing and IQOS, is it fair to think that the impact of IQOS is offset by cost savings and the incremental increases pricing or how should we think about that?
Martin King: Yeah, the margin expansion is driven by a number of factors. First of all, it's partly mix in that we're growing very rapidly now in the EU, which has very good margins on IQOS via tobacco units. The second piece is, as you point out, our cost saving initiatives have stepped up significantly.At this point, the investments that we're making behind RRP are now fully offset by these cost savings initiatives and that's where you get the big benefit for margin expansion and the cost saving breaks down into a couple of buckets. In the operations area, we have various productivity, especially, as we get better and better at producing the consumables for heated tobacco units with scale, better uptime on the equipment for waste.We're improving the footprint across the whole manufacturing area. You saw the factory optimizations we've done in the last year, which begin to pay off in 2020 and beyond and we also have initiatives across all of our spending categories to find ways to become more efficient intelligently and rotate money out of less efficient areas and be able to put it into reduced risk products.So that whole effort started to pay off for the last year, you saw our margin expansion last year was very strong at 1.7 percentage point increase and then this year we're committing to at least 1.5 percentage increase, and this is something that we will continue to focus on in the out years going forward as well.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. Regarding pricing, I would say, as I explained, we foresee pricing to be a bit below this year than 2019, but is essentially due to Indonesia, okay. Because if we took 2019 we had annualization of pricing from 2018 in Indonesia, which at this stage we assume is not going to happen.Obviously, one, there was no real pricing in 2019. So you have no annualization in 2020 and we have to be a bit cautious about pricing and how it rolls out in Indonesia, there is a pretty steep increase. But we assume that this situation will resolve during 2020. So in 2021 we have annualization of pricing in Indonesia and come back to normal, okay.
Robert Rampton: Excellent. Apologies. Just one follow-up, in terms of IQOS operating margins, can you give us some color on how it compares to cigarettes in say Italy at one end and Russia at the other?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, IQOS margins are higher than cigarettes. Okay. So that's basically clear and a lot of the margin improvement is coming, as Martin explained from IQOS essentially.
Robert Rampton: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. Good morning.
Martin King: Hey, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So you guys sound very constructive on the momentum on IQOS that is clear. I was hoping that you could comment on your key competitor's commentary this morning for the RRP category in Japan. Specifically, they may be have a different view than you specifically saying that they're looking for more moderate growth to capture 25% of industry volumes as competition intensifies, can you comment on that.
André Calantzopoulos: I think it's very difficult to comment at this stage what is going to be the precise growth of the category. Maybe I see it higher than them, but we see both growth and that's the important part. And I think we are well positioned with all the initiatives we have to capture the largest part of the growth.So we'll see as the year unfolds where exactly we end, but the key thing is that we remain focused. IQOS still has a lion's part of the segment share and the momentum is positive and accelerating. We're increasing segment share and overall market share. So that's the key thing to retail.
Vivien Azer: Perfect. That's helpful. Just a follow-up on in Japan. Can you offer any color on what your HTU mix is between HEETS and Marlboro at the end of 2019?
André Calantzopoulos: I don't have the exact numbers in my head, but I would say the cannibalization is stable. We had a little bit of down-trading, I would say, after the price increase because Marlboro increased prices more than HEETS, but now it's back to stable and both are growing, but Marlboro is growing, again.
Martin King: I think, Vivien, we haven't given the exact split.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah.
Martin King: But I think it's safe to say that Marlboro's share, Marlboro HeatSticks share ended up being more than we had originally expected. We thought that HEETS would a bigger component by now and Marlboro HeatSticks has held up better than we expected given the pricing.On the other hand, HEETS did its job of expanding their category and making the offering available to a broader array of consumers that were more price sensitive. So we're satisfied with this performance and overall it did its job. However, more heated tobacco users opted to stay with the Marlboro HeatSticks than we originally planned, which is positive of course for our margins and for the profitability.
Vivien Azer: Sure, absolutely. Now, that's a great outcome. Last one from me. André, I appreciated your commentary on some of the e-vapor concerns that are spreading seemingly to the EU. That's certainly consistent with what we heard from one of your competitors yesterday. Are there any principal markets that we should be watching out for, in particular where consumer concern or confusion around e-vapor risk is taking hold most dramatically?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think the maximum was after the unfortunate cases in the U.S. with the lung disease and deaths that was spun by some people in the wrong way. As you know, I think this is getting better, but we are not there out yet, because there are still people that spread confusion despite all the efforts.Myself and others are making to explain that this has nothing to do with the e-vapor category and more with misuse with cannabis, oils and so on. My – our perspective on this was in any case our plan on e-vapor was to build the capacity and go into the bulk of the market, that is the European Union towards the year end, okay, because then we have capacity at scale.We had planned a couple of markets earlier on a try basis. I think it's better not to put oil in the fire, especially, since we will put the e-vapor under the IQOS brand. So to minimize confusion, I prefer that we let a little bit time fly. We build capacity and it doesn't move in reality our plan for the European Union, which was towards the end of this year. So that's my perspective.And I think that it's about time, there are more voices here to stop misleading people and I was reading the recent Q&A by the World Health Organization and it's not my commentary, but it is so much of misleading and I would say malicious statements in there that some of the top advocates in public health came out and said, this is unacceptable. So they modified their version, but they still misleading.So I think short-term that may appear not a good thing, but long term, the more people say insane things, the more credibility they lose and the more the alternatives will become more credible because they lose their credibility. And I think we are in this phase now who are frankly speaking, you see more and more of this nonsensical thing and more and more voices saying let's stop these, have I reset now of the situation and stopped talking seriously because these alternatives are better for people would otherwise smoke. But as far as the commercial part is concerned, that's it -- that's why, it's what I said and I explained just now. Hope I'm clear.
Vivien Azer: Very clear. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman from Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hello, thank you very much for taking the question. As Vivien was asking about Japan, can I just ask one quick question there before turning to IQOS. And the question on Japan, is whether in your pricing variance, you're baking in any assumption for the around the tax rise that we're obviously going to get in October this year, so that's the first question.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, any, pricing is all in the guidance, obviously Adam. So we're always hope there is an opportunity in Japan, when there is a tax increase to get pricing, we'll make some assumptions, we'll see how much they materialize or not.
Adam Spielman: Perfect, that's very, very clear. So the real question, the core question is obviously around IQOS and so one – and so thinking about the European to begin with, the European Union to begin with, in Q3, you had 0.1% quarter-on-quarter market share growth and then you've had a much high, really, really strong growth in Q4.And I was just wondering how you should think, how we should think about EU market share progressing going forwards, whether there is any sort of seasonality in that and how you think we should sort of smooth out those two things, slightly disappointing in my view in Q3 and then a really strong performance just in Q4?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. In broad strokes, okay, there is as on seasonality in summer pretty obviously that's favoring cigarettes hence a little bit less market share on the heated tobacco unit. The second thing, although IQOS was very marginally affected by the whole situation of e-vapor in the U.S., it was just the moment in the quarter, we had a bit of a slowdown in September I would say but we recovered as of October/November and I think we're entering 2020 with a pretty good momentum.Number of users is increasing. As I explained, I think the menthol is an opportunity for us towards second half of the year. So I'm very optimistic about the momentum and outcomes in the European Union.
Adam Spielman: And so just to summarize, I think you're saying, you expect to get more new users in the EU in 2020 than you did in 2019, partly because of a medical issue, but also the CRM that just the whole momentum is so good?
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Martin King: Hey Adam, I'm Martin. On the IQOS heated tobacco unit share in the EU there is seasonality there. If you look at for instance in 2018, you see the same basic dynamic, where the increase from Q2 to Q3 is relatively small with a bigger increase from Q3 to Q4 and then again in 2019 you see the same dynamic.In addition, this year we had even more pronounced effect that André mentioned with the other news flow, but this is -- this is back to the seasonality piece. Cigarettes in EU are going to be higher because it's warm weather, people go outside and they can use it more and then lower in the winter months, whereas IQOS you could use much more easily frequently without any worry as far as what the weather outside is, so you don't see the volume changes quarter-to-quarter as much as you do on cigarettes. So it's really the cigarette seasonality that's driving these share numbers to be impacted.
André Calantzopoulos: Overall, I would say, Adam, we see a significant increase in the number of users overall across the market. Okay. And I think it's also due to the fact that we're getting scale, getting momentum. We see more word of mouth happening in the markets and the tools we use now are more scalable. So I hope we will see this accelerate.
Adam Spielman: And then quickly, so turning to Russia, which obviously is a very large market and you're gaining share very fast. Roughly speaking, well in Q3 last year you had roughly 1% market share, you've now got 5%, so in five quarters you've gained four percentage points of market share. I guess the question is, do you think that rate of growth can continue or would you expect it to slow slightly?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, first of all we need to compare comparable things. Okay. We are still growing in cities where we started before. There is some obviously some expansion in there that helps and we still have scope for expansion. Now it's pretty clear in my mind that at a certain stage, we would need probably a second price point in the portfolio in Russia because in certain cities, we will be getting the essence of the premium and somehow, a large part of the more I would say wealthy part of the mid-price segment. I don't know that we will need this in 2020, but we have to plan at least for 2021. Okay. And that's how I see it. So we don't see a slowdown, but we need to prepare for reaching the limits in terms of affordability over time in the big cities. Now in the cities we just started clearly, we have more runway in front of us.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Pamela.
Martin King: Hello, good morning.
Pamela Kaufman: So over the last several years, you've quantified a level of incremental IQOS investment in each year. How much incremental investment do you anticipate in 2020 relative to 2019?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, in my view is going to be a bit less than 2019 and it's all variable. At the end of the day, it all depends on the number of new consumers you acquire. So I would say we would be between 300 and 350 depending on the number of new users and that we have because there are certain cost that are purely variable. But as Martin clearly said, all this is offset on a comparable basis by all the savings we have in -- from a cost saving initiatives. So that helps clearly the margin expansion plus the geographic mix of IQOS that is helpful.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. That's helpful. And I wanted to better understand your decision to partner with KT&G and how you see their products competing with IQOS and given that this partnership expands your portfolio to e-vapor and hybrid products, do you also see a need to fill the gap in modern oral?
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah, I think at the end of the day I said many times, I don't think we will do all the new products on our own or invent everything and we're very open to partnership and this is a very simple principle is what can we add to the partnership. I think we have technology, we have IP that complements, we have the scientific assessment capabilities and obviously the route to market. And in my view KT&G has an interesting product like the hybrid product, which by the way is a peripheral heated tobacco product that vaporizes at the same time.When we think there is potential in certain markets and certain consumer segments, their heated tobacco product has -- is the second more performing heated tobacco product and it's also heating from the inside and I think with the know-how we have if necessary, we can improve this product. And I think we decide market-by-market, what are the right price points for this product, so that they are complementary to our IQOS strategy. And as we discussed in Japan, for Japan, there may be some cannibalization, but from Japan, for example, we did two price points with our own products. We didn't see much cannibalization. We're still much more incrementality. So that's how I see it.For the e-vapor product, we have not major plans at this stage, but a much more interested in their hybrid and the heated tobacco with the team that has potential in these markets and that's how I see it.We also have more alignment I would say overall, in Korea, that's important for the Korean market. And we also have access from a technology point of view to a country like Korea that is one of the centres for electronics. So I think it's a win-win for both companies. It's a license agreement, the financial works for both of us. So I look forward to working with them and expanding in the right markets offering consumers much more wide range of products.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you. And can you give an update on the impact on new user adoption in Japan from your device price reductions and other initiatives to accelerate IQOS growth in this market over the last year? Are you seeing increasing heated tobacco adoption and trial among the harder to convert later adopters?
André Calantzopoulos: Certainly, we see some. I think the IQOS DUO would help, because consecutive use for some people is important. We addressed this problem with the multi, but now we address it also with the main product and we see better adoption.The pricing is also in general to avoid all these promotions and promotional money, we think that's the right price of the product and we always prepare the portfolio for the next generation that will always come at a premium. So we always reduce the previous version price in view of the forthcoming new version. And as I explained, many times, we have a strategy of having a major innovation every two, three years and significant upgrades every year in the portfolio and that's why we're doing in Japan.So say that there is enormous reduction -- reaction just because we reduced the device prices, it helps, but there is a whole mix that works. We see actually more reaction in Russia where disposable income is really an issue. By having still the 2.4 Plus on the market and IQOS 3, where still a lot of consumers buy the 2.4, because the more price sensitive market.I think the answer is not only pricing, is much more resolving constantly the consumer pain points that are a barrier to entry in the category and that's why we're working on the current version and the forthcoming one. So that's a little bit the philosophy we apply.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe: Hi, I just had a question for you and a bit of a follow-on from earlier question. As you said, your cost per user and acquiring users in IQOS is going down, and I guess I'm interested in that scale effect you have in RRPs. You, obviously, had to spend more money this year but I think at the same time, I'm just trying to understand how you can leverage that infrastructure you have as you think about the launch of Platform 2 or MESH. Is the lot of the same or are a lot of the same resources being used for that? Are those -- I assume they are figured as part of the $300 million to $350 million you cited for this year as you think about the launch cost of those new products.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, obviously, these new products, if you go through our infrastructure, which means our own retail, third-party retail where this kind of franchises. Our own digital platforms now that are put in place, our coaches, obviously you can use the infrastructure you have in a much more efficient way.So I would say that, still the vast majority of the investment during the year is still on IQOS heat-not-burn and we assume even when we are allowed a bit more massively IQOS before it's going to be on a per user basis much cheaper compounded by the fact that we don't have to explain the category to people. We just need to explain to people what the difference is and what the benefits of MESH are compared to existing e-vapor product. So there is no category explanation effort behind. So it will be much cheaper in my view or less expensive than the heat-not-burn product.
Chris Growe: Okay. Yeah, thank you for that. And then one of the follow-up question. And this gets to a question, a bit of a question earlier in your response. But you have seen this -- a number of markets in the EU, where IQOS market share has really accelerated and we talked in the -- couple of -- few years ago about in Japan when you got over that 2% to 2.5% threshold, you start -- started to see market share really accelerate. Are we at that point in the EU? Do we see that in the fourth quarter? Because some of those market share increases are quite notable. Are we at that stage is my question and are you seeing that in more markets, or do you hope to see that more markets in 2020?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, we hope we'll see in more and more markets in 2020. As I said we expect the number of users to grow, which means compared to -- we had 4 million users, we expect a much higher number than that. So I call this acceleration on a same market basis, okay.Look it's the beginning of the year, we feel good about the fourth quarter. We have good momentum going into 2020. We'll keep you up to date on how we progress and that comes at a much lower cost. So I think we're building it pretty nicely.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you for your time.
Operator: We have time for one final question and that is from Gaurav Jain from Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hello, good morning. My question is on the Canadian subsidiary, so can you tell us where we are with the RBH creditor protection negotiations, which are happening?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, they are progressing, but I cannot give you more details. Okay. Still, there is a stay of all litigation and there are discussions to resolve the issue. Once we have something concrete, I can give you more details, but things are progressing.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. A follow-up, on the IQOS MESH launch, so would you consider applying for a PMTA, considering Altria changed some of the language around their Juul agreement, if Juul is not allowed in the market for a year and other things?
André Calantzopoulos: I think we have a lot of plans for before. So, one day, we will probably apply for PMTA in the U.S., but we still have to finalize a few studies on P4, for we have the same type of file as we head for IQOS, but that's important also for many other countries. And in due time, we will discuss if and when we want to enter the U.S. market. The FDA is going to be very busy in the U.S. over the next you know few months on, on all the PMTAs. I don't think that's the appropriate moment to do anything.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. And if I can ask one last question, can you comment on the sell-in versus sell-through trends for IQOS, both in the last quarter and for the full 2019?
Martin King: I'm sorry, the in-market sales versus the shipments or in your words, sell-in versus sell-out, we are approximately equal. If anything actually, the IMS was a little bit more than the shipments. So, there was no inventory change on the year.
Gaurav Jain: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah, it's in line with I said from beginning of the year.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thanks a lot.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay.
Martin King: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A session of today's call. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. I would like to thank you all for joining. First of all, I would say, we had a pretty good 2019. We're entering 2020 in a very good shape. We outlined the one unusual thing that is Indonesia. We think we'd see how this unfolds. We prefer to be cautious about this at the beginning of the year. And just something that is in the air just now, I mean this whole, this issue around the coronavirus. We have no problem today.But clearly, if that continues, there may be some impact on travel and the duty-free and in terms of supply chain; I think we're in pretty good shape for a few weeks. But if that persists for a very long period of time like everybody else, we may have some issues with device supply. Now, that's not a continuation of this like in any company is not baked into our guidance, but we all hope this is going to be soon resolved. So we put it behind us.So, thank you again and I look forward to a pretty good 2020.
Nick Rolli: So, thank you very much. That concludes the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team here in Switzerland. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2019 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI’s Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Comparisons are presented on a like-for-like basis reflecting pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans Benson & Hedges, Inc. or RBH, effective March 22, 2019. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our third quarter results continued to reflect strong underlying business performance. The results include the better-than-anticipated timing of pricing and costs compared to our previously communicated assumptions for the quarter. Our reported results in the quarter were impacted by an after-tax charge in Russia of $315 million, related to a final assessment by the Moscow Tax Authorities on excise taxes and VAT for the 2015 to 2017 period. Additional detail on this charge is provided in today's press release. Total shipment volumes in the third quarter declined by 1.4%. Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements due primarily to the heated tobacco unit inventory reduction in Japan during the third quarter of 2018, our total in-market sales volume declined by 3.6%, reflecting lower cigarette volume, partly offset by strong heated tobacco unit volume growth. Approximately two-thirds of the total in-market sales volume decline was due to three markets, in two of which, the decreases were largely timing related. In Pakistan, our cigarette volume was down by approximately 50%, broadly in line with the industry decline reflecting the timing of excise tax increase announcements compared to last year, as well as the impact of price increases. In Turkey, our cigarette volume decline was due mainly to the impact of two price increases this year, totaling TRY5 per pack or roughly 44% on a weighted-average basis, which disproportionately impacted our share, given the timing of our price increases vis-à-vis the competition. In Indonesia, our cigarette volume declined, mainly reflected lower share, primarily due to widened price gaps between our brands and the competition’s, as well as a lower total market. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume reached 16 billion units in the quarter. Excluding the net favorable impact of inventory movements, primarily related to third-quarter 2018 inventory reduction in Japan, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 28.3%, driven by the EU and Eastern Europe Regions. HTU shipment volume in the quarter was in line with our HTU in-market sales volume of 15.9 billion units. Third-quarter net revenues increased by 7%, excluding currency, driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by lower cigarette shipment volume. RRP net revenues reached $1.3 billion in the quarter, or over 17% of PMI's total net revenues. It is worth noting that our year-to-date September RRP net revenues of $4.1 billion have essentially reached the full-year 2018 total. We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 5.9% in the quarter, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, and Turkey. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 8%, while adjusted operating income margin grew by 40 basis points. This margin expansion was achieved despite net incremental investment behind RRPs in the quarter of approximately $170 million and was driven primarily by favorable geographic mix related to HTUs, reflecting the increased contribution of volume from IQOS geographies with relatively high unit margins, notably markets in the EU region. Our adjusted operating income and margin also benefited from the timing of costs as certain expenditures initially planned for the third quarter were not incurred by quarter-end. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 5.9% excluding currency. The lower currency neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share compared to adjustable operating income notably reflected the high relative growth contribution in the quarter from markets with sizable non-controlling interest, for example, the Philippines with a non-controlling interest of 50%. Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., was essentially stable in the third quarter, reflecting lower share for cigarettes, offset by higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.3%. Our share of the cigarette category declined by 0.4 points, reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS, particularly in the EU region, Japan and Russia, coupled with lower share, notably in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, and Turkey. Importantly, Marlboro share of the cigarette category increased by 0.2 points to 10.2%, driven by Germany, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The share decline in Indonesia primarily reflects the impact of widened price gaps between Sampoerna A, notably a mild and competitive brand, particularly at the bottom of the market. As you may recall, we increased our prices in Indonesia late last year in anticipation of a 2019 excise tax increase that ultimately did not materialize. Our competitors largely maintained their prices, particularly following the government's decision to leave cigarette excise taxes unchanged, leading to the widened price gaps with our brands this year. Although, no formal regulation has yet been issued, the government recently outlined a 2020 cigarette excise tax with an average increase of 23% in exercise and 35% in the minimum band roll price. As the government has not yet announced the increase for each individual tax year, it is difficult to accurately gauge the anticipated volume and share impact in 2020. We do note, however, that while the potential tax pass on is relatively steep in the context of the two-year stack with no excise tax increase in 2019, the average percentage increase is broadly in line with historical levels. Turning now to a more detailed discussion of RRP performance. We estimate that there were approximately $12.4 million IQOS users as of quarter end. We further estimate that 71% of the total or some 8.8 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. IQOS is now commercially available in 51 markets, following recent launches in Belarus, the United Arab Emirates and in the United States. We are particularly excited by the launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria. The first IQOS retail store has opened in the initial lead market of Atlanta, Georgia, marking a historic milestone in providing better alternatives to the 40 million men and women in the U.S. who smoke. IQOS is currently the only heat-not-burn product on the market authorized through the U.S. food and drug administration's PMTA pathway as, "appropriate for the protection of public health". As you are aware, the merger discussions with Altria have ended. Although, this chapter is definitively closed, we have an ongoing relationship with Altria, and both companies will focus on maximizing the IQOS opportunity in the U.S. market. Last month, we took another important step in our journey towards a smoke free future with the launch of IQOS 3 DUO. This latest edition to the IQOS family was designed with enhanced features to help adult smokers switch more seamlessly from cigarettes. IQOS 3 DUO allows two consecutive uses without recharging the holder. While it's charging time is significantly faster compared to IQOS 3, and IQOS 2.4 plus. IQOS 3 DUO is currently available in Japan and will be rolled out in most markets where IQOS is commercially available by the end of this year, further strengthening our smoke free leadership position. Let me now take you through the performance of IQOS in the quarter. In the markets where IQOS has been commercialized, excluding the U.S., our HTU brands recorded a total combined share of 5.1% despite not yet being nationally distributed in many of them. At this share level, our HTU brands would collectively be the fourth largest tobacco brand in these markets, up from number six in the third quarter of last year. In the EU region where we are commercializing IQOS in areas representing approximately 57% of total industry volume, share for each more than doubled in the quarter to reach 2.5%. This growth reflects continued strength across a broad range of markets as detailed in the HTU market share appendix included at the end of today's presentation. On a sequential basis, share increased by 0.1 point compared to the second quarter. Given the impact of higher industry cigarette sales volume reflecting summer seasonality, we believe that this sequential share performance understates the favorable momentum of HEETS. To this point, the end market sales volume for HEETS increased by over 9% sequentially versus the second quarter. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia in the quarter with HEETS share up by 2.9 points to reach 4%. On a sequential basis versus the second quarter, HEETS share increased by 1.1 points while in market sales increased by over 40% to reach 2.4 billion units. HEETS share growth in the quarter was consistent with the pace of adult smokers and our geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in cities, representing approximately half of the market by total industry volume compared to an estimated 40% at the end of the second quarter. In Japan, our total share for HeatSticks and HEETS increased by 1.5 points to reach 17% in the quarter. The initiatives that we introduced during the second quarter of last year continued to pay off and drove a step up in our share performance. On a sequential basis, the share for our HTU brands was up by 0.4 points or stable after adjusting for the estimated impact of trade loading in advance of the October 1st tax and price increases. Importantly, our weekly off take share increased sequentially during the quarter, reaching over 18% by the end of September. While we acknowledge that our off take shares toward the end of the period may have been favorably impacted by consumer loading ahead of the October 1st, our share growth continues in the first week of this month. We are encouraged by our HTU share performance in the face of increased competitive activity as the year has progressed. While the growing number of smoke-free devices and consumables has contributed to competitive churn, IQOS remains the market leader with approximately 73% of HTU category share despite accounting for only around 20% of category SKUs. We believe the launch of IQOS 3 DUO will further reinforce the IQOS family's leadership position. This will be complemented by recent line extensions in our HeatSticks and HEETS line-ups. In Korea, the heated tobacco category remains highly competitive, particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions that are also present in the cigarette category. HEETS share in the third quarter declined by 1.2 points or by 1 point on an adjusted basis. Share for HEETS was also down sequentially versus the second quarter. However, we began to see early signs of stabilization in HEETS off take segment share over the course of the third quarter, supported by recent launches that expanded the flavor line-up. While we are encouraged by this trend, we have a lot of work to do to reinforce the heated tobacco category's benefits and build upon IQOS's leadership position. In this regard, we look forward to the upcoming roll-out of IQOS 3 DUO. Turning now to our full-year outlook. As announced in today's press release, we are revising our 2019 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.73. The $0.21 decrease, compared to our prior guidance on July 18th of at least $4.94, was predominantly due to the $315 million after-tax charge in Russia, noted earlier. Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 per share. After excluding the reporting adjustments and tax items outlined on this slide, our forecast continues to represent a projected currency-neutral increase of at least 9% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018. Our guidance continues to assume an industry total volume decline in 2019 of approximately 2.5%, excluding China and the U.S. As a result of recent cigarette price increases in selected markets, notably the Philippines and Turkey, we now assume a full-year total shipment volume decline rate of 1% to 1.5%, versus approximately 1% previously. This revision solely reflects changes to our full-year cigarette shipment volume outlook. We continue to anticipate full-year HTU shipments volume broadly in line with our HTU in-market sales volume with any inventory movements this year in individual markets, essentially offsetting on an aggregate basis. We are maintaining our full year assumption of currency neutral net revenue growth of at least 6%. This now reflects a higher combustible tobacco pricing variance of approximately 6%, compared to above 5% previously, which is effectively offset by the impact of our revised total shipment volume target. While we continue to anticipate net incremental investments behind RRPs of approximately $400 million, excluding currency, we are refining our currency neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion assumption for the year to approximately 150 basis points from at least 100 basis points previously. In addition, please note that we now expect the full year contribution of IQOS devices to total RRP net revenues to be approximately 15% compared to below 20% previously. This primarily reflects the favorable geographic mix impact of greater HTU volume in relatively high margin geographies, notably markets in the EU region, the longer lifespan of the latest IQOS devices compared to prior versions, and the impact of IQOS device retail price changes in select markets. We now anticipate full year operating cash flow of approximately $9.2 billion subject to year-end working capital requirements. The change, compared to our prior assumptions of approximately $9.5 billion, reflects the impact of the after-tax charge in Russia. Separately, we now expect 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, compared to approximately $1.1 billion previously. Dividends remain the primary use of our operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 2.6% to $1.17 per share. This equates to a total quarterly dividend of approximately $1.8 billion, or approximately $7.3 billion annually. To close on our full year guidance and assumptions, I would like to touch on our anticipated fourth quarter performance. Importantly, we expect currency neutral net revenue and adjusted operating income growth to be in line with our year-to-date September results. However, our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth will be lower than our year-to-date September performance due to the following factors. An unfavorable income tax rate comparison of roughly 4 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2018, during which our three month tax rate benefitted from the full year impact of further clarifications related to the U.S. tax reform. And a continued high relative adjusted operating income growth contribution from markets with sizable non-controlling interest. We expect these two factors to serve as a drag of approximately 9 percentage points on our fourth quarter currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth rate compared to our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17 in the fourth quarter of 2018. To conclude, we recorded strong underlying business performance in the third quarter, reflecting the quality of our execution against each of the key metrics of net revenues, operating income, margin and diluted EPS on a currency neutral adjusted basis. The fundamentals supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio are intact. The favorable momentum for IQOS continues across geographies, further supporting our confidence in our HTU shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021. We are excited by the recent launch of IQOS in the U.S. and the global launch of IQOS 3 DUO. Finally, on a currency neutral basis, we are maintaining our full-year 2019 growth assumption for net revenues of at least 6%, and our anticipated full year 2019 growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS of at least 9%. Thank you. I'm now happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will not conduct a question-and-answer portion of conference. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: My first question for you, and I think you did a good job explaining from a high level just that you do have more pricing coming through in the combustible business in relation, and therefore there is a negative volume implication, certainly in this quarter there was. Is that just -- was the timing to tax increases or were there certain markets you'd call out, if you said those I'm sorry I missed them, but . I just want to get a little more color on that to understand the implication to the guidance for year and for volume?
Martin King: Yes, the two markets to call out are Turkey and Philippines. Remember, in Turkey, we had a tax increase back in April, and the pass on was about TRY4.20. And at the time, we took TRY2 shortly thereafter, amidst a lot of scrutiny on inflation from the government. At the time, also, the other competitors did not move immediately and we lost quite a bit of share. And now we've been able to take another TRY3 in August, which the other competitors also followed immediately. And so, you're seeing basically our opportunity to take pricing in Turkey come with the situation. We're taking it as soon as we can, but we're in fact a little bit late. Now, we've been able to pass the full tax and a little bit more. So, we're on track in turkey after having to delay a bit the pricing from what we would have normally done. And the second one to call out is the Philippines. There was a tax increase announced to take effect in January 2020. The tax goes from 35 pesos per pack to 45 pesos per pack, and you're seeing us move ahead of that with pricing that started already in August, late August, now that we have clarity on the tax to come, and also because in Philippines, once the tax is clear, the trade will tend to try to buy more volume and take some of the benefits from the tax increase. So those two are situations where we're taking pricing as we can get it. We were obviously doing very well with volume through the first half of the year. And you see us now in the second half moving a little more with pricing in a couple of markets. But if you look at -- stand back and look at the full year picture, where we're saying volume down 1 to 1.5, pricing at 6%. It's actually a pretty good balance. And our overall share for the year we anticipate to be positive against the industry decline of 2.5. So when you look at the bigger picture long term, it's a very nice balanced mix between volume, share, and pricing.
Chris Growe: I just had a second question, if I could, in relation to IQOS and RRPs. And you have a -- if my math is right here, if my numbers are right. You have -- you had inventory builds, I'm trying to get to in RRPs year-to-date. Does that come out in the fourth quarter as we think about your inventory that being a factor for your shipments for the year? You did mention that in-market sales should roughly approximate your shipments. So, I just want to put those two numbers. And then just to think about your RRP revenue in the fourth quarter, have you given any color around that sort of the degree to which that should grow, with the degree to which these inventory changes, if they do occur, could weigh on that in the quarter?
Martin King: Let me be crystal clear on RRP HTU inventory. There has been no inventory build and there will be no inventory build for this year. Our in-market sales and our shipments for the full year will be approximately the same, and they were also -- even in the quarter, we had 16 billion of shipments and 15.9 billion of in-market sales. What you're seeing, Chris, I think maybe there's some confusion, is it last year in the third quarter, we drew inventories down in Japan, in particular, around 4 billion units. So, the reference to ex-inventory is so that you can compare apples-to-apples, what it is essentially saying is add 4 billion back to last year to make the comparisons equal. But this year, our inventories are flat for HTUs and so forth. And in fact, we don't anticipate, by the end of the year, any inventory builds really in HTUs or cigarettes. We should end the year fairly lean on inventory.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Looking at Indonesia, you've called out the volume headwinds in this quarter, but on a year, you're slightly up. How do you reconcile that with the price gaps that you've cited as a headwind for the quarter? And then just looking ahead, what should we think for the outlook for the market? I know you don’t have some of the tax tier detail yet, but in terms of just where you sit from the category standpoint, can you give a sense of what 2020 might look like?
Martin King: So, for Indonesia, the overall market so far this year is up slightly. As you would expect with no tax increase and very muted pricing, we are losing some share. As we mentioned in the script, the price gap between our premium brands and the low end is hurting our share, but it's also causing some mix erosion as volume trades down. We do have some new initiatives at the lower price tiers that we're doing very well, but within our portfolio, we're being dragged by mix, as well as by the overall share loss. And so our shipments for the year are coming in slightly negative -- year-to-date are coming in slightly negative as well. Now as far as the situation in Indonesia, going forward, the government has said they're going to increase the tax. They've used the number 23%. It's not final and hasn't been released, particularly by taxed year. They've also said though that the banderole price, minimum price would go by 35%, which would have a very positive effect from the point of view of this mix issue, because it would cause the low end of the market to move up and close some of the gaps that have been the biggest problem for government revenue collection, as well as for our own mix issues. Now the total volume, it's hard to estimate, going forward, until we see the details, on both the increased the amount but also by individual tiers. But overall when you look at the increase of tax of 23% over two year period and realize that the pass on actual retail price is lower than the full 23%, it's not a disaster from that point of view. Although, we will have the challenge next year of going into the year without a lot of annualization of pricing that we normally have because of the way the Indonesian market works with lots of small price increases. So Indonesia, I guess the longer term big picture, resetting the gaps, perhaps having a chance to address some of this mixed issue, is net positive. However, the challenge for next year will be the overall lack of annualization on pricing and the potential impact on the volume due to the relatively larger size increase all at once as opposed to coming over a period of time. So we'll wait and see what Indonesia unfolds. But it gives us some opportunities as well.
Michael Lavery: And just on Japan, you've called out some headwinds from down trading as well for the cigarillos. Can you just give a sense of how to think about that segment? And is there more of a headline from that going forward we should anticipate?
Martin King: Yes, there are couple of things to know about the cigarillos segment. One is it's not considered in the cigarettes and HTUs to overall cigarette volume that we've been using as the basis. So as cigarillos grow, we may have some distortions coming from that that we'll have to explain in quarters going forward, and we'll break that out for you. The cigarillo category benefits from a preferential tax, if you will. We don't know whether this will last. Likely, I think eventually, the government will close this situation, because cigarillos, for example, can be priced below cigarettes at the bottom of the market and still have higher margins. Now, it was initially a category that was opened and JT, when the Class D product separate tax category phased out, they actually transferred some of the Class C brands over into cigarillos. So we would guesstimate that, probably by the end of this year, it could be $3 billion to $4 billion total year number for cigarillos. So it's starting to get big enough to have an impact on the total market. Obviously, we all think this category should have preferential tax going forward. But we'll have to monitor this situation and decide we ourselves would have to compete in it at some point in order to not be at a disadvantage. But overall, I think the situation in Japan with our focus being on heated tobacco and IQOS, and the real benefits coming from our gains in those categories, are a net positive right now.
Michael Lavery: One quick last one. You mentioned in duty free some headwinds from China, in particular, having a little bit more enforcement on what people are allowed to bring in to that market. Clearly, there's some consumer interest in that country. Can you give an update on what if any status change you may have had in your negotiations with CNTC to potentially launch with some sort of joint venture, or something in China?
Martin King: I really don't have any news with regards to our cooperations with CNTC. We continue to hope that the RRPs and IQOS in particular is an area for potential cooperation, but we don't have any additional progress on that. You're right. Duty free numbers have been affected by the fact that the allowances, the amount of a product that individual tourists or travellers are allowed to bring back into China, has been reduced and more strictly enforced. And that is having impact on what was a very robust duty free business of HTU, not just to travellers from China but other countries as well. And you see in the numbers for the Middle East, Africa, duty free that HTU is down this quarter. It's partly because of the comparison whereas last year we were ramping up and building some inventory that deal with higher sales. This year, we're in a reverse situation where we're bringing some of the volume down in order to account for the new situation with the traveller limits. So it's pretty big swing but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not major. And as I said before, the total sales and shipments for our heated tobacco units around the world were equal for the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on your guidance for Q4. You mentioned EPS growth will be below year-to-date trend. So just wondering how much lower? You talked about, I think, a 9 point drive from the factors you mentioned, Martin. But shouldn't that be offset by your expectations for stronger margin expansion? So just trying to get a sense if you're expecting Q4 EPS growth closer to your full year guidance of 9% or below? And I guess I'm really trying to get a sense of how conservative this might be, especially given the momentum you're seeing in your business?
Martin King: The answer is we expect IT to be well below the EPS number, or below where we have been year-to-date. We would expect the operating income and revenues to be in line with where we are year-to-date. But the drop off from operating income to earnings per share is quite steep, driven primarily by this big difference in corporate tax rate. Last year in the fourth quarter, we were catching up on positive news and interpretations of the U.S. tax act, and we have the benefits for the full year hitting in one quarter. So we had a relatively low corporate tax rate in the fourth quarter last year. This year, it's little bit of a different story that we're slightly behind our 23% projection for the full year so far through the year. So in the fourth quarter, we would expect the tax rate to make up that difference and bring us back to 23%. So the gap between the two years is 4 percentage points, which is pretty big impact. And then on top of that, you have this non-controlling interest line, which is being as effective as it's already even in Q3 you see it, but it's even more pronounced in Q4. The two markets we called out with significant pricing, just to put it in perspective. In Turkey, the pricing was over 40% and in Philippines, it was just below 40% at 37%. So these two markets with very significant pricing are bringing bigger increases than other markets obviously in operating income et cetera. However, they have non-controlling interest. We called out Philippines with 50% non-controlling interest. So you're sharing some of that big increase with your partners. And therefore, the step down of those two, the tax and the non-controlling interest, we call that as a 9 percentage point drag versus the number last year, which was $1.17 on the adjusted pro forma basis. So it's a very large gap between the OI and the EPS number, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: And then actually I wanted to ask you about the deal talks with Altria, if I may. I know they've ended. But I'd be curious to hear why you considered merging with Altria to begin with? And then why the timing was right? And I guess when the talks started, I'd like to hear from you how you were thinking about the U.S. market, and then how that in fact maybe changed given of course, the talks have ended? And then just in terms of talking with some of the investors over the last month, month and half. There was a fair amount of concern that maybe you were seeing something in your business that made you feel compelled to maybe seek a deal. So if you could just touch on that, I think that would be really helpful. Thank you.
Martin King: So Altria discussions were a natural outgrowth. The fact that we were launching IQOS in the U.S., we had PMTA approval. So it's natural, I think, for the two companies to sit down and discuss whether that's the best arrangement or whether there was other alternatives, for example, a merger. And whenever you're looking at a merger between two companies the first thing you start to look for are our strategic benefits, primarily synergies around revenue. And in our case, obviously, it was about RRP portfolios and having the right product mix for the future of a combined company potentially, having a better opportunity with wider range of products. We were looking at the U.S. market being very profitable, very large, 20 billion profitability in that market, with growing profitability over time. Obviously, you look at cost synergies, although, that wasn't really a key driver here. And then regulatory synergies, because from our perspective the U.S. market has pretty big role in setting the regulatory framework for the world. So we looked at all these different categories and then we put it also into the larger context. And one of the big things was the environment was developing rather rapidly as we were in these discussions with all the news around e-vapor and the regulatory approach from FDA, et cetera. We also got pretty clear feedback from our shareholders. We have lot of questions about whether this would make sense. And shareholders feeling that they could, if they wanted to, be exposed to the U.S. market by Altria separately, they didn't need PMI to do that. So we obviously heard quite a bit from shareholders. And then of course, you have the distraction, the management that would come with overcoming the environment, the shareholder feedback, and so forth. So in the end, both management teams decided that the best path was for us to collectively focus on IQOS success in the U.S., which incidentally as this was developing became even more of an opportunity, because we felt that the environments gave IQOS even more of a chance since it's the only heated tobacco market with FDA, PMTA authorization. And so we've chosen this path. We are definitively done with merger discussions. We've chosen the path of working with Altria on IQOS. The merger is off the table. And we're going down a path, which is very promising and we're very happy with. Now as far as concerns about whether this was some way to offset results. I think this quarter's numbers in our picture for the full year I think should give people some confidence on that. I mean, if you step back from the big picture, we've got a very positive situation. We have -- the total industry, they were predicting the down 2.5%, which is at the better end of the range that we've seen long-term for total tobacco industry, ex-U.S. and China. Our volume, we're predicting to come in between 1 and 1.5, meaning we're gaining share, pricing at about 6%. So there's a nice healthy mix between the two. Revenues, we're seeing at least 6% ex-currency adjusted. We're seeing good growth on RRPs and HTUs, particularly coming from markets with high margins like the EU and managing our costs and investments. So you see the margin expanding 150 basis points we're estimating for the full year. And then you see our EPS guidance at least 9% despite the non-controlling interest issue, and so forth. So I think that's a pretty good indication of a very well shaped P&L and a good overall positive business momentum. So I hope people take that as the true picture of a situation, and realize that there was no merit to the idea that the discussion with Altria had anything to do with our base business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Rampton of UBS.
Robert Rampton: Three questions for me, if I may. The first is on Japan. I'm interested to know what the cap rate, in particular versus 2Q. I mean, I can see that your share has improved and you've had competitive launches over the same period and there are more coming. So some color on the overall category will be great.
Martin King: Okay, do you want to take one at a time, or…?
Robert Rampton: Yes, that would be great.
Martin King: So overall heat-not-burn category for Japan continues to grow. From the end of last year till now, it's up about 2 percentage points. We're at about 25% for the total category. We've gained most of that. So we're maintaining, in fact, improving a little bit our segments share. But sequentially, it's not quite so smooth. There was a bigger step up in Q1. It continues to grow. But I think if you look at it more from the beginning of the year, you can see the overall picture with of course, as you mentioned, additional product launches coming from various other competitors. So we're gratified by the category growth and our ability to grow within the category is intact as well. Our segments share is solid and you see that from our exit shares from C-stores at over 18% for this quarter. So I think we're on a on a steady trend of Japan continuing to grow. It's not as fast as, say our Russia, which is growing spectacularly right now. But its good solid growth given the total size of the category and our share, are already very substantial in Japan. And we're also gratified by the DUO. I think the launcher DUO can be underestimated. This product is very positive from the point of view of consumer experience. Those that have been using it, we're surprised at how much of a difference it made, being that you have the tubes experience as anytime you want and the very fast charging time to come back to the first experience. It just makes it seamless. And you don't have to worry about the charging, or waiting, or the device. It's really a very nice step forward as far as the overall consumer experience. So we have high hopes for DUO, particularly in Japan and Korea, where we will focus the first of volumes as we ramp up production.
Robert Rampton: On East Asia and Australia Asia more broadly, so per pack revenue for the region declined a lot kind of sequentially and year-on-year. Trying to understand what's driven that? You flagged some price right downs and inventory right downs, you have -- it’s been kind of there and specifically what the run rate is in that market?
Martin King: Well, we did have some device price adjustments in the quarter. In Japan, we used to have a pricing ladder. There was more or less ¥1,198,000 for three multi and 2.4 plus. Now in Japan, 2.4 Plus is almost gone very, few people buy it. It's doing very well in other markets. But in Japan, we now have DUO coming in at 10,000 essentially and then multi three and multi fill out the pricing ladder down from there. And one of the consequences of reducing the pricing for the existing inventories of three and multi and a little bit of 2.4 Plus is yes, we did have to revalue the inventories in Japan. So you see that one time effect hitting the quarter. So it's probably disproportionate to what's really happening with pricing, because you're taking an inventory and revaluing it as opposed to just having the effect of the sales that you actually made in the quarter. Does that make sense?
Robert Rampton: It does, yes. And can you just give us -- if you could quantify that number?
Martin King: No, I mean I think you see it in the pricing line and in that line there if you can try to pick out the effect. So we haven't given individual inventory revaluation type numbers.
Robert Rampton: And my last question. Just can we get a color market share in the UK and specifically London? I mean, just anecdotally. I've seen a lot of it around and obviously, the market where e-cigarette use is very high and we've also cut prices. So I'm curious to hear how IQOS is doing in this market?
Martin King: Yes, IQOS is doing better in London and the UK, admittedly from a relatively small base. But it's up itself over 1% in London, depending on how you define the city, right? But it's doing much better. It's grown at a much faster rate in the last few months than it was before. And we're encouraged by the pickup that we're seeing in the UK and in London, in particular. Now it's from a small base and we have obviously many other markets where the share is much higher. But it's very good to see it moving and we anticipate better results coming forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: I have a follow up question on your discussions with Altria. Were there any changes to your agreement with Altria on IQOS that emerged from the merger discussions that more closely align each of your interests? And is there sufficient incentive for Altria to invest behind and push the product?
Martin King: Yes. I mean, I think one of the benefits of the merger discussions and going through all the discussions about how we would align et cetera, is that we came out of this period with better understanding of each other and better alignment, both regulatory and how we would go about IQOS et cetera. The current agreement is the one we had before that we're continuing to commercialize under. But I think we did come out of this whole thing with better alignment, better understanding better push for IQOS in the U.S. And I think given the news flow around the e-vapor and everything else, I think we both agree that there is even more of an opportunity for IQOS in the U.S. than we might have understood a few months ago. And if there were any doubts about Altria's alignment and interest behind IQOS, I think it's very clear they are fully focused on it. They were before but even more so perhaps now that IQOS has even bigger opportunity in the U.S., given the news flow and the whole situation around e-vapor. Now, I mean, we haven't disclose the terms of the agreement. But Altria has very good incentives to make sure that IQOS does very well. And we're very happy with the arrangement, the agreement, their execution in Atlanta, so far has been excellent. And we look forward to some good success coming out of that.
Pamela Kaufman: And just related to that. Are you seeing any impact from the healthcare around vaping in the U.S. on consumer attitudes towards our view outside of the U.S, given the potential for this issue creates confusion among consumers? Do you want to see any impact on IQOS's performance?
Martin King: We don't. Although, we are working hard to make sure that IQOS is distinguished from the issues in the U.S.; making sure it's understood that this is not an e-cigarette, this is a heated tobacco product; making sure it's understood our track record. We have 12 million plus users now. We have very good conversion practices to make sure that we're focused on adult smokers. We have lots of experience in over 50 markets, with making sure that the people that convert to IQOS are former adult smokers. We also emphasize that this is scientifically substantiated product. We've got the FDA authorization. So we're able to really make sure that the IQOS heat-not-burn is in a different category. At the same time, when we're engaging with regulators and others, we're very clear to say that the issues that they're hearing about in the U.S. are not coming from authentic properly manufactured close system e-cigarettes. In other words, it would be unfortunate for a properly manufactured, properly regulated e-cigarette to be caught up in this issue around the unfortunate illnesses and very unfortunate deaths that have been reported in the U.S. We understand that is a different issue from a properly done e-cigarette, like we will have or do have already, but we'll have better versions of with our MESH. And so we have worked hard to both make sure that it's understood what e-cigarettes are and how they can be properly regulated to make sure these issues don't evolve. But also to make sure that they understand the heat-not-burn and IQOS are truly a different category and shouldn't be even in the discussion around the issues they're hearing about from the U.S. I mean when it comes to the youth access issue, this is where we focus on our good conversion practices and are very stringent focus on adult smokers.
Pamela Kaufman: And should we expect you to file any PMTA applications next year, maybe related to IQOS MESH?
Martin King: With regard to IQOS MESH, as you know we have the improved device. We are working very hard to ramp up our production. We are on track to be able to launch in a market this year. And we are very much focused on expanding production and capacity so that we can satisfy a number of international markets next year. So our full focus with MESH is in international markets. Obviously, we're focused in the U.S. on IQOS heat-not-burn and the agreement with Altria. Now, with regard to MESH, we are putting together a package of scientific substantiation, which we could use in the future with a number of different regulators and that work needs to happen regardless. So that's our plan for MESH is to get it into as many markets internationally as we can. At the end of this year starting, but really next year is the big ramp up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: I want to ask you sort of more general question, because this is not I didn't understand about these results. The first thing was that the margin was substantially better than certainly I was expecting. Are the two key results you said you'd be investing much more heavily in the first quarter but that you said that didn't seem to come through, and I was just wondering why? You also said that part of the reason for the good margin growth was that you've actually done very well in high margin markets for RRP, specifically the EU. And yet at the same time, the market share growth in the EU, as you said yourself, was a little bit disappointing. So I'm wanting if you can sort of bring all those things together. Why was the margin so strong? When frankly, you said it probably wouldn't be in 3Q. And if you can give a little bit more color about what you sort of think the underlying market share for such a thing in the EU is for IQOS? Thank you. That would be the first question.
Martin King: First of all, with regard to why the margin was better, it's two things. One is additional pricing, which we called it out for Philippines, Turkey, as two examples. The other piece is costs were lower into third quarter shifting to the fourth quarter. You're right, the $170 million for RRP related investment compares to the $200 million that we have said and planned. But there are also some additional costs throughout various areas of the company that shifted. The total impact is probably about $30 million for the RRPs and about $40 million or $50 million for all the other costs netted together. So when you move that from one quarter to the other, it has a pretty significant impact. And I would emphasize, this isn't spending lower spending, primarily it's just movement from one quarter to the next, hence the fourth quarter impact. Now as far as talking about when we called out the EU impact of higher margin volume coming from HTUs that was more of a total year picture when we were explaining the device wait in the margin, I mean, in the RRP revenues being around 15% to help folks with their modeling and so forth. Now for EU, growth during the quarter, you're right. Sequentially, the share growth was about 0.1, which was not as much as you might expect, especially since the end market sales we're up 9%. So you have a seasonality impact where cigarette volume sales are higher in the summer. And that obscured the fact that HTUs were actually up very nicely at 9%. And if you look at the year-over-year, the share was up more than doubled from 1.2 to 2.5. So the EU growth rate is continuing at a very nice cliff. It's obscured a bit just when you look sequentially in the quarter. And we always said share, in particular, tends to be a little bit lumpy. When we look at user acquisition, we look at in market sales, those are more direct leading indicators of where it's going. And the momentum in the EU is very solid, very good. And that will eventually of course lead to continued improvement in margin as the volumes in the EU are already very significant by the way. If you look at the number of units shipped but they're growing at a very nice pace. And of course, they're coming with substantially higher margins than the average elsewhere.
Adam Spielman: I mean, certainly, the 40 or 50 movements in 4Q does I mean this is very minor and perhaps I shouldn't waste your time even asking it. A quick follow up questions is it's in my look. I mean why seasonality affects cigarettes more than the HTUs in the EU, it appears to me? But there's -- the more important point is if you can try and give some color about Russia, because in Russia things are clearly going well. But again, it seems very volatile. You had I thought excellent growth sequentially in Q1 and it went backwards in Q2 than even more surprising, but very sharp growth sequentially in Q3. How should we think about the passing of this? And how, I guess -- also congratulate EU. I mean, should we think or if you're modeling this. Should we just assume, I don't know 20 or 30 bps of market share expansion a quarter, I don't average it will have work out and equally in Russia. How should we think about it given the volatility in market shares you're reporting?
Martin King: So first just quickly the seasonality topic, because it does also affect Russia. What we're seeing is that heated tobacco units' seasonality is different from combustible cigarettes. And one of the reasons is because people are more likely to use it indoors. So the cigarette consumption in Europe, for example, increases as people have more time outdoors during the summer months. But for HTUs, it doesn't seem to move as much, because people can use it more into their houses et cetera without bothering others. And so they feel much less constrained about their cigarette -- their consumption of HTUs depending on how the weather is. And this also partly is your answer on Russia. If you remember in the first quarter, we called out that the share for HTUs in Russia was flattered by the fact that the consumption of cigarettes was much lower during the super cold weather. And that's because you don't want to go outside to use one. And so it's on the other way in a slightly different quarter in Russia, and help to explain some of that difference in share. And we topped down the share in Russia in first quarter, and we were right. It came back in and showed exactly where we were in the second quarter. And here you have the opposite effect going on in the EU, because of the warm summer months' seasonality impact. And we saw that also, by the way, in Korea and elsewhere that these seasonality impacts are part of explaining the reason why the share tends to come a bit lumpy. Again, we have underlying view on how fast we're acquiring consumers, and that's really our focus and our biggest forward looking number. We've been giving that number on an aggregate basis, and you see it and the step up this quarter to over 12 million. And casing we've given it broken to regions, but that's probably our best way of having a look forward on what's coming this year.
Adam Spielman: And you can't give us a year of sort of underline -- so in Japan, you sort of talked about underlying market share was essentially flat. You can't talk about something like that in the EU, or in Russia but it's just somehow an adjusted figure, but try to exclude some of the volatility practice?
Martin King: I mean, we went down that path in Japan, because of the heightened concerns and because of the issues we'd had about shares and being impacted by competitor inventories and so forth. I mean, I hesitate to get into that sort of reporting everywhere in the world. We've done it sort of on a temporary basis to try to give people more transparency on the Japan situation, given where we were last year. But I don't think we need to go into that with EU. We're growing very nicely. We're delivering the results. We see this strong year-over-year. There's no slowdown in momentum in the EU. So I think we will stick with what we got. And eventually even in Japan and other places, we may stop doing that extra transparency once it's no longer needed.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So I wanted to touch on IQOS in the U.S. please. In looking at the introductory bundle that's being sold, it seems like it's a very attractive proposition for the consumer at $80 for carton of consumables plus advice. Would you be able to comment at all on who is funding that promo? Because it seems like the implied price of the device is $25, which is far lower than what I've seen even on a promoted basis in international markets.
Martin King: Yes, I think I'm going to leave those sorts of questions to Altria who is commercializing IQOS in the U.S. The answer is funding it. I mean, they are responsible for the commercial expenditures around the launch. And so the answer would be, it would be their program and their funding, and their decision on how to approach the consumer in the U.S. Obviously, we've shared with them and continue to share with them all of our experiences from around the world, and what we've seen in the many markets we've launched in. But it's their program and their decision on it. And I think I'll leave it to them to answer those specific questions like that.
Vivien Azer: And then my second question also on IQOS in the U.S., I can certainly appreciate the optimism that you're expressing on the call today, in particular in light of growing concerns around potential health effects with liquid e-vapor, but as I reflect back on some of the pre marketing consumer work that you guys did in the U.S. relative to some of the other countries where you were running similar consumer trials. If I recall correctly, U.S. trial and conversion looks closer to Italy, or Switzerland than it did, even in Germany but certainly not a Japan, or South Korea. But if you could just remind us why you have so much confidence? Because yes, like Italy certainly, at this point in a 4.6% share, is clearly a success story, but it was five years in the making. Thanks.
Martin King: I think we've said in the past that if you look at consumer readiness for reduced risk products and the openness to switching out of smoking that we see a lot of receptivity. We said in the U.S. the ability to communicate with consumers is actually very good. There are rules around how we need to report and do it with the FDA, given the pre market authorization. But compared to other countries around the world, the ability to communicate with consumers is very good. Now, as far as any studies you might be referring to, Vivien, I would imagine they're very old by now, if you're talking about studies done back when we were looking at Italy and Japan. They would be about five years old, or more by now. And you have a tremendous fee change in the U.S. with regard to people's receptivity to reduce risk products, understanding of the issues around smoking, et cetera. So  So we have high confidence that the U.S. will perform well. And we've always said it's probably somewhere in between where the EU has taken time and energy, because of the consumer receptiveness and the ability to communicate. And it probably won't be as quick as say Japan or Korea started out, where they were -- it was a phenomenon and it kind of took off on us. So we'll see, right, it's early days. But we have heightened expectations given the news flow that's happening to U.S., if you're a smoker and considering alternatives. And this is the only product with PMTA authorization in the heated tobacco space, and it's got your taste and performance very, very well. I mean, I think it's got to be very high consideration, maybe even higher than it would have been a couple of months ago. So I think that's where we are on the U.S. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: So on the CapEx decline of $100 million for this year. Is it because it shifted to us by '20, or there is a change to growth expectations?
Martin King: Neither. We've sharpened our pencils. We are better and better at getting more capacity out of the existing assets, particularly when it comes to production of heated tobacco units. Our uptimes keep improving. Our waste rates keep declining. Our ability of our factories to produce efficiently continues to improve beyond our initial expectations. And so we've been able to scale back some of the investments. And usually at the beginning of the year, we put our capacity plans down as best we can. But there is a probably a little bit of opportunities to sharpen the pencil and cleanup the estimates, and come to a closer number and we're near the end of the year now. So we've been able to revise and refine our numbers and come to the billion. But it's not shifting to next year nor is it an indication of not needing the capacity. If anything, our capacity is in line with our $90 billion to $100 billion estimate that we have for -- by 2021. We're well on track to hit that and that's the capacity number we're focused on for heated tobacco units, as well as of course preparing for MESH and the e-cigarette platform for ramp up that I mentioned earlier.
Gaurav Jain: Now coming to the new product categories, so there is a lot of discussion around modern oral. Do you have any plans in that category?
Martin King: Around which category?
Gaurav Jain: Around the modern oral category? 
Martin King: I mean we continue to monitor. We look at it very closely. But yes, right now, we don't have a modern oral product on the market. But we certainly have studied it and looked at it. And most of our markets right now today, we don't have huge oral category. But we are interested in that product, because it is reduced risk product category and we think it may play a role in the future.
Gaurav Jain: And my last question is just on the stock price, so you know your stock is where it was in 2011. Can you do something to change the trajectory? Like launch a share buyback, such as Progressive. Now that your balance sheet is more under control, you're not planning M&A. There doesn't seem to be any obvious escalation for you out there.
Martin King: Well, with regard to stock buybacks. We've said that our focus in the interim time next 18 months or so is to get into the leverage ratios that go with our mid-single A credit rating, and we are committed to that. And you see us slowly deleveraging over the last period, and we'll continue to do that. Once we get into the range for the mid-single A, then the board would be able to reconsider starting stock buybacks. I'd share with you that perhaps the underlying feeling that our stock is a good buy, but we aren't ready yet to be able to -- to start a buyback program until we get our leverage ratios to the range as it goes with our mid-single A rating.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question [Operator instructions]. Our final question will come from the one line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Just one question for me then, so on the earnings guidance you called out the higher growth in market to sizable non-controlling interest. I was just hoping you could provide a bit more specifics here in terms of which markets they are, what sort of growth you're actually seeing in operating income and also what is driving the strong growth? Thank you.
Martin King: The one we called out and it's probably the best explanation for this, is Philippines with 50% non-controlling interest in the Philippines. And we haven't given the specific market profitability. But you can see from the pricing and from the fact that our Marlboro share, for example, is way up as we get up trading. Marlboro has now hit 40% share this quarter. So you can see in the Philippines, I think, or you can sense in the Philippines that the profitability is up substantially. Obviously, we share that with our partners with 50%. So when your overall growth in the operating income line is being boosted by an affiliate like the Philippines and then half of it goes to the non-controlling interest, when you go to the EPS, that growth there is not obviously as pronounced. Turkey is another example where there is a non-controlling interest. And there are others, I'm not going to go through the whole list. But you can see, I believe in the P&L, you see the non-controlling interest line and you see this been growing. And it's pretty substantial on third quarter and we expect it to take another significant step up in the fourth quarter as the full impact of the pricing in countries like and affiliates like Philippines and Turkey kick in since their pricing only started partway through the second quarter, I mean, the third quarter. In the case of the Philippines, it was the end of August. In the case of Turkey, it was in August as well. So the fourth quarter will see another step up in non-controlling interest.
Operator: And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
A - Martin King: Yes, I mean, I think I just like to close with the thought that our overall year is showing very good momentum. We pointed a little bit to the fourth quarter, and that we expect the currency neutral growth of net revenues and adjusted operating income to be in line with our year-to-date. However, the impact of the non-controlling interest and the tax rate differential leads us to about a 9% drag at the EPS line.  Nevertheless, I think if you stand back and look at the big picture, we have a very positive year with good momentum going forward with nice balance between volume, share, pricing, margin expansion and the growth of heated tobacco units, especially coming from some higher margin locations like EU. We're seeing broad geographic success of heated tobacco units, and our smoke free future strategy is paying off throughout the results of the company as well. So I think that would close it. And thank you all very much for listening.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Philip Morris International's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Comparisons presented on a like-for-like basis reflected pro forma 2018 results which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. effective March 22, 2019. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. Building on our encouraging start to the year, we delivered very solid performance in the second quarter, notably reflecting positive momentum for both our combustible tobacco and smoke free product portfolios and strong currency neutral adjusted financial results. Key among our strength in the second quarter was our volume performance. On a like-for-like basis, total shipment volume declined by 0.7% in the quarter and increased by 0.1% June year-to-date. This performance was better than we had anticipated notably driven by the EU region. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 37% to 15.1 billion units in the quarter driven by the EU region, Eastern Europe region and Japan. Second quarter net revenues increased by 9% excluding currency on a like-for-like basis driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio. Our performance was flattered by the timing of pricing in certain markets compared to the prior year, which contributed an estimated two percentage points to net revenue growth. RRP net revenues reached nearly $1.5 billion in the quarter or nearly 20% of PMI’s total net revenues. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% of RRP net revenues compared to approximately 19% in the second quarter of 2018. We recorded a strong like-for-like combustible pricing variance of over 6% in the quarter, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, and Turkey. We have recently increased our cigarette prices in markets such as Mexico and Ukraine, which should further contribute to a positive pricing variance over the balance of 2019. On a currency-neutral like-for-like basis, adjusted operating income increased by 15.7% in the second quarter, while adjusted operating income margin increased by 240 basis points. The strong margin expansion was driven primarily by favorable geographic volume from high cost geographies with relatively high unit margins, notably markets in the EU region. Like-for-like adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% excluding currency, driven by our strong business performance. Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.1 percentage point to reach 28.3% in the second quarter. This growth was driven by heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.5 points to reach 2.1% reflecting broad based share gains across the EU region and in Japan and Russia. In the markets where I QOS has been commercialized, our HTU brands recorded a total combined share of nearly 5% in the quarter, despite not yet being fully distributed in many of them. Our share performance for cigarettes in the quarter reflected continued adult smoker out switching to IQOS as well as an estimated adverse impact of a proxy point two points related to Turkey, due to the timing of price increases vis-à-vis the competition. We expect our share performance in Turkey to improve over the balance of the year. Turning now to RRPs. We surpassed 11 million IQOS users as of quarter end. Approximately 70% of the total or some 8 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. In the EU region, HEETS continued its sequential quarterly share growth increasing by 0.3 percentage points to reach 2.4%. This growth reflects success across a broad range of markets with varying regulatory frameworks and adult smoker preferences. We have achieved significant progress with IQOS across the region over the past year as evidenced by the HEETS market shares shown on this slide. This includes strong growth in some of our larger markets such as Italy, Poland and Germany as well as even faster growth in other markets, such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic. HEETS continued its strong performance in Russia in the quarter, with sequential in market sales growth of over 23% and national share of 29%. As a reminder, our first quarter HEET share was flattered by the impact on the total market of seasonally lower cigarette industry volume. In market sales volume progression therefore remains a more realistic indicator of the brand's trajectory. For reference, we estimate a first quarter adjusted share of 2.3% implying sequential share growth of point six points in the second quarter. We continued our geographic expansion during the quarter, and are now commercializing IQOS in cities representing an estimated 40% of the market by total industry volume, compared to approximate 32% at the end of the first quarter. In Japan, our total share for HeatSticks and HEET increased by 1.1 points versus the second quarter of 2018 to reach 16.6% further demonstrating that the initiatives we introduced during the second half of last year are paying off and driving a step up in our share performance. After adjusting for the impact of estimated trade inventory movements, which benefited our first quarter share this year, our share was stable on a sequential basis. We continue to anticipate greater competitive activity in the category as the year progresses. While this may increase competitive churn among adult consumers over the short term as they try new products, we ultimately view this as a positive development for the category overall and for IQOS in particular. As I will cover later in my remarks, we're investing behind further enhancements to the IQOS 3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand's leadership position. Importantly, share for both the heated tobacco category and our heated tobacco brands continued to grow sequentially in the quarter, based on the latest consumer off-take share data. In Korea, the heated tobacco category continues to be highly competitive particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions. Share for HEET declined by 0.7 points and was stable on a sequential basis at 7.3%. This performance was flattered by the impact of inventory movements as seen from the adjusted market share progression. We attribute the current share dynamics mainly to competitive churn as new devices and consumables from the competition have entered the market and experienced initial trial. We plan to broaden our portfolio of HEET to better address the unique taste preferences of adult tobacco consumers in Korea and have related launches scheduled for the second half of 2019. In addition, like Japan, Korea will be an initial focused geography for the upgraded IQOS3 device. It is important to remember that aside from Japan and Korea, our focus for IQOS across most launch markets remains targeted to key cities. These city level shares compare very favorably to the corresponding national shares and provide an encouraging indicator of the greater opportunity that can come with broader focus and support in IQOS markets. Before closing on IQOS, I would also like to reiterate our excitement over the prospects for IQOS in the U.S. As a reminder, on April 30th, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that the marketing of IQOS is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. We are excited to bring IQOS to the U.S. market to an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc. whose subsidiary Philip Morris USA has the market expertise and infrastructure to ensure a successful launch, beginning with the initial lead market of Atlanta Georgia. Turning to our full year outlook, we are raising our 2019 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.94. The $0.07 increase compared to our prior guidance on May 1st of at least $4.87 was be driven by stronger business performance primarily reflecting better shipment volume and a tax benefit of $0.04 related to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the year 2015 to 2018, partly offset by asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $0.02 per share related to a plant closure in Colombia as part of our global manufacturing infrastructure optimization. Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share with just $0.01 in the second half of the year. Items outlined on this slide, our forecast represents a projected currency neutral like-for-like increase of at least 9% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $4.84 in 2018. Our increased guidance now assumes a total shipment volume decline of approximately 1% on a like-for-like basis versus a decline of 1.5% to 2% assumed previously. We continue to anticipate full year HTU shipment volume broadly in line with our in market sales volume with any net inventory movements in individual markets essentially offsetting on an aggregate basis. For the industry, we now estimate a total volume decline in 2019 of approximately 2.5% excluding China and the U.S. which is at the low end of the previously communicated decline range of 2.5% to 3%. Our increased guidance further assumes like-for-like net revenue growth excluding currency of at least 6% compared to the assumption of at least 5% in our prior guidance. We also now expect IQOS device net revenues to account for less than 20% of our total RRP net revenues in 2019. The change from the previously communicated range of 20% to 25% primarily reflects the favorable geographic mix impact related to HTU shipment volume that I noted earlier. We continue to anticipate a full year like-for-like combustible pricing variance above 5% supported by our June year-to-date variance of 5.2%. This positive top line momentum provides us the opportunity to further increase or advance investment behind IQOS in order to accelerate product and commercial development, expand distribution in both existing and new geographies during the second half of 2019, further enhance the IQOS3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand, and strengthen our category leadership as competition intensifies. Consequently, we now anticipate net incremental investments behind RRPs this year of approximately $400 million compared to our previously disclosed estimate of approximately $300 million. With the majority of the 100 million step up in investment expected to occur in the third quarter. We believe this increased investment will reinforce the positive momentum behind IQOS heading into 2020. Despite the increased investment, we are maintaining our assumption of currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion of at least 100 basis points on a like-for-like basis. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I believe it is appropriate to provide some additional visibility on the third quarter in which we expect currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to be essentially flat compared to our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.35. This estimate assumes a like-for-like currency neutral net revenue growth rate in the quarter slightly below our full year assumption. As I noted earlier compared to last year, our second quarter net revenue growth benefited from the timing of price increases in certain markets and some of this benefit will be offset in the third quarter. We also face a challenging combustible pricing comparison versus the third quarter of 2018, our strongest quarter for pricing last year. Coupled with our top line assumption, our third quarter EPS estimate also reflects higher expected costs on a like-for-like basis. This is primarily due to our net incremental investments behind RRPs with about half of the full year total of approximately $400 million expected to come in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow of approximately $95 billion subject to year-end working capital requirements as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. In conclusion, we're building upon our promising start to the year and delivering a very solid performance in the second quarter. The fundamental supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio are intact. The favorable momentum for IQOS continues across geographies, further supporting our confidence in our HTU shipment volume targets of 90 units to 100 billion units by 2021. Finally, on a currency-neutral like-for-like basis, we have increased our full year 2019 growth assumption for net revenues to at least 6%, and our anticipated full year 2019 growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS to at least 9% further demonstrating our overall confidence in PMI short and long term growth prospects. Thank you. I'm now happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hello, thank you very much. I guess, I have two questions. Clearly, you've guided both to better volumes for the markets and more -- on a bigger improvement for yourself. And I was just wondering, where what has surprised you and what geographies you're talking about particularly in terms of a market, and in terms of your end volumes as you think about 2019? That's my first question, thank you.
Martin King: It's fairly broad based, but I would call out the EU as the one area that is exceeding its previous run rate or and maybe surprising us a little bit to the positive this year. Poland is one market that's doing well. I mean, it's overall EU run rate used to be around 2% to 3% and now we're seeing it running more like 1% to 2%. With so far this year, it's been quite encouraging. But we're also seeing pretty good volumes across a number of other geographies the Turkish market in the first half of the year is still up. Indonesia market has started to grow again with no tax increase and with limited pricing this year because of not having the tax, and you have a couple other markets at least for the first half of the year that are benefiting from lapping some previous big tax increases and so forth like Saudi is up compared to last year, Thailand is up pretty strongly even though it's not such a big market but it is a pretty strong size growth there. So it's fairly broad based, but I would -- I would pick out the EU is the one that's probably a little bit more than what we expected.
Adam Spielman: And just the market, and for you specifically is it just, I guess, our peers are doing better than expected or is there anything else, or is it just the those are favorable markets here, Indonesia Turkey, EU, Saudi all big markets where you have decent market shares?
Martin King: Yes, well I mean you see our overall share is benefiting from heated tobacco units. And even within the cigarette category, we're doing pretty well. We called out this quarter wasn't quite as favorable as last quarter on cigarette share, but Turkey was one of one of the main reasons and the issue in Turkey was that, we increased prices and we're the only ones in the market with the higher prices for about a month. The competition lagged a bit, and so we lost quite a bit of share in the second quarter. However, competition has lost and we don't expect -- Turkey with Marlboro in Parliament. They're recovering quite quickly. So that was a bit of a Q2 anomaly. So overall our share in cigarettes, within cigarettes is holding up very nicely and of course we're benefiting from the overall strategy of leading the heated tobacco space as you know approximately two out of every three consumers coming in the category are coming from the competition. So overall our share is holding up very nicely we're quite pleased with it.
Adam Spielman: And just very quickly. A second point, you mentioned at the beginning a couple of times, but you had more pricing variance this quarter. And I guess you implied there's going to be sort of slightly reverse in Q3 because the impression you gave was you took earlier prices in 2019 than you did in the corresponding markets in 2018. But I was just wondering sort of can you be a little bit more specific about what markets you're talking about? And also why did you do that? It seems a sort of slightly strange thing to do. It's a bit more of a color around that pricing variance thing moved a bit further forward in the year.
Martin King: Yes I mean, first of all with pricing you kind of take it when you can get it. It's not that we try to stick to a certain schedule. We read the competitive situation and the overall gaps and various other measures and we take the pricing is as we think we can achieve it. One market to call out as having shifted from where it was in Q3 last year into Q2 this year is Mexico. So you had the trade movements benefiting Q2 and the pricing benefiting Q2 this year where it was in Q3 last year. And the other piece on the comparisons to last year is, last year’s pricing variance in Q3 was very large, it was the biggest of any of the quarters. It was $483 million. So just because of the way the timing works out and the different sequencing, you get some quarters that are bigger than others, and when pricing moved from one quarter to another, it can have a pretty significant impact on the total revenue line. So yes, 9% total revenue growth in quarter two ex-currency like-for-like is very, very strong, but it is flatter by these movements by about 2%. So we wanted to call that out, and also make sure people understood the impact as we make the comparison against Q3 coming up.
Adam Spielman: Again, I've got lots more questions, but I'll leave it at that, so that the other folks have a go. Thank you.
Martin King: Okay, thanks Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi, Martin.
Martin King: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong: So my first question is just your decision to spend incremental hundred million behind IQOS this year. I know you kind of gave the big buckets of where you think the investment will go, but I guess, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity around just some of the specific programs and in mind for the spending. And then if we should think about this as more of a pull forward from kind of the planned spending next year as the underlying momentum has come in a bit better than expected.
Martin King: Okay. Yes, I mean there are a couple of broad areas where the spending will help us maintain our momentum going into next year and really beyond. I mean one is, to accelerate the development of innovation of both the product side and on the commercial side and that will have more of a long term benefit. I mean that's something where it's not likely to help us this year, but it will help us next year with some of our innovation coming out at a faster pace and some additional projects that we can we can accomplish. So that's more of a long term investment, and very much a confidence on our strategy and realizing that, that in order to stay ahead of the competition we've got to continue with our innovation pipeline. The second piece is around geographic expansion. We've had great success in Russia and the EU, and we've pointed out that geographically we still have opportunities to expand in both areas. So accelerating those plans ahead of more competitive presence is prudent. And then we also have some new geographies that we will open in the second half of the year and funding that appropriately to get off to a really good start is I think an excellent use of additional investments to get momentum going into next year. And that's really what I would sort of say staying ahead in the areas where we're -- where we're doing well and opening up some new areas. And then the third bucket is investments to address intensifying competition. I mean, I guess the best examples that are going to be Japan and Korea. We do have new innovation improvement on our IQOS3 device. And we want to get that out there in a in a big way and benefit from it. It's an excellent innovation and it helps us have news and, and a reason for IQOS users to really stick with IQOS in the face of having lots of other products being offered to them and so forth. And then there's also in that same bucket I think commercial activities, which I won't specify, but which we will put aside some additional investments for given that the competition is putting more intensity into these markets as they realize that they need to try to catch up in the reduced risk space that we've built. So those are I think prudent investments. It's about momentum and it's a bit of success, breeds success because we've been able to do well this year and get ahead. And then that allows us to up the ante and keep our momentum going, not just finishing this year well, which we need to do, but more importantly for next year and beyond. These are these are long term plays so I hope that covers that Judy.
Judy Hong: Yes, that's helpful. I guess a bit of a follow up and my second question was actually going to be on Japan and Korea and some of the competitive dynamics that you've talked about. I guess in Japan, you've had some new activities in place now for I guess six, six months plus, market share being kind of flattish. How would you think about that in the context of some of the investments that have already been made? And then, can you be a little bit more specific in what the improvement on IQOS3 devices that that we'll see with the launch in the back half? Thanks.
Martin King: Okay. So, for Japan, I mean, we have to keep in mind that we're up 1.1 share points year to-date over last year. So yes, sequentially we only had very slight growth on an offtake basis from Q1 to Q2, but that's already on a base that's well stepped up from our run rate last year. So, our initiatives are clearly working. The introduction of HEETS at the different price point and with the different taste lineup to attract the different consumer group is definitely working, its incremental share we're getting, and it's more mainstream brand that opens its access to more consumers. We've had very good feedback on the IQOS 3 and MULTI. The battery works better charges between usages for IQOS 3 much quicker. The design it is well received. And the evidence is that despite the price tiering where 2.4+ is available in the market at a lower price nearly all of the purchases and all the volume, the vast majority have gone IQOS 3 and MULTI. So it shows that the consumer there has appreciated that innovation. And our salesforce is working effectively to convert adult smokers that overall category has grown and as I mentioned before our HEETS and HeatStick share has grown and we expect that to continue going forward. Now obviously there is going to be some more competitive activity in the second half. So we'll see out there may be some short-term impact with consumers trying other products and so forth, but we're convinced that our product is still the best choice in the marketplace and we're to keep investing behind it. And the IQOS 3 improvements we think will help consumers see new innovation from us as well as the competitive offerings. I'm not to get any further details on what that improvement is as you can imagine we'd like to keep it in surprise for now. But I think its improvement that consumers will really appreciate. Pleased with Japan's performance; obviously we're watching very closely the competitive situation and that certainly – the first half of the year only behind us. We still have the second half to go and I think that's one area where we have to keep our eyes short and make sure we're addressing the competitive situation in Japan as well as in Korea.
Judy Hong: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright. Thank you. Hello, Martin.
Martin King: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to also ask about a little bit further on some of the things that you are just discussing. And I kind of wanted to hear maybe more specifically how consumers have been responding to more of the competitor innovation that's been rolling out in the market? Are they simply trying the new renovation and then possibly coming back to IQOS? Or do you think you're experiencing some share loss as these consumers are switching or is it possible that some of the new innovation by your competitors is helping to convert more smokers and driving a larger reduced risk markets?
Martin King: I would say that, it's different between the two markets, between Japan and Korea. In Japan, I think we have seen the period of churn and we have more consumers that are actually settling back with IQOS. Obviously, there would be a new wave of expansion coming from some of the device sales especially from JT, so there maybe another phase. But overall in Japan I think the initiatives we took are having a good affect, our share growth is up from last year nicely and we see that our position is pretty firm and that we're growing the category and growing our share moving forward. So, in Japan well obviously we'll keep an eye on the competition. We feel pretty confident going forward. In Korea, it's a little bit more intense competition. KT&G's device has a lineup of consumables in a taste direction, non-menthol flavors that are kind of unique to Korea if you will. Korea is a country that has an overall trend not just in tobacco but in other categories of all kinds of exotic flavors and its present in the tobacco area as well. And KT&G has done a very good job of capitalizing on this. It's not just by the way in the area of heat-not-burn, it's also in the cigarette category that they have put out a large number of new offerings with all kinds of exotic flavors, but within the heat-not-burn area we feel more confident to respond and offer some additional flavors in our lineup and we will come with that in the second half of the years. So we'll have to see how those competitive responses get traction. We think we will do better going forward and we're also putting more attention to conversion and some of the other activities in the marketplace in Korea. But right now our results in Korea are in need of some remedial action and that's we're taking, going forward in the second half of the year, whereas in Japan I think we're on firm footing and we're quite confident going forward.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's help. And then in light of all this as the competitive landscape intensifies; how or where you seeing pricing heading for reduced risk products? How concerned are you that pricing is going to start to roll back and effort for possibly you to defend share. Just trying to get a sense of the evolution of pricing in the reduced risk market over time?
Martin King: Well, I think you need to separate out consumable pricing versus device pricing. On the consumables we have absolutely no indication of any sort of pricing issues or skirmishes. And in fact for example in Japan when overall prices went up last year with the tax increase, the pricing went through on RRPs as well as on cigarette. And we don't see any sign anywhere of the actual, consumables being a big issue from the pricing perspective. Now on the devices, there are some countries where the competition has offered very low prices on devices. We are always priced well above competition and surgically and where necessary we have and we'll continue to offer discounts to promotions to keep our devices from being too high on price and we will need to keep doing that. But that's a much more manageable issues, I mean the value of converting a consumer it's really in the consumable and making sure that you're in the mix for devices on device pricing is a relatively more manageable economic challenge than having to do with the consumable side. So overall I would say pricing in the category is not a major issue. Its small skirmishes in certain countries, certain places with the devices where we're going to have to continue to make sure we're being competitive.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And just one final quick question on your guidance from me. You're increasing your spending slightly, but you noted you still expect your margins to be just as strong. So, can you highlight for us what the key offset is or what is expected to perform better specifically as it relates to your margins?
Martin King: Well, I mean, I think that the top line increase allowed for a bit more spending while keeping the margin still where it was before, and I think if you put that through the model I think you'll see that's more or less what it is. I mean, obviously we're very mindful of our spending and working hard to get efficiencies. You see us moving forward on our footprint as we've announced some factories. We did Pakistan before. We're doing Columbia now. We've announced the intent and the beginning of consultations on Berlin. We're working hard internally on our cost categories and bringing cost out and so forth. But most of those benefits you'll see more going forward in the next few years. It's not showing up so much already this year because you have to take the actions and of course incur the cost and treat people fairly and properly and then you get the lower cost base in the out years. So I think the 100 million is really within the realm of the higher revenue and keeping the EPS growth 1% higher as well.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Thanks for the question. In your comments about step-up of investment investing in Q3, you alluded to accelerating investments behind innovation. Will this happen specifically within heat-not-burn? Or will you be investing more behind vaping product. And also, what are your thoughts on M&A in vaping to extend your presence in the category?
Martin King: Yes. The investments are across several platforms including e-vapor. We continue with our plan to roll out the first initial market with – improve the cigarette with the mesh technology and then improved form factor and we're very confident that that product will be superior to what's in the marketplace. So we're continuing to vest behind the capacity ramp-up for that and we want to ramp the capacity as fast as we can and get to as many markets as we can next year. As far as timing on spending, if you take the total of 400 million that we're now communicating on spending, about $120 million has been spent the first half leaving us about $280 million and then we said about 200 or half of the 400 will come in Q3. It's across various categories, not just the innovation you're asking about. But it's a broad-based commitment to the smoke-free future and all of our activities across commercial as well as product platforms as well as commercialization.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And how are you thinking about IQOS's ramp in the U.S. Can you help us think about the potential contribution to your results as it scale?
Martin King: Well, I mean, I think we start with looking at the prospect for IQOS in the U.S. and I think it start with the consumer receptivity. And in our estimation U.S. consumers are very open to trying new products not just in the area of reduced risk tobacco product by the way, but also all products in general as compared to many other countries. U.S. consumers tend to embrace innovation pretty readily. And you certainly see it with the cigarette category and some of the other categories in the U.S. where consumers are trying to product, so that's a plus. There's a pretty clear regulatory approach and we got clear guidance from FDA on some of the aspects of introducing this product in the U.S. There's good communication freedom that will help build awareness and trial amongst adult smokers. And then you've got Altria and PM USA. They have excellent execution ability. They're well prepared. They got a very strong plan. We've been working with them to share all the learnings, very good cooperation. So we expect the U.S. to perform quite well. I mean, we would expect it to be faster on average than the EU has developed. I mean I think you have to be realistic. I wouldn't assume that it’s going to take off like Japan did or Korea initially et cetera, but we expect U.S. to have very solid results. Now, of course, has yet to be started. We'll find out a lot from the Atlanta beginning and then we'll take it from there. But we have very high hopes and we're working very well together without you to make this a success.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And one last question from me. Just curious about your early read on the competitive dynamics, from JUUL International expansion in Europe and Asia?
Martin King: Well, it is early days for JUUL. We're not seeing certainly any impact from JUUL on our overall results. As you can see there's really nowhere that we're having any issues with it, but it is early days. We're watching it closely. I mentioned staying ahead of competition with expansion and staying ahead of competition, it's mostly we're talking about heat-not-burn, but it’s also quite frankly with an eye toward JUUL as well and making sure that we get as much awareness and trial and presence throughout the EU and Russia and places like that as we have this great momentum and we're doing extremely well and as within eye also to the fact that others are coming amongst them JUUL. So we have our eye on it. We're taking steps including with the e-cigarette platform for investment and rollout that we talked about and I mentioned earlier to make sure that we're going to compete well with JUUL. Nonetheless of course there's room for more than one on successful product in this category and JUUL will likely get some success. So we're realistic about it as well.
Pamela Kaufman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Rampton of UBS.
Robert Rampton: Good morning. Three questions from me. The first question is -- so your disclose market for down around 1%, if you could help me with the bridge to the 2.5 for the full year?
Martin King: The 2.5 is a reference to the total market for tobacco and heated tobacco units worldwide and the 1% it's our shipment rate. So, I'm not sure. Maybe I didn't get your question.
Robert Rampton: So, I'm referring to your key market data at the back which says the total market units were down 1.1%. I appreciate that doesn't cover 100% of your [Indiscernible] I guess what I'm asking is, what did the industry do in 1H and then how do we bridge from that to the full year?
Martin King: The total industry in the first half was down a bit less than the two and a half and would be down a bit more than two and a half, obviously, in the second half to bring it back to that. I don't have the exact number.
Robert Rampton: Yes. I mean there's going to be pricing throughout the year and you have a normal decline rates throughout various countries. Turkey's pricing that went into effect in April in Turkey. Turkey was growing quite rapidly last year and into the first quarter, but obviously it was a pretty big tax hence we've now taken pricing to Turkish Lira per pack, so that market price won't grow quite as fast as it was. I mean there's various market events that infer that the second half will be a bit weaker than the first half for both total market and for our own shipments too by the way because we're more or less flat in the first half. We're saying we're going down one for the year, so obviously our second half shipment volume will be down roughly to 2%. Does that help, Robert?
Robert Rampton: Yes. That's very helpful indeed. So next question was on inventory in Japan, so last year there was a 4, 3Q there was a 4 billion gap between your shipment number and you’re in-market sales. I mean clearly some of that will be loading ahead of the tax change, but how should we think about the lapping of that in the context of the difficult pricing comparatively flat?
Martin King: Yes. I mean, there are couple moving parts in Japan that have impacts on inventories especially one quarter the next. I mean as you point out we had the pricing last year. We obviously drew down the inventory because we had a different projection for the market than what we started the year. This year you have a VAT increase expected October 1st going from 8% VAT to 10% VAT. That's across the whole market not just tobacco, but all products. But obviously, consumers are going to expect that there might be some pantry loading and trade movements from that. There's also a health warning change coming next year, so inventories have to be managed to deal with that. So there are quite a few moving parts. I mean, obviously, we've made the statement that overall worldwide we expect total heated tobacco unit shipments to be more or less in line within market sales, in other words if there's inventory up in one market down in another market, but overall it should be more or less flat. I can't really give you that individual where each market is going to end up. Even Japan given these many moving parts. And you have to remember inventories are really set. As we go into the end of the year with an eye towards what we think is going to happen in the next year that's the whole reason to have the inventory, is decide as to what's coming and what events are coming as well. So it's a bit difficult to give you any more details on what's coming up for inventories other than that broad statement that we expect in market sales and shipments to be approximately the same this year and not have big inventory differences.
Robert Rampton: Okay. That makes sense. Sorry, one last question just in terms of IQOS share in Greece and Bulgaria, that moved backwards quarter on quarter, obviously I'm not trying to say anything about in proposition, but I'm just wondering in those markets. Is that a function of the bigger weight of 2Q versus other quarters or is it a case that you get to a certain point in development of a market where you start getting the initial churn or is it you've redirected resource?
Martin King: Well, I mean you have to keep in mind there's some volatility in the numbers, but if you look at Greece the share is 8.1, up four from the prior year, so it's doubled, right? So there might be just like we saw in Russia for example where the overall IMS is growing at a very steady, very nice rate. But you saw the share moving around, Q1 was overstated because of cigarette seasonality and now when you when you look at the underlying and understand the situation the Russia share growth has been growing and growing steadily. But it's distorted by these other movements and its similar things happen in other markets. But when you look at the longer term both you called out Greece, it's doubled in the last year to 8% up 4%. Bulgaria's is more than double. It's grown two and a half to four and a half. So when you look at one quarter to another quarter with those kinds of growth rates I don't think that's really the best way to look at it. But we're growing well in both those locations.
Robert Rampton: Okay great. Thanks very much. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Could you just unpack the third quarter a little bit more and especially in light of the VAT increase in Japan and what should be relatively profitable trade loading. How should we think about the revenues still in the quarter being below your full year range? And why would that be the case?
Martin King: Well, I mean, one of the biggest impacts is this timing that we talked about, where the Q2 is benefiting by about two percentage points. And that's obviously going to drag on Q3 on the top line. And then when you look at it year-over-year we had this very large pricing variance last year of $483 million. And while we'll have decent pricing this year as well, it won't be nearly that big in the quarter. And you add to that this spending step up which is very much concentrated in that quarter. And that's how we get to the overall picture of essentially flat with the pro forma from last year at 135. I mean that's pretty much the basics of it. I mean obviously there are individual events in certain countries like Japan and so forth in one year to next year. But if you look at the bigger picture those are pretty big movements and significant numbers that affected. I remember last year Japan had a price increase in the same pattern, right? It was October 1st. So you had trade loading and et cetera. So when you do it this year you have a VAT instead of the price -- instead of the tax, I'm sorry. But you have a similar potential for trade dynamics that are at really the same date. So I don't think that that's going to be a big driver of it year-over-year.
Michael Lavery: Are you anticipating having pricing go through with this tax hike as well?
Martin King: We never discuss forward pricing. The VAT is going to go up, that's all we can really know at this point in time. We'll have to see what happens as far as any anything else.  And we usually have to discuss with the government you're pricing ahead of time and so forth, so it's not always very clear as to what's going to happen.
Michael Lavery: Yes, of course. And just back on the spending piece of it, can you unpack the incremental 100 million a bit. You mentioned that half of it is going to fall on the third quarter. Is the rest in the fourth? Or has some of that already happened?
Martin King: Just to be clear, we took the 100 million increase added it to the 300 million that we had already said would occur. That's a total of 400. Half of that i.e. 200 million step up will occur we believe in the third quarter. That's why it's a pretty big impact. It's not just the 100 million. It's 200 million of step up out of the total of 400 million that we expect to hit in Q3. That's why it's a pretty big impact.
Michael Lavery: That's helpful clarity. And some of that timing just driven by opportunistic ability to reinvest some of the momentum ahead of your plans. Is that how the 3Q surge hits from the pacing perspective?
Martin King: Yes. I mean we've only spent 120 million so far this year in the first half. Some of it was by design and some of it was some timing slipping and some things like that. As it turns out, Q3 is actually a very good time for us to step up this investment because we get some time through the year to benefit from the geographic expansions that we're going to do and we've been planning them already now. There's much of that's out of the original 300, the 100 million on top as we go and try to address better some of the competitive situations and work on our longer term innovation. Q3 is when we can get things rolling and get -- the commensurate spending that goes with it hits the timing. So yes, it just so happens that the concentration of the 200 out of the four falling into one quarter. But it's a variety of different things driving that.
Michael Lavery: That's helpful. And then just one more on the U.K. Obviously, it's been a -- there's some severe restrictions on your ability to communicate and market much about IQOSs, but it -- you're starting to expand in Bristol and Manchester now. It also was in the news that there's been 100,000 devices sold in London over the last couple of years and some of those obviously could be in the hands of multiple, but people could have more than one, no question, but that might be something in the neighborhood of a high single-digit share of London smokers. How is your progression in London? Is it gaining a little bit more traction and starting to have some good share runway there?
Martin King: Yes. I mean, our share in London is relatively small. It's above 1%. But it's relatively small. It's bigger in certain pockets like around Canary Wharf, West London, we have pretty significant share. We have really good conversion rates in U.K. and London at 70%, so the people who do buy the devices successfully convert and for the most part quit smoking and switch completely to heat-not-burn. We're continuing to invest as you pointed out by opening stores in Bristol and Manchester. So we're making headway. As you pointed out it hasn't been easy due to the regulatory setup and some other issues. We have to keep in mind London is like a crossroads of the world. So you have a lot of people to visit London that might buy a device, but not actually consume HeatSticks in London. So when I give you market share, I'm talking about HeatStick offtake share, but obviously you would have devices that would be purchased by people visiting London from various countries. You might have also Londoners who travel quite a bit buying HeatSticks in the EU and bringing them back as long as they stay within certain limits they can do that. And prices are much lower, say in Italy your price for HeatSticks in Italy is about significantly lower than what it is in London. So you get a lot of that going on. So I think probably London is a bit of a unique situation where the number of devices sold doesn't match up very as closely as you might think with the offtake share of the consumables. But I think it's a worthwhile endeavor for us to keep working on awareness and conversion of people in London because it is a leading city in the world and one that helps set worldwide trends. So we keep chipping away at it. We are making progress. We'll continue to do that.
Michael Lavery: That's helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Thank you for taking my question. And this is a follow-up on that question that was earlier on the sequential market share in Bulgaria and Greece. So if I look at Japan, IQOS stalled after having penetrated the early after market and the overall HTU category share has been stable at around 21%, 22%. Now in Vilnius in Lithuania you were already at 20% share in Q1. And if we look at the Lithuania market share, they are up very slightly. So what I'm trying to ask is, are you hitting the limits of early adopters in some of these Eastern European cities and countries already?
Martin King: Well, I mean, the only one that would be kind of at the level where you might think that there might be some challenging would be Vilnius which is at as you said 20%, and it really all depends on the dynamics of the pricing of the offer if you're running out of people that are in the premium category that can sometimes have an effect. But overall it when you look at EU and even Russia, we still have quite a bit of runway to go before I think we'll start to hit issues where you say, I've converted the vast majority of premium smokers or I have converted the vast majority of the early adopters and innovators. And even now, even when that starts to happen we're now much more prepared for that because we know obviously you need to be prepared to make sure you have offerings that span the different price tiers. You need to be prepared to have the messaging in place for different groups. So, obviously it's something we keep an eye on and we build the toolbox to be able to move to a different strategy when you start hitting those levels. But in the EU frankly, I think we're still in aggregate anyway far far away from it. Keep in mind Lithuania and Vilnius are relatively small geographies within the EU. So I don't see it as an overall issue for our growth rates in the EU. We're on a good trajectory and I expect us to continue to be growing nicely for quite some time to come. But we are prepared and aware of it and have the toolboxes and strategy for those sorts of situations. Thank you for your question.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. Okay. Can I ask one follow up question? You are increasing your revenue growth guidance this year to 6% but not the three year guidance from greater than 5%. So shouldn't that be also increased a bit now, because you are increasing the guidance in the first year itself?
Martin King: That's not how we've set up the three year. We gave it as a compound annual growth rate. Obviously when we get into next year, we'll give some guidance for next year and we'll see how things are going before we do that. We're not prepared to do that, and we wouldn't change the three year overall based on just this just this period.
Gaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Martin King: Thank you very much.
Operator: And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin King: Yes I just wanted to leave three key takeaways. First one being, we've got very strong momentum as evidenced by our total volume, which is which is actually slightly positive on a like-for-like basis in the first half and it's both the conventional and the heated tobacco units which are performing well. Second is that our strategy is working for the shareholders. We've got the top line benefits that are flowing through, with our margin expansion of at least 100 basis points currency-neutral that we expect for this year, and this has given us the confidence to increase our investment to maintain this momentum into 2020 and beyond. We're focusing on the longer term, with the product and commercial development. We're focusing on geographic expansion. We're addressing competition to maintain our favorable competitive lead. And when you put all three of those things together, we're in pretty good shape for the first half of the year. We definitely have still the second half to go and there's some countries in areas that we have to make sure where we're keeping an eye on amongst them, Turkey with the pricing in Indonesia, with some down trading and so forth. We've got the increased competition on heat-not-burn, but when you put it all together, we're confident in the future and we're ready to have a good second half and move into 2020. So thank you very much for listening.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much for joining us today on the call. If you have any follow up questions please contact the IR team. Again thank you very much and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for joining the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We are off to a promising start in 2019, reflecting positive momentum for our combustible tobacco and smoke-free product portfolios; strong currency-neutral adjusted financial results, and the important milestone of reaching over 10 million IQOS users globally. As we announced in our press release this morning, we are revising our 2019 reported diluted earnings per share guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.87. The $0.03 revision compared to our prior guidance on March 22nd of at least $4.90 is due to two specific factors. First, a $0.02 increase in the estimated net impact of the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Incorporated, RBH, representing a total charge of approximately $0.12 per share based on final quarter-end figures. And second, asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $0.01 per share related to a plant closure in Pakistan as part of our global manufacturing footprint optimization. Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share with essentially the entire amount or $0.13 coming in the first half of the year. After excluding the $0.22 per share of reporting adjustments outlined on this slide, our forecast represents a projected currency-neutral increase of at least 8% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018. For the year, we continue to anticipate a total industry volume decline for cigarettes and heated tobacco units of approximately 2.5% to 3%. Furthermore, on a like-for-like basis adjusting for the deconsolidation of RBH, we maintained the following full-year assumptions; a total PMI shipment volume decline of 1.5% to 2%; currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%; currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion of at least 100 basis points; operating cash flow of approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements; and capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Turning now to the first quarter. We recorded a total shipment volume increase of 1.1%, driven by the strong growth of heated tobacco units, notably in the EU Region and Russia. Our cigarette shipment volume was stable, supported by growth from each of our top-five international cigarette brands. Excluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume grew by 1.7% with heated tobacco units up by nearly 35%. Importantly, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 10.6% sequentially versus the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 13 billion units. Net revenues increased by 3.2%, excluding currency, driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing from our combustible tobacco portfolio. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth came despite two challenging comparisons versus the first quarter of 2018. The first relates to sizable IQOS device shipments in Japan last year following the lifting of device sales restrictions. This is evidenced by the contribution of devices to our total RRP net revenues of approximately 22% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to approximately 35% in the same period last year. The second relates to the shift to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina, effective July 1, 2018, with the U.S. dollar now serving as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina and the impact of the peso devaluation now included in our currency-neutral results. Combined, these two items represented an estimated drag of approximately 3.4 percentage points on our currency-neutral net revenue growth rate. Absent which, our growth would have been approximately 6.6% consistent with our full-year assumption of at least 5%. Our combustible pricing variance in the quarter was nearly 4%, and was adversely impacted by a partial excise tax absorption in Turkey and the aforementioned accounting shift in Argentina. The underlying fundamentals supporting our strong historic pricing remain intact, notably the broadly rational excise tax environment globally and our leading cigarette brand portfolio. We have recently increased our cigarette prices in markets, such as France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Turkey, which should further contribute to a positive pricing variance over the balance of the year. For the full-year, we anticipate a combustible pricing variance above 5%. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 9.1% and adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points. Compared to the first quarter of last year, these metrics benefited from the lower device shipments noted earlier in my remarks given their dilutive unit margins. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15%, excluding currency, driven by our strong business performance, coupled with the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense. Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., increased by 1 percentage point in the first quarter to reach 28.4%. Half of this growth was driven by heated tobacco units, reflecting broad-based share gains across markets where IQOS has been commercialized. Our cigarette portfolio contributed the balance of the growth, despite the impact of out-switching to heated tobacco products, with higher share in markets such as Egypt, Germany, Thailand and Turkey. Importantly, our share of the cigarette category alone increased by 0.7 percentage points to 27.1%. Our total international share growth was driven by higher share in five of our six regions. The decline in the East Asia & Australia Region mainly reflected the impact of lower cigarette share in Japan and Korea. Moving now to RRPs, we reached a key milestone in the quarter, surpassing 10 million IQOS users. Importantly, approximately 70% of the total have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. In Japan, we are seeing encouraging trends in IQOS device ownership, IQOS past-seven-day use, heated tobacco category share and our HTU off-take share, as evidenced by the three-month moving average figures presented on this slide. These trends suggest that the range of initiatives for restoring share growth that we initially outlined last May and introduced during the second half of the year are indeed starting to pay-off. And while we anticipate increased competitive activity in the category over the course of this year, this could actually serve to accelerate category growth. Our share for HeatSticks and HEETS in Japan reached 16.9% in the first quarter, or 16.6% after adjusting for estimated trade inventory movements. This marked our first sequential share growth since the first quarter of 2018, and is the highest quarterly share that we have achieved in the market. Importantly, as shown on this slide, the sequential growth of the heated tobacco category in Japan in the first quarter was driven primarily by our HTU brands. In Korea, where the heated tobacco category continues to be highly competitive, our market share over recent quarters has been distorted by the impact of inventory movements, which we initially noted during our full-year earnings call in February. On an adjusted basis, the share of HEETS remained stable sequentially at an estimated 7.8%. In the EU Region, HEETS continued its sequential share growth, increasing by 0.4 percentage points to reach 2.1%. The growth was driven by essentially all IQOS markets and reflects success across a broad range of countries with varying regulatory frameworks and adult smoker preferences. It is worth noting that the government in Italy recently lowered the excise tax for innovative smoke-free products, such as heated tobacco and e-cigarettes. As a result, effective April 5th, we adjusted the retail price of HEETS to €4.50, in line with the lowest price point for cigarettes. We believe that this is an important step to help accelerate the transition to a smoke-free future. HEETS also continued its strong performance in Russia, with national share up by 1.3 percentage points sequentially to reach 3.1%. The increase was flattered by the impact on the total market of seasonally lower cigarette industry volume. Given this effect, we believe that the in-market sales volume progression with sequential growth of over 30% in the first quarter provides a more realistic indicator of the brand's trajectory. Our in-market sales growth mainly reflects the progress of our local organization in existing IQOS focused geographies; the impact of positive word-of-mouth from the growing number of IQOS users; our omni-channel strategy; and further geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in 35 cities, representing an estimated 32% of the market by total industry volume. As noted during our earnings call in February, our HEETS shipments exceeded their in-market sales in the fourth quarter of last year, driven by our planned geographic expansion. While this contributed to an unfavorable impact on our HTU shipments of approximately 600 million units in the first quarter, it had no material effect on our in-market sales volume or market share. In conclusion, we are off to a promising start to the year. The fundamentals supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio remain intact. Favorable momentum for IQOS across geographies, including Japan is driving HTU share gains and further supports our confidence in our HTU shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021. Finally, on a like-for-like basis, we are on track to deliver against our full-year currency-neutral net revenue growth assumptions of at least 5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth forecast of at least 8%. Thank you. I am now happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: So I guess it's nice to see Japan getting back on the growth track for IQOS. If you can share your observation about IQOS 3 and multi-performing in that country, and then maybe contrast that with Korea perhaps where it seems like share trends have been flattish. So why is Japan doing better versus Korea, is my first question.
Martin King: Yes, we're very gratified by the performance in Japan. I think IQOS 3 and multi is playing a role in that. The devices have been very well received by consumers. It helps us turn the page in Japan on the reliability issue we had with the previous early versions of 2.4 plus, even though 2.4 plus is now fixed from a reliability point of view in consumers' minds in Japan, this was part of what they were looking for was to get past that. And it's definitely helping us with perceptions in the marketplace. Our new registrations in Japan have increased substantially, and it's in part due to the 3 and multi that's there. HEETS is playing a role as well. And the roll out during the quarter was successful. It's adding to our share and adding to profitability in the market as it brings in the price sensitive consumers from cigarettes. So the plan in Japan is as we had hoped and it's right on track and doing very well. In Korea, the issue is very intense competition in the heat-not-burn category. We're holding our own but we're seeing some new offerings from competition. And there's some churn going on there, not unlike happened in the earlier days also in Japan. And we're working very hard, the 3 and multi are well received in the country, but we're still working through I think some of the competitive activity that's going on in that marketplace.
Judy Hong: Okay, that's helpful. And then your decision to take pricing down for HEETS in EU, just elaborate on what drove that decision. And then if you can speak to then, how does that impact the profitability outlook for IQOS, HEETS. Are there other offsets that you're looking to drive some of the pricing changes, and why just Europe and not other markets around the world?
Martin King: Well, actually, it was even more specific than Europe, it was in Italy only. And it was because the government reduced the tax. And so we're passing on that benefit to consumers, and we believe that that's the right thing to do. The profitability remains intact. And it's something that as we get better tax differentials in various countries, we think it's important when we get a lower tax to reflect that sometimes in the price, so that consumers benefit. Otherwise, governments are less likely to retain those gaps. 
Judy Hong: And then just my last question. So the first quarter earnings actually came in better than your expectation that you talked about during fourth quarter earnings. So were there any timing factors or is the underlying business actually done better than you expected in the first quarter?
Martin King: Yes, so it's both. There is better underlying business, particularly in the area of EU and the volume on conventional cigarettes came a bit stronger than we anticipated. As far as HTUs, we're right on plan but about -- if you take the beat being about $0.09, $0.03 is the currency coming better, which is transactional currency. Then there is about $0.06 that's more in the business and half of that is better underlying performance and the other half is more spending timing that I think will flush out in the coming quarters. So we're on a good start for the year but it's early days and we will see how the rest of the year unfolds.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: I guess I'd like to ask the same question again from Judy. Can you explain just a little bit, because I think in the last six quarters, you've given guidance for quarterly EPS 4 times. [Indiscernible] some extraordinary - by large amount. And I'm just wondering how we should interpret that, maybe because fundamentally the business is not hugely unpredictable, and we just have four lucky results in a row? Or is there some other explanation? And I suppose given that, how conservative are you being for the full-year?
Martin King: Well, I mean, we are off to a strong start for the year and it's reflected, as I said, in the business results that you see. We have good margins. We have good volume. But it's early days. I mean, we're here in the first quarter only. For the heated tobacco space, we're right on plan in Japan that is very nice share growth but it's what we planned. In EU, it's turning out really nicely. It's everything developing well. We're getting the benefit from the investments that we made last year. But it's exactly what we had anticipated and put in the plan. The part that’s a bit further ahead of where we anticipated, is the conventional cigarette volume, which is coming both from the total market, which on adjusted basis total market worldwide was down 2.3, so it's very much to the low end of the range we expected. And our own share is coming quite strong as well on conventional cigarettes to be up in share despite the impacts of cannibalization from HTUs is a welcome development. Now, we'll have to see if these trends hold and it's really the beginning of the year. We give the best estimates we can and I think it's a positive that we're seeing the business performing a bit better.
Adam Spielman: Can I ask two questions that perhaps you can answer specific. First of all, I was very surprised to see I think 31% organic adjusted operating income growth in the EU. As I've read the press release, that was mainly driven by pricing in Germany, Italy and Poland. But is there any other factors that you can point to, because that’s a huge increase 31% on what should be quite a stable market?
Martin King: Well, there're two other factors. One is the total market in EU came better than it has for a while, and pretty good for EU to be only down slightly. And our share is doing very well for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units. And then you get this factor that our volume our shipments in EU for heated tobacco units are starting to get quite significant. And you have to remember that our margins on those shipments are considerably better than cigarettes. So you get both the weighting of HTUs at a higher margin and you get better trends on the volume for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units. We're also getting more efficient on our spending. We made significant investments in infrastructure and we've learned how to better convert smokers to the heated tobacco to IQOS, and do it more efficiently and effectively. So if you look at our cost, the step up across all the regions actually but in the EU, it was much smaller this year than it was last year, and we're benefiting from the investments we made before. We're also scrubbing our costs on the other existing areas in the company as we're committed to doing and we're doing a better job controlling the costs, so all those come in together to give some pretty good results.
Adam Spielman: And I think from your comments that there's been no impact that you can see from JUUL. I guess, the question behind the question is back in I guess November, December, when we discovered they would go international, we thought that there was a risk with JUUL, which hit volumes perhaps in the UK, perhaps in Canada, which I suppose we no longer talk about, perhaps in Germany. But I guess the impression it had no impact that you can see.
Martin King: That's correct. We haven't seen any impact from JUUL in any country on our volume…
Adam Spielman: And the final question from me is you've highlighted as I said particularly in the EU very good operating growth. Is there any factors you'd highlight in the rest of the year that maybe cause it to fall in perhaps the way that's not obvious for the informed onlooker? Or should we just extrapolate this very good performance in Europe going forward?
Martin King: Well, I can't think of any event to call out that would cause performance to falter in any way. I don't know that you'll see the same percentage increase each quarter going forward because there're other factors involved. But the trajectory and the trends I think are good. And yes, I believe EU will have a good year this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: You touched on the advantages that the heated tobacco units have in Europe compared to cigarettes. Can you give a sense we have a little bit of color on a couple of markets, like Italy and Germany. I guess two questions. One, are they somewhat representative of the EU broadly? And then second, in Italy with the lower taxes and also the lower price. Does your economic advantage increased at all with that lower price or is it constant? How does your price adjustment and with the tax adjustment compared to where you would've been prior to that?
Martin King: Well, Italy and Germany probably overall have slightly higher margins for heated tobacco units than most of the other countries. They both have a pretty good advantage from a tax perspective, Germany particularly so. As far as the price increase, I mean we've passed those tax advantages on the consumer and our profitability is at least as good as it was before.
Michael Lavery: And just looking at the pricing variances that you cited. First, am I right just that that is pricing and it doesn't reflect the mix, for example, revenue mix lift from heated tobacco units? And if that's correct, do you have a sense of how much mix benefit you get from the growth of the HeatSticks as part of the -- the bigger part of the portfolio?
Martin King: Yes, the pricing that was mentioned in the script was reflecting conventional cigarette pricing over conventional cigarettes revenue. We do of course get a mix benefit as we grow heated tobacco units. If you look at mix companywide, it's a little more complicated, because we also have the effect of geographic volume differences that’s higher or lower margin. So for example, if Turkey grows volume is what happened in the first quarter this year that tends to be at a lower margin than the volume, in say EU that we mentioned before. So that factor comes into the mix as well. So companywide mix is not so clear. But overall, there is a mix benefit absolutely as we grow the heated tobacco unit volumes around the world, because everywhere that we commercialize we have higher margins on heated tobacco units in the cigarettes in that same given market.
Michael Lavery: And again just over and above the pricing that you call out for…
Martin King: Well, the pricing for the year, it's going to vary. Overall, the main takeaway is that the pricing conditions are intact the pricing power is still there, the brands are strong, you see that in the share gains. So we are very encouraged by the pricing environment. It does vary. You have the number of factors going on in this quarter. For instance, Argentina being out of the pricing variance that reduces it significantly in the second half of the year the comparison will be better. In Turkey, we absorbed tax in the first quarter. We've now taken pricing in Turkey recently. Russia, there is a tax timing difference. The tax increase was in January this year whereas in Russia, it was in July. So the comparison for the first half year is more difficult. And then there are some countries like Philippines, for example, where we had very nice pricing last year, but it was more a issue of closing the gap from the JTI acquiring the Mighty brands and the crude tax, excise tax being fully reflected in the price, so that close price gaps in the market last year and even starting the year before. So we had very nice pricing as that catch-up occurred, returning more the pricing that should be in the market. And so the comparison against this year, while we continue to have good pricing variance and we anticipate still to have a good pricing variance in the Philippines, it's not nearly as big as it was last year, so all these factors come into play. On top of that we just took the pricing in France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Turkey. And we're going to keep looking for pricing opportunities as we go forward. So we are confident we'll be over the 5% to the part of the year, and it's pretty good pricing environment overall.
Michael Lavery: And then can you just touch on the competitive environment for heated tobacco in Japan, there's been some new product launches obviously you're still growing there or even picking up versus where you were last year. What have you seen from any of the competitive initiatives, is it too early to really have a read? Or what's the right way to characterize the competitive dynamics there now?
Martin King: Well, right now we're the ones growing as we showed you on the chart. We were driving the category growth and taking pretty much almost all of that growth into IQOS related consumables. Now, there are some new products that have been launched but very limited amounts, so it’s hard to see how they're going to do. And then later in the year, probably in the October time period or so is what we understand from competitors that they're planning to launch some additional products, which has combined effects. One positive from it is it could very well help accelerate the category growth. One of the problems we called out in the past in Japan is as consumers try other products in the heat-not-burn space, in many cases they've been disappointed and dropped out of the category as opposed to being satisfied by the products and staying with it. So IQOS still has by far in a way the best conversion rates of anything out there. We'll see if these additional launches or products, which people can convert to more readily. But I think we're still confident that we'll have the best product in the marketplace based on everything we know today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So sticking with the theme of competition in Asia. Can you just elaborate a little bit on the competitive activity that you cited in South Korea. Any color around relative price points of commercial activity would be helpful. Thank you.
Martin King: Well, the price points on the consumables are pretty much clustered around the 4,500 three and one per pack. I think there's maybe one competitor has slightly lower price. The differences on the devices though is larger, IQOS 3 and multi are priced at a premium versus most of the other devices. But the bigger driver I think is on the consumable side. In Korea, there's very little price tiering, as well as the whole market mostly clustered around that same -- including cigarettes by the way, clustered around that same 4,500 per pack price.
Vivien Azer: So given the limited price variance on the consumable, is it your understanding or your belief that its larger variance on the hardware that's driving the heightened competitive activity in your sequential share loss. Is it differences in flavor variance?
A - Martin King: Well, first of all, our share is stable. I mean you're getting some distortions in the reported number from the effects of the graphical health warning volume that was shipped in the fourth quarter last year that we had called out and you're paying it back in the first quarter. Our in-market sales share adjusted for those effects is stable at 7.8%. So we're holding our own that's the good news. We do recognize that we need to continue to broaden our availability of different SKUs. In South Korea, there is a very big role for different flavors and you see that on the cigarette side, but you also see it on the heated tobacco unit side. And we do have a number of different flavors in our SKU lineup, but we continue to look at opportunities to broaden that lineup and we'll work to be competitive across that space as well.
Vivien Azer: And just second question on IQOS in U.S., we've heard from the FDA that there will be some resolution on your application by the end of the year. Can you just remind us when we'll hear a last engagement with the agency, what was the nature of the discussion any specific topics that were raised? Thanks.
Martin King: Well, we continue to expect an answer or a decision anytime. In the past, we have gotten various questions on the application, we've always answered them right away and we're continuing to expect to hear from them and hopefully, we'll be able to get off and running with IQOS in the U.S., sometime this year. But I don't have any real update on the timing or any further insight other than the same comments that you probably read from the TMA that were on the news.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: I wanted to circle back to Japan and IQOS. A lot of discussion this morning, and your in-market sales increased nicely but your shipment volume was down year-over-year and sequentially. And I know this was due to distributor inventory movements. But I guess I was hoping you could drill down just a little further on this, and maybe walk through some of the key dynamics for us of what's going on there. And then really how we should think about shipments versus inventory build for the remainder of the year in that important market?
Martin King: Yes, you're right. It was impacted by inventory change, which is about 0.7 billion sticks. So if you look at in-market sales, it was about $6.4 billion. Now, remember we've had a price increase in Japan and the market is impacted by that. So you have about a 4.5% to 5% market decline coming from the -- the usual market decline, plus the impact of the pricing that occurred in October. So you have to keep that in mind when you're comparing pure volume going back. So despite the very nice share gain that we're experiencing now, the actual in-market sales volume is not as up as much as you might expect, because the total market is declining as of course, it is across all the categories and all the different brands. So I don't know if that answers your question, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: No, that helps. I appreciate that. And then my next question I had was on your plan lowering incremental spend behind IQOS this year. Maybe help us understand how some of the things that you're doing to invest behind this business have changed, or maybe will change versus what you've needed to focus on in the past. I guess, I'm trying to understand where you're at in the cycle in terms of building the business and are you, as you're lowering the spend levels. Again, how are these initiatives changing? And then a second part to that question is margins. On your outlook for margins in '19 or this full year, you mentioned you expect your margins to expand 100 bps. But hoping you could highlight maybe some of the key puts and takes for us? Thanks.
Martin King: First of all, just to be clear on the spend. What I think you're zeroing in on is our step up in net incremental spending, whereas last year, we were about 600 million incremental behind RRP, meaning RRP spend offset by reductions in other areas and shifts, for example, from the CC side and overall cut, versus this year the increment we said it would be about half of that $300 million. That doesn't mean we're not spending behind IQOS and commercial launches and everything else. In fact, our spending really hasn't slowed down. What we're doing is better covering the step up from within our existing cost base. And of course there is also the factor of some of the things we were spending money on last year were for infrastructure that once you have it in place like a digital organization, et cetera, it can scale to much more volume without adding into it. So there's two factors there, one is, some of the big building blocks being in place and not needing to be increased in line with volume. And the other one is a more focused effort to ring cost out of everywhere we can throughout the business in order to be able to maintain a very steady and significant level of investment behind the transformation and reduced risk products but without adding so much incrementally. And that's helped us with our financial objectives, of course. We called out at Investor Day this initiative to find over $1.1 billion of cost efficiencies across the whole business that includes operations, manufacturing, a number of initiatives we've put in place zero based budgeting approach, which is up and running. We've identified number of initiatives we're starting to apply them. So you're seeing those benefits coming through in a lower step up in costs. But it doesn't mean we're slowed our investments behind transformation RRP. It's a very deliberate strategy to be able to invest heavily but without having it affect our margins yet and other aspects of the business, and that's what you're seeing. Did that cover that piece of your question on margins?
Bonnie Herzog: Yes.
Martin King: So margins, the 100 basis points improvement is -- part of it is exactly the same discussion. It's slowing the incremental total costs that we're adding, while still benefiting from the increased margin coming from higher volumes of heated tobacco units, especially in the EU where the margins are very attractive. So it's a variety of different pieces there that help us achieve the 100 basis point at least. And you see even in this quarter we were above that, because of the other factors, the cost and the devices, et cetera, being lower. So this is a multiyear focused effort to improve our margins at the same time we invest significantly.
Bonnie Herzog: That was really helpful. And I mean are there any key headwinds we should think about that will put pressure on your margins as you talk about all the positives? I just want to make sure I think if there are any headwinds that you foresee for the rest of the year?
Martin King: I don't see anything right now that would prevent us from achieving this 100 basis point at least objective. We'd always think of some wild thing that would come from that field, I can't think of anything that's likely to happen that would keep us from making that attempt.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: I wanted to better understand IQOS' distribution reach within Europe versus its market share trends. So thinking about individual countries in Europe, I guess what percent of relevant distribution outlets are IQOS in? And how much more opportunity is there for IQOS to expand its distribution range?
Martin King: I believe we are around 50% in Europe, maybe a little higher now, because that's probably little bit of an older number. But the point is we still within Europe and most of the countries in Europe are not truly, truly fully national. And even if the product is available in some places nationally, the initiatives behind converting smokers and the real consumer journey activities, if you will, are more focused still toward the bigger population areas for efficiency reasons and other. So there is room to grow in EU strictly simply from geographic expansion. And it's a substantial amount of space still available for us to do that. And of course that's true elsewhere as well. Russia we called out is just now with this last expansion that occurred, we are in about a third of the country by volume. Japan and Korea, we are fully national. So those two, there's probably not much room you're going to get from purely geographic expansion. But in just about every other country that we've launched in, we still have geographic expansion opportunities within the country. And of course, we can still over next few years, we'll continue to add countries as it makes sense. So there is plenty of room to grow with this product.
Pamela Kaufman: And then just on Japan, so there is discussion of a potential delay in the consumption tax increase in October. How would that influence your thinking around pricing? And would it preclude you from being able to raise prices in the market, if the tax increase doesn't go through?
Martin King: Well, Pamela, I really can't talk about future pricing. For sure in general, when there is pricing in most countries and in Japan, in particular, it's usually easier to do when there is some sort of an event, either tax increase or VAT increase. It is not impossible to increase prices absent those and we have done it. We did it on Marlboro a couple of years ago. Mevius, we did it independently the year before that. So it's not impossible to have pricing in Japan, absent tax and VAT. But obviously, the event creates the opportunity to be able to do it.
Pamela Kaufman: And just a last question on your expectations for upcoming regulatory developments. Are there other countries where you expect to see changes to favorable tax treatment for heated tobacco? And just an update on plain packaging, any anticipated impacts from the implementation of plain packaging in the Middle East in the coming months?
Martin King: I don't know of any particular situation to call out of expected rollbacks in tax with regard to novel tobacco products. But I mean, we make the case with various governments all the time that the ideal way to think about taxes on tobacco product is along the risk continuum. And if you have cigarettes at say 100% of tax, then you have products that have far lower levels of toxicity and measurable scientifically substantiated benefits that are much, much, much lower than that should be reflected in the tax. So we do make that case. And we have had case situations in other countries where the tax actually improved or the gap improved between cigarettes and heated tobacco units. There are couple of cases actually in the EU. But I can't really call out any going forward, but we'll continue to make the case along those lines. As far as plain packaging, we have a lot of experience now with plain packaging in a number of different countries. And so far, it really hasn't had any significant impact on volume share or any of the other key metrics. So, we're not worried about the implementation of the plain packaging. I mean, obviously, it's important for us to be able to keep branding and keep the premiumness of our products and so forth. So we don't think that plain packaging is the way to go. But if they're going to implement it on cigarettes, then it's not the end of the world. We haven't seen any big impacts from it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pieter Vorster of Credit Suisse.
Pieter Vorster: Good afternoon, Pieter Vorster from Credit Suisse. Just a quick house-keeping question. Last year in Q1, you made your $80 million annual contribution to the foundation for a smoke free world in Q1. Is the timing the same this year or did you make it this quarter or should we look for it in a different quarter this year?
Martin King: Yes, it was the same timing and we have made the contribution and it's the same as it was last year with the size and the timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Radhika Swaminathan of Flowering Tree.
Radhika Swaminathan: Yes, I just wanted to get some of your comments on the Philippines market on the brands. I mean I see some qualitative comments on upgrading. So how's that panning out?
Martin King: I mean, in the Philippines, our share is stable right. We're at flat share but we're growing significantly with our Marlboro share versus Fortune. So we've traded up from mid-price or even low priced brands also from mighty Marlboros and so forth, up in the Marlboro as those price gaps close. So Marlboro is up almost six share points in share from the same period last year, and it's almost 39% share of the market now. Whereas Fortune has dropped by not quite the same amount, but about five share points, which is part -- it's just a function of the gaps, the price gaps closing between the different brands. So, Philippines while our share in volume if you -- our volume was up in the quarter but it's more of a trade loading timing so forth. It's really down slightly overall in the market. And the share is also more or less flat, but the profitability improves as you trade up from a mid-price or low price into the premium. So, Philippines is pretty good story still.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Thanks for the follow-up. I just had one other quick question on platform two. Could you give us any update on the status there?
Martin King: It's pretty much the same as we've communicated before, Michael. We did the test market in the Dominican Republic and we've learned quite a bit on the consumer side. The product is actually well received. It's a product we think will be very successful in the long haul. But we're working on improving the reliability of the product and making sure that charcoal heat source is well secured and won't give us any problems in a broad scale launch. I mean, when you launch in a very big country, you can be shipping billions and billions of units. So even a very, very small rate of dropping off of the heated tip would be of concern so we want to make sure it is absolutely bulletproof and tested and able to stand up in high humidity environments, for example. And also with the new way of attaching the tip and making sure it's right, we need to scale up the manufacturing for it. And that's taking us a little bit of time. So we still have a great deal of confidence in this product, and we believe it will play a role. It will be very nice to have it in a number of markets for more conservative smokers, because the ritual is more similar and we'll get it out there as soon as we can.
Michael Lavery: Do you have a sense of what the timing is for when you could commercialize that more broadly?
Martin King: I really don't have an update right now. We will give it to you when we can.
Michael Lavery: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: And thank you, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin King: Yes, I just want to summarize a couple of the key points, I think going forward. We're very pleased with the start to the year. We've got very good momentum. The combustible tobacco portfolio, the volumes are very good. I think this is the best volume performance we've had in a very long time. The share is very strong. The pricing remains intact and is doing well. So we're very pleased with the base of the business that is the engine that can feed our growth as we move toward smoke free products. At the same time, the IQOS is doing extremely well across geography. We have Japan growing shared nicely and on a very good trajectory. We're able to grow across pretty much every different type of country and geography and consumer preference, regulatory scheme. And we're seeing really pretty impressive growth in places like Russia and the EU. We're on track to deliver our long-term targets of 9,200 billion units. And we're also pleased with the financial results in being able to expand margin and have a have a good cost approach. While we're investing in what we need to invest and continuing to see the growth with substantial investments, but at the same time scrubbing our costs and being very cost conscious throughout the business to be able to fund that without as much incremental spending. And we are very pleased to be able to deliver these results and we'll see as the year unfolds, and we continue to have good momentum we're off to a good start. So I think that's the main points to take away. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you very much.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes the call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR team. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-08 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2018 and Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides which are posted on our website. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, will join André for the question-and-answer period. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin with some general thoughts on our performance in 2018. We achieved robust results from our combustible tobacco portfolio and nearly doubled our heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume, driven by growth in all IQOS markets. We fell short of our initial full year net revenue growth target provided in February last year, which was almost entirely attributable to lower than anticipated IQOS consumer acquisition in Japan and related distributor heated tobacco unit inventory adjustments. In our view, this overshadowed an otherwise robust financial and strategic performance across the business. Clearly and understandably, this contributed to the overall decline in our share price, which was also pressured by broader market concerns surrounding the industry and the consumer staples sector generally. While we recognize that the market is the ultimate judge, we find it difficult to understand the share price impact of certain developments in the industry last year, particularly those that were very U.S. centric and arguably less relevant to our international business. Entering 2019, I believe that we have laid the foundation for a better business performance this year and beyond, thanks to significant investments in product portfolio development and organizational capabilities, including a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion. As I will cover in my remarks in a moment, the underlying strength of our combustible product portfolio remains undoubtedly intact and our smoke-free products are the catalyst to accelerate our overall business growth. Let me now take you through the main elements of our full year results starting with volume. Our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume declined by 2.1%, notably reflecting the reduction in distributor heated tobacco unit inventory in Japan, which we explained during our third quarter 2018 results call. Excluding estimated net distributor inventory movements, total shipment volume was flat, our best annual performance since 2012 with strong growth in heated tobacco units offsetting a decline in cigarette. This performance compares favorably to an estimated decline in total industry volume of 1.6% on the same basis. Our cigarette shipment volume declined by 2.8%, the decrease was due mainly to lower industry volume, notably in Russia and Saudi Arabia, coupled with the impact of consumer switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco product, particularly in Japan, Korea and the EU region. Increased shipment volume, notably in Pakistan and Turkey, driven by higher industry volume and in Thailand driven by higher market share served as a partial offset. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 14.2% to 41.4 billion units despite estimated net distributor inventory movements in Japan of approximately 17 billion units. More importantly, our in-market sales volume for heated tobacco units nearly doubled, reaching 44.3 billion units, a significant achievement driven by all IQOS launch markets, including Japan and Korea. Turning to our 2018 financial results, net revenues increased by 3.4%, excluding currency, driven by strong pricing of our combustible tobacco portfolio and heated tobacco unit shipment volume growth. The users’ product net revenues reached $4.1 billion or 15.8% of total net revenues, with IQOS devices and accessories accounting for approximately $0.9 billion or 22%. For reference, last year distributor inventory adjustment in Japan of an estimated 4.5 billion units adversely impacted our total net revenue growth, excluding currency, by approximately 1.2 points. The move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina further impacted growth by approximately 0.6 points. Our 2018 combustible tobacco pricing variance represented 7.6% of prior year combustible tobacco net revenues, with positive contributions from all 6 of our regions. Pricing was particularly strong in Canada, Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. The strong pricing performance in Russia benefited from a very favorable comparison following essentially no net pricing in the market in 2017. Also, in the Philippines, we benefited from improved industry pricing dynamics following the significant decrease in non-tax product availability. On a currency neutral basis, adjusted operating income was essentially flat, while our adjusted operating income margin decreased by 1.3 points. The margin decline primarily reflected the impact of our net incremental RRP investments of approximately $600 million. For reference, the factors mentioned previously for Japan and Argentina had an adverse combined impact on our currency-neutral adjusted operating income growth and margin of approximately 3.3 and 1.1 percentage points respectively. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.10 increased by 8.1% driven by both a lower effective tax rate and net interest expense. Excluding adverse currency of $0.11, which occurred in the second half of the year, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 10.4%. The lower effective tax rate and net interest expense were both driven by the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our 2018 effective tax rate decreased to approximately 23%, slightly better than the 24% that we had assumed as part of our guidance in November and around 5 to 6 points below our effective tax rate in the years prior to tax reform. The decrease in net interest expense resulted from greater flexibility on cash repatriation and capital structure optimization provided by the reform. Our operating cash flow of $9.5 billion increased by over $500 million, or 6.4% principally driven by higher net earnings partly offset by unfavorable currency. Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion came in below our full year assumption, primarily reflecting continued improvement in heated tobacco unit investment efficiency as equipment productivity rises. Turning now to market share, our total international share of 28.4% increased by 0.5 points, our highest organic growth since 2008 driven by heated tobacco units, which reached a share of 1.6%. Remarkably, share grew in all six of our regions, underlining the strength of our combined portfolio. Our share of the international cigarette category was flat at 27.4%, demonstrating our success in maintaining cigarette market leadership while transitioning our product portfolio and transforming our overall organization. Further, despite over-indexed IQOS out-switching and the impact of the sizable volume contraction in Saudi Arabia during the first half of the year, Marlboro’s international share of the cigarette category was also flat, reflecting share growth in a number of markets, including France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and Turkey. With the performance of IQOS being top of mind for investors, let me also highlight some of the latest results and developments, beginning with an overall view, followed by some market specific commentary. As seen on this slide, the total estimated number of IQOS users reached 9.6 million in the fourth quarter, continuing the positive quarterly sequential growth trend. Importantly, nearly 70% of the total, an estimated 6.6 million users, have already stopped smoking by switching to IQOS, while the balance are in conversion. IQOS user growth in the quarter was especially driven by the EU region and Russia. Approximately 1/3 of the total IQOS user base is now in markets outside Asia, which highlights the broadening geographic success of the brand’s proposition. As announced last year, we began the global launch of our IQOS 3 devices in mid-November, starting with our own retail and e-commerce channels. Though still early as full device availability and expansion to our main distribution channels has only occurred in the past couple of weeks, we are very pleased with the initial consumer reaction to the new device lineup across IQOS markets. I will now turn to the performance of IQOS in specific geographies, beginning with Japan. As discussed during our earnings call in October, there were sizable trade and consumer purchases of both cigarettes and heated tobacco units across the industry during the third quarter in advance of the excise tax-driven price increases on October 1. This led to a distortion in heated tobacco unit in-market sales in both the third and fourth quarters. The same distortion is reflected in our share progression between the third and fourth quarter. When equalized for the purchase patterns, our estimated share in each quarter was approximately 15.4%. Looking to 2019, we are encouraged that the favorable heated tobacco unit weekly off-take share trend that we observed during the fourth quarter continued in January. We anticipate increased competitive activity this year, including new heated tobacco product launches. This may accelerate overall category growth, in part by reducing the consumption dilution observed with current competitive device ownership, which I will show shortly. In this context, we believe that the new IQOS 3 and its continued superior sensorial experience in combination with the range of initiatives that we rolled out during the later part of last year, including the mid-priced HEETS brand, will allow us to restore growth. Importantly, the convenience store channel, which accounts for the vast majority of our volume, began selling IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 MULTI as of last week. But already, IQOS 3 has significantly increased the number of new users acquired by IQOS compared to the 2018 monthly average prior to IQOS 3 launch. Furthermore, the national rollout of the HEETS brand, which is currently only available in geographies with approximately 25% of the country’s tobacco consumers will begin in the coming weeks. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the heated tobacco category in Japan and of our brand specifically. Japanese adult smokers continue to show a strong and growing interest in heated tobacco product as demonstrated by device ownership and past 7-day usage trend. Based on the latest available data over 45% of Japanese tobacco consumers owned at least one device while over 40% reported using a heated tobacco product over the past 7 days, while these indicators of category interest are not yet fully reflected in the latest category share of consumption of around 23%, this is understandable for a couple of reasons. First, switching takes time, with a lag between device purchase, use and the full conversion that maximizes heated tobacco share. This is easiest to see through the end of 2017, when IQOS was essentially the only product on the market at scale. Second and more importantly, other heated tobacco product, which became broadly available over the course of ‘17 and ‘18 have been far less effective than IQOS in fully converting adult smokers. This is due to relatively low taste satisfaction, leading to mainly situational use that further dilutes the category share relative to device ownership. Lower conversion effectiveness is also generating some hesitation among more conservative cigarette smokers to enter the category at this stage. Many users of competitive devices have never tried IQOS, and certain IQOS users also own a competitive device. Both groups represent great opportunities for us, with IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 MULTI. Over time, as competitive products improve and more heated tobacco users experience the relative benefits of IQOS, particularly those who began their heated tobacco journey with a competitive product, we expect the gap between total category share and the level of device ownership to narrow. Turning to Korea, fourth quarter share for HEETS of 8.5% increased by 3 points compared to the same period in 2017 or by 1.1 points sequentially, it should be noted that our share in the quarter was distorted by trade inventory movements ahead of the change in health warnings on heated tobacco products in late December. We are pleased with our share performance, particularly given the backdrop of additional competitive activity in the heated tobacco category as the year progressed as well as the confusion among some adult smokers caused by the Korean FDA’s comments last year regarding the tar generated by heated tobacco products. In-market sales volume for HEETS increased slightly on a sequential basis to 1.5 billion units. Looking to 2019, IQOS remains the preeminent brand in the category, with HEETS holding over 75% category share in the fourth quarter. This position has been reinforced by the launch of our new devices, giving us confidence in our ability to grow HEETS volume and share further. In the European Union Region, fourth quarter share for HEETS reached 1.7% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, an increase of 1.1 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, supported by all IQOS markets. On a sequential basis, share growth accelerated in the quarter, increasing by 0.5 points. It is worth noting that IQOS is only present in geographic areas representing approximately 47% of industry total volume in the region. The favorable share momentum reflects continued growth in the total number of IQOS users, which reached nearly 1.8 million by year-end. Importantly, as of late January, IQOS 3 is finally fully available in essentially all IQOS markets across the region. Our HEETS share growth in the EU region was driven by a number of markets, notably Greece, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Italy, Poland and Germany. As we have said before, the speed of IQOS adoption will vary by market. This reflects factors such as the underlying disposition of adult smokers to use and recommend innovative tobacco products as well as the regulations that apply to reduced-risk products, such as those that impact our ability to communicate to adult smokers about better alternatives to continued cigarette smoking. Despite related constraints in certain geographies, IQOS is growing across all EU launch markets, and the fourth quarter accelerations are going well for 2019. In Russia, the strong sequential performance of IQOS continued in the fourth quarter, with HEETS market share up by 0.7 points to 1.8% of the total number of IQOS users, reaching 0.8 million. This performance is impressive given the fact that IQOS is present in only 7 cities, where the average fourth quarter share for HEETS was nearly 8%, with share in Moscow approaching double digits. This primarily reflects increased adult smoker interest in and understanding and acceptance of IQOS as well as our targeted approach to geographic and channel expansion, which has underpinned an improvement in IQOS conversion rates and consumer experience. Given our success in the existing large cities, we are now expanding into additional geographic areas. Before I turn to our 2019 outlook, let me remind you of the 3-year financial growth targets that we outlined during our Investor Day last September. For the 2019 to 2021 period, we are targeting currency-neutral compound annual growth of at least 5% for net revenues and at least 8% for adjusted diluted earnings per share. As detailed in today’s press release, we have adjusted the formulation of our annual EPS guidance to reflect the difficulty in determining with precision the speed at which adult smokers will adopt reduced risk products. At the beginning of each year, we will now forecast our annual reported diluted EPS and the related currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth rate by reference to a minimum threshold of expected performance. As each year unfolds, we intend to provide greater detail. For 2019, we forecast reported diluted earnings per share to be at least $5.37 at prevailing exchange rates compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $5.08 in 2018. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.10 in 2018. Our 2019 forecast assumes currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%, which includes an expected adverse impact of approximately 0.6 points due to the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina. We expect IQOS and heated tobacco unit volume growth, in particular, to be the key driver of this growth. Combustible tobacco pricing will remain an important contributor, underpinned by the broadly rational tobacco excise tax environment and mitigating the impact of the anticipated combustible product volume decline. As noted earlier, we recorded an exceptional pricing variance in 2018 that creates a challenging pricing comparison this year. We expect our average pricing variance over the 2018 and ‘19 2-year period to be in line with our average annual pricing variance from 2008 to 2017. We anticipate the total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline of approximately 1.5% to 2% in 2019. This compares favorably to an estimated total industry decline of around 2.5% to 3% for the year. Given the challenge of forecasting with precision heated tobacco unit shipment volumes, we are not providing a specific 2019 target at this early stage of the year. That said, we expect positive volume contributions from all IQOS markets in 2019, and we remain confident in our shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021. Turning to our cost base, our efforts to deliver over $1 billion in annualized cost efficiencies by 2021 are already underway led by important initiatives related to productivity, zero-based budgeting, a project-based organization model and other cost reduction opportunities. We expect our progress on this front to contribute to an increase in currency-neutral operating income margin of at least 100 basis points in 2019. We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23% consistent with last year and a relatively stable net interest expense compared to 2018. We are targeting 2019 operating cash flow of at least $10 billion subject to year end working capital requirements. We project total capital expenditures this year of approximately $1.1 billion reflecting further investment behind RRPs in particular to support our platform for e-vapor manufacturing capacity. I will close our 2019 outlook with some comments on the first quarter. While we don’t provide quarterly guidance, I believe that it is appropriate to share some additional visibility related to pricing. We currently anticipate reported diluted EPS of approximately $1 in the quarter or flat compared to last year, subject to the timing of commercial spending associated with some of our IQOS related projects. Excluding approximately $0.09 of adverse currency at prevailing exchange rates, this represents a growth rate of 9% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $1 in the first quarter of 2018, which itself included a positive contribution from currency of $0.03 or approximately 3 percentage points. I will conclude with a few key takeaways from our 2018 performance. As evidenced by our total share growth internationally and our stable share of the cigarette category, we are successfully managing our transition from cigarettes to reduced-risk products. Our combustible tobacco portfolio remains the foundation of our business and is delivering robust performance and pricing power. Furthermore, the international cigarette industry volume decline was broadly in line with historical trend. IQOS continues to grow globally, nearly doubling heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume in 2018 and increasing the number of markets, making important contributions to its success. We estimate that as of year end over 6.6 million adult smokers around the world had already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. We estimate a retail value of approximately $18 billion for the combined heated tobacco and e-vapor category outside China and the U.S., with heated tobacco representing approximately 70% of the total. IQOS alone accounts for an estimated 57% of the combined retail value, with unit margins and switching rates superior to any other nicotine product. We expect to increase our share of the e-vapor market through further development and deployment of our product portfolio. Turning to 2019, we anticipate better underlying business fundamentals, driving currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%. Our 2019 EPS forecast reflects a growth rate of at least 8%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $5.10 in 2018. Finally, we remain confident in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that our RRP portfolio continues to provide us with a single largest opportunity to accelerate our business growth and generously reward our shareholders over time. Thank you for listening. Martin and I are now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, André. I actually first wanted to ask you about Altria’s decision to take a stake in JUUL. I would really love to hear your thoughts on this and if you think this was a good decision for them. And also given the rapid growth of e-cigs in several markets internationally, would you guys consider some type of distribution agreement with JUUL? I think you will answer on you believe your technology is superior, but couldn’t there be a case for you to do both especially you are still not at a point really to fully rollout your technology?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I will start by reminding everyone that, because there is a lot of discussion amongst investors and in the media in general what is the potential of x product, y product, JUUL, IQOS and so on and we have to understand that this is not a binary or a zero-sum game or winner takes all kind of situation. I think you can say there are some form of parallelism with intersections in the trajectory of consumers between e-vapor products, lighter-pure nicotine products and heated tobacco products. We know that heated tobacco products have the highest conversion ability, but there are people that in markets where IQOS doesn’t exist, that have already switched fully to e-vapor products. And there are people that use both. So, we are going to see very different behaviors that are sometimes complementary and nonexclusive. We will see we know that there is dual usage of e-vapor and cigarettes. We have people that may continue using the same amount, of cigarettes and have a few additional e-vapor products. And you will also see heated tobacco products, like IQOS and e-vapor, being used simultaneously. That’s why we developed a portfolio of products that can cater to all consumers and that will see all kinds of combination going forward. So, we are ready to compete with everybody, and I think competition in the category and the ability to switch people out of cigarettes is very important. I mentioned in my remarks, Japan, where we see that not subsidiary performing products in terms of sensory experience dilute the category, and we welcome products that can. So, I think, for us, as a matter of principle, there is room for all products, and there will be no one exclusive user of our competitor in any category. So, I think we know sufficiently, and we have demonstrated over the past year that we understand all the categories, and so we understand all the consumers, okay? So, in our situation, to a certain degree, we’re not in the same market as Altria and I will not comment on the Altria decisions because they have to look at their own portfolio and situation. And they took the decision to make the investment, which I respect. I think nothing has changed in the relationship we have with Altria in preparation of the IQOS launch in the U.S., and I think Altria confirmed that they are fully ready once we get FDA approval to go for IQOS. And we are looking forward to this moment. As far as JUUL is concerned, clearly, JUUL benefits from a certain degree of awareness due to the U.S. market in certain English-speaking countries. So, we’ll see some initial success, for sure, because there is awareness as we had with IQOS, for example, in some markets when we entered, like Korea. But then, we have to see the sustainability of the product proposition, both from a marketing and product performance point of view. But again, there is no one winner takes it all, okay? So, I think we have to go over this, this initial excitement and discussion, who is going to be the winning technology, who is going to be the winning brand. I think there will be many brands. I believe IQOS is already a very well-established brand, as I said in my remarks. If we combine the e-vapor and heated tobacco category, and the e-vapor category internationally is essentially in the EU and has been fairly stable, IQOS has 57% of the entire retail value of both categories combined, and we’re not even in the e-vapor category. We plan to enter significantly the e-vapor category as of the end of this year, including with the devices we showed in Investors Day that are smaller devices to cater to different consumers’ needs. And that’s why we also said we increased a little bit the CapEx so that we have capacity to develop this to commercialize this product. And I think we are ready for competing. The only thing I would say is JUUL, I hope they learned their lessons regarding certain undesirable target audiences that we are very careful and extremely wise about. And I hope that the Altria participation will increase their attention to unintended audiences. That’s all I have to say.
Bonnie Herzog: Now that was helpful. And then if I may, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the new innovation you just put into the market in November that you discussed a bit. But if you could drill down a little bit further for us and talk about if it did, in fact, meet your expectations or possibly exceed your expectations so far. And then what will the rest of the rollout schedule look like? For instance, I think you’re still planning to do a phased rollout, but will the bulk of the new devices be in the market by the end of Q1, or is it by the end of Q2? And then last point on this, I’d like to hear from you just a little bit more about the cannibalization you might have been seeing. You mentioned, I think, it’s been quite incremental, but I just kind of wanted a better understanding of that.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. We’re talking about 2 different things, if I understand. The first is the rollout of what we call IQOS 3 devices and IQOS MULTI, and the other, what happens with the second lineup of consumables we have in Japan. Is that correct?
Bonnie Herzog: Yes.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. So, a bit limited initially on IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 moved in many markets, so we made the product available only through our own retail and e-commerce. And we also made the product, so we had limitations, and I have to say we’re very pleased with the initial reaction. People understand and appreciate also the IQOS MULTI because that was a clear consumer need. We have combined sales of both, and that’s very good. And we also continue selling IQOS 2.4. So, although it’s a limited sample, I would say, because we are not national and in every retail channel with IQOS 3, the first indications is things are happening the way we had foreseen are happening. And the comments from the consumers are good. And if you look at more to use Net Promoter Scores, we have improved also significantly the Net Promoter Score of IQOS in Japan, in particular, and in other places. And at the same time, we see new user acquisition, even with this limited availability of IQOS 3 increasing. So, it’s early indications, but they are good indications, and we see the same in other markets. We’ll give a bit more color and granularity in CAGNY because we will have a bit more weeks behind us with full availability. But so far, so good. Now regarding HEETS, our reading is they help from the limited markets again we’re in. They help increase consumer acquisition because we cater to people that are a bit more price-sensitive. We have incremental share if you combine both Marlboro heated units and HEETS in the places we were, and that’s why we decided to extend. There is obviously a certain cannibalization because we are, essentially, the only product. But overall, we have share increase, and that’s the encouraging part.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: So, André, I guess I wanted to ask a little bit more about the volume outlook for 2019. I know you’re not giving specific volume target for IQOS, but clearly, you’re giving the consolidated volume guidance of down 1.5% to 2%. So, I think we can kind of back into what you’re, at least high level, expecting for IQOS if we assume combustibles down somewhere around 3%, 3.5%. So maybe a little bit more color just in terms of, at a high level, how do you see volume kind of playing out for IQOS and combustibles. And then more specifically, in Japan, just based on JT’s comment earlier today that they’re expecting only 3% category growth for the heat-not-burn this year, I’m just wondering if you think that the growth rate could be more robust or is that kind of a more prudent assumption at this point in the year?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, we see clearly growth in all the markets where IQOS is present, okay, volume growth. I mean, I would not read too much in the forecast of global combined cigarettes and everything because, frankly speaking, we were positively surprised last year by the combustible category as well with more positive volumes than we initially anticipate. All I would say is we are in line with the projection I gave for 3 years down the line, 90 billion to 100 billion, and I would not venture in more precise volumes this year because they are baked in the, at least, 5% revenue growth, okay? In Japan, in particular, if you have noticed from the slides, I don’t know if you had the opportunity to see them, we see growth in the share of IQOS, actually in Japan, in January, the share of IQOS was 16.5%. So that’s very nice compared to 15.4% we had in the previous quarters. I would not it’s in 1 month, and I would not read anything into this, but it’s a positive development. And EU and Russia, as you have seen, we have very positive trends. So, we are very optimistic, but we’ll keep you abreast on what’s happening as the year unfolds.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a little bit more specific to Russia because obviously, that’s one market where, clearly, you’ve seen improvement sequentially, both on the volume side and market share side. I guess my questions are, number one, is that starting to have a bigger impact on the broader combustible category volume, certainly in markets like Moscow, where you’ve got a pretty sizable share with IQOS? And then just broadly speaking, as you kind of roll out IQOS into additional cities in Russia, kind of the cadence of volume trajectory that you’re expecting as you implement that strategy going forward?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, I mean, as we expand in different cities, we’ll see additional volume, obviously. We also need to understand, we are in the richest and more affluent cities, and we see continued growth. As we expand over time, maybe the growth trajectories will be a bit slower because we are reaching lower-income consumers. But overall, I think Russia piloted a number of practices, including using digital tools, that show that we can scale up efficiently without necessarily expanding manpower everywhere. And that’s something, now that we have the digital platforms, as I said, and infrastructure available and we’re rolling it out as we speak, should be an accelerator this year and most importantly, in the years to come, with also much more cost efficiency underlying the growth trajectories of IQOS. So, I see I mean, we’re very pleased with what’s happening in Russia. I think it’s a very clear demonstration that IQOS has potential everywhere, even in markets that have less purchasing power. And the testing of the tools show that we can scale with much more efficiency than before. So, it’s all very positive signs.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. And then just my last question. Just in terms of your profit guidance or the operating margin being up about 100 basis points, it seems like that’s mostly around being the half of kind of the incremental spending that you put into place in 2018 kind of not growing again. So, I’m just curious if that’s sort of the correct interpretation. And I know that IQOS has been pretty volatile just in terms of thinking about the profit performance. So, when you kind of look at the 100 basis points operating margin target, how comfortable are you that you should be in position to deliver on that target even if volume slows or other things happen from an IQOS kind of volatility standpoint?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, we are fairly confident we can then deliver on this. It’s a combination of, as we said, lower spending, much lower spending than last year, but still incremental spending. And the second one is an increased volume contribution of IQOS to the overall earnings. And as we know, IQOS has better margins. So that’s the way I would read it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you very much so first, can I just follow up on the answer you gave to Judy, just to make sure I got it, absolutely right? With respect to the 100 basis points, it sounds like the majority of that is coming from the efficiencies of rolling out IQOS that you always said you were going to get. And yes, we’re talking about the rise at the beginning of last year and less of it is coming from the new, relatively new use of $1 billion ZBB savings. Is that the correct way of understanding that last answer?
André Calantzopoulos: That’s correct. We started the ZBB project. But as you can understand, it’s not going to deliver big amounts of money in the first year because we have to go through the whole process and do it properly, okay? So, I see this participating as of the next year. And we never said, just to be clear, that the $1 billion we are targeting is all money that you’re going to see on the bottom line, but you should see a portion of that to the bottom line. The other helps the incremental investment, so the deltas are not as big as they used to be in the previous year.
Adam Spielman: Okay thank you very much. So, the real question or the more important question is around IQOS. And I was surprised, frankly, how strong it was in this quarter relative to the third quarter. And I was just wondering if there were any shipping effects we should be calling out. Clearly, Japan was harmed by shipping effects. You called out a positive one in Korea. But for example, in Italy and in Russia, where there any shipping effects that somehow artificially boosted your IQOS volumes?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. There were, some shipment in Russia ahead of we’re expanding in different cities. So, there is its preparation of the expansion, okay? I don’t remember exactly how much that was, around $1 billion, $0.8 billion, something like that, if I can recall correctly, okay?
Martin King: It was planned.
André Calantzopoulos: It was planned from the beginning, so it’s not something but there is nothing else in there. The rest is direct in-market sales, okay?
Adam Spielman: And so, for example, if you will focus just on Italy, there was a huge jump in market share in Italy in 4Q, even relative to 3Q. I was just wondering if you can explain what caused that and how we should think about it going forward as well?
André Calantzopoulos: That’s a very good question. First of all, I think we see momentum in Italy. It took a lot of time, if you remember, Adam, to get Italy moving given the restrictions. And I think it’s just the fact that there are more consumers of IQOS in Italy, so start having word-of-mouth, okay? Again, I wouldn’t read 1 quarter as the proxy for the acceleration, but the momentum is there. So, I think, in Italy, finally, we start seeing this better than slow linearity of growth, and that’s exactly what’s happening. And this is ahead of us deploying further of the efficiency tools I described. But this is what you read in Italy, share of the market. It’s nothing to do with inventories and shipments and all these things.
Adam Spielman: Perfect. And then one final question for me. And this is about the guidance. Am I correct to understand, you’re giving guidance in sort of 2 different sorts of ways, firstly, you’re giving floor guidance? So, it’s a minimum of 5% sales growth. It’s a minimum of 8% constant currency EPS. But then when you’re talking about things like the volume, the combined volume figures, that’s more of an expectation. It’s not a floor. And is that correct that it’s more in the sense and the style you used to give guidance, that this is really what you expect to happen? And it might be a little bit worse, it might be a little bit better. But the EPS isn’t really an absolute floor in terms of constant currency?
André Calantzopoulos: Yes. I mean, look, volume for the year is a bit difficult to estimate. So, we gave a range of 1.5% to 2%, okay? That’s our estimate. It can come better or slightly worse. It depends on the combustible as well. So, it’s just to give you a flavor of what we see compared to total market, which means we expect share growth in this whole context, helped obviously by the IQOS units as well. But I mean, the key guidance is more than 5% and more than 8%, and that’s how it is.
Nick Rolli: Yes, at least.
André Calantzopoulos: All right?
Nick Rolli: At least.
Martin King: At least.
André Calantzopoulos: At least, yes.
Adam Spielman: Yes at least. And can I tempt you to sort of give a sort of offering so that you’d be really surprised if, let’s say, it was more than 12% on EPS? Or how big is that at least? I mean, how big is it? To me, it’s very conservative.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, as the year goes, I had I think depending on what happens, we’ll give you better forecast for the remaining year. I would stay to what I said at this stage, and that’s all I can tell you at this stage, Adam.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. I failed to tempt you. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So, I wanted to follow up on the IQOS 3 launch in Japan, and I appreciate you want to hold some of this detail back for when we see you in CAGNY in a couple of weeks. But can you offer any color around like the underlying consumer demographics of the new users that you indicated you’ve been acquiring? Is it kind of going deeper into that kind of first tranche of consumers, kind of younger, more affluent, or are you finally starting to see early success in terms of penetrating that 55 Plus market that had proven a bit elusive? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, clearly, we made – first of all and foremost, we made these devices available as an option to existing users of IQOS, especially part of our, what we call the IQOS sphere and exclusive users, okay, because I think that’s fair to these people to have first access. But we also see now sales from people that have never bought IQOS before. I don’t have the demographics to be fair with you – with me, but we’ll provide them in CAGNY. And I would not like – I wouldn’t provide statistics just with 1 weeks or 2 weeks of rollout, okay? So, what I – I repeat what I said before, we also see sales of 2.4 Plus surprisingly because people knew that the new device is coming and still bought 2.4, especially the most price-sensitive consumers, which in my view shows that the strategy works and that there will be people that they will enter the category also through 2.4 Plus. Don’t forget, we kept the previous version at a lower price and we sell the new devices at a higher price, so we have a dual strategy. And I think this in combination with the HEETS that are at a lower price than the Marlboro consumables are for IQOS, will help us increase the penetration of the more price-sensitive consumers, okay.
Vivien Azer: Okay. That sounds great and totally reasonable and I look forward to hearing more about that at CAGNY when you have more data. My other question on the RRP category in Japan, just to kind of follow up on Judy’s question, I certainly appreciate your point that with a host of product activity from you and your peers that, that should engage more Japanese consumers. The question though that I have is do you have adequately embedded in your guidance increased spend? I know you’ve got a really favorable comp, but given that you’ve got new products from a host of competitors hitting in 2019, how are you thinking about incremental investment spend in Japan specifically? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, we have embedded overall, I would not make specific comments for markets, incremental spending. As I said, it’s much less than last year, but it’s still a lot of incremental spending and I think we’re adequately equipped to compete in Japan. At the same time, as I said, we’re also rolling out digital tools and CRM platforms we didn’t have before. And that should help cause the retention, which we should not forget, including making existing IQOS users that own multiple devices to go back and exclusively use IQOS, which IQOS 3 helps significantly in achieving this. So overall, I think we are in good shape. We knew the competition is going to come. And I think at the end of the day, a better product will increase the full conversion over time and then over time also, the best product will win. But as I said many times, we’re not going to have 80% of the segment forever in Japan. What is important is that the entire category grows over time and I see no reason why the category will not grow. Every indication from what we showed is, is with the right product portfolio, the category will continue to grow.
Vivien Azer: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Lavery.
Michael Lavery: Good afternoon. Thank you. You have several markets in Europe now that have around a mid-single-digit or even higher IQOS share. But typically, those countries still don’t have national expansions. Can you give us both a sense of when that might come and also in some launch cities or launch areas, what the share might look like? If you’re giving to us now on a national basis, what does it look like where it’s a little bit more concentrated?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I mean, if I – as I said, if you take the European Union, we are roughly at 50%, 47% of volume-weighted, if you want, present. So, our share in the European Union would be double in the places where we are present, roughly speaking, okay, so it’s 1.7, I think it would be 3.4, okay, as…
Michael Lavery: Yes. I understand that math. I guess, more specifically, some of the places you’ve launched first like Milan, Rome, Prague, Athens, not necessarily first, but where there’s been either a longer history and/or a more rapid acceleration and better awareness. What does the share look like in some of those places that are your better performers that when you give a national share, might be masked a little bit by places that – in that country you still haven’t launched yet or that have just – that are just getting started?
André Calantzopoulos: Yes, look, I don’t have all the numbers. If I recall correctly, Athens is well above 10, because I know, it’s my home city, okay. Actually, yes, it is – the whole region of Attica, including Athens is 14% now, which is pretty high and growing. Milano, I don’t have it, if somebody can help me here.
Martin King: Rome is about double the –
André Calantzopoulos: Just 1 second. Milan actually is an interest experiment because it’s where we tried the first ways in the past. It was very flat, took us a lot of time to make consumers try the product again. But if I’m not mistaken –
Nick Rolli: It will be in Milan or in Rome –
André Calantzopoulos: Okay, sorry, but in Milan or in Rome, it’s 5.3, something like that, okay. We’ll give you bit more color in CAGNY on all this. But for me Milano is probably the most important because it is the most difficult city because of the previous presence of IQOS to regain momentum and we did. So that’s a very good sign, actually.
Michael Lavery: Okay. No, that’s very helpful. Thank you. And then just on your thoughts on more national expansions in any other European markets or you’ve already talked about Russia expanding a little bit more. Is that one that you would expect to go national as well?
André Calantzopoulos: Look we go gradually in most of the markets. As I said previously, our objective, I mean, we are at 43, call it markets today. The priority is to expand nationally to see the full potential in these markets, now that we can scale up efficiently. And during the year, we may open new markets if there’s strategic opportunity or the regulation changes, but the focus is to expand nationally in the markets where we are and that’s what we are following, okay.
Michael Lavery: Okay, that’s great. And then just a little bit more of a housekeeping question, you talked about the 100 basis points margin expansion X currency. Do you have any sense of what the transactional currency impact might be that we should have in mind or to factor in there?
André Calantzopoulos: I have not – I don’t have the calculation, but traditionally, our transactional currency is 10% of the total currency impact. If I can use this as a rule of thumb, I don’t think it’s more than that.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: Hi. Thank you for the question. You made comments at the beginning of the call that the share price performance, which has partly been impacted by industry concerns that are more U.S.-specific. I wanted to get a sense if this influences your view on timing for reinstating share buybacks?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, we look at the share buyback regularly. And I think for the moment, the conclusion is that we follow the plan. I think Martin explained that if we look at the 3-year period including this year, it’s in the outer years that we will be in a position without losing our rating to restore share buybacks. I understand it may be tempting for – to do this, but I think we have to stick to the plan because I believe that some of the impact on the shares as I explained is due to our lower-than-expected initially performance, but the reality is also there is a lot of uncertainty that I’ve been trying to clarify. And we’ll clarify even better e-cigarette categories, e-vapor worldwide and heat-not-burn and all the interactions in CAGNY. I think it’s a necessary anxiety there. And in this context, I think for us, our focus is to deliver the results quarter-after-quarter and get the growth of the products. And I’m sure investors will appreciate these and have the share going up rather than doing very opportunistic share repurchases rather than based on a clear plan when the time is right for them.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. And you mentioned that combustible pricing would – should moderate towards more in line with the historical pricing growth in 2019. What do you see as the puts and takes contributing to your outlook, and are you still anticipating a relatively benign excise tax environment this year?
André Calantzopoulos: No, I think the excise tax – if you look globally, the excise tax environment is fairly stable. I mean, yes, there are occasionally, there are 1 or 2 markets that have more than regular increases. On the other side, we have the positive surprise of Indonesia, where the government decided not to increase excise taxes, okay, so which would help volume. What I was trying to say in my remarks is we have to see 2018 as a very exceptional year because of Russia comparisons, that’s a major contributor to pricing, obviously, given its volume size. Russia 2018 comparisons were compared to 0 almost pricing in 2017. Also in the Philippines, because the illicit trade went away, we had the opportunity to get very significant pricing in ‘18. Obviously, that would be more regular now that we rebased our pricing in the Philippines. So, the overall environment I think of pricing has not changed. It’s very robust. It’s there. But all I said is we have to look at ‘17 – ‘18 and ‘19 as 2. And if you add the 2, we are very much in line with the rest, okay. And we have already taken 60% plus of the pricing so far. There’s still a few markets that the price tax situation has not settled, but this is not anything major. I think overall pricing is very much in place and intact.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. And – thank you. And just lastly, how is IQOS MESH performing? And can you provide an update on what progress you’ve made on your Platform 2 and 3 products and timing?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, IQOS MESH is only in our own e-commerce and a few stores – actually, our own stores in London. For us, it was the experimenting again to see whether the flavors we offer are acceptable to consumers, whether the product itself is acceptable and then improve before we go for much more widespread expansion of the product. So, it’s very difficult to judge what is the potential. I think we learn what we need to learn. Obviously, we’re there with the devices you’ve seen that caters more to the pod and mod, big vape or bigger vape consumers. In Investor Day, we explained to you that we have also smaller devices that cater to different consumers. And we are investing in manufacturing capacity for those devices and related cartridges. Overall, I would say the consumer feedback we receive is very good. They recognize the product is better, much more robust, batteries, detection of end of liquid and all these things. Now we need to integrate them in the smaller devices and that’s what we’re doing just now for rollout. P3 is a bit – we’re preparing the industrial designs for the product. The product is stabilized. Clearly here I see the potential more longer term and more situational use of the product, their full conversion at this stage. So, it’s not something we roll out immediately, but all in very selected places in order to get better understanding. And in Platform 2, which I think is very promising, as we know, we’re working on resolving one problem that in humid climates we had some problems with the heat source, that there were some fall-offs occasionally and that’s – even if it’s very small, it’s not acceptable. So, we are now working – I think we have a solution at lab level. We’re working on how to industrialize the solution before rol-lout. So that’s where we stand on all this.
Pamela Kaufman: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.
Robert Rampton: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first question I have is you mentioned IQOS has better margin. Could you talk about which markets you’ve reached breakeven and in which markets or cities you’ve achieved profit per stick, which is equal or better to cigarettes? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, IQOS in every market we’re in has better margins than cigarettes. As a matter of fact, there is no one single market where we have lower margin than cigarette.
Robert Rampton: Including acquisition costs and retention?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay, we’re talking about marginal contribution here, okay. As we explained many times, in all major markets, clearly, we are breakeven or above. But it takes depending on the market and the difficulty of consumer acquisition based on the restrictions, we’re between 1 year to 2 years before we get to breakeven point, okay. So that’s how I would read it. I think Jacek showed all the details during Investors Day on how to do it at different markets. But that’s the rule of thumb, if you wish.
Robert Rampton: Okay, great. Thank you. And in terms of the upcoming menthol ban in Europe, how does – how is IQOS treated under that, and how are you guys thinking about that?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, heated tobacco products are excluded from the menthol ban, so we don’t see a problem with this, of course, we need to maintain it. And for cigarettes, we are ready clearly to offer consumers some alternatives, but what we saw from markets where there is a menthol ban, nothing happened actually. People switched to the same brands very often with different variants of the brand. So, I don’t expect any major thing to happen in Europe even with the menthol ban.
Robert Rampton: Superb. Thank you. And so my final question, in terms of the latest evidence on the IQOS quitting rates and human trials, could we get an update on that or is that something you’ll give at CAGNY? Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: I don’t – nothing new in there. I mean…
Nick Rolli: Conversions.
Martin King: Conversion rates.
André Calantzopoulos: Conversion rates are the same. And in terms of quitting rates, we don’t see any change in the trajectories in Japan, which is the biggest market. If you look at cigarette or IQOS, it’s – the advent of IQOS has not changed the trajectories of people quitting smoking. So, I think we are on the right side there in terms of concerns of regulators and public health people.
Robert Rampton: Superb. Thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.
Gaurav Jain: Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. Your view on superiority of heat-not-burn over e-cigarettes is clear due to the high conversion rates. Do you think regulators prefer e-cigarettes over heat-not-burn on the risk continuum of risk reduction, which is then getting reflected in higher excise taxes on heat-not-burn versus e-cigarettes in different markets?
André Calantzopoulos: That’s a big question. I think in principle my belief has always been that this product should be not taxed at all, okay? I’m just trying to be real because a reduction of 95% or 98% is a humongous reduction, okay, if you talk heat-not-burn versus e-cigarettes versus everything. Now we have to be also realistic, that’s why the – there will be some taxes. There are taxes on heated tobacco products, some countries tax e-vapor products because at the end of the day, ministries of finance need money. What is important is that there is a differential and substantial differential between the two. And that’s something we have achieved so far in all the markets where IQOS is present. And I think that’s something that in the foreseeable future should be maintained. So now if we look at the two categories, as I explained, consumers will decide at the end of the day how they will behave. The important thing is they move out of cigarettes. It’s – because the only way to achieve harm reduction in global is to have a very high degree of people switching out of cigarettes and sticking 100% to the product. So far, heated tobacco product has proven to be much more efficient in doing this, but also e-cigarettes played a role, and then there will be people that can use both. And when we have nicotine products, maybe they use all three of them depending on the situation they are. So, you will have exclusive category users and you have dual category users as we can see already and that’s why there is room for everybody. On IQOS, we have various platforms under the IQOS brand. We focused initially on the heated tobacco product because we thought and we have the proof that it has the highest efficiency. And now time has come for us to offer more products to consumers. And as we explained also in Investors Day, eventually, we will also have a product that has – use the same device with different consumables, e-vapor, heated and potentially nicotine, so consumers have absolute choice without the hassle of changing devices all the time. Now that’s a bit more future music, but that’s where we go. And I – that’s why I say there is room for all kinds of product in the consumer journey over the years and within a day. And that’s how I see the category.
Gaurav Jain: That is very, very helpful. And if I can have a follow-up on this. So, the guidance you have given for 2021 on IQOS volumes, does it include IQOS MESH volumes as well or that is just the heat-not-burn product in your view?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, it will include eventually e-vapor products, but the essence of our projection was based on IQOS to be frank with you, okay. So maybe e-vapor will become incremental on top of this volume.
Gaurav Jain: Okay. This is very helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And that was our final question. I’ll now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes the call. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations Group. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-18 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Nick Rolli - VP, IR & Financial Communications Martin King - CFO
Analysts: Adam Spielman - Citi Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus Pamela Kaufman - Morgan Stanley
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Additionally, following the comprehensive business review that we provided at our recent Investor Day, today we will summarize our 2018 full-year outlook and third quarter results, as well as our performance in select geographies. For reference, the slides and transcripts for the Investor Day presentations are available on our website and our IR App. It's now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2018 reported diluted earnings per share guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be in a range of $4.97 to $5.02. Our guidance includes $0.12 of unfavorable currency and represents a growth rate, excluding currency of approximately 8% to 9% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. Our guidance continues to reflect the full-year assumptions shown on this slide and detailed in today's press release. Importantly, this includes: PMI heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 41 billion to 42 billion units, reflecting a net anticipated distributor inventory reduction of approximately 3 billion units; and PMI heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume of 44 billion to 45 billion units. Moving to our third quarter results, total shipment volume decreased by 2.1%, due mainly to the impact of distributor inventory movements, notably related to heated tobacco units in Japan. Excluding inventory movements, total shipment volume increased by 1.1%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume in the EU, Japan, Korea, the Middle East and Africa region and Russia as well as higher cigarette volume in select markets, notably Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey. September year-to-date, total shipment volume declined by 1.2%, but increased by 0.3% excluding inventory movements. Given the impact of distributor heated tobacco unit inventory movements on our third quarter 2018 results, let me take a moment to put this into perspective vis-à-vis the 3 billion unit full-year distributor inventory reduction assumption that we previously communicated. As seen on this chart, the full-year reduction is driven by Japan and concentrated in the third quarter, with a decrease of 3.7 billion units. By comparison, there was an inventory increase in the third quarter of 2017 of 3.2 billion units, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.9 billion units. For the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate a 0.5 billion unit inventory increase. This compares to an inventory increase of 7.3 billion units in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.8 billion units. Importantly, heated tobacco unit inventories have been right-sized, and we are poised for future growth. Third quarter net revenues increased by 3.3%, excluding currency, driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by the impact of the heated tobacco unit inventory adjustment that I just noted, as well as unfavorable combustible tobacco volume/mix. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter came in slightly above the approximately 2% growth expectation that we provided during Investor Day. As this difference mainly reflects timing between the third and fourth quarters, we are maintaining our full-year net revenue growth assumption of approximately 3%, excluding currency. Given our September year-to-date growth of 6.5%, this implies a decline in the fourth quarter of approximately 5%, largely reflecting the difficult comparison with the nearly 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income increased by 7.6%, excluding currency, reflecting the price-driven growth in net revenues, the favorable margin impact of lower IQOS device sales, as well as lower manufacturing and marketing costs for combustible products, partly offset by incremental RRP investments across IQOS launch markets. Adjusted operating income margin increased by 1.8 points, excluding currency. Our reported diluted EPS of $1.44 increased by 13.4% in the quarter, driven by favorable business performance, and also benefiting from the lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense compared to the third quarter of 2017. Excluding currency, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 20.5%. Demonstrating our favorable business momentum, total PMI international market share, excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.5 points in the third quarter and by 0.6 points September year-to-date. The growth for both periods was driven by higher share for heated tobacco products, with the lower cigarette shares reflecting the impact of adult smoker out-switching to our heated tobacco brands. Indeed, our cigarette shares within the cigarette category alone were stable. As discussed in detail by our Chief Operating Officer, Jacek Olczak, during Investor Day, our combustible tobacco portfolio continues to be supported by robust fundamentals. This is evidenced by our third quarter combustible pricing variance of approximately 8%, driven notably by the EU Region, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. Furthermore, our results reflect favorable cigarette share and/or volume trends across a range of key markets. For example, the decline in cigarette industry volume in Saudi Arabia moderated considerably in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of the June 2017 excise tax implementation. Importantly, our market share increased by 6.1 points versus the third quarter of 2017, driven by Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, and was up by 1.6 points sequentially. In Turkey, strong cigarette industry volume growth continued in the quarter, supported by the lower prevalence of illicit trade. In addition, although our August quarter-to-date share declined slightly, share for Marlboro increased by 1.3 points. And in the Philippines, both Marlboro and Fortune drove total cigarette market share growth of 1.2 points in the quarter. Marlboro's performance reflects the brand's strong equity in the market, while Fortune is benefiting from narrowed price gaps with lower-priced brands. Turning to the performance of IQOS, we are pleased with the growth in the total user base, which we believe serves as a leading indicator for market share. Indeed, the positive sequential share performance for our heated tobacco brands continued in the quarter, reaching 1.7% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, excluding China and the U.S. In Japan, our largest IQOS market, we recorded stable quarterly HeatSticks share on a sequential basis. This is encouraging, given that we expect the range of initiatives that we have outlined previously including the upcoming launch of IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 Multi to only have a meaningful impact on share beginning in 2019. Please note that third quarter in-market sales for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units, industry-wide benefited from trade and consumer inventory movements in advance of the October 1st price increases. In Korea, in-market sales volume for HEETS in the quarter was stable on a sequential basis at 1.4 billion units. Sequential share for HEETS declined, however, partly reflecting the impact of cigarette in-market sales volume seasonality. The sequential quarterly share trend for HEETS also reflects the impact of misleading comments by the KFDA earlier this year regarding the quote tar generated by IQOS, as well as competitive churn associated with the increased distribution coverage of competitors' products. As Jacek explained at Investor Day, the KFDA's comments have not really been an issue with regard to IQOS users that have already fully made the switch from cigarettes, and thus have discovered the various product attributes for themselves. Instead, the comments have been impacting those who are new to IQOS or were otherwise planning to enter the heated tobacco category. We remain focused on properly educating current IQOS users and adult smokers interested in the heated tobacco category on the differences between tobacco heating and combustion. We are committed to ensuring that these smokers receive accurate information to guide their choices. In addition, the upcoming global launch of IQOS 3 devices, which includes Korea, should reinforce IQOS's status as the preeminent heated tobacco brand in the market. In the EU region, the steady sequential growth of HEETS continued in the quarter, with share reaching 1.2% and reflecting further growth in the IQOS user base. It is also worth highlighting that our quarterly share for HEETS increased in all IQOS markets in the region compared to the third quarter of 2017. Finally, we are particularly encouraged by the strong performance of IQOS in Russia. In the third quarter, share for HEETS reached 1.1% nationally, although our focus is currently on key cities comprising approximately 20% of the total cigarette market. Our disciplined approach to geographic and channel expansion allows us to ensure continued improvement in IQOS conversion rates and consumer experience. To conclude, we delivered solid currency-neutral results in the third quarter, driven by strong pricing for our combustible product portfolio and benefiting at the EPS level from a lower effective income tax rate and lower interest expense. Our 2018 business outlook remains intact, supported by robust fundamentals for combustible products and increasingly broad-based IQOS growth across geographies. Consequently, we are reaffirming our 2018 reported diluted EPS guidance, which continues to represent a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you very much. So, I have two questions. The simpler question is on FFA [ph]. This clearly did much better than I was expecting and I suspect it's partly in Philippines, but a large chunk is Indonesia. I was wondering whether you think that good performance there is likely to continue into 2019 or whether you think it is a sort of short term lift if you like. That's my first question. I will come on to the second later.
Martin King: Okay. Yes, the Philippines and Indonesia are both performing well. Philippines, Marlboro has been on a multi-year share growth trajectory that continues as the pricing in the market at the low-end has moved up and it is the preeminent brand in the market so it continues to grow its share which is helping lift the overall share. More recently the positive has been also that Fortune has started to benefit from the price gaps as well and so its growth has been very good up from a share point of view and obviously with the price gaps closing and the trading to Marlboro is from a share perspective in Fortune that's helped the profitability in the market. As far as we can see going forward, I think the Philippines will continue to be a good story with the single tier tax there and the ability of our brands to continue to do very well. For Indonesia, the volume has been better than more recent times as the market has stabilized. The total market size has stabilized. We're looking probably for the full year for it to be very slightly down but it's very close now to being flat versus before in previous couple years it's been down 1%, 2% to 3%. So that's a positive trend. We're doing very well in Indonesia with a couple of brands, we introduced in the last 12 to 18 months and that is the Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild and then also with the Marlboro Filter Black Kretek they both gained share very nicely and they continue to do so. The challenge for us in Indonesia is with down-trading as A Mild has moved through the 20,000 per pack, rupiah per pack price point it has lost some share. Over time of course other brands will move to that price point and it should recover, but that's still going to take a bit longer to do. So, I think Indonesia is on a good stable platform, shares stable to slightly up and it's been that way now for a good period of time. Obviously, we would like to see the share grow. We'd like to see A Mild start to do better and I think that's just going to take some time as the pricing moves through the market. As you know in Indonesia you have lots of frequent price increases. So, yes very good news in that region.
Adam Spielman: Okay. So perhaps, a more significant question is about your guidance. Given your substantial beats not only of the sales growth, but also on EBIT I suppose I simply didn't understand how your EPS can be as low as you say. In other words, I estimate that you are sort of implying of EPS is that it has to be down something like 11% to 15% for 4Q to make your guidance. On particularly the shipping effects in fact and I want to share the shipping effects on IQOS are fundamentally almost the same in 3Q and 4Q. I didn't understand given how good EPS was this quarter why we should think it's going to be down double-digit next quarter?
Martin King: Okay. So let's start at the revenue line and the story there is really the comparison with a very high increasing Q4 of last year versus what's happening in Q4 this year. Actually sequentially from Q3 to Q4 if you do the math on the revenues to be down about 5% for the quarter versus last year and to be up 3% for the full year you end up with revenues approximately the same in the fourth quarter is what we're seeing in the third quarter. So sequentially it's not really the issue. On the other hand when you compare Q4 to last year, you have several things going on most of which relate to Japan and that is you have the 7 billion almost impact on the inventory comparison year-over-year since we were building last year inventory whereas this year the inventory is relatively flat. So that right there is a pretty significant comparison issue. We also paid back in Q4 in Japan the volume related to this recent pricing that occurred since retail and consumers loaded in the end of Q3 and so you will pay that back in Q4 that's probably around 1.5 billion sticks between conventional and heated tobacco units that's just approximate. And then the other piece is the difference in device sales from last year to this year. Last year, we were bringing on the additional supplier and adding more volume into the market as we were getting ready to lift the cap in the end of January of this year. Whereas this year, we're launching 3, and 3 Multi however we have sufficient inventory of 2.4 plus. So, the comparison year-over-year on devices is also another piece of that. If you talk about the rest of the business, the revenues are actually up about the same in Q4 of this year or will be we anticipate Q4 this year versus Q4 last year around 5%. But the Japan effects are very significant when you add those impacts up. The other piece when you take it down to the EPS level is the cost pattern we're still on track with the cost. The spending increases that we mentioned before around $600 million incremental on RRP, but a bigger piece of it comes in the fourth quarter, so we are stepping up the spending timing in the fourth quarter overall it's still more of less the same. And that's partly behind the 3 and 3 Multi launch around the world as well as other activities around RRP where we are rolling out some of the efficiencies and improvements that we've been preparing all year. So it's all baked in to the guidance, the 8% to 9% takes into account these issues as well as the pricing and everything else.
Adam Spielman: So, to summarize and to make sure I got to understand sequentially. So, thinking about it because I think easy because you've got a 7 billion G load in effect in both quarters 3Q and 4Q, you expect roughly. Sequentially, when all is said and done sales will be roughly the same but EPS is going to go down sharply because you are investing more behind the version 3 device. I mean to me that sounds like the key difference between Q3 and Q4 when you come to the cost line if sales is going to be the same roughly.
Martin King: Yes. I mean revenue is more of less the same. I mean obviously there are other impacts in there like as I mentioned the timing on the timing on the pricing for Japan has an impact or other movement around the world between Q3, Q4 et cetera. But overall, I think it's all baked in.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Martin, just the first question is on the IQOS next gen 3 and the multi launch in the fourth quarter. So, it sounds like in Korea they are announcing a launch next week. I'm just wondering from a timing perspective if you can just remind us sort of the phasing of the launch by just the market is Japan going first and then Japan. Sorry, is Korea going first and then Japan or kind of thinking about the timing around that is my first question.
Martin King: Yes, it will become more clear in the next short period of time. But essentially Japan, Korea are on the same timeline and we're getting ready for having a really successful introduction because we think these devices are a step forward and will help cement our already good position as the premium RRP brand in both those markets.
Judy Hong: Got it. And then in Japan for the inventory loading ahead of the price increases I think you called out 1.5 billion in total in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you can break that a little bit or just combustible versus the HeatSticks? And then I know it's early in the days, but kind of what are you seeing in terms of the consumer acceptance to those pricing and the volume elasticity around that?
Martin King: Well okay. First of all the prices have only been there very very short period of time. So it's too early to really see any patterns in how consumers are reacting. In Japan, just let me plan out to make sure people understand what I'm referring to is retail stores and consumers buying ahead of the price increase which occurred in the third quarter. It doesn't have to do anything with our own shipments to distributors et cetera. This is consumers, however in the fourth quarter obviously consumers and retailers would reverse that and so you could anticipate lower sales. As far as the exact amount, it's difficult to estimate a precise amount. I was giving a round number on the revenue just to give a sense for it. We think heated tobacco units in Japan for the quarter, we were flat to maybe slightly up if you exclude the inventory or the impact of the pricing. But that's just an estimate, right? So you figured it was at 7.5 billion in there, we figured it's around maybe 7.8 billion, 7.9 billion somewhere in that range and whereas cigarettes were around 7.6 billion or so. And that's just a rough estimate Judy. You don't really know until you see how it flows out into the consumers and how the prices are accepted and it's too early to really see that yet.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. And then, this is my last question just in terms of Russia. So, nice to see continued price improvement in that market. Just give us an update in terms of competitively what you're seeing in the marketplace and then sort of the sustainability of this more stable pricing environment in your build?
Martin King: Yes. I mean there is really no new news. The pricing continues to roll through pretty much as we've been talking throughout the year. We still see some down trading from the mid-priced brand like our Bond Street to lower price. We actually see our premium Parliament et cetera holding up pretty well. But the pricing environment is more of less what we communicated in previous quarters which means it's being pushed through. There are certain times when we see higher levels of inventory being used in order to delay the timing between announcing pricing versus when consumers actually get it. But there is really no new news on that front.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co.
Vivien Azer: So, my first question is on the EU and the margin improvement continued to be quite strong on the heels of a good second quarter [indiscernible] as well. Anything to call out there in terms of geographic mix, obviously the pricing has been a bit better but anything else to call out?
Martin King: Right, I think Germany has been a bring spot with the performance of the brand. Marlboro and we've seen some good results there. I mean overall across the EU the bigger story is about the success on the heated tobacco units and IQOS. We're seeing very nice momentum across all the markets with growth and you see it in the number of users which is really the key metric to keep looking at because that for us is what tells us that we're converting smokers and locking in a better future as far as having higher margins and higher benefits for shareholders from the consumers. So, it is on a very good trajectory. But most of it, the most exciting part is that the success of the heated tobacco unit.
Vivien Azer: Terrific! That's certainly encouraging to hear. My next question is on Saudi Arabia. Clearly we understand the volume pressure from the excise taxes and your market share has clearly looked quite good. But there have been press reports that Saudi is looking to implement plain packaging. Any update from that and how are you thinking about the potential impact to your business? Thanks.
Martin King: No. We don't have any new news on that. I mean obviously we're happy to be lapping the big implementation of excise and that helps us as far as our comps moving forward, but we don't really have any other additional news in Saudi.
Vivien Azer: Fair enough. My last question please. Have you had any new engagement with the FDA on your IQOS application? Thanks.
Martin King: We're in the same place we were at Investor Day, which is we are hopeful that we would hear something on the PMTA by the end of this year. But it's really in the hands of the FDA and we don't have anything more to add, I think we covered it pretty well at Investor Day and there is really nothing new on that front either.
Vivien Azer: Excellent! Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Just looking at the heated tobacco and the revenues you report for that by segment along with the HeatSticks volumes. I know you don't give the number of devices, which is a part of that. But just crudely calculating the revenue per stick, it looks like Russia or Eastern Europe has gone up considerably from last year and Middle East Africa duty free and East Asia are down a bit. Can you just help us understand is device mix a big part of that have you had any lower pricing that is driven it? Have you seen the discount on the IQOS device in Japan that you made sort of basically permanent be a driver of that? How do we think about just some of the portfolio mix within the IQOS platform?
Martin King: Well, yes. I mean Russia is doing very well and continues to grow very nicely at a stepped up pace from what it was some time ago. Duty free is continuing to show good growth this year. I think you see the stories for Japan and for Korea in the graphs that we showed during the presentation, the volume is stable to slightly up in Japan if you strip out the effects of the pricing. In Korea it's stable. The number of devices sold is pretty much in line, it's lower than it was before partly with regard to Japan of course it was that we had sold it to our distributor there and we've now been working on for those inventories as opposed to seeing new additional shipments which would impact revenue. They've been reduced to bring that inventory back into line just as we communicated we would do and going forward you're going to see the 3 and 3 Multi coming in. Bur as it's a new product and we're ramping up production, the year-over-year comparison on devices will be negative for Japan compared to Q4 last year. But other than that I think you really get the effects of the growth that was offset by the inventory changes that we communicated for Japan.
Michael Lavery: Well, and so I realized you have all the data yourself. So you may not have it back of the envelope, the way like this you would even look at it. But for example in Eastern Europe the price per stick, the total IQOS revenues per HeatStick were up over 25% would that suggest a greater skew to devices and if so is that a potentially good leading indicator of increasing adoption with the stick sales to follow?
Martin King: I'm not sure I follow that. Obviously, when we sold devices it's flattering the revenue and until you have a consumer with the device, you don't get the stick sale, so there is a lag. So, as you are opening a new market you might see the revenues from the devices be a heavier proportion until you've converted smokers to it and then they start to purchase and repurchase the HeatSticks. So there is often a period of time where, when we look at a metric like HeatSticks per device sold in a newer market that would be relatively low and then it would steam as you convert more users. So, some of these metrics can be affected by either very rapid growth like what's happening in Russia where we are converting a lot of people and selling devices. But then the HeatSticks lag there. So it depends on where the market is as far as whether it's stable from the point of view or whether it's adding users at a very fast pace versus a more mature state where it's adding users but maybe not as quickly that might have something to do with some of your back of the envelope calculations but I am not sure I can really help you with that.
Michael Lavery: No, it's very helpful. That's exactly the way it looks, so that's great color, just one more on HeatSticks and pricing. Can you just give us some of your thinking as the business now is getting to be two or more years old in many markets as you are taking regular price increases on cigarettes? Are you applying those to HeatSticks as well, I know typically you have some modest discounts where others have small price grant relative to say Marlboro for example. But when you are taking cigarette price increases do HeatSticks tend to benefit from that as well?
Martin King: Well, the best example is what we are doing in Japan right now. So, we increased the price on Marlboro HeatSticks from ¥470 to ¥500 whereas we increased – from ¥460 to ¥500 on the Marlboro heated tobacco units whereas the Marlboro cigarettes went from ¥470 to ¥510. So the increase was actually the same but we kept a small differential in the price. So, I think it's going to depend on each market. Obviously we want our heated tobacco units to be premium products and we don't want to have too big a gap, the other piece that influence it is how big is the tax benefit in each country and making sure at least pass some of that tax benefit toward the consumers. So in general, I think over the long haul you will see the pricing from heated tobacco units come but it will depend on the situation in the market with regard to taxes and with regard to where we are as far as establishing the category and establishing the brand. Japan is the most mature of all and you see the pricing that occurred there recently which kept gaps but moved with cigarettes.
Michael Lavery: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on your total operating margin. It expanded nicely despite higher spending and was probably driven by your lower IQOS device sales in the quarter. So, I am wondering as you ramp your new device sales in Q4 how much of a negative impact will this have on your margins? And then actually maybe going back to an earlier question on your guidance can you just explain why your EPS growth in Q4 won't be higher? And then as we think about next year and you continue to build or ramp your new device sales. Just trying to get a sense of the impact this might have going forward on your margin?
Martin King: Yes, so I think you are right to look at device sales is having an impact on the margin and we actually called it out in previous quarters when we were shipping ahead of demand and had higher device sales as a percentage of net revenues for RRP. I mean we've given the sort of rule of thumb it's around 25%, but like in the first quarter it was quite high. It was like 36% and that dragged our margins a lot. Now you are seeing in Q3 it was lower, because we were drawing down inventories above 14%. So you see the benefit now swinging the other way when you compare. So, over time I think it works out to be around 25% of RRP's. But it's going to be variable depending on the timing of either inventory adjustments or of course launching additional devices. Now 3 and 3 Multi coming in, now in the fourth quarter, we're obviously ramping up supply as well. So, it's not as though we can ship as many as we would like. We have to live within what can be manufactured. So, I don't know that you will see such a huge surge of it because of the fact that you have to get it distributed. You have to get it in consumers' hands. You have to explain it. Plus you have to be able to manufacture it. So, going forward I think the 25% waiting it probably the best estimate, but it's going to vary.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on the same line what do you think about next year and we should expect these the new device sales to continue to sort of build especially in Q1 and probably Q2 and then depending on the demand throughout the year. So, maybe it's not so front end loaded, I'm just trying to get a sense of the phasing also as we look forward into 2019.
Martin King: Yes, I am not sure I can help you with much more than what I have just said. Keep in mind though we will also continue to sell the 2.4 plus device in the market and we will use both as important ways to both reach more price sensitive consumers or newer consumers will may not be willing to invest as much in the device with 2.4 plus, but use the 3 and 3 multi as a more premium offering and giving consumers that consecutive experience option with the 3 Multi that's very important. I think it will help us a lot in Japan and Korea especially, but also in other markets. So they both have a role to play going forward and part of us is going to depend on how fast we convert consumers because obviously as we ramp up our efforts and continue to get better at reaching consumers and converting consumers you need the devices to go with that.
Bonnie Herzog: And that is actually is a little bit of on the lines of my next question which was on the spending behind IQOS. You mentioned I think that Q4 spending might be a little bit higher again as you rollout these new devices. But just wanted to confirm that your total spending for the year in terms of incremental spend will still be around that $600 million range. And then just want to get a sense as we look forward, how should we think about any increased levels of spending you might need to do again you timed increase conversion will it be the same level next year or do you need to ramp that further?
Martin King: The $600 million that we communicated early in the year is intact. We're on track for that. I was referring to the phasing of it where it's a bit heavier in the fourth quarter to support the 3 and 3 Multi launch but also some other initiatives. So it's more waiting within the quarters that I was referring to. The total incremental spend net of CC the allocations is intact at about $600 million. As far as next year, I'll just reiterate what we said before which is that we expect that a chunk of that investment that we've made this year will support higher volumes going forward in next year. In other words it won't need to be scaled with higher volumes and spread, whereas there will be another portion which we will need to continue to increase as we reach more consumers and as we move forward in additional geography. So it will be a mix. We are also as we communicated at Investor Day working hard at reallocating our spending and getting spending efficiencies out of our current business as part of our transformation that will be through various efforts including the normal operations activities around productivity and as SKU rationalization supply chain. But also a new initiative around obese measuring methodology to work hard on scrubbing our spending and making sure we are putting it to the great best use. Some of which would be invested in improving revenue growth and helping to fund these investments that we need to make and some of which helps us with our step in our growth targets where we are growing from at least 5% compound annual growth rate on revenue stepping up to be at least 8% compound annual growth rate ex-currency both of them for the earnings per share.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful and then maybe just one final question from me if I may. Just in terms of IQOS and the progression in different markets. You talked about the success you are having and maybe you could highlight again one of two markets that you are really excited about in terms of what you are seeing and where couple of more markets could really take off and then on the flipside of what are there any markets right now that are possibly presenting challenges or maybe similar in terms of complexity to what you're experienced in Japan where you are at now in that market or possibly that get you passed. That would help. Just a couple markets you are super excited and then maybe a couple that you are little bit concerned about. Thanks.
Martin King: Well, first of all we have broad geographic success with this product. It's doing well all across the EU, it's doing well across many many many markets. So, it's hard to pick up just one or two to say or particularly interesting Russia is the one that we've tried and we've seen very positive momentum there. We've implemented a lot of tools and approaches that we intend to spread the other markets later in Russia. As something of our pilot or testing ground and we've seen excellent success and excellent execution by the team in Russia around all sort of tools that would regard a digital and other approaches that we will continue to roll out in other markets as well. I mean I think the big challenge as we've talked about quite extensively being overcoming in Korea this issue around misunderstanding caused by the statement that were made and trying to reach consumers and make sure they get the accurate message about what this product does to you. And then of course in Japan where we have very good initiatives coming now very soon in the fourth quarter not just the 3 and 3 Multi launch but also the HEETS launch at the mainstream prince of ¥470 and that will help us in the more price sensitive areas as well we'll start with it and of course the messaging the approach to the consumer base improving our execution across the whole line we've been working very very hard on that across all the markets. That are actually focusing on Japan and Korea and we hope to see the benefits from these initiatives really start to show up essentially in 2019.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, just had a couple of questions for you. I want to ask within the combustible business, if you could speak to like the mix performance. Just thinking about the context of having some conversions of discount brands around the world to global brand and just comp mix overall is performing to the mix of country and product mix in that question. Just curious if you can comment on it?
Martin King: Yes, we have been working at consolidating brands into the global brands for efficiency regions. Because you can support essentially a campaign and an approach walk in the field [indiscernible] for only a restricted number or smaller number of global brands. So moving some of the local brands, a great example is what we did in Russia moving some brands in the Philip Morris and being able to support it better and you see Philip Morris growing in Russia. That's for efficiency reasons, but also for consumer reasons, it gives consumers a move established brand to migrate toward. I mean obviously there are some challenges around mix in certain countries, I mentioned Indonesia earlier where you have certain price point we are moving through and you have some down trading that occurs over time that can flow the other way depends on which brands are going through which price point. But we are focused on getting more efficient and working on consolidating our brands around the world.
Chris Growe: Just to reiterate is that moving to some of those global brands from more local brands is that a sector mix is that a positive or a negative?
Martin King: Well, so far as you can over time establish a stronger brand and then have it move up a bit in pricing it can be more helpful. A lot of the smaller local brands tend to be at lower price points, so over time you can establish a Chesterfield or a Philip Morris in the market, you can move it up off the bottom of the pricing and get it delivering a bit more benefit from the mix perspective.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you. And then I'm curious if you can say how many market do you expect for IQOS to be in for the year? Is that kind of continuing to increase overall into 43 before 42, 43 before?
Martin King: Right now we have lots of room to grow within the markets where we are already launched. In almost all the markets except for a handful, we still are not completely national we're focused more on bigger cities and on areas that are good place to start, where we have opportunities to spread geographically. A good example of that is Russia, where we've seen tremendous success in the cities where we've launched. But it's only representing 20% of the volume. So nationwide we're a little over 1% market share, 1.1% but obviously in the focused areas where we launched we're much higher than that. So, we have plenty of room to grow in a lot of the markets where we've already launched. Now we do periodically add additional markets as it makes sense. Sometimes that's because of the tax or the regulatory environment has finally gotten to where it supports this product and we want to lock it in and go ahead and launch and get things going there that's some cases. In other cases there are just markets we want to get going with because we think they show great promise. Now over the three year period a longer period we would obviously have more markets in that. I'm talking about more of the shorter term period. So you'll see the markets probably creep up a bit in the next six to 12 months, but I don't think we'll be adding a large number of markets in that time period and as you go further out of course we would like to get to some of the other big market that we haven't addressed yet.
Chris Growe: I had just one quick follow-up which is on the Investor Day you showed a chart of an increase in shipments – increase in the sales of devices in July and August in Japan. That was a big of resurgence there of device sales. Is that, and we saw a little bit of an increase at least sequentially from the day you gave at the Investor Day in Japan in HeatStick market share. Should we expect those devices to contribute to HeatStick volume in Japan? Do we see some of that already in if you will in September for the quarter and is that starting to increase a bit as you sell more devices there?
Martin King: Well, obviously we're focused on converting smokers into the category. In Japan the category is still growing, we've added the whole heat-not-burn categories added well over a million new consumers over the course of the year and we're the biggest player in that. We're getting very good proportion of that. So you need devices to continue to do that. We are selling devices to consumers as we convert them and a nice click in Japan. You also will have replacement devices particularly in market like Japan it's already been out there for a couple of year. You have consumers that want to replace their device, they want a second device. When it comes to 3 and 3 Multi, we could very well see consumers buy this as an additional device not just for new consumers, we would expect quite a few of the existing consumers to be interested in the Multi for example. So, yes we see good trend on device sales since we communicated I think in May sort of the lower point. We've seen some nice recovery since then, although some of that is holders as well, because we've been selling holders as well as the complete device. And so, I think we see a pretty good base in trend for optimism in Japan as far as the volume and share is stable, it's not showing a big uptick. But we do expect these programs in the fourth quarter to start having the intended effect and our growth to be more occurring in 2019, we're very optimistic about what's coming in Japan.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you very much for your time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on Japan and was hoping you can elaborate on the competitive dynamics there in heat-not-burn given some recent competitor product introductions over the last several months and competitors distribution expansion efforts over the last quarter?
Martin King: Yes. It's nothing really new. We've been talking about the competitors that have expanded their distribution and they've obviously benefitted from that. There were some supply constraints especially on the part of Japan tobacco earlier in the year. So they have been gradually able to expand over the course of the year. We've shown before the places where the competitors have been the longest in other words where the churn has had sometimes settled a bit, and you see there are share in places like Tokyo and Sendai and Fukuoka has been encouraging and that trend is not any different it continues. So, it's really not new news on that front. We do see that consumers' conversion rates to our product are very good and better than the competition and we do see that the product appreciation is higher. We have had the issue of reliability on our devices which is much improved now. We showed at Investor Day, the more recent production batches of the 2.4 plus have been increasingly more reliable and robust and much lower return rates. That continues. And we believe that 3 and 3 Multi are very well executed devices and will be able to help us in the competition with consumers and so we're really encouraged. And in fact from the point of view of competition, it's actually good for the category for competitors to come with better products and have overall category grow faster. So, we think we are in pretty good spot. We have a great innovation machine that we showed at Investor Day to keep us ahead of the competition and that's where we intend to stay. But we are not complacent about it, we're working hard on it.
Pamela Kaufman: Thanks. And just a question about the upcoming FDA PMTA meeting next week, what are your expectations for that meeting and do you think that there might be any clarity on IQOS coming out of it?
Martin King: Look, I don't have any new information with regards to the FDA from what we communicated at Investor Day. We're hopeful to hear from the FDA that it's really in their hands and I don't know that we're anticipating any particular meeting that's going to be the big breakthrough. So, there is really nothing new from what we communicated there.
Pamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you very much for allowing the follow up question. One of the things that struck me in your presentation was the pricing variance in combustibles in the EU of 8%. I was just wondering if you could say where that came from in terms of geography is that from Germany mainly and in particular what's happening to France because that had negative variance is what I believe anyway depending on the [indiscernible].
Martin King: Yes. Germany is the biggest driver in EU pricing and there is no new news on France. We still have the situation there of expected higher prices going forward as the government has communicated and the pricing efficiency is not very good there because of the structure of the tax. So, the overall pricing headwind that we had in France is still more of less what it was before.
Adam Spielman: And if you had to mention after Germany, the next two biggest contributors?
Martin King: Next two after Germany, well worldwide it would be like Philippines and some of the other ones. Within EU Germany is the biggest one. But we have pricing across the EU. I mean in Poland, in Italy there is pricing across the EU it's really hard to flag any one market that's driving it other than Germany being the biggest one.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that was our final question. I'll turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin King: Yes. I just wanted to close with a couple of the key messages that we ended with Investor Day. It starts with our commitment to the success for transformation to the smoke-free future when it gets good for smoker in particular but also very good for shareholders. I think you've seen that the efforts are starting in bear fruit in the volume numbers, the share numbers for this quarter gives us good momentum moving forward. It's built on that strong combustible tobacco business which depends on the foundation in a wake for us to form the transformation and get to a better place for shareholders. Very promising growth in RRP's across the geographies you heard about. We've got the innovation machine behind all this to try to stay ahead of it and all of it supports the achievable three year currency neutral compound annual growth targets that we communicated at Investor Day around at least 5% for next revenues ex-currency and at least 8% for the adjusted diluted EPS. So, I think our business is in good shape. We're showing good momentum and we're looking forward to reporting the results going forward. Thanks very much everybody for being on the call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-19 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Nick Rolli - Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications Martin King - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus Adam Spielman - Citi Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray Jon Leinster - Berenberg Owen Bennett - Jefferies Pamela Kaufman - Morgan Stanley
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. And I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release or review the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?
Martin King: Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I will open with some brief remarks on how we currently see our business halfway through at the year. For our combustible tobacco portfolio, the fundamentals are robust, reflecting a strong pricing environment and improving volume trends. This is a very positive sign given the majority of our profits and cash flow continues to be generated by combustible tobacco products. With regard to IQOS, we are tracking below our very high initial expectations for this year, primarily due to the current project trajectory in Japan. However, the year-on-year performance across geographies remains very strong and we continue to view RRPs as our largest growth opportunity going forward. As Andre explained during the Annual Shareholders Meeting in May, RRPs will experience periods of acceleration and periods of slower growth as they expand. The related timing is very hard to predict precisely, especially at this initial stage. This is the case with virtually every new product category and IQOS will invariably go through these phases. What is certain in our view is that adult smokers worldwide are looking for better alternatives for smoking. We believe that the IQOS is the best alternative on the market today as evidenced by the fact that 5.6 million adult consumers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. Let me now take you through our second quarter results, beginning with total shipment volume, i. e., cigarettes and heated tobacco units combined, which increased by 0.9% or by 0.6%, excluding inventory movement. This growth was driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume across IQOS launch markets, led by Japan and Korea, partly offset by 1.5% decline in cigarette volume, which includes the growing impact of adult smokers out-switching to our heated tobacco products. Importantly, heated tobacco unit volume growth in the quarter was relatively balanced with about half coming from outside the East Asia and Australia region. This illustrates the broad-based progress of IQOS across geographies. For the first half of the year, total shipment volume declined by 0.6% and was essentially flat excluding inventory movement. Our cigarette volume decline in the quarter was due notably to Russia, mainly reflecting the impact of price increases and higher illicit trade in Saudi Arabia, primarily due to the impact of tax driven price increases, following the June 2017 excise tax introduction. The decline was partly offset by growth in a number of markets, most notably Pakistan and Turkey, primarily reflecting higher industry volumes. We also recorded cigarette volume growth in important geographies, such as Indonesia, North Africa and the Philippines. On a sequential basis, our cigarette volume performance in the quarter marked a significant improvement compared with the 5.3% decline of the first quarter. Turning to our second quarter financial results net revenues increased by 8.3% excluding currency, driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio and higher volume of IQOS devices and heated tobacco units. Our pricing variance for combustible products in the quarter was more than 8% of second quarter 2017 combustible product net revenues, driven by Argentina, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. Year-to-date June, our combustible pricing variance was 7.5%. Adjusted operating income increased by 9.8% excluding currency, reflecting the growth in net revenues coupled with lower manufacturing costs in the East Asia and Australia region, partly offset by an incremental RP investment in all IQOS launch markets. Adjusted operating income -- margin increased by 0.5 point, excluding currency. Currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS increased by 20.2% in the quarter and benefited from a lower estimated full year effective tax rate, as well as lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 22%, reflects the impact of a revised full year effective tax rate estimate of approximately 24%. The reduction compared to our prior full year estimate of approximately 26% is mainly attributed to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the scope and impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States. Our lower interest expense in the quarter primarily reflects the impact of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This included the decision to use existing cash to repay the principal of our recently matured May 2018 10-year U.S. bonds, which had a coupon of 5.65%. Our total international market share excluding China and the U.S. increased 0.8 points in the quarter to 28.4%. The growth was driven by our heated tobacco brands, which reached 1.6%, up by 0.9 points. To put this performance into perspective, our heated tobacco brand now enjoy an international market share equivalent to that as Philip Morris, our fourth largest international cigarette brand after just over two years since the initial IQOS commercial expansion in Japan. Despite the increasing impact of adult smoker out-switching to our heated tobacco products, share for our cigarette brands was stable at 26.9%. I will now cover our performance in select geographies, beginning with an update for two markets; Russia and Saudi Arabia that reflect previously as potential watch out. In Russia, we recorded a strong pricing variance in the quarter, mainly driven by the annualization pricing announced in the second half of 2017, and further supported by price increases earlier this year. This built on our favorable pricing brands in the first quarter and is a welcome change from 2017 during which we recorded essentially no net pricing in the market. Pricing in Russia was the main driver of the Eastern Europe region's 14.7% possible pricing variance for the year to date June period. We continue to closely monitor the pricing environment in the market, particularly in the context of the excise tax increase that came into effect at the start of this month. Encouragingly, since June, the industry has been progressively announcing price increases in line with the tax increase pass on of 5 Rubles per pack. It is important to note, however, that there continue to be differences in timing between when price increases are announced and when they actually reached the consumer at retail. Separately, I would like to highlight the favorable IQOS momentum in Russia, with HEETS to off-take share in Moscow of 4.4% in the quarter, up by 1.7 points sequentially versus the first quarter. This growth was supported by the successful rollout of our new digital initiatives. In Saudi Arabia, cigarette industry volume and PM in-market sales volume remained under pressure in the quarter, declining by about 24% and 40% respectively. However, the declines in both cases improved on a sequential basis as the excise tax driven price increases from June 2017 were finally lapped during the quarter. We expect continued improvement in the sequential trends for both industry volume and our in-market sales over the balance of the year. Importantly, we will enter 2019 with this major drag on our profitability behind us. These positive developments are being reinforced by strong cigarette portfolio performances in a number of key markets, such as Germany, Indonesia, The Philippines and Turkey, as highlighted on this slide. Turning now to IQOS in Japan. We recorded HeatSticks’ market share of 15.5% in the quarter, an increase of 5.5 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. While share for HeatSticks declined by 0.3 points compared to the first quarter of 2018, let me remind you that our first quarter share was favorably impacted by a low total market in January, reflecting a cigarette inventory reduction by our main competitor. In fact, in-market sales of HeatSticks in the second quarter increased by over 5% versus the first quarter to 6.6 billion units. We remain focused on reaccelerating HeatSticks’ share growth, particularly as competitors expand the availability of the heated tobacco products. In this regard, we are rolling out a range of initiatives this year, which do not require incremental marketing expenditures to drive further switching to IQOS, including the introduction of the next generation of IQOS devices, which will offer significant improvements that address key consumer needs, including consecutive use; the planned launch of a stronger tasting HeatSticks’ variant in order to facilitate full flavor adult smokers switching, as well as a main stream price product for more price sensitive consumer; the simplification of the registration process for new users, which was a significant barrier to entry, particularly for older smokers; the intensification of our loyalty program and deployment of more targeted and relevant communications for our existing and perspective IQOS users; and the already address device reliability issues in the current generation of IQOS, they have caused frustration among certain consumers. We conservatively assume today that these initiatives will have a limited favorable impact this year with the full favorable effect coming as of the beginning of 2019. We continue to observe strong consumer interest in heated tobacco category. As of June 2018, we estimated 34.7% of adult tobacco users in Japan that use the heated tobacco product in the preceding seven days, an increase of over 2 points since March. This equates to around 150,000 additional users per month over the period. It is important to highlight that this general growth dynamic has not changed as a result of the presence of competitive products. However, there are different patterns of full adoption depending on product with IQOS having the highest exclusive use and per device heated tobacco unit consumption. Other products appear to dilute the correlation between the number of users and the category share. Thus, the heated tobacco categories’ consumption share of total tobacco volume, which reached around 21% in June, is lagging behind general heated tobacco user share, as the latter reflects an expression of interest in heated tobacco products and the potential for further conversion going forward, this offers well for both the category and IQOS. We have previously highlighted the roll that competitive churn associated with the introduction of the new heated tobacco products to the market is having in Japan. In general, competitive products have the greatest impact following the initial launch, but critically overtime as consumers recognized the benefits of IQOS. Given the geographic expansion of the competitive products in recent periods and the related impact that this has on the national share for HeatSticks, it is helpful to look at specific geographies within Japan to help gauge better the impact of competitive introductions and the related churn on IQOS’s performance overtime. This slide shows heated tobacco unit off-take share trends in Fukuoka, Sendai and Tokyo, three geographies where multiple heated tobacco products have been available the longest. As all three geographies illustrate, the longer the competitive products are in the market, the better IQOS performs. Importantly, IQOS remains the heated tobacco proposition with the highest full conversion rate, which drives recurring HeatSticks purchase and therefore revenue. In Korea, HEETS market share reached 8% in the second quarter, an increase of 7.8 points versus the prior year period and 0.7 points sequentially. Over the past few months there regrettably has been confusion among the adult consumers with regard to heated tobacco category. This sense primarily from government discussions on graphic health warnings for heated tobacco products, as well as the Korean FDA mischaracterization of the tar generated by such products, which we have vigorously refuted through compelling scientific evidence publicly and by directly informing our IQOS users. Unfortunately, the KFDA has risked confusing millions of people into thinking that heated tobacco products are as harmful as cigarette, contradicting its own scientific findings. In spite of this, our existing user base is staying with IQOS, demonstrating consumer confidence in the product and its benefits based on personal experience. We have comprehensive plans in place to ensure that the confusion dissipates, so that the many adult smokers who are understandably hesitant at this time will resume switching from cigarette to the heated tobacco category. In the EU region, IQOS continued its steady growth. HEETS reached the regional share of 1% in the quarter, up by 0.8 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. This growth was supported by strong performances across IQOS launch markets, most notably Greece and Italy, where HEETS shares have increased by 3.1 points to 4.1% and by 1.3 points to 1.9% respectively. As the marketing focus behind IQOS continues to be limited to select geographies within EU launch markets, the regional share, not to mention the national share for any specific market, clearly understates the success of IQOS. It is also important to monitor the number of IQOS users, which serves as a leading indicator of heated tobacco unit consumption. Over the past 12 months, the estimated figure in the EU region has increased by more than fourfold to approximately 1.2 million. Importantly, we have maintained the overall level of quality of the IQOS user base as demonstrated by full and predominant conversion rates, while growing the number of users substantially. We have also been able to increase the user registration rate, which now stands at over 80%. User registration is very important as it enables us to follow and better service new IQOS users during their initial conversion journey, while also increasing the loyalty and retention of existing IQOS users. Turning to our full year 2018 outlook. We continue to anticipate a total industry volume decline of 2% to 3%, excluding China and the U.S. Against this backdrop, we also continue to expect decline in our total shipment volume of approximately 2%. However, we now anticipate a change in the composition of our shipment volume, reflecting higher cigarette volume and lower heated tobacco unit volume compared to our prior forecast. We expect a significant increase in our global heated tobacco in-market sales volume to around 44 billion to 45 billion units, including revised more conservative assumptions regarding the impact of our product and marketing initiatives in Japan to support IQOS. We now target heated tobacco unit shipments of around 41 billion to 42 billion units. This excludes an anticipated full year net inventory -- this includes an anticipated full year net inventory reduction of approximately 3 billion units, reflecting an estimated 4 billion unit reduction in Japan and 1 billion unit increase in other markets. We expect the reduction in Japan to be concentrated in the third quarter. The revised shipment target represents a total net inventory adjustment swing of 5 billion units compared to our previous communication during our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. And we had assumed a full year net inventory increase of 2 billion units. Our heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume target for this year reflects growth in the second half of approximately 60% compared to the same period in 2017 and almost 20% compared to the first six months of 2018. We now expect net revenue growth this year of 3% to 4% excluding currency. The revision compared to our previously disclosed estimates of approximately 8% is primarily due to lower than anticipated shipments of IQOS devices and heated tobacco units, predominantly in Japan and the impact of accounting for affiliate in Argentina as highly inflationary effective July 2018, partly offset by the better than expected performance of our combustible tobacco portfolio. Let me provide some additional granularity behind the revision, beginning with the devices, which accounts for approximately 2.5 points and mainly reflect the following; the worldwide introduction of the next generation of IQOS devices towards the end of 2018, which I touched on earlier; this requires an adjustment to current generation device inventories, while the ramp-up of new devices is expected to occur in 2019; the fact that we are reaching out to more conservative adult smokers in Japan who need more time in different communications to switch to heated tobacco, as well as the assumption of continued competitive churn as consumers experiment with other heated tobacco products; thus, impacting the rate of adult smoker acquisition; improved device reliability and longer life cycle, leading to fewer IQOS replacement purchases; higher sales of second IQOS holders versus relatively higher price full-kit purchases; and the alignment of the retail selling price for all IQOS kits in Japan to the previously discounted price of approximately ¥8,000 independent of device registration. Given the current unit margin structure of IQOS devices, the impact of lower device sales is felt predominantly on the net revenue line with a slightly positive corresponding impact on operating income. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume accounts for further 2 points of the revision; mainly reflecting the anticipated full year inventory reduction mentioned previously and the slower growth of in-market sales in Japan. Our revised net revenue forecast is based on the conservative view of a very limited favorable impact from our initiatives in Japan in 2018. The upward revision for our combustible tobacco primarily reflects better than expected cigarette performance across a range of geographies, notably Germany, The Philippines and Turkey. We continue to anticipate a full year combustible price variance of approximately 7% of our 2017 combustible product net revenues. Given our year-to-date June 2018 currency-neutral net revenue growth of 8.3%, our full-year target of 3% to 4% implies a slight decline for the second half of the year on the same basis. This is primarily due to the challenging comparison that we face in the second half of the year related to the sizable shipment of HeatSticks that we made in 2017 as part of our planned inventory build in Japan. As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we recorded currency neutral net revenue growth around 9% and 19% respectively. While the inventory build of approximately 13 billion heated tobacco units was appropriate at the time given that then forecasted demand, our or heavy reliance on a single production center and the shift from air to heat rate, it is now resulting in lower heated tobacco unit shipments and related net revenues, especially as we adjust existing inventory levels, mainly in the third quarter. Consequently, we forecast net revenue growth of around 1% excluding currency in the third quarter and a decline of around 4% on the same basis in the fourth quarter. As announced this morning, we’re revising our 2018 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to a range of $5.02 to $5.12. The change primarily reflect lower anticipated heated tobacco unit shipments in Japan and the unfavorable impact of currency, partly offset by a lower estimated full year effective tax rate of approximately 24%. We continue to target net incremental investment behind RRPs of approximately $600 million for the full year. Our guidance now includes $0.07 of unfavorable currency of prevailing exchange rates excluding currency our guidance represents up to growth rate of approximately 8% to 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. The unfavorable $0.13 change in the currency impact on our guidance as compared to our previous guidance on May 9th is due notably to the Argentine peso and Japanese yen. For the year, we are now targeting operating cash flow of approximately $9 billion, subject to currency movements and year-end working capital requirements. We also now anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion that we communicated in May. The change primarily reflects lower planned spending on heated tobacco unit manufacturing equipment, driven by increased production efficiency and greater flexibility associated with dual production of our existing factories, as well as an adjustment for the revised production forecast. In June, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualize rate of $4.56 per share. This mark the 11th consecutive year in which PMI has increased its dividend, representing a total increase of 147.8% or a compounded annual growth rate of 9.5% since PMI became a publicly traded company in 2008. The timing and magnitude of the increase reflects the Board’s confidence in the growth outlook for our business, underpinned by the potential of our smoke free products, and underscores the Company’s steadfast commitment to generously reward shareholders overtime. In conclusion, the fundamental supporting our combustible tobacco portfolio are robust, namely strong pricing and a modern cigarette industry volume decline. While we are tracking below are very high initial expectations for IQOS this year, primarily reflecting the current growth trajectory in Japan, the year-on-year performance across geographies remains very strong, and we are confident that RRPs constitute our largest growth opportunity. We are implementing the right marketing and product measure to reinvigorate growth in Japan. These initiatives, which require the rightsizing this year of our existing IQOS devices and HeatSticks’ inventories will position PMI well for a strong overall performance in 2019. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So I appreciate all the color and your efforts to be transparent around guide down. I’m just curious if you could just offer some thoughts on why you didn’t update your guidance at the AGM formally?
Martin King: We’ve been assessing the whole situation. We have been putting the programs in place in Japan. And we gave you quite a bit of detail at the AGM on the dynamics of the consumers, and some of the uncertainties involved. And we gave some better color on the forecast for shipments. We decided not to give a new net revenue number, because at that point in time, we were still recalculating and figuring the effects of all these pieces. But the key is we're really confident going forward in these projections. We have time now to understand the consumer situation Japan, and to put together a really good plan there. And we have a great deal of confidence going forward that we will hit these numbers, including the shipment and IMS for the heated tobacco units.
Vivien Azer: Sticking with Japan then please with the more affordable variant. Can you talk about how that will benchmark from a revenue accretion standpoint relative to some of the metrics that you guys had offered at your shareholder meeting in 2016?
Martin King: I think the key point with regard to the heated tobacco unit, whether it’s mainstream price or premium price in Japan, is these products have better margins than cigarettes do. And their price, and including the mainstream variant, will be priced such that it's adding quite a bit of profitability, even above what we would get from a similar tobacco product. Because Japan, for example, our portfolio on the conventional side, has always included Marlboro Lights, Lark and other brands so we've always had brands priced at difference points within Japan. And with heated tobacco units, you're going to follow a similar logic that you need more than one price point in order to reach a broader group of consumers. And we’re still going to be, on average, above the average price in Japan. And we're going to be adding profitability very strongly with our RFP portfolio in Japan and everywhere else.
Vivien Azer: One last one from me, on South Korea. Can you give us some color on how you're thinking about target market share for the full year, given the deceleration and the confusion in the marketplace?
Martin King: Well, I mean, it's unfortunate that there is confusion in Korea, because we've been growing tremendously well there. And we are still adding consumers in Korea. But unfortunately, with the confusion, we've had a pause in the rate of speed of converting people; we're sorting through it and getting them the right information, the consumers the right information, which factually we have a very good story to tell; and all the scientific backing, including coming from other government agencies. In fact, the KFDA itself, if you read their evidence, they understand that the composition of the aerosol is much better with our products. Unfortunately, that didn't come through in their final report. So there's some confusion, but we're clarifying it. And we think that Korea will continue to grow. It’s not as fast as what we had been on very good trajectory, but we'll get back to those fast speeds of growth in the future. And I think we're still going to see very good growth in the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: My first question is your revenue outlook. It’s much lower than previously. And you highlighted IQOS in Japan as one of the biggest drags on your top line. But I'm trying to understand your outlook for pricing or revenue for IQOS in all of your other markets. I guess, I assumed it would have bigger contribution as these markets ramp, especially given the tax benefits. And then also, do you expect you’ll need to introduce lower price points in some of the other markets sooner than you had previously planned, possibly as soon as next year to increase conversion. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of your thinking on all of this.
Martin King: Our intent is to keep the premium positioning for heat. It’s important as you’re establishing the new category that remain premium, you have to remember in Japan we have reached the market share, which is very, very substantial to this point where you get running out of premium smokers, if you will. And you need to expand once you hit very high market share. In other markets, we’re not there yet, we will get there eventually. So certainly, if we get well into the 15%, 16% market share, we’re going to have to deal with this issue in other places. But we’re still not there, we are growing very rapidly in the EU. In a number of markets, we’re doing extremely well. Italy, Greece, we called out already, but there are number of other markets that are growing. And when you look at the consumer uptake, it’s really taken off in the EU and we’re very pleased with the results there and looking forward to higher market shares. But it will be away before we get to the point where we would need to be thinking about introducing a second line up of SKUs. But overall, I mean the HeatSticks as you point out, are very profitable in EU. They enjoy some favorable tax positioning, and it makes it quite accretive in a number of markets.
Bonnie Herzog: And then the incremental spend behind IQOS of $600 million this year. Could you update us on the phasing of this spend -- and for the rest of the year and then more color possibly on some of the initiatives that are working? You touched on the digital initiative in Russia, which seem to be having very positive effect. And then I know it’s early. But how should we think about potential stepped up investments behind IQOS next year? Should we assume you’ll continue to ramp spending, so you can increase further conversion in the future?
Martin King: So we’re still on track for the 1,600 incremental. As far as the phasing, we’re about 50% already in the first quarter. So it’s pretty on track, and we’ll expect about the same for next second half. Obviously, we spent half we’ll have half to go. So that remains intact. We are seeing some very good impacts from some of our investments, digital, absolutely. I mean, Russia, you see the market share really talking in Moscow. Its due to a number of initiatives, digital is playing a role. We’re getting better at finding leads and being more efficient in how we decide to approach those smokers. And it’s paying off inefficiency that we hope. We will see rolling across other markets towards the latter part of this year and into next year. And it really gives us much more leverage with our coaches, for example, where they can work on leads that are already verified and already delivered from the digital process. It's also helped us follow during conversion and a number of other benefits. So the spending that we’re making in digital is paying off. Our retail footprint is improving. We’re getting more consistent higher quality, getting more effectiveness of our retail spend. So there are number of variance where the spending is really starting to pay off, and will pay off even more in next year. As far as next year, when we look at that 600 million, about half of it, say 300 million, will be in the base but will not grow any further. They work through specific initiatives that are being built that can handle much higher scale. So we will not need to grow or have more spending behind it in order to provide the benefits to a huge number of consumers and across all the markets. The other half will scale somewhat on how fast we rollout markets and how fast we have uptake in the consumer conversion piece. But it should not grow as quickly as the consumer pieces. So we’re looking at the profitability coming from the whole RRP investment to begin paying off much better next year and going forward, because if you realize it, the consumables are being sold at a net factory price around the world that’s about twice of our average CC. So we’re getting very good benefits as we grow the volume. And that allows us to amortize the costs of conversion and of these other essential initiatives over some very good profitability. And we’re seeing more and more and more markets now have passed the point where they’re accretive and they’re profitable; obviously, Japan and Korea were there; there are number of markets in the EU there; there obviously, Italy, duty-free. So we’re getting now much more benefits from all these investments and very helpful going forward.
Bonnie Herzog: And then maybe just one-time a quick one from me, I am just curious to hear how IQOS has been performing in markets where e-cigs are much more prevalent. And really what the interaction has been. And then what are your plans for introducing e-cig technology, either organically or possibly via an acquisition? Thanks.
Martin King: We don’t have as much exposure to e-cigs as other companies. Our biggest e-cig exposure or markets, is in the EU, UK would be obviously the one with the highest level. We have a lower market share in UK, so a lower base from which to deploy our commercialization and so forth. So it’s hard to really say where e-cigs versus IQOS. We know that IQOS is a better product from the point of view of converting consumers, especially adult smoker that has lower total usage that has higher conversion rates than e-cig. The taste is closer, the delivery of nicotine and the satisfaction of the smokers is much closer than cigarette. So we are confident that IQOS is a better option for adult smokers, and that we will be successful -- are successful when we go into markets with e-cig. One example would be like, Italy, where there are e-cigs in the market. Obviously, IQOS is doing extremely well there. And then I think from a point of view of looking at e-cig. We think the IP in the regulation around the tobacco product of heat-not-burn is a different categories, it’s difficult to replicate the IP that we have and the scientific substantiation. Whereas e-cig category tends to be much more of a commodity, the technology is pretty much weakened coil across the industry. There aren’t a lot of unique IP around it. And then the regulation as a tobacco product, while we think heat-not-burn should be regulated differently than cigarettes, we recognize there’ll still be regulation around tobacco products and so forth. So it makes it more difficult for competitors to come into this space if they don’t have the experience of the tobacco regulation. So overall, we do believe that e-cigs have a role to play. We have very good technology with our MESH that we’ve developed. And we will be putting out a newer version of that soon. And we think that our mesh approach has better consistency. It has the better IP protection. And we’ll deliver better over the long-term in the experience of consumer. So we will compete in e-cigs. We’ll be very successful there. But at the same time, we feel that the winning product right now is actually in heat-not-burn and that’s where we can achieve better profitability, better uniqueness and also better conversion of smokers. So we’re pleased to compete with e-cigarettes in any market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: First just in terms of your EPS guidance for the full year, so ex-currency, it's now 8% to 10%, which is slightly better than the last guidance. But your tax rates now come down by about 400 basis points since beginning of the year. So that should be adding means something like 6 points to EPS growth. So I guess I am just wondering what's causing the shortfall that FX neutral guidance is actually not going up more at this point.
Martin King: It's the things we made out before. Obviously, the tax is coming better. The business is being impacted by the heated tobacco unit shipments, but also now the currency, I mean the inventory, which is about a 5 billion swing from what we talked about at the annual meeting. The devices don't have much impact because of EPS and that we're getting some offset from the CC business. So the main impact is difference between where we were projecting Japan versus where we are today. We're still very confident in Japan and we're taking the actions necessary. And this step around inventories, for both devices and for heated tobacco units, is to clear the deck and prepare Japan for better growth going forward. So that the initiatives we put in there, the new heated tobacco unit offerings, as well as the very compelling new devices, have an opportunity to blossom and to do really well and drive our growth going forward. So we're setting the base for a better 2019, and to deliver the numbers.
Judy Hong: And just to clarify the Japan inventory impact. So when you think about third quarter. So if we assume a similar in market sales growth for IQOS in third-quarter. So if you get something like 6.5 billion units, you have an inventory reduction of 3 billion. So basically you could have an IQOS volume in the third quarter for Japan something like a three or 3.5 billion. That's the right way to model?
Martin King: I think that's about right. We're going to take the inventory adjustment of 3 billion to 4 billion in Japan, because remember the net is 3 billion. It includes a plus one by the end of the year coming from other areas. So in Japan, we're looking at about 4 billion inventory, it will come mostly in the third quarter. I think almost entirely in the third quarter. And we're you know making sure we have the right inventory of the Marlboro heated tobacco units to make room for the new line up of SKUs. And we have a really flexible manufacturing base now we're able to supply. So rather than end up with too much inventory of any one particular product, which is hard to predict how it's going to perform going forward, especially given the pricing that's coming in the market and the tax increase October 1. So to clear the decks and have a lower inventory so we can be more flexible is what we're doing.
Judy Hong: And then just lastly, in terms of your price guidance of the combustible, I'm assuming it does not include any potential benefit from Japan. So I just wanted to confirm that. And then just confirm if you've gotten any clarity around the application that you've submitted?
Martin King: I mean, our guidance is all in. We don't carve out any particular instances. We have put in the application on conventional product in Japan. The tax increase is ¥20 per pack. We applied for ¥50 total increase. On the combustible side, there are some technicalities around the calculation of the device -- on the RRP, the heated tobacco unit side. There are some technicalities on how the new tax based on the weight of tobacco or consumable product is calculated. So that's held off a bit the timing of the applications but obviously, the tax is going up October 1. So we’ll need to submit new price list as soon as we can for those products as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: I just have two questions for you. So I'm curious if you look at your new initiatives you have set for Japan in the second half and new devices, HeatSticks pricing and that kind of thing. Do you believe that that will increase the overall level of heated tobacco users in Japan? Is this what's going to hopefully draw in some of late adopters? And if I can add to that, you’ve mentioned that there is 35% of consumers that are using new tobacco about at 21% share. And I think you have a bit of an explanation and I couldn’t recall what the explanation is for the GAAP between those two figures there, if you can help with that too?
Martin King: So first of all, the number of consumers coming into the heat-not-burn category is growing. We estimate it’s around 150,000 per month. And the 34.7% number is anybody any smoker who has used a heat-not-burn product in the last seven days. So it doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re fully converted. It doesn’t even necessarily mean they yet bought a device, but they’ve tried the product. It could be also from a friend or somebody else. But it's an indication of interest and that I think is the starting point. Then you get to the question of, will consumers convert. And this is what our initiatives are around. And we find that IQOS is the best at converting consumers and we find that it's the best product in the category, so as long as the category has interest and people are coming into it. And look we’re selling over 500,000 kits and/or holders every month in Japan. So we are bringing people into the category. It's being hidden a bit by this churn and the fact that consumers are trying many different products. And so the number of sticks per device and consumption has come down a bit. So you don't see quite the volume and share growth that you would associate with that number of consumers. So we’re convinced it’s going to settle out that IQOS will win, it's the best product in the market and we will see higher rates of growth. Now that’s underpin by the three buckets of things we’re taking in Japan; we’re improving the basics, so the device quality issue and reliability; the loyalty programs for existing users to make sure they stick with IQOS since they appreciate the brand; the holders have programs to get people the ability to do some and use in short-term; we’ve simplified pricing registration and you’ve got the messaging to reach a broader consumer base; and reach, for example, we flag the 50 plus group, which is pretty large in Japan; we’re adapting our messaging to those to that group and focusing on smoke-free Japan; going to where they are and more suburban; there is a new campaign on the way; so that's all around messaging and consumer. And then the products are a key part of it; the new flavor SKU; the new lineup of consumables at the mainstream price; and then very importantly, the new generation devices, which is a nice improved device; and we are convinced, it’s going to do really well, even at a premium price to the existing devices, which is why we’re bringing the inventory of the previous devices down, so that the new devices have room to sell. So all these things, put together, I think will increase the rate of people coming into the category. Overtime, the churn will dissipate. It may a take a while. We still have the spread of competitive products. But you see what’s happening in the cities where we’ve already been in the longest, we start to tick backup. So it’s got a come, it’s just a matter of being more conservative in our estimates about when that will happen and making the room for these initiatives to take route and be successful through the inventory resizing. So that’s the story around Japan. We’re really confident in the future. We are absolutely sure that the basics are in place, the product is right and it’s going to resume growth. We’re just being more conservative about when we forecast that will happen and giving run through the initiatives to take place.
Chris Growe: And if I can just, one other quick one is just that -- and from a high level, I guess. When you saw in Japan and Korea the product reach up to 2.5 share. We started to see an exponential increase in market share for that, point forward. It got a real -- a lot of consumer adoption from that point, got to be well known in the market and that kind of thing. You’re not seeing that quite so much in Europe. Is that what we should expect the EU is just different than Japan? Or is it around the way you’re standing behind the product or anything you could add to that? Just to understand how the shares develop in the EU and when they could really take off from here?
Martin King: There are couple of markets that have accelerated notably in the last few periods. I mean, you call out Europe. Take Italy. Italy is starting to take some pretty big jumps in the share quarter-over-quarter. I mean we were at 1.5 share points in the first quarter, now we’re at 1.9. So maybe it’s not taking off quite as fast as Korea or Japan. But that’s a noticeable acceleration in share. Russia, Moscow being the leading city for Russia. I mean, to you jump from 2.7% to 4.4% in one quarter, that is a serious acceleration. Also, Greece is another example, and there some of other markets. I mean, I’m not going to go through the whole list. But we are starting to see faster growth across a variety of markets. And I think part of it is the efficiency of our initiatives and we’re learning how to do it better. Our spending is paying off better. But it’s also I think which you pointed out, which is word of mouth. At some point, it gets to a critical mass where people start seeing each other using it and they start reaffirming their choice and you start to see a difference in the growth rate. And we are seeing that. And obviously in differently geographies, it might be to different extremes, but it is significant growth and we’re very pleased with the progress across EU, Russia, a number of different geographies, as well as the great success that we’ve had in Japan and Korea. So it’s getting very broad base now. We’re very pleased with it and very confident in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: My first question is really focusing around the 600 million, how you’re spending and how that varies in the life of a slowdown in Japan and Korea. And I suppose what I’m really trying to ask is this. It sounds like, you are ramping your marketing investments in Japan in response to the slightly disappointing trajectory in Japan. But you’re keeping the 600 million stable. Does that mean to say that you’re not investing as much in Europe as you would have done? And that’s my first question.
Martin King: Well, in Japan, we’re actually spending this year what we plan to already at the beginning of the year. We have not increased the total spending in Japan above what we had already planned. And I’m sure within the 600 million that we’re spending across a variety of markets, including Japan, Korea, EU, a number of different geographies. But the plans, as far as how the markets are spending it, are pretty much on track and Japan is actually right on track with its spending. So it's a step up from last year and that's maybe what you're seeing when you look through our earnings release. But that was already planned and it's already in the 600 million number, we haven't increased either the 600 nor have we increased its allocations to Japan.
Adam Spielman: And then as I look at the rest of the world, so excluding Japan and Korea, we've talked about a lot. It seems to me that certainly compared with my expectations it's doing better in certain geographies. You've called out Greece, Italy, Russia than I would expect, but correspondingly less well in others. And I'm really talking Northwest Europe here. Is that, compared with your forecast let's say this time last year, is that how you would see it as well? Better in some place, worse in others, net-net in line with what you expected.
Martin King: Well, I think we expected it to do well across the geographies. It's done a little bit better in some, obviously, and in others we're hoping to accelerate the growth. And we're still confident it'll come. I am one where it would pay off tremendously if it grew, but is challenging, is Germany. We knew, because of the characteristics of the consumer and so forth, there was a little bit more of a show-me type market and would take more effort and more incremental growth to where we get to a point. We are growing in Germany. We're gaining consumers. We're making progress. It's going okay. But obviously, we would like to see it do better in Germany, partly because it would be extremely profitable, as well as the fact that it's a key market for us and we would like to grow it. But we're very confident it's going to happen. We are applying these new tools and the learnings and getting better every day and it is starting to move faster. But we're all always looking for more.
Adam Spielman: And very quickly, it's not my final question, the UK. I live in London, it seems to me you're making big efforts here. But I just wonder how it’s doing in London?
Martin King: I think we're making progress we have good efforts on the ground there. And it's a market that is very interesting, because it has a fairly large e-cigarette component and we have consumers there. And we also would like to see it do well in the UK from the point of view of English-speaking, and would spread the word better around the world with word-of-mouth. It's going fine, we're making progress. But that's a market that we're putting a lot of focus on and trying to accelerate the growth in.
Adam Spielman: Finally, just you've dropped some hints about pricing. One thing you said, I think you said is you're applying the new device to be at a premium to the existing IQOS device. I'm intrigued by that, particularly in line of the fact that the heavy discounting from the glo device and to some degree from plume. And also I think I heard you say that you're definitely planning to submit a new price list for IQOS in Japan in due course to deal with the tax rise on IQOS. Is that correct?
Martin King: So for the existing line up of devices in Japan, we said the price now as a simple one price as opposed to the situation before where you had discounting and you had most consumers having to go through the registration process to get the discount price. It also gave the impression the device being marked down. So we made it simple. We simplified the registration. We also didn't require the registration in order to get the same price, the ¥8000 price, which is where most consumers were getting to anyway but only after some pain and suffering. And that was also in anticipation of bringing the new line-up of devices. The plan all along was when the new devices arrive would be to have two price tier system for the existing line-up and then the new and improved line-up at a higher price. None like you would see for other electronics product line-up. So we just accelerated that, took away the pain and suffering of having to go through a long process to register and get the price, which you should have gotten anyway and put it there. So yes, when the new line-up comes, it will be an improved device. It will offer better functionality, performance, design, all the great things and consecutive use too, by the way. And so in general, it will be priced above the older device, which you would expect that that’s not surprising. As far as the consumables pricing, I was just referencing in October 1st, there is a tax increase in Japan for both RRP and conventional cigarette. So obviously, you need to have your price list in before any tax increase. We've already put our price listing for the combustible. And so we were delayed a bit by this technicality on the rest of our portfolio, and so that’s what I was referring to.
Adam Spielman: But the new retail price will be higher to take into account the tax increase on the consumables of IQOS?
Martin King: There is a tax increase and we’re going to file a price list that deals with that. I can't comment further on pricing.
Adam Spielman: And one thing I didn’t ask. You feel the ¥8,000 is right in the lights of the ¥3,000 for some glo devices?
Martin King: We’re still selling a nice amount of devices, and we do have a superior product we believe. So we want to have the premium positioning. So yes, I think this is about the right price.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: I just wanted to touch on Russia. It's your largest cigarette market where you’ve launched IQOS. And you’ve highlighted some of the momentum there. Can you just help me to reconcile a few of the data points you’ve given. You talk about the 4.4 share in Moscow, and that’s close to 10% of the population of that country. I think you’ve also got almost 1 billion sticks in that region, which is primarily Russia and Ukraine. I guess, I’m just trying to reconcile that with your appendix 1 where you show zero rounding, I suppose, to zero market share for Russia. If you took say half of the segment number divided by the market size, you’re still looking at around 0.7 or 0.8 share. Obviously, the 4.4 at around 10% in the country would be close to four tenths of a share. Why is there no share registering on the national basis and how should we think about tying all that together?
Martin King: I think this has to do just with the data source for the shares at Nielsen for Russia, I think. It may just be that -- I’m not sure, to be honest with you. It may just be that the way we pick up share in Russia is still not picking up in Moscow rather, it's still not picking up in there. But I honestly don’t have the answer for that…
Michael Lavery: Can you give us a sense of what the split is between Russia and Ukraine, or any other markets in that segment? Just how big the -- when you look at that shipment number, how much of that is coming from Russia?
Martin King: We really haven’t split it out by market. Obviously, Russia is probably the biggest component but it’s not split by that.
Michael Lavery: And now that you’ve got no issues with capacity, would you -- are you looking at a national expansion in Russia, or further expansion beyond? I know you called out Moscow typically. You’re also in St. Petersburg as well. What’s your thinking about reaching beyond those?
Martin King: We’re having terrific results in Russia. So logically, we would expand -- we will expand, yes. We will continue to expand in Russia. I’m not going to say when and so forth. But absolutely, with the results that we’re having and the programs working so well, it’s only logical that we will continue to expand in Russia.
Michael Lavery: Or any sense of timing maybe as a better way to put it?
Martin King: No, not at this time…
Michael Lavery: And then just one more on Japan, there is the smoking ban coming into place. It looks like that applies the heated tobacco as well. How does that influence your outlook for the market there, and just any thoughts on what you expect from that coming through?
Martin King: I don’t think we really have an impact from that on the market development, going forward. I mean, usually smoking bans aren’t a big impact on volume in the market. I think it’s disappointing if they don’t allow heated tobacco units, because I think it is materially different to combustible and it should allowed, it does not impact into our air quality, we have the studies to prove it. In fact we did a study in Japan on actual consumers and looking at the biomarkers and individuals, and proved that the IQOS device does not impact air quality or give a problem to non-smokers in the area.
Nick Rolli: Michael just a follow up -- Michael it’s Nick. That ban does apply to both combustible and heat-not-burn. They’ve carved out some differences between the two. So I think that’s the good news is to recognizing the heat-not-burn category as a bit different.
Michael Lavery: Just to clarify then you said it does apply to both, but there’re some carve outs…
Nick Rolli: There are some differences and I can get you the specifics on that after the call. In restaurants, and bars and things you maybe…
Martin King: I think there’re different categories…
Nick Rolli: Something like the establishments and things of that nature where you can’t use CC but you can use heat-not-burn.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.
Jonathan Leinster: Just going back to previous question. What plans have you got if any for the full commercialization of platforms two, three and four? Where are we in that?
Martin King: So platform two, which is the heat-not-burn product, deliver similarly to platform one but it uses carbon tip to generate the energy. That product has been launched in a limited city test in the Dominican Republic. We’re gathering consumer data and consumer information on that and preparing to ramp up the production. And we’ll give plans for that going forward. Platform four, which is the e-cigarette MESH product I referred to before, is -- the new version of it is being finalized and it will be launched soon. And it is an improve technology that we believe and a differentiated from others in e-cigarette category. So we have high hopes for that product and continue development of that product going forward to deliver better satisfaction to smokers. So that will be put out in its market before the end of the year. And then platform-three is little bit more in development and we don't have it in test market yet. But we will get into a test market as soon as we can.
Jonathan Leinster: Does that mean we should expect -- when will we expect first national launch of any of these products?
Martin King: We haven't said, so don't have any new update on that.
Jonathan Leinster: Secondly, certainly there was trade press, suggesting that the announced IQOS factory in Germany was no longer going to go ahead. Is that true? And there are some of the other ones that you announced too; Romania, Greece, the Dublin, the size in Italy, Switzerland investment, Russia investment? Are some of those also being scaled back or perhaps not going ahead?
Martin King: We're reevaluating our whole CapEx for RRP. The reality is we're in good shape with RRP capacity. We have better efficiency with the spend because you have better up time. We've had lower waste numbers and we've also figured out how to better use some existing facility layout. And with the new growth forecast we're in pretty good shape. So we have now changed the timing on some of our spending for CapEx, that's why we have lower CapEx number for the year. And we're going to continue to evaluate the footprint for RRP going forward. We don't have any announcements on individual factories, but we're doing the assessment now. And we'll give more information to the individual areas as they might be impacted or not. From a company perspective, it's a story of us being more effective and efficient with spend and phasing of the timing of our investment on CapEx to match the situation.
Jonathan Leinster: And within Japan now, you may or may not be able to answer this. But I mean is there going to be direct connection when you're talking about potentially launching higher tar and nicotine product but also lower price products. Is there actually going to be a direct connection between the pricing and the level of tar and nicotine? In other words, is there going to be a -- is the market going to be stratified into a higher priced product, which are more flavorsome but more tar and nicotine and the lower price product, which perhaps gives less of a kick. Or is that not going to be the case?
Martin King: That is not going to be the case. We're not launching higher tar and nicotine product. We said more flavorful. First of all, tar doesn't really make sense when you talk about heated tobacco units. The aerosol is dramatically different. It's not really -- tar doesn't really make sense in the case of those. And the nicotine level doesn't necessarily go with the flavor level. It's about the selection of tobaccos in the way we make the tobacco, print tobacco in the raw that creates a different flavor. So we're talking about more flavorful ones that -- products that give more taste in the consumer experience in order to bridge better to full flavor smokers. But it's nothing to do with tar and nicotine. And as far as price goes, we're going to have a line-up of different flavors. We would not price according to the flavor or the nicotine amounts or anything like that, nothing like that, no.
Jonathan Leinster: And lastly I think, historically, you’ve talked about having a new EPS algorithm at some point in 2018 given the uncertainties. Is that still the plan at some point, or is that perhaps going to be later?
Martin King: We have our Investor Day that’s coming up at the end of September, and we will talk about the future in much more depth there and talk about the different aspects of our growth and the very positive plans we have for the future. I think that’s probably the best venue in which to talk about longer-term prospects on growth for the Company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: I think you may just filled my question in talking about long-term is more of a long-term question. So I’m assuming you’ve modeled a number of scenarios internally. And so with that respect you’ve spoken quite bullishly in the past when IQOS was continuing to grow very strongly. The double-digit organic sales growth each year was possible going forward. My question is if IQOS growth stays at the current rate, we increasingly see lower-price variants introduced like you plan to do in Japan, and perhaps later becomes much more prevalent on a global basis than you had expected. And what sales growth will be expected in that scenario?
Martin King: I mean, first of all, we don’t believe that scenario is reflected with what's going to happen. The heat not burn category is profitable. The products that we sell in that category are more profitable than our convention cigarette products and we think it will stay that way, some of its coming from tax differentials. We think we have very good arguments for maintaining tax differential. We’ve been very successful around the world having these products at a lower tax than conventional cigarettes. And if you couple that with the fact that the production costs are roughly the same as cigarette and the trade margins are the same as cigarette, you have a much more profitable category. We think it’s defensible with our IP and the regulatory situation around tobacco. We think that the conversion costs are reasonable given the higher income stream coming from the higher margins on these products, and they are coming down the conversion costs as you amortize the central costs and the set up costs over more and more volume. The conversion costs will come down and the scale will help us with that. We’re building brand equity with IQOS. So we have every reason to believe that the profitability of IQOS and heat-not-burn category, in general going forward, will be very good and better than cigarette and we are very confident in that scenario. I think the success we’ve had around the world and the fact that these products and these markets, even at relatively low market shares, are accretive in adding profitability to the Company is a testament to that.
Owen Bennett: But then just in terms of when you speak about double-digit organic sales growth. I mean, even given the trends we’re seeing right now. Do you think that is still a long-term possibility, or perhaps that needs to come in some more?
Martin King: I mean, I think at Investor Day, we’ll talk about the further out periods. I think 2019 will be a better year for us. We’re lapping some challenges around Saudi for this year that 3 EPS point. The combustible business is better and strong, it’s improving. We’ve got volume. We’ve got share improved on combustible. We’ve got pricing that’s going well. Our investments going forward, I already talked about, are more manageable in the out years, because you don't step up the infrastructure cost that you built for bigger volumes. We’re taking the inventory rightsizing and the initiatives in Japan that will help set the deck for 2019 and help the initiatives in Japan really take effect, and get us better growth there. And then you’ve got tremendous growth across a bunch of geographies on IQOS this year that are very well for the future next year. So I can tell you 2019 we’re quite confident in and very bullish about and we can talk more at Invest Day about the longer-term and the different elements of our growth.
Operator: And we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.
Pamela Kaufman: I just wanted to ask about the combustibles business and what’s driving the improved expectations there. Is it less cannibalization from IQOS? And are you reallocating some incremental investment back into the cigarette business?
Martin King: No, I think that the spending is -- just the flip side of what we’ve talked about with the $600 million on RRP. We haven’t really changed greatly the investment plans behind the combustible category. And our pricing went very well this year across a broad series of geographies, so that’s helping the overall. And our share is doing better. I mean there were another -- a number of markets that have been dragging on us, which are now turned around. I mean, you go to the Asia, South and Southeast Asia region; Indonesia is positive share this year and doing better on first half on volume; Philippines, we’re getting great share growth in the Philippines and the profitability is improving. From a volume perspective; Thailand and Pakistan are adding, whereas before it wasn’t as much; Turkey, the market is growing due to illicit coming back into the legal market, and we’re benefiting greatly from that; in Germany, our pricing and initiatives went very well this year. We had growth in share in the second quarter. And so it’s starting to deliver some good benefits. So it’s a broad range of geographies where the brands are doing well, the pricing is a bit better and the overall market volumes, in a few cases, are a bit better like I mentioned in Turkey but also in some of the geographies that had been causing us issues before. We have situations and we have volume coming back from illicit due to a number of factors like in Pakistan the new tax tier, et cetera. So you add it all up and we have a very good picture, going forward, not just for the second quarter but going forward on the conventional products business.
Pamela Kaufman: And then I was just wondering if you can elaborate on the commercialization strategy for the next generation IQOS device. Are you going to be rolling it out across all markets or initially just in Japan…
Martin King: I think you’re going to have to wait and see on that one. I can tell you that we’re very excited about this new generation of devices. They really are better from the way the consumers use them, the interface, the way they look and the performance of them. And we have a good plan for introducing them and you’ll have to wait and see.
Pamela Kaufman: And can you comment on the battery life. How many uses the device have?
Martin King: We flagged as one of the drivers of having to reduce inventories and device sales, going forward, is that that we’re finding that our devices are actually holding up better as far as the life of the battery, if you will. You buy a battery and it’s rated for a certain number of cycles. But the reality is in the real life and with the consumer use, people are tending to get more cycles out. So the replacement rate for battery life issues is actually turning out to be bit lower than what we had planned. And therefore, consumers can hang onto them and use them for a longer period of time. So the batteries in these devices are fantastic technological quality and they are lasting better.
Operator: Thank you. That was our final question. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin King: I just want to close with just reiterate three key points for our outlook. First of all, the base business we talked about it, it’s doing better. We've got improved volume to share. The Marlboro is doing well across the world and the pricing is coming in very nicely this year. The RRP growth is substantial. Year-over-year, we're growing our IMS, nearly doubling it and it's really broad based. It’s covering a number geographies, not just Asia now with Japan and Korea which are great success stories, but also EU, Russia, other markets are starting to kick in with significant additions to our volume growth. And the last point is that we've taken some decisive actions to improve our growth, going forward. In Japan, in particular, the initiatives we put in place in rightsizing these inventories. We're doing that in order to give us better results, going forward, not only that the initiatives have better impact but also prepare the decks for 2019. So we're very confident about the future. We look forward to giving more detail at Investor Day, and we look forward to improve results going forward. So thanks very much, everybody.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Phillip Morris International's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-19 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Nicholas Rolli - VP, IR and Financial Communications Martin King - CFO
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray Adam Spielman - Citigroup Inc Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC Jonathan Leinster - Berenberg Chris Growe - Stifel Financial Corp
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or "RRPs," as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. As a reminder, effective January 1, 2018, we began managing our business in six reporting segments reflecting a new regional structure. Three years of historical data reflecting the new structure are available on our website and in the Form 8-K that we submitted to the SEC on March 23rd. Please also note that we are now using operating income to evaluate business segment performance and allocate resources, replacing operating companies income, or "OCI," which was used prior to January 1, 2018. OCI was defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in an unconsolidated subsidiaries, net.  Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin.
Martin King: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are increasing our 2018 reported diluted earnings per share guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, by $0.05 to a range of $5.25 to $5.40. The change reflects a lower estimated full-year effective tax rate of approximately 26%. Our guidance includes $0.16 of favorable currency, at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding currency, our guidance represents a growth rate of approximately 8% to 11% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. The reduction in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018 to approximately 26%, versus the 28% that we had previously communicated, is driven by two main factors. First, further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , primarily related to foreign tax credit limitations due to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income provisions of the Act; and second, revised foreign income tax estimates due to a change in the mix of our foreign earnings. I must caveat that this estimate reflects our current capital structure, as well as our current interpretation of the new tax law, which may change as further regulations and clarifications become available. It also reflects current assumptions regarding earnings mix and tax rates by taxing jurisdiction, which may also change. Our revised guidance also incorporates some caution related to the evolution over the balance of the year of three elements which I will cover in more detail later in my remarks namely; the timing of price increases in Russia, although the start of the year has been encouraging; slower-than-initially-projected RRP category growth in Japan during the quarter. Given the phenomenal category evolution, we are now reaching different socio-economic strata with more conservative adult smokers who may have slightly slower patterns of adoption; and the pace of recovery of cigarette industry volume and our market share in the GCC, particularly Saudi Arabia. Consequently, we have not passed through the full benefit of the lower estimated tax rate to our 2018 guidance at this early stage of the year, but we will monitor how these dynamics and our related initiatives progress as the year unfolds. Our revised guidance reflects currency-neutral net revenue growth of around 8%. Turning to our first-quarter results, we recorded strong currency-neutral net revenue growth of 8.3%, driven by higher volume for heated tobacco units and IQOS devices across IQOS markets, coupled with higher pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio across all Regions, notably South and Southeast Asia and Latin America and Canada. Adjusted operating income declined by 2.7%, excluding currency, mainly due to the following three factors, which André outlined previously during our year-end call in February. The impact of the tax-driven cigarette industry volume decline, as well as the related down-trading and our corresponding market share decrease, in the GCC, principally Saudi Arabia; higher RRP investments, primarily in the EU Region; and our full-year 2018 contribution of $80 million to the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which was expensed entirely in the first quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.00 declined by 1%, excluding $0.03 of favorable currency. Our reported diluted EPS in the quarter came in $0.13 above the $0.87 forecast that we provided in February. Underpinned by our strong business performance, this better-than-anticipated result was helped by the lower effective tax rate, as well as the timing of certain RRP investments. Nevertheless, our projection of net incremental investment behind RRPs of approximately $600 million in 2018 remains unchanged. Combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume declined by 2.3% in the first quarter, or by 1.1%, excluding estimated inventory movements, primarily in Japan and Saudi Arabia. The decline was principally due to lower cigarette industry volume, notably in Japan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by strong growth in heated tobacco unit volume, particularly in Japan and Korea. For the full-year, we continue to anticipate a combined shipment volume decline of around 2%, compared to an industry volume decline of 2% to 3%, on the same basis. Heated tobacco unit volume is growing rapidly across launched geographies. In Japan, we lifted the IQOS device sales restriction during the first quarter of 2018. We observed, however, that device sales were slower than our ambitious expectations. This was due to still limited awareness of IQOS' increased availability and, more importantly, to the fact that we are reaching earlier in the year than we had anticipated, the more conservative consumers, especially the age 50 plus smoker segment, which represents approximately 40% of the total adult smoker population. In general, these consumers are likely to display, at least initially, a slower pace in entering the RRP category, that is, they are less likely to be in the "Innovators" and "Early Adopters" groups shown on this chart. Instead, they are relatively overrepresented in the "Late Majority" and "Laggard" groups, which are larger in size. This is common with any new product category, and especially RRPs, and IQOS in particular, given their phenomenal speed of growth in Japan. We are therefore adjusting our commercial plans in terms of the timing, intensity and content of communication to specifically address the needs of these adult smokers. In parallel, we are strengthening our loyalty programs for existing IQOS users as competition intensifies. However, this temporary dynamic may affect our full-year total heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which we have cautiously reflected in our revised guidance.  IQOS continued to record strong heated tobacco category share growth in Japan in the quarter at an estimated 80%, and it is the undisputed icon RRP brand. In fact, as the availability of competitive RRP products has increased, there has naturally been experimentation by certain IQOS users especially "Innovators" and "Early Adopters" with competitive products. This has also been due to the IQOS device sales restriction. However, only an estimated 1% of converted IQOS users fully switch to these competitive products. This is remarkable, particularly given the premium positioning of IQOS, and is a testament to its potential. Before closing on this topic, I think it is important to highlight the underlying growth in heated tobacco unit demand. Even if the aforementioned dynamic persists, we remain on track to double our worldwide in-market sales of heated tobacco units compared to 2017. Moving to our market share performance, total international share, excluding China and the U.S., increased by 0.4 points in the quarter, driven by higher share from our heated tobacco brands, which were up by one full share point to 1.5%. Over half of the 0.6 point share decline for our cigarette portfolio was due to Saudi Arabia, where the decrease in cigarette industry volume and related downtrading put pressure on the shares of both Marlboro and L&M. I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Total industry volume declined by 4.1% in the first quarter, or by 3.4% excluding estimated inventory movements. The decline was due mainly to the impact of price increases, including sizable excise tax-driven price increases in France. For the year, we anticipate a total industry volume decline of approximately 2% to 3%, consistent with the structural decline rate. Our total regional market share was down by 0.2 points in the quarter, largely reflecting the impact of estimated inventory movements, partly offset by the strong growth of HEETS, which reached a regional share of 0.8%. As expected, Regional adjusted operating income, which declined by 15.8% on a currency-neutral basis, was heavily impacted by incremental RRP investments. For the year, we anticipate adjusted operating income growth in the low to mid single-digits, excluding currency. In Russia, total industry volume declined by 8.3% in the quarter, due mainly to the impact of price increases and higher illicit trade. For the full year, we expect a total industry volume decline of approximately 7%, consistent with 2017. Quarter-to-date February cigarette market share declined by 1.1 point, primarily due to our low-price brands. Despite continued down-trading in the market, as well as adult smoker out-switching to IQOS, share for premium Marlboro increased by 0.4 points, while share for above premium Parliament was down only slightly.  We recorded a favorable pricing variance in the quarter, reflecting the annualization of 2017 price increases, as well as additional price increases earlier this year. While this is a welcome development, the pricing environment remains a watch-out, particularly after the scheduled excise tax increase in July. Turning to Saudi Arabia, cigarette industry volume remains under considerable pressure following the June 2017 excise tax-driven price increases. First-quarter industry volume declined by over 40% and was impacted by a further VAT-driven price increase in January. Our cigarette market share declined by 12.5 points, largely reflecting the impact of significant industry-wide down-trading following the price increases given the premium positioning of our portfolio vis-à-vis competitors. We anticipate a moderation in the cigarette industry volume decline in the second half of the year, when the June 2017 price increases have been lapped. As I mentioned earlier, the market nonetheless remains a watch-out, along with the broader GCC, due to the differing stages of tax enactment. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.3% in the first quarter, largely reflecting the soft consumer spending environment coupled with above inflation excise tax-driven price increases. For the year, we continued to anticipate an industry decline of 1% to 3%. Cigarette market share increased by 0.2 points in the quarter to 33.2%, driven by the strong performance of Marlboro Filter Black, as well as Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild, a lighter-tasting machine-made kretek line extension from the Dji Sam Soe brand family, launched in May 2017. In the Philippines, excise tax-driven price increases drove further profit growth in the quarter. We also recorded strong market share growth, led by Marlboro and Fortune. We are particularly pleased by Marlboro's performance following its price increase in December 2017. We continue to be very encouraged by the outlook for profit growth in this important market. I will now turn to the performance of IQOS, beginning in Japan. HeatSticks continued their strong sequential growth trend in the first quarter, reaching a national market share of 15.8%. This represents growth of 8.7 points and 1.9 points versus the first and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Looking at IQOS's performance in Sendai specifically, HeatSticks off take share growth in the first quarter continued to drive an increase in our heated tobacco category share. It is worth highlighting that the category’s share growth in the first quarter was driven primarily by IQOS. The quarterly share progression of HEETS in Korea also continues to stand out, reaching 7.3% in the first quarter. To put this performance into perspective, HEETS is now a top-5 tobacco brand in Korea less than one year after launch, with a quarterly share approaching those of our leading cigarette brands in the market, Marlboro and Parliament. Outside Japan and Korea, we continue to record strong sequential national share growth in other advanced IQOS launch markets, with first-quarter market shares ranging from 1.5% in Italy to 3.5% in Greece. This performance demonstrates that we are successfully leveraging our learnings across markets to drive improved execution, higher IQOS awareness and strong conversion. It is important to also remember that these national shares have been achieved despite not having a full national presence in these markets. We believe that the even higher quarterly off take shares in focus cities such as 3% in Rome and 5.9% in Athens augur well for IQOS in these markets going forward. As seen on this chart, we are observing similar trends with our focus area offtake shares in IQOS launch markets that remain more targeted within a limited number of key cities. This gives us further confidence that our investments behind the heated tobacco category are increasingly paying off. The growth of our RRP portfolio, coupled with the enduring strength of our combustible tobacco brands, is supporting strong anticipated cash generation in 2018. For the year, we continue to target operating cash flow of over $9 billion. We plan to use this cash primarily for capital expenditures to support the growth of our business, and for dividends, at the Board’s discretion.  We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion this year, with RRP-related investment expected to account for around 60% of the total. We remain committed to restoring, over time, our leverage multiples to the ranges associated with our current credit rating. Importantly, both Moody's and S&P have recently confirmed our rating, with S&P revising its outlook from "negative" to "stable." In conclusion, our first quarter results came in better than expected, with the delta compared to our February forecast driven mainly by a lower effective tax rate and the timing of certain RRP investments. Our leading combustible tobacco portfolio continues to support strong pricing, while contributing the lion's share of our earnings and cash flow. In parallel, IQOS is recording strong sequential quarterly share growth across launch markets, demonstrating our ability to effectively invest and apply learnings in a wide range of geographies. Finally, the full-year outlook for our business remains strong. Our increased 2018 earnings per share guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 8% to 11%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. 
Judy Hong: Thank you, hi everyone. So Martin I had a few questions just in terms of how the IQOS trends played out in the quarter. So, first just in Japan how much did device sales actually come in lower versus your expectations and is this is something that developed in the last two months because it sounded like CAGNY trends were pretty strong, I think you had January market share number for IQOS that was higher than the quarterly average. So, just curious in terms of the device sales situation and then if this is something you have observed in the last two months?
Martin King: Yes, Judy if you recall when we were talking about the end of the year call we mentioned that we were expecting to be able to meet the additional HeatStick units inventory that we had sent to Japan with additional devices from our second supplier that had ramped up production. And we did ship the additional devices and we were anticipating a substantial surge because as you know we had short in the market for quite some time. And as it turned out we were closer to having met market demand than we realized. We are anticipating that we would reach some sort of a plateau later in the year given that we knew the consumer dynamics that we hit close to saturating the early adopters and innovators. It is just coming a bit earlier in the year than what we had foreseen, and this isn’t unusual.  We have looked at trends of other new products and new successful launches in other situations, and there is almost always periods where you get surging adoption and then it plateaus a bit as you enter some new consumer dynamics and categories, and then it tends to resume some growth rates. And we think we are at one of those points. Now we are obviously going to adjust our plans. We have very good initiatives in Japan that we are going to pull forward earlier in the year and we need to adjust a bit our messaging to these consumers and we don’t know how long this plateau will last it may -- we may be able to resume better growth rates fairly quickly or it may persist a bit throughout the year. So we thought it was prudent to reserve some of the benefits from the tax to account for this as well as for the Saudi and Russia pricing. And we're going to see how it goes for us here. It's still early days in the year. We've got a terrific team in Japan that is addressing these issues backed up by some folks in the region that have experience in Japan. And the group here in the headquarters that's putting together a great tool box for us to address these other consumer segments.  So we're actually quite optimistic about Japan. We had tremendous growth there. I mean to reach about 16% share in such a short period of time is absolutely phenomenal. It was just an issue of whether this torrid pace of growth would continue uninterrupted or whether we would hit some points at which we need to adjust a bit and approach consumers in a little bit different manner and that's just coming a little earlier in the year than what we had hoped. And there is that -- I'm sorry go ahead. 
Judy Hong: No, go ahead sorry. 
Martin King: You had mentioned the shares, for the quarter we are at 15.8 versus the quarter four last year of 13.9. I think you mentioned the January share that probably you were looking at from CAGNY which was given at 16.3. We're focusing more on quarterly shares because there's always a bit of noise in those in market shares there based on exchange of data from the different companies and sometimes there are some inventory impacts as they shift to retail. If you look at December of last year the in-market shares percent was 14.1 so it was probably a little understated versus due to some inventory increases from our competitors and then 16.3 came in in January probably a little overstated because of the reversing of that effect. But if you look at say quarter end to quarter end so December was the last month for Q4 at 14.1, March of this quarter is at 15.6 so we're seeing a good trend in Japan in offtake. What we're flagging for the rest of the year isn't really you don't see it in the first quarter numbers. What we're really flagging is the growth, the speed of uptake of new consumers as measured by how quickly they buy the devices and rather than get a big surge from pent up demand that we had optimistically estimated we're seeing still good growth, still a good number of new consumers coming in the category. We just don't have that surge there of devices and therefore we can project forward and see that our HeatStick sales which come as a lagging indicator to the device sales are likely to be a little bit lower than what we had flagged at the year-end call and therefore we're being cautious in reserving some ammunition to deal with that. 
Judy Hong: Okay, and then if I can just clarify the distortion though between the in-market sales number versus the shipment number because it seems like last year particularly in the fourth quarter, there was a bigger sort of over shipment of IQOS versus the in market share number. So as you think about the kind of a little bit slower adoption of the more conservative consumers and then you also have this big inventory that's probably still in transit or somewhere in the channel. How do you think about accounting for that as you think about shipment volume in 2018?
Martin King: Okay, so let me go back a little bit to what we said previously and remind a little bit of what the setup was. So we started the year last year with almost no inventory because we were behind on HeatSticks and only later in the year were we able to start catching up a bit and we called out in Q3 and also in Q4 that we were actually building what we thought -- what we think still is an appropriate inventory for Japan. If you recall we said that for the full year we've built inventory as a company of 8.5 billion net of conventional cigarettes. So in Japan obviously we were providing for an appropriate inventory of heated tobacco units while at the same time reducing our conventional cigarette inventory. So we had called out the 5 billion that was in the fourth quarter and a total of 8.5 throughout the year. And of course we were at the same time we were shifting from air shipments to sea shipments.  We were still relying and still are relying primarily on one factory. So we needed to have some safety stock to deal with any potential disruptions and so forth and we were also anticipating HeatSticks to meet the new device volume which had become the bottleneck by the second half of the year. So I think we were pretty clear to say that within our numbers for last year was a build-up of the inventory for heated tobacco units in Japan. Now for this year we've got that inventory, we don't expect it to reverse from the point of view that we have excess inventory. We have an inventory that's appropriate for a rapidly growing product category and appropriate for the long supply chain and we've gone to see shipments and appropriate to guard against any possible disruptions from a supply chain that's still relatively young and relatively focused on a single factory.  But for 2018 you will see pretty stable HeatSticks inventory in Japan. You'll see comparisons year-over-year which is a variance on variance where we'll call out that the difference in inventory build in 2018 will be obviously lower than the inventory build was in 2017. So I think you also have to keep in mind that we're back to shipping by sea from Japan so you have product on the water that ships and is recorded as revenue when it ships out of Europe primarily and it takes six to eight weeks to get to Japan. And I think maybe there's been a bit of confusion also with some people reading to Japanese government import data within the quarter and mistaking it as having been the IMS sales in the quarter when in fact it was shipments in the fourth quarter of last year that arrived on the water only in January-February of this year. So that perhaps is another source of confusion on reading the difference between our in-market sales and our shipments.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Martin King: Okay, thanks Judy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about what changed in Russia and Saudi Arabia. Those aren't new issues but it seems as though they must have gotten worse, it's now -- that's part of what you would point to as your updated -- for your updated revenue outlook? 
Martin King: Okay, sure. So for Russia it's more a situation that we still have a lot of the year left to go with the pricing situation and we still have the tax increase which comes only in July this year which is a pass on of five Roubles per pack. So it's lower than it was last year but it's coming six months later. So the whole pricing situation in Russia is still unfolding. The first quarter actually came in pretty good. We're on track, there is no big new news there. But we have a situation in Russia where the timing between when the price is announced and when it actually reaches retail is quite long in Russia because of the way the pricing happens, it has to be declared at production and then there's inventory that works its way through the market. So the time between now and the end of the year with the tax still to come and the pricing having such a long time to retail, we just called it out as a caution and something that we are still watching and concerned about. But there is really not a big new development. You always have the usual skirmishes or lagging from competition and certain SKUs perhaps not coming up in price quite in the way that others are. That's normal so it's not really new news.  On Saudi I think it's a story where we're just now seeing the full impacts of the volume effect of these huge price increases. We had another price increase in January driven by the VAT. Our market share in Saudi is actually sequentially starting to recover a bit. In Q3, Q4 we were in the 35% more or less market share range. So while Q1 is way down versus last year sequentially it's actually starting to recover. The watch out is more on the market volume which is still not in recovery mode which is still lower in Q1 than it was in Q4 and Q3. So again it's a situation where it's very hard to predict the rate of recovery of the total market volume and our share and it's still early in the year so we're calling it out as a caution.  Again we're not seeing numbers that are dramatically different from what we had expected but it's still very early days and we want to make sure we have that accounted for rather than just roll it on through to the guidance and then have some news later. 
Michael Lavery: So just help me understand this, I guess when you reported your fourth quarter and gave initial guidance it would have been earlier still in the year and you're -- I'm hearing you right nothing's changed so is really the updated revenue outlook all driven by IQOS in Japan?
Martin King: What, I mean certainly IQOS in Japan is probably the piece that's more newer information coming from the way that the device offtake is occurring. But we're still anticipating a very successful year in Japan and we're still anticipating double the volume of heated tobacco unit sales worldwide. I mean but clearly if this situation in Japan persists then our volume estimates for heated tobacco units will be more in the range of 55 to 60 versus the over 60 that we had called out before. It's hard to say exactly at this point, we don't know how this trend or the dynamic is going to develop. But we are just calling out kind of a more cautious situation to give us the time and the resources to tackle these different consumer segments in the right way. 
Michael Lavery: So, help me understand the IQOS number then 55 to 60 is quite different than twice last year's number which would be more like 70. I thought you were just saying today that something in the 2X last year was where you thought it might be? 
Martin King: We are having a bad connection, I really couldn't get that. Could you repeat that again Michael. 
Michael Lavery: Yes, sorry. So if I understood it right I thought you've just been saying that now you still think you could hit a something like a 2X last year's number that would be about a 70 billion sticks, is it more like 55 to 60 though? 
Martin King: No, what I am calling out is we expect to be more than double our in-market sales. So I'm accounting for this inventory build last year and just -- and comparing our in-market sales last year to what we expect for this year which would be well over doubling. And giving a more or less cautious range to say 55 to 60 would probably be a better estimate if this situation persists in Japan. But overall we're seeing tremendous growth not only in Japan by the way but if you saw the situation in the other markets we have a very nice stepped up share growth and volume coming from a wide range of markets across the EU and Russia is doing better and we're seeing some very good developments and very good news across the world for IQOS and our heated tobacco units. But obviously Japan is a big chunk of the volume and so when we are revising the numbers we felt it was best to give a little bit more cautious range.
Michael Lavery: So can you just help us understand, I know you're learning as you go and this is an evolution in your business that's quite new but where do you see this going and how do you model next year or two, three, four, five years out. You must have some amount of planning around that, what could an investor expect for what this all gets us and where we're heading?
Martin King: I'm sorry Michael, it's very hard to understand you. I don't know that you have a very good connection or something. I took away you are asking about how do we model our for the years, is that… 
Michael Lavery: Yes, so if there's some inherent uncertainty around how your business is evolving because this is a new platform and reduced risk products are different… 
Martin King: I'm sorry I can't hear the question at all. So I don't know Michael you just have a bad connection maybe you can call in again. We can go to another and come back. I can't get the question. 
Michael Lavery: Yeah I can try that and maybe if you can hear me now just one more time to what's the outlook like two, three, four years out, how do you see your business evolving. Obviously there's still some learning you're doing but what is the end game for where we're heading?
Martin King: Well, I mean we're building a whole new category not only for IQOS but we will be doing the same thing across our entire RRP portfolio. You have heard our commitment as a company to move as quickly as we can our entire combustible business to reduce risk products. We're investing substantially in building the infrastructure not just centrally but in the markets to make this happen. So we are very committed to this. We have a strong portfolio of products not just with IQOS but with other platforms as well. And as IQOS continues to do well in these other markets we expect the volume to keep growing extremely quickly as we make this happen. At the same time we're not abandoning our conventional product focus. You see we're getting very good results from our portfolio, our pricing in the first quarter is bang on. We said that for the full year on the conventional side we would achieve 7% pricing variance as a percent of the combustible prior year net revenues and in the first quarter we're right on track for that doing extremely well. The volume is okay. We're getting some volume back in some markets where we had lost it in Asia and overall we're using the combustible side to fund this transformation to reduce risk products and as far as modeling how fast that will go it's difficult. We've said there is uncertainty in this, we're going to move it as fast as we can but we're also prudent at the speed at which we invest to make sure we're getting good return for the investments and so forth. So as far as modeling it out several years, if you figured it out, have a good model we'd like to look at it too.
Michael Lavery: So as far as the margin outlook it's hard for you to indicate that right now?
Martin King: As far as the margin outlook, well okay look at the situation right now in the first quarter, we saw a pretty big drop in our margins. We were down about four percentage points. So let's strip that out a little bit. About half of that, about 2% of that is coming from the device impact and one of the things you're seeing in the first quarter is that our device sales as a percentage of RRP net revenues was a bit higher than usual. We had said that we expect around 25% to 30% of the net revenues for RRPs would be coming from devices and in fact in the first quarter it was about 5 percentage points above that range, around 35%. And this is partly the impact of what I described before that we had the devices coming from our new supplier that we shipped into Japan which we record the revenue as we ship it and they didn't sell out quite as quickly as we anticipated.  Still we had very good results by the way. It's just not the surge that we anticipated so you see a bit of a disproportionate share of the devices in the first quarter versus some of the other quarters. So that's about two percentage points of the 4% volume, I mean, the margin impact. You have got Saudi in there which is a huge drag, Saudi is very high margin area and you're seeing a big drag coming from that. So that's a big chunk and then you have the $80 million annual foundation which hit in the first quarter only. So that's -- those pieces together account for this four percentage point. If you look at some of the regions that aren't impacted by those other pieces we had very good margin expansion in South and Southeast Asia and Latin America and Canada and then of course on top of that you have the big RRP investments that we put in and a lot of it's going into EU but it's really going really across the world. There are a lot other markets as well.  So when you put all these margin pieces together you see a pretty big impact but going forward we should not see some of these as big a drag as we have seen in the first quarter. Obviously on the investments we will continue to invest and part of that is new consumer acquisition and making the transition, but there's a certain portion of this step up in spending which should not just scale the volume. A lot of it is infrastructure spending in the -- digital approach which you do it and you build it and it's there and then it can support a large scale of volume. It doesn't have to grow with the volume and the transformation. So going forward while we'll have more investments, the ratio of the investments to the new consumer should become more manageable.  The other piece is you've got a lag. You put in your big investments for example into EU behind gaining consumers. This is something that we need to do to convert consumers, we need coaches, we need a digital approach, we need a number of investments to make it happen. And the payback comes fairly quickly but also not exactly in the year where you made the investments. So there's a bit of a lag. So the step up that we're seeing this year we'll see some payback of course this year and in the second half of this year but most of it will come next year. You won't have -- the foundation will be in the base next year, the devices will be there but we're also working on having the devices be a bit less of a drag. The cost of them is coming down, the pricing is a bit better and then next year we shouldn't have Saudi because we would have lapped those results and in fact we have some hope for the market to recover a bit and get our share back and get some of the volume back as that market normalizes. So if you put all those things together logic would tell you that 2019 should be a bit better certainly on a margin perspective but also overall business.
Michael Lavery: Okay, thanks for your time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi. 
Adam Spielman: Alright, thank you very much. I have a really quick question on Japan but my main focus is the E.U. But to get rid of the Japan one first, you used in answer to Judy you used the phrase [indiscernible] and you also if you look at the sequential market share month by month it appears to be falling the course. 
Nicholas Rolli: Adam, this is Nick. We have a very bad connection, we're going to just switch to a different phone so if you can just hold on one second we will just make the switch. Gloria can you switch us, the operator can you switch us to the backup line please.
Operator: Certainly.
Adam Spielman: Or I could email you the question.
Martin King: We want to hear it from you.
Adam Spielman: Can you can you hear me?
Nicholas Rolli: Go ahead Adam, thank you. 
Adam Spielman: On Japan quickly, I think just to be clear I think you'll say you still expect growth over the courses in terms of market share even though you use [indiscernible] which sounds as if it's flats and sequentially the monthly market share within Q1 got worse over those three quarters. But I think what -- am I right to think that you still expect growth in market share over the course of 2018 quarter-by-quarter? 
Martin King: Yes, we do. We continue to grow in Japan, we continue to gain new consumers and we anticipate that share in Japan will continue to increase. It's just an issue of the speed of growth and the surge that we were expecting from the finally lifting the cap and having the supply of devices to meet the HeatSticks that were already there. Didn't materialize as much as we expected but we continued to grow in Japan, we have a very successful product there, conversion rates remain intact, and we also are doing very well versus the competition in the heat not burn category. We are growing our segment share so it's not an issue of not growing, it's more of an issue of the speed and the moment at which during the year we knew we would hit a bit of more difficult to convince consumer groups if you will. I mean especially in Japan you've got 50 plus age segment, there is 40% or more of the total adult smokers. And IQOS we are under indexing that group and that group is over indexed in more the late adopters and laggards parts of the consumer groups. And so it takes them a little bit longer to understand and be convinced to try IQOS and to move into the segment. We are convinced they will, in fact many have because there are -- but if you and I are using our product now, it's just a matter of timing. 
Adam Spielman: Okay, can I turn to -- thank you very much, can I turn to the E.U. two related questions. Firstly, it sounds like you planned to make some investments in Q1 but you decided not to and I would be very interested to hear about what you didn't do? And secondly, obviously market shares are progressing. I think it was 0.6 market share in 4Q, 0.8 in 1Q. And how do you expect that dynamic to continue, due you expect it to accelerate during the course of the year or do you think that run rate will continue each quarter? Thank you. 
Martin King: I mean when it comes to investments I mean whenever you put plans together to have a big step up in investment it's always built on project timelines and when you can execute things and so forth. It's not so much the case of deciding not to move forward, it is more the case of our ability to pull off this big surge in investments and to get the resources lined up and get it executed. I mean obviously we're making choices on putting more money or less money into individual markets depending on how the return on investments is coming and obviously there are times when we try something it doesn't work and we shift the resources over to another project that is working. But I'm not going to get into specifically calling out which things are working and which ones aren't working because I certainly don't want the competition to gain that information.  As far as the speed of growth in E.U. I mean it's hard to predict, we're seeing better results. We are very pleased with the way things are moving and the increased rate of growth. I mean in Italy where we've been for quite a while it was moving along at 0.1 at best month to month, quarter to quarter and now we're accelerating a bit. There are a number of other markets where the results are pretty fantastic. Greece is another so it's very difficult though to sit here and give you a rate of progression across the E.U. I mean we're going to continue to invest.  Overall this year we're still on track to achieve our $600 million step up which is net of conventional product allocation. So it's a considerable sum. We're trying very hard to spend it wisely, we put in place controls and tracking to make sure that that the money is getting results before we release more of it and that we reduce programs that aren't working. And the money and the investments not only in EU but in other places as well, Russia is a fantastic example, it's really starting to pay off. And the learnings are coming and we are getting better at executing, the quality of the coaches that we've put in place in a number of markets is much better, the messages are being fine tuned by market to fit the differences of consumers.  So we're really pleased with what is going, we're very optimistic about IQOS growth across the world by the way not just EU but it's in many other places as well. We're seeing terrific results in quite a few markets. So the plan is working and the move towards a reduced risk product is working. We're very mindful though of keeping an eye also on the conventional pieces and not abandoning that part of the business because it has to be the engine to provide the resources for the gains that we're going to get on RRP. But you see it worldwide. Our share in RRP was up one full share point year-over-year. I mean if you looked at that and said this was like a new brand rolling out across the world everybody would be jumping up and down with tremendous joy and it is. It's pretty fantastic and so we're very optimistic about it.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Hi guys, I missed a little bit of the call but I did want to talk to you about your HeatStick sales outside of Japan which did increase sequentially but maybe not as much as I would have expected. So I want to hear from you guys if that has met your expectations and how you expect that to ramp as the year progresses especially with what you just discussed in terms of the stepped up spending, conversations you're having with consumers, refining your approach, are you more optimistic that that could accelerate further as the year progresses?
Martin King: Well Bonnie I'm very glad you have very high expectations and the reality is we do to. And did the first quarter HeatStick sales outside of Japan meet our expectations, yes, they did. We're on track. We do hope to continue to accelerate the growth and that's what the investment is for. Obviously we've got a fair amount more to spend and more to put behind the growth rate and we're getting better at it, we're getting more tuned into what works. We're sharing very good learnings across markets. The new operating structure with the COO, Jacek focused on execution while the development side works more in the future in the tool boxes and so forth is working very well. We're still getting this in place. But we're already seeing some benefits from that and improved execution as well as improved speed at which we're developing the pipeline of new tools and new products to come. We have a terrific plan for the rest of this year and into next year for new products, new initiatives which I can't go into great detail on as you can imagine but yes, I think we're pleased with the results so far and we're very optimistic that we can accelerate the results going forward. 
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, and then just another question on your top line guidance which changed a little bit as you guys discussed and a few questions, so I wanted to make sure I understand the pricing on HeatSticks, is that something you guys are adjusting downward for instance in any markets as you try to push for the conversion, just kind of wanted to better understand how you're going to continue to position HeatSticks relative to combustible sticks in many of these markets? 
Martin King: Yeah, we haven't changed our plans on pricing for HeatSticks at all. Our main focus of course with IQOS and HeatSticks is consumer acquisition. So at this point we're not pushing to try to get a lot of pricing out of HeatSticks. Obviously we want to maintain its premium positioning so it doesn't mean we won't ever change prices anywhere but pricing isn't really the name of the game at this point with IQOS or with HeatSticks. We've got obviously increased competition in a number of markets so the pricing of the devices and the consumables we have to keep an eye on competition. We are priced well above the competition virtually everywhere which is fine by the way because we have a better product and consumers see it that way. On the other hand we have to be careful that we don't get undercut too much. So we have not changed the pricing on HeatSticks at all. The slight change in the language on revenue growth first of all, I mean we are still seeing about 8% which is pretty fantastic for any company but especially for a consumer products company. So I think this is a pretty terrific number to have out there.  We changed it a little bit based on what I already said which is the potential if it persists from Japan for the HeatStick or heated tobacco unit volume to be a little lower than what we had flagged in the previous year. And so we're giving ourselves a little bit of room and range around the 8% and trying to be as forthcoming with everybody as possible so that we don't disappoint on that number. But it's very, very solid number. 8% is nothing I think to be ashamed of. 
Bonnie Herzog: No, not at all and then just maybe a quick final question for me, I want to circle back to something you just mentioned about new innovation that you expect to be in the market this year which you can't talk about but I wanted to then clarify is that baked into your guidance for the HeatSticks volume as well as are you also considering any volume you might be selling in the U.S. market, is that factored into your guidance? 
Martin King: Well, look I hesitate to go line by line and say what's in guidance and not in guidance because you know as you well know a guidance is a kind of an all in number with a lot of puts and takes. I will say that the U.S. volume is really immaterial for this year. First of all we don't know exactly when it would ship and we don't have any volume in there for U.S. However, when it comes to other programs or other initiatives I mean obviously we have a plan and we know what's going to happen. It's part of our overall assessment of what the business can provide for the year. So for new initiatives and new type activities of any type we obviously consider them when we're putting together estimates. 
Bonnie Herzog: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Martin King: Hi Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. So, on the top line again, sorry to belabor the issue but that's clearly the concern today. When we think about your full year outlook for 8% and I look at the cadence of revenue growth in 2017 it is hard to imagine if you only did an 8.3 in the first quarter and your comps get considerably harder like what is going to change over the course of the year and allow you to kind of maintain that level of growth when your comps get significantly harder. So help us understand kind of the cadence of revenue growth please over the course of the rest of 2018? Thanks. 
Martin King: Well, I think Q2 and Q3 we are expecting some pretty strong revenue growth above 8%. As you pointed out the real comp hurdle comes with the fourth quarter where we had a fantastic revenue growth last year in the fourth quarter, it was 18.8% I believe if I recall. So that comparison does make it more difficult and that with that in mind that's partly why we're putting out there more around 8% versus saying the over 8% before. But we expect very solid, very strong revenue growth in Q2 and Q3 and continued growth sequentially for Q4 but just the year-over-year comparison becomes quite challenging. I think that's about as much color as I can give you on that one.
Vivien Azer: Geographically can you call anything out like that supports that level of confidence around much more robust growth in the next two quarters?
Martin King: Well I mean I mentioned that in the first quarter we had good pricing and that we are on our plan for pricing. And in fact slightly ahead. So that's part of it, as the pricing gets rolled in, in the first quarter it is really not fully impacted because we announced pricing across a number of geographies. I mean in the E.U. alone we're implementing pricing in Germany, Poland, Italy, France. I mean and yet we have mentioned the pricing in Russia. As you know Indonesia developed throughout the year, we had pricing in the beginning the year for Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Philippines, a big piece that's going to be now reflected throughout the rest of the year. So that's part of it. The volumes in the first quarter came in what we expected maybe a little bit better. The CC, the conventional cigarette volume is actually holding up very nicely and we're seeing some good developments in a number of markets despite some of the pricing related volume impacts that we're having in Russia, in France and in a couple other markets. But overall we're doing pretty well on conventional cigarette volume and our outlook for that as well.
Vivien Azer: Okay, thanks. On your outlook for incremental spend on IQOS relative to I believe it was the 600 million in incremental spend, you had originally guided for. How should we think about you guys kind of tweaking that plan, like what would drive adjustments there given in particular the first quarter trends in Japan, thanks? 
Martin King: Yeah, I mean look we're going to spend what we need to spend particularly in Japan. We have a rocket ship there that is absolutely taking off and very, very successful. And we will put the resources into it that we need to and which we think is appropriate. There are various ways to do that right, you can reallocate from the spending you have in other areas around conventional and other programs. You can reallocate some geographically or if necessary we can also spend above that 600 million that we mentioned. And this is part of the reason we are holding back a bit of the tax benefits that we called out as far as our guidance increases. So that we have the flexibility and the ability to put the resources behind a very successful product that we have not only in Japan but elsewhere.  So yes, right now we don't call out an increase in spending from the 600 because first we want to look at our reallocations and putting our heads together to put more resources where we need it without increasing the total net increase. But in the end of the day if we need to we will spend what is necessary for these new initiatives in Japan. And we'll find a way to deal with that within the guidelines that we've given you on the guidance.
Vivien Azer: Okay, thanks. Last one for me please. As we think about that Roger's innovation adoption curve that you showed for Japanese consumers like where do you think it kind of breaks and you say, okay, you know what like we're probably at saturation on IQOS and these older cohorts maybe are more appropriate for like a platform too, how are you guys thinking about that balance? 
Martin King: Well, I don't buy the idea that the late adopters or the even the laggards won't move to heat not burn. We see actually that individuals in those groups have very high conversion rates. It just takes a bit harder, bit more time to explain to them how it works, how to use it, what the benefits are and so forth. I mean we're reaching, we are ever more mainstream with IQOS in Japan. When you had 16% market share it's everywhere. You see every people using it, it becomes much more a product that can be considered by anybody. It's just that it takes them maybe a bit more explaining, a little more training on how to use it, a little different message on what are the benefits. So we're not at all saying that IQOS won't be successful among the 50 plus or among those different groups that we flagged on the chart. It's more a matter of how you approach them, what are the programs, what are the messages, which way can you communicate with them better, what are the products you put in front of them. So we think that they are very -- still good potential consumers for IQOS.  Now could a platform too over time also play a role in some of these markets, absolutely and we will over time as we get to that point use the entire product portfolio to address both different consumer groups but also even individual consumers during different times of the day or different points where they might enjoy one product versus another. We see our entire portfolio as something that can be used not only to approach different groups but also within individuals where they might see some of these products as more relevant during certain times of the day or during parts of their week. So any way we think we will continue to grow in Japan. It's getting more mainstream so it becomes a different approach. You don't have the very fast word of mouth coming quite as fast from some of the early adopters and innovators because almost all of them have already either moved to the category, tried the category were reaching close to saturation in those groups which is great news. But we will tackle these other groups and we will be successful with it, we're quite convinced of that, it is just how fast it goes.
Vivien Azer: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Alright. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg. 
Jonathan Leinster: Hi, good morning or good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions, one quite specific one in Japan just out of interest how many of the devices are now sold at full price and how many are still being sold on discount when it comes to IQOS?
Martin King: An increasing percentage is sold at full price because the original design was that the discount was more for encouraging people to register a new user. So you see consumers buying a second device which is positive from the point of view that they are more attached to the category and they see a need for additional devices and you also see some replacements because remember we've been in Japan now for over two and a half years. So you have devices that reached the end of their number of cycles that need to be replaced. Right now in Japan it's actually more than 50% is sold without the discount. So it's moving slowly in that direction.  At the same time we have to realize that to attract new consumers especially getting back to the 50 plus age group there's a little more price sensitivity in that group as well. This group tends to buy brands which are a little bit lower price and so they are more sensitive both on devices and on the heat sticks. So having a good offer for them and a good opportunity for them to try specially for their initial devices is important to cracking that group. So we will be judicious how we use discounts but I think we have to be realistic that we have competitors out there offering their HEET number and usually at 30% or 40% below the lowest prices we're offering for our. So we have to find ways to also put our products in front of people that are little more price sensitive as we go forward.
Jonathan Leinster: Just to take that a bit further I mean, in the past you've talked about potentially producing lower priced brands, HEET is sort of premium brand and maybe producing sort of more comparable and in pricing terms with some of the competition, is that what you're referring to here potentially a whole new brand or you are referring to sort of just a more heavy discount on the existing brand? 
Martin King: Well I think as you can understand I'm not going to go into details for competitive reasons on our plans. But in the long run, over the long haul you're going to have to find ways to approach different consumer groups and you can do that in many different ways. You can do it with different products, you can do it with different offers, you can do it with special offers, etc. So I'm not going to go through the exact plan but that obviously we're thinking about ways to crack different consumer groups many of which are going to be increasingly price sensitive.
Jonathan Leinster: Another quick question on IQOS, clearly the experience in Japan has been that the flavors of the menthol and so on where they are sort of most popular, are you finding a very similar experience outside of Japan or was the consumer reaction to IQOS perhaps to use the more non-mentholated or non-flavored versions, is that a traditional taste? 
Martin King: Yeah, I mean I think it depends on the market and markets that have a menthol category. The menthol version is usually preferred by menthol smokers quite obviously. Often though we do see the menthol over index is a bit simply because it's a bit easier taste to bridge to from conventional to go to IQOS because IQOS is a much lighter taste and it's a flavor that people have chosen in a bit higher percentage than usually the menthol in the market. But it depends greatly on the different market and the different situations. 
Jonathan Leinster: Right, because it does vary, the experience does vary by market quite considerably then? 
Martin King: Yes, it does. 
Jonathan Leinster: Yeah, and a quick one on the FMC side, am I reading this right, the volumes in Pakistan sort of doubled and that added 8.4 billion units, is that correct. Yeah, there's couple of things going on in Pakistan. First of all if you recall in May of last year we were successful in working with the government to establish a new tier, a lower tax tier in order to pull back the volume that had been lost to illicit trade. Because they had raised taxes so much and prices so much and the illicit trade being actually local producers that weren't paying taxes had grown tremendously. So in May of last year this new lower tax tier was implemented and we were able to put products there at a price that could pull volume back from illicit trade together with the competition.  The second piece is in 2016 there was a big inventory load in the market associated with a big price in tax anticipated. So in 2017 first quarter there was very little volume sold or relatively low volume sold in the market. So you're looking at two aspects; one is volume coming back from illicit trade which is roughly half of that 8 billion number you're mentioning and then the other half of it is the comparison year-over-year which is an inventory effect from the very high volume sold in fourth quarter 2016 with a very low volume in first quarter 2017 to more normalcy in the first quarter of 2018. So the market was quite distorted by both of those two events. The good news in Pakistan is we do have the legal volume recovering substantially from what was a pretty dire situation with the illicit trade taking a lot of that volume out. So that's a very positive development and our market share by the way in Pakistan has improved as well from this whole situation.
Jonathan Leinster: Okay, and very quickly last one, just wondering are there any sort of hated lawsuits pending regarding any other competitors related to IQOS in terms of the design of the product, is there any legal procedures outstanding against anybody in terms of sort of copyright? 
Martin King: Look we worked very hard to defend our intellectual property. We constantly are looking at what competition is doing and looking at potential legal remedies in cases where we think they are misusing our IP but I'm not going to comment on individual cases or individual actions that we have either pending or out there at this time.
Jonathan Leinster: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. 
Martin King: Hi Chris. 
Chris Growe: Hi, good afternoon. I know we're nearing end of the call here, I will just be quick here with two questions. The first is can you say how much of the spending you planned for the first quarter is in the future quarters, is it a symbol of the EPS beep that occurred in the quarter that could push into Q2 or spread across the next three quarters? 
Martin King: Yeah, I mean we flagged the difference between the $0.87 that we had forecast and the dollar it's about $0.03 coming from the difference in the tax rate and the rest is overall spending type stuff. I mean the business by the way was very good in the first quarter. Our revenues came in well, pricing is doing great. So we had a good robust quarter but most of the difference is the tax and it's actually the spending than the tax. We still think the spending will be the same more or less is what we said before. So obviously what we didn't spend in the first quarter we still plan to spend in subsequent quarters. I'm not going to give you the exact amount or the exact timing of it partly because these plans are still unfolding and we're still allocating the resources and deciding which projects are most successful and deserve more funding and so forth.
Chris Growe: Okay, and then just to understand the construct of that spending, you talked about spending more behind existing IQOS users in Japan for example so is that taking away -- are you spending more say in Japan to retain customers and taking away from maybe new developments in other markets around the world as we think about the total $600 million of spending? 
Martin King: I'm not going to go through the exact regional split or country split. All I'm trying to flag is that we will do what we need to do in Japan. In other words we're pulling forward some of our plans so in some cases just timing of what we're planning to spend anyway. In other cases we may need to put some additional resources in there which we can fund in a number of different ways including taking it from the conventional business. It's a big company. We have adequate resources to redeploy some to trouble spots or to get opportunities going which has been more as an opportunity. But does that mean we're going to for instance cut spending in EU behind IQOS in order to do that, I don't think so. I think it's more an issue of figuring out what programs work and where to spend it and so forth. So I'm not going to give you the exact split by the market and by the region but we will do what we need to do to get IQOS fully successful which it is doing already and we need to continue. 
Nicholas Rolli: Operator do we have any questions left. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. 
Judy Hong: Alright, thanks for taking a follow up. I just had two quick questions. One, I mean obviously your stocks down pretty meaningfully today, your ratings have gotten better, you've got some cash overseas, so I'm just wondering if you can revisit the share buyback earlier than perhaps you had envisioned? And then secondly just on Japan, I guess the bigger question to me is whether you've just overestimated how big the market can get ultimately and basically we're already seeing market share kind of plateau and it's not necessarily an early adoption issue but that's basically how big the market can get. So how do you get comfort around that there was actually a bigger demand out there?
Martin King: Okay, I mean first of all on the share we've said we won't have a share buyback in 2018. We're working to improve our leverage and make sure we have the flexibility also within our balance sheet to be able to make for example acquisitions of new technology and in the reduced risk area if necessary. If currency continues favorable or gets more favorable and stays that way and we continue to see the success in the business that we're having at some point we're going to have to sit down with the board and decide what's the best way to reward shareholders whether that be dividend increases or whether it be stock buybacks. It's really a Board decision and we haven't got to that point yet. But at some point in the future that will come.  As far as Japan you know look, what we're seeing is that the conversion rates for example continue to be very strong. We think that as we approach consumers and have the ability to talk to them and convince them of the product that we can still continue to grow this category. We don't think there's some artificial plateau that is sealing and we won't be able to grow beyond that. We think it's more a matter of the speed at which you can move, the resources it'll take to do it, and the messages, tools, approaches, products that are customized to each of the different consumer groups to keep growing. We don't buy the idea that somehow there's a big chunk of consumers that want to continue using combustible cigarettes when offered extremely high quality satisfying reduced risk products. It just doesn't make sense.  Every single adult smoker that has the right product to shift to has a cleaner way to use nicotine we think can eventually make that shift. And we've seen it among our own employees, we've seen him on every market where we go and work on it, we are seeing among our friends where we go and you approach them by and convince them that this is a better way for them to use nicotine and get them to commit to using it for a certain period of time. The conversion rates are fantastic so we don't buy the idea that there's some sort of a limit.  Now it may take longer, it may take more resources, it may take more customized approach but this is an unforeseen. We knew that we were going to have to adjust as we hit different consumer demographics and consumer groups and that's kind of where we are. This isn't surprising, okay it came a little bit earlier in the year than what we had hoped. That's just how it is but that's okay. We've got the right team and the right products and the right approach and we're going to keep growing in Japan.
Judy Hong: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Thank you that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. 
Martin King: Well thank you very much for joining us. This concludes our call for today. And if you have any follow-up questions please contact the IR team. Have a great day. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call, you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International 2017 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, please note the following, unless otherwise stated. First, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, references to total industry, total market, PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Andre Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer will join Andre for the question-and-answer period. Andre?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick. And welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Before I get into a discussion of our 2017 results, let me share my thoughts on last month's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee or TPSAC meeting in the U.S., which I recognize is top of mind for investors. For reference, we have posted our full presentation to the committee on www.pmiscience.com. The meeting was part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA's review of PMI's request to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product or MRTP. To advise the FDA on PMI's applications, the committee gathered a wide range of scientific, technical and consumer communications topics, address questions and probe the likelihood and magnitude of potential benefits as well as how best to address possible unintended use. We believe that committee's interactions with presenters and its discussion reflected respect for the integrity of our scientific data and our commitment to bring IQOS to the U.S. Although the committee did not agree with some of the specific language related to consumer communications, it confirmed that the evidence supported the statement that switching completely IQOS significantly reduces exposure to harmful chemicals. The meeting with TPSAC was just one step in a broader ongoing review of our MRTP applications by the FDA. And the recommendations and votes of the committee, while important, are advisory. In order to make a final decision, the FDA will now consider the topics discussed at the meeting, including public comments, along with the totality of the evidence we submitted in addition to information we had already planned to submit. In the immediate future, we look forward to working with the FDA to clarify any outstanding point, while recognizing that some questions can only be realistically answered in a post-market scenario. In this regard, in 2018 we will complete an exposure response study, designed to measure clinical risk markers in adult smokers who switched to IQOS over a 12-month period. The results of the first six months term were received at the end of 2017. And the related report is under preparation. We expect to submit the report to the FDA in May. Separately, PMI has submitted a pre-market tobacco application or PMTA to the FDA which if granted will permit the commercialization of IQOS in the U.S. without modified-risk messages. This application was not before the committee as it follows as parallel regulatory pathway. Finally, I'm deeply grateful to my colleagues, for their exceptional work on our applications to the FDA and for the presentations last month. Our science and the commitment of our people, gives me confidence in achieving a vision of a smoke-free future. I would also like to thank the FDA for the time that it invested to review our application, as well as the many members of the public who took their time to provide thoughtful comments. Turning to 2017, it was a landmark year for PMI, reflecting better than anticipated performance of our flagship smoke-free product, IQOS, which drove a positive annual profit contribution from our RRP portfolio for the first time, encouraging early feedback from a range of government agencies and advisory committees regarding the scientific substantiation of IQOS, including a growing recognition of a risk continuum for tobacco and other nicotine-containing products. The accumulation of valuable learnings that are driving organizational changes to support and accelerate our smoke-free ambition and our highest annual net revenue growth excluding currency and acquisitions since becoming a public company in 2008. Full year net revenues increased by 9.4% excluding currency, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume and IQOS device sales across all IQOS launched market. This reflects a favorable volume mix variance of $1.1 billion, our best ever performance on this measure. RRP net revenues reached $3.6 billion or 12.5% of total net revenues. Of which, IQOS devices and accessories accounted for approximately $0.9 billion. Net revenue growth also reflected favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by the growth in RRP allowances, which resulted in a total pricing variance equivalent to 5.2% of prior year net revenues, despite essentially no net pricing in Russia. Adjusted OCI increased by 7.4% excluding currency, driven by higher net revenues, partly offset by the adverse impact of higher sales of IQOS devices and increase investment to support the commercialization of IQOS. Consequently, our adjusted OCI margin decreased by 0.8 points to 41%, excluding currency. As outlined in today's press release, our reported diluted earnings per share when impacted by tax items, primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these tax items and unfavorable currency impact of $0.21, our adjusted diluted EPS increased by 10%. The negative currency impact was $0.04 higher than we had assumed in our previous forecast in October, notably due to the euro and the Japanese yen. Operating cash flow reached $8.9 billion, an increase of 10.3%, or 5.5% excluding currency. Capital expenditures increased by $376 million to reach $1.5 billion, reflecting higher investment behind heated tobacco unit production. These strong currency-neutral financial results were achieved despite 2.7% decline in our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume. The volume declined was principally due to lower cigarette industry volume notably in Indonesia, Philippines, Russia and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by strong growth in heated tobacco volume particularly Japan. The sequential improvement in our quarterly volume performance continued in the fourth quarter with heated tobacco unit growth driving a total shipment volume increased of 3.8% or 1.4%, excluding inventory movement. For the year, heated tobacco unit shipment volume nearly quintupled to reach $36.2 billion. The sequential growth in our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., also continued in the fourth quarter. Since the first quarter, our quarterly share for heated tobacco units and cigarette increased by 0.7 and 1.1 points respectively. For the full year, our total international share was essentially stable. Lower share from our below premium cigarette brands, notably in Indonesia and Russia was almost entirely offset by the growth of our premium products led by HeatSticks and HEETS. Within the below premium segment, we continue to strengthen our portfolio through brand consolidation in 2017 with the morphing of local brands into international brands such as Chesterfield and Philip Morris, which gained 0.3 and 0.5 share points, respectively. Marlboro cigarette share was up slightly, a notable achievement given the disproportionate impact of out switching to our heated tobacco products in IQOS large market. The brand cigarette share increased in the Asia and the EEMA regions, reflecting robust growth in the Philippines and across markets in North Africa such as Algeria and Egypt. I will now discuss a few of our key geographies beginning with European Union region. Total industry volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units declined by 1.9% in 2017 slightly better than our forecast decline range of 2% to 3%. Relatively modest decrease in industry volume largely reflected the improving economic environment across most markets. Our total regional market share in 2017 was stable, reflecting a gain from HEETS, which reached a share of 0.3% for the year and 0.6% in the fourth quarter, offset by the decline of our cigarette brand portfolio. Among the largest EU markets by industry volume, we gained total share notably in France and Poland, driven by higher share for Marlboro and Chesterfield, respectively. Share declined in Spain, mainly due to Marlboro's passing of the round €5 per pack price point in the vending channel at the end of 2016. The share performance in Italy is also worth mentioning, while down for the full year, the favorable sequential share progression continued in the fourth quarter, led by HEETS. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined by 4.4% in 2017, mainly due to unfavorable volume mix and higher investments behind the commercialization of IQOS. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI increased by 6.1%, excluding currency, supported by higher heated tobacco unit shipments. During the quarter, we observed an acceleration in HEETS share growth in IQOS markets across the region, which I will cover later in my remarks. Turning now to EEMA, our 2017 results for the region were significantly impacted by two markets, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In Russia, total industry volume declined by 7.2%, primarily due to the impact of excise tax driven price increases coupled with higher illicit trade. Despite continued down trading, our cigarette share was essentially stable, reflecting growth for Philip Morris, net of portfolio consolidation, offset by declines for Chesterfield, L&M, Next and Next/Dubliss. Net pricing, i.e., pricing above the excise tax increase was a significant challenge due to the competitive environment. Consequently, we were unable to offset the financial impact of our volume decline, which was essentially market driven. For 2018, the excise tax increase is scheduled to take effect in July rather than January, as in the past. The weighted-average total excise tax pass-on for the industry is approximately RUB5 per pack, compared to RUB13 last year. We are optimistic that we will return to profit growth in Russia this year. In Saudi Arabia, the excise tax driven price increase in June 2017, which resulted in the doubling of retail selling prices, drove a cigarette industry volume decline of approximately 28% in the second half and 17% for the year. The volume decline primarily reflected a reduction in adult smokers' average daily cigarette consumption, coupled with a surge in the consumption of illicit products. The structure of the excise tax increase resulted in the widening of price gaps and led to significant down trading to low price brands. This can be seen in our quarterly share performance, with sequential declines in the third and fourth quarters for premium Marlboro and mid-price L&M, partly offset by gains for low-price Chesterfield. These factors weighed heavily on our profit in the market during the second half of 2017, and we expect continued pressure this year, particularly during the first half. Moreover, the other five GCC countries are in various stages of introducing a similar excise tax increase, with the United Arab Emirates having already done so in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we anticipate considerable volume and profit pressure across the area this year. For reference, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates accounted for approximately 60% and 20%, respectively, of the GCC's cigarette industry volume prior to the 2017 tax increases. In Japan, the spectacular performance of IQOS drove our results in 2017. Total shipment volume increased by nearly 30%, driven by the strong growth in HeatSticks demand and the increase in HeatSticks inventory levels. Excluding estimated inventory movements, total shipment volume increased by 13.1%. The favorable inventory movements primarily reflected, the increasing demand for HeatSticks, which we expect to grow further in the first quarter following a planned lifting of the restriction on IQOS device sales. The establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units, given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center; and the transition from air to sea freight of heated tobacco shipments, largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our total market share increased by 5 points to 32.1% with HeatSticks share up by 7.9 points to 10.8%. In the fourth quarter, HeatSticks share grew by 9 points to 13.9% and reached 14.1% for the month of December. Total industry volume decreased by 4.2% for the full year, broadly consistent with the secular decline rate for cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS. In Indonesia, the economic environment showed signs of recovery over the end of 2017, though consumer-spending remain soft. Against this backdrop, full-year cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 2.6% compared to a forecast of approximately 3%. The shift of industry volume into the Machine-Made Kretek continued in 2017. Share for Marlboro Filter Black increased 1.4 points, driving overall share growth of the brand. While our cigarette share declined by 0.4 points, 33% for the year, we essentially recorded stable sequential share at that level across all four quarters. The 2018 excise tax took effect in January 1, resulting in a weighted average excise tax increase of 10.8% industry-wide, compared to 10.3% last year. This included a reduction in the number of excise tax tiers and we are encouraged by the government's roadmap to further reduce the number of tax tiers over the coming years. In the Philippines, higher pricing across our portfolio drove further profit growth in 2017. Price increases at the bottom of the market in particular resulted in the narrowing of price gaps between Marlboro and lower price brands. This contributed to the brand's strong performance, with share up 4.6 points to 33%. While our total cigarette share declined by 3.7 points last year, we recorded strong sequential share growth, beginning in the second quarter. Full year cigarette industry volume declined by 5.6%, mainly due to the impact of excise tax driven price increases on lower price brands. In fact, volume in the premium segment, which is essentially Marlboro, increased. As a reminder, the first step of the revised cigarette excise tax increased for 2018, took effect on January 1 with the second step scheduled for July 1. The industry weighted average total increase is expected to be in line with the increase of approximately 14% last year. Importantly, while the increase is higher than the government's original plan, a single-tier specific pack structure remains unchanged. Heading into 2018, we believe that we have finally turned the page on the multiple challenges that we faced in recent years and we are very optimistic about the outlook of the important market. Turning to the Latin America and Canada region, cigarette industry volume declined by 3.8% in 2017, mainly due to the impact of retail price increases in Brazil and Canada. Despite the cigarette industry volume decline, and essentially stable regional share, we recorded very strong currency neutral adjusted OCI growth, driven by higher pricing, notably in Argentina, Canada and Mexico. To close, on 2017, I will gather in more detail, the strong momentum of IQOS across geographies, beginning with Japan. As seen on the slide, HeatSticks recorded strong sequential quarterly share growth throughout the year, despite capacity limitations, first related to HeatSticks, and then on IQOS devices, as well as the increased availability of competitors' heated tobacco products. We thus begin 2018 in excellent shape, with the supply of HeatSticks no longer an issue. The shipment of HeatSticks now shifted from air to lower-cost sea freight, and the capacity limits on IQOS devices behind us as of this month. While the presence of competition in the heated tobacco category at the national level in Japan remains in the early stages, the Sendai prefecture offers insight into a competitive environment, where multiple established heated tobacco products are present. In this environment, IQOS is performing very well, as illustrated by consumer offtake data. During the fourth quarter, HeatSticks weekly offtake share increased by 1.4 points to 19.9%, while also growing PMI share of the total heated tobacco category by 4.4 points to 67.3%. In Korea, IQOS continues to perform exceptionally. Fourth quarter market share of HEETS more than doubled sequentially to 5.5%, reflecting growth in existing launch areas coupled with the impact of national distribution expansion. Outside Asia, we recorded strong market share growth for HEETS in the fourth quarter, with notable accelerations compared to the prior quarter across many markets. We believe that these share gains primarily reflect our relentless focus on building quality awareness, improving commercial execution and continuously applying our learnings across markets. Building adult smoker comprehension of the heated tobacco category generally, and IQOS specifically is key to the product success. The ability to do so is very dependent on the regulatory restrictions in place in a given market, particularly with regard to adult smoker communication. This in turn impacts the speed at which we are able to grow IQOS. Italy is a good example of a market that has required a relatively longer time period to gain traction. In this regard, we are very pleased by Italy's share growth acceleration in the fourth quarter, which provides evidence that our efforts to build the category are bearing fruit. The favorable fourth quarter market share progression is also visible in our focus area offtake shares, in markets where our launch of IQOS remains more targeted geographically. The performances in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where IQOS was only launched during the third quarter of 2017, were particularly impressive, with focus area offtake shares already reaching 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Turning now to this year, our reported diluted EPS guidance for the year, at prevailing exchange rates, is a range of $5.20 to $5.35 versus $3.88 in 2017, and includes a favorable currency impact of approximately $0.16. This guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency of approximately 7% to 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. This forecast assumes currency-neutral net revenue growth of over 8%, driven by RRPs. The robust growth is underpinned by sizable upfront investments that while having an adverse impact on our near-term profit outlook reflect our growing optimism for the RRP category broadly, and IQOS, in particular. The incremental RRP spending in 2018, net of lower spending on our combustible portfolio is projected to be approximately $600 million, excluding currency. This equates to a drag of approximately 6 points on our projected EPS growth compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. The incremental spending comes on top of introductory discounts on IQOS devices to accelerate adult smoker switching. We plan to provide further detail on consumer acquisition, commercial deployment and the economic model for IQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY conference on February 21. The $0.16 of favorable currency, at prevailing exchange rates, included in our 2018 guidance is driven primarily by the Euro, Russian Ruble and Japanese Yen. We have currently hedged approximately 50% of our 2018 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates, translates to an effective rate of ¥110 to the Dollar versus ¥111 in 2017. This is the first time since 2011 that we entered the New Year with guidance that reflects a positive currency impact. While we are encouraged by this development, we should caution that spot exchange rates remain volatile. We are aware that investors would appreciate increased clarity on the phasing of our full-year results. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do believe that it is appropriate for us in this instance to share additional visibility on our expected first-quarter 2018 results. Despite strong anticipated currency-neutral net revenue growth in the first quarter, we expect reported diluted EPS of approximately US$0.87, at prevailing exchange rates, including approximately $0.03 of favorable currency. Our results in the quarter will reflect unfavorable comparisons versus the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to: the impact of the excise tax-driven cigarette industry volume decline and related down-trading in the GCC, principally Saudi Arabia; higher RRP investments, primarily in the EU region; and our 2018 contribution of $80 million to the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which is fully expensed in the first quarter. In addition, given the heightened interest around the recent corporate tax reform in the U.S., I will provide a general overview of the related impact on our estimated effective tax rate in 2018. I must begin with the caveat, however, that our estimate reflects our current capital structure, as well as our current interpretation of the new tax law, which may change as implementing regulations and clarifications become available. For 2018, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The difference between this rate and the 21% statutory rate under the new law, reflects the fact that PMI operates in markets outside of the U.S. and is driven by three main factors: foreign tax rate differences, the non-deductibility of interest expense and the partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible low-taxed income. It is important to know that under the new territorial-based system, we may face greater variability in our effective tax rate going forward, largely reflecting any changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. With regard to the impact of tax reform on our shareholder return priorities, we remain committed to restoring, over time, our leverage multiples to the ranges associated with our single-A credit rating. Importantly, the new tax law provides us with greater flexibility on cash repatriation. We are targeting operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion in 2018. This is above last year's level, despite our initial payment of approximately $130 million related to the repatriation tax on our unremitted earnings under the new tax law. We plan to use this cash flow primarily for capital expenditures to support the growth of our business and for dividends, at the Board's discretion to our shareholders. We do not forecast any share repurchases in 2018. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion this year, versus $1.5 billion in 2017. The projected increase is driven by higher investments to support RRP capacity expansion. In conclusion, our robust business performance in 2017 underscored the enormous promise of reduced-risk products, the enduring strength of our combustible product portfolio and the commitment of our employees to lead the transformation of our industry. We recorded strong full-year currency-neutral adjusted financial results, highlighted by our highest annual net revenue growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, since our spin-off in 2008. IQOS is performing exceptionally, demonstrating the importance of our investments and our ability to transfer and apply learnings across markets. We estimate that over 4.7 million adult consumers around the world have already stopped smoking and made the change to IQOS. To support our business transformation, we have reorganized into six regional segments, up from the previous four, effective January 1. This change aims to enhance our executional focus and our ability to exploit business opportunities in an accelerated manner. The outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2018 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 7% to 10%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 last year. This includes significant incremental investments behind RRPs, as outlined earlier. Our guidance including currency reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 13%, also compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 last year. Thank you. Martin and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hi, Matt.
Matthew Grainger: Hi, good morning. Thanks, Andre. I guess, I wanted to start by asking a few follow-ups on the reinvestment guidance you communicated for IQOS. This is something that's obviously been highlighted and sort of directionally talked about in recent months, but can you just address the decision to sustain that reinvestment phase and what the implications are for investors as they think about modeling out the profitability you expect from your RRP platforms relative to those initial 2020 targets?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, I think you have very strong momentum behind IQOS clearly and we want to accelerate this momentum, okay. So the investments I outlined, around $600 million incremental, obviously, behind IQOS that is more amounts of money, but there is a reduction that is coming from the fact that we are reinvesting some of the conventional business back to IQOS. And some of these costs are pure incremental and may be also repeated to a certain degree in the forthcoming years as volume grows and we gain more consumers. Some of them are infrastructural costs, including digital infrastructure, increasing the number of retail shops we have in different market. And the number of IQOS coaches we increase and so on. And this I consider them as necessary this year in order to accelerate our growth in the acquisition of new consumers that switch out of cigarettes, but they will stay rather in the base in the years to come. So I don't expect them to expand at the same rate. We also need to understand something that - and I appreciate it's the new business model and we'll explain more in CAGNY. But let's understand one thing, in any given market you need a certain infrastructure to start. So as I said shops, a number of coaches in place, a number of contracts with retail outlets, call centers, you name it, okay, that we didn't have to have under the previous business model. Then, during the year, let's assume you go from 100,000 to 500,000 people that switch to IQOS. You need the acquisition costs in the first year, because they vary between, say, $400 and $2,000 depending on the market at the beginning and the infrastructure cost. But you get revenues only from the equivalent of 250,000 converted people during the year. So next year, however, you get revenue from the entire 500 in my example. So there is always a period when you build the infrastructure and acquisition cost, but the revenues come the year after. And obviously, the year after you don't have acquisition costs on this particular consumers, but you have your retention cost that are notoriously low. So in our logic, I think in the years after, you have to see the benefit of what you invest this year and I would assume that 2019 results would be better 2018. Having said that, there will always be new markets that we open and there will be commercial costs. But as we get ahead of the curve, as we seen in Japan, where clearly the bottom line is positive from RRP, you will see it in other markets. So I think that's the right business model to grow the business. And when we see momentum, we have to put the money behind the momentum. And that is exactly what we're doing.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Thanks. I agree, I agree regarding the business model and the momentum in Q4 was definitely encouraging. I guess, just to help us with the modeling of all the moving parts on this, to that end, based on the capacity - from a capacity standpoint, you may talk about this at CAGNY, but can you give us a sense of where you plan to be by yearend 2018? And given the magnitude of incremental spending, how closely would you expect shipments to track relative to capacity? And, I guess, the last part is you've had 14% organic sales growth in the second half of the year, you're talking about 8% for 2018. Is that just your reflection of conservatism or can you help us think through any other big offsets that we should be thinking about?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. Look, we are explaining in detail the progress of capacity build in 2016 and 2017, because of the constraints. I think in 2018 we have to assume, unless we have some real explosion of IQOS sales somewhere that we were not bound by capacity constraints in 2018, okay? So I think that becomes less relevant going forward. Of course, we have to build capacity as volume grows. But - and we have an increase in capacity because the capital expenditure clearly is up compared to this year. But it should not something that should be worrying investors going forward, because I think we are ahead of the curve just now. So that's the first thing. The second thing clearly is - I gave a range and we gave a range of 7% to 10% EPS, despite all the investments, which I think it's pretty good growth. Clearly, the most - the biggest variable I think we will agree is the sales of IQOS, okay. I think the minimum I expect is 65%, around - increase rather than 60 billion plus, okay. But you appreciate we start, we have many markets that are open. There are some of there at the beginning. All markets have very good signs of growth. But it's very difficult to anticipate the speed and that will the variability and that's how we look at it. Now, to finish, to give you the other rules of thumb, we said that devices and you have some indication, will always be something between 25% to 30% of the revenue growth. And devices at the beginning of the journey, they are not bottom line accretive. I mean, actually we lose money on those, but that's for a very good reason. Over time, I hope we will get there. So that part does not really contribute to the bottom line at this stage. And it may sound volume - margin dilutive, but the thing is they're necessary investment in order to switch the smokers. And the rule of thumb is always what I gave last year, for every 1 billion of incremental HeatSticks sales you need to count rather 330,000, 350,000 units. So that gives you a little bit of color on how to calculate this thing. Now, sorry guys and ladies, I understand this is a bit more complicated than before, okay. So we'll try during CAGNY to give a bit more color on how to better calculate this thing. But I hope I helped.
Matthew Grainger: Yeah, that's definitely helpful. Thanks again, Andre.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Hi, guys, how are you?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hi, very good.
Owen Bennett: And a couple of questions please. First of all just on IQOS, it seems to be kind of really accelerating in Europe now. I'm just wondering if you could talk us through these dynamics a bit more, and what sort of market share you think it's doable in your - for fiscal year 2018, especially given the heightened investment? And I'd also be keen to hear what has changed in Italy to see the pickup in share there, which is encouraging. And then secondly, just coming back to the spending expectations, you talked about lowest spending on the combustible portfolio. Could you give any details on the areas of combustible? This reduced spending will be focused on what brands? And will it be local portfolio brands, et cetera? Thank you.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. I think, what is happening - and of course, what - as I said in my remarks, different markets get different amount of friction, so it takes a bit more time. I think, there are three things: first of all, we learned a lot during these last two years, I mean, we have to be very fair. There are many new things for us from much more consumer centric, marketing, logistics, call centers, coaches, you name it. But as we learn we deploy and apply the learnings. So that's the first thing. We are much more efficient in the way we approach smokers to convince them to switch, I think very understand better and better. And of course, as we work, there is more awareness. So at a certain stage all of these are conducive to higher market share and an acceleration in that number of smokers that switch to the product and the category. So it's not a surprise to me that we see acceleration and more. I will not venture a forecast of market shares here going forward. And I think Italy, as you mentioned is a very good example of a lot of patience, a lot of work, a lot of infrastructure in terms of the amount of coaches and training of the coaches. But now we start seeing results, and in some cities we are much higher than the national share. So all this is baked into the guidance. And hence as I said, the range is well, because the speed by which things are going, I cannot forecast. I wish, I had a crystal ball, but I don't precisely have it. But all - everything is moving in the right direction and upwards, so that's what we'll all be happy about it.
Owen Bennett: Good. Thanks. And just on the spending around the combustible portfolio?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes. Some of the - what we try to do is in every market is strike the right balance between what is necessary to maximize support for IQOS without clearly living around to our competitors on the existing portfolio. We also are much more focused in the number of new product introductions, we do in this market, because we have increased efficiency and focus, and actually we have much higher success rates by being much more focused, which is very good news. So we are not moving money out of the business unnecessarily, but clearly the feel for focus and our investment is on IQOS. But I don't see in the markets, where we have dual existence of the products, because I am not talking here, the markets where IQOS is not available like Indonesia, where we continue with normal investment in the business. In this markets, we don't see any negative on our existing portfolio in the country, but also focused us on consolidating as I said, morphing local brands into international brand, an increase overall efficiency. And that's how I would look at it.
Owen Bennett: Okay. Cool. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: Hi, how are you?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Good.
Judy Hong: So first, it just bit of a follow-up to Matt's question about revenue guidance for 2018. So I think based on the commentary around IQOS - the things like IQOS could contribute maybe about 10% of revenue growth. So I'm just wondering within that 8% plus revenue growth guidance, what are you expecting in terms of the combustible revenue sort of breaking out volume versus price?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. Clearly, we see a decline in the volume of combustible, both because of the secular decline, but also because of the switching to IQOS, okay. So the mix - and the volume mix there is going to be negative. Now I try to say this in my remarks is important to notice that the pricing variances that you will see going forward. I have two components, because of the way they work and I think it's important for everybody to understand. There is the combustible price increases, on which I think we have pretty strong power and nothing has lost there, the model is robust, and I will explain. However, as the allowances on the devices and sometimes other incentives we give for IQOS. For example, going against the pricing variance, the net variance is lower on what the combustible bringing. Assuming no price increases obviously on the IQOS HEETS. Okay. The second element is to give you an example of what happened in Korea, just to give some color. Okay. In Korea, we had a higher net ex-factory price, there was a tax increase, the net ex-factory price during 2017 went down. The way you report variances is that you take this difference of the lower net ex-factory price, but we multiplied by the volume projected in the current year. And that variance maybe heartbeat in the hundreds of millions, but it's nothing dramatic, because you didn't have this business before. So it's not the current model, where we have a price variances as real price variances, it's just a little bit. I wouldn't say hypothetical, but it's a bit theoretical. Okay. So if we take last year, we reported pricing variance of 5.2%, but if I exclude the allowances on the devices will be in the range of 5.8%, 5.9%, which is not different with the price variance we had in combustibles in the past. And next and that is despite the fact that we didn't have real pricing in Russia. So next year is going to be higher, so nothing is broken in the model, just for you to understand, okay. I don't have if I am helpful.
Judy Hong: I guess the 6% you're referring to the consolidated pricing variance for IQOS and combustibles, right?
Andre Calantzopoulos: It's 5.2% this year we reported, okay. So that's consolidated, if I deconsolidate 5.9% is combustible and the negative is coming from the allowances on the devices and other incentives, okay. And obviously, this is going to increase next year, the allowances. But as I said, if you take combustible to combustible comparison is going to be higher next year compared to this year, okay. If that makes sense to you.
Judy Hong: Yes. That makes sense.
Andre Calantzopoulos: To 2018 versus 2017. What did I say? I was in 2017. I'm sorry. I missed the chronology.
Judy Hong: All right. I think, I guess that. Just separately into Japan, so first on IQOS, it sounds like, if you kind of look at the retail market share performance and your shipment figures there is sort of a $12 billion or so in terms of additional shipments in 2017 related to favorable inventory movement. And I think the way, we should model this is the space in the base, and so we are not going to see an adverse impact in 2018. So I just wanted to clarify that number one. And number two, JT's view of the total market decline in 2018 seems pretty sizeable. So I'm just wondering what you're thinking in terms of the combustible pass the HeatSticks volume outlook for Japan, if there is anything changing from a secular perspective that you see.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yeah. I look, we have to build these inventories, for the reasons I explain. So I don't see this decreasing. If I see anything at the volume goes up and it has to be adjusted, obviously, upwards overtime. I'm talking our HeatSticks inventory. Obviously, we have reduced the combustible inventory to reflect the volumes of combustibles going down. And we will continue adjusting this during the year as it unfolds. So that's to answer your first question. The second one is, look, we have own projection for total market in Japan, including obviously HeatSticks, and there is nothing in the horizon that would affect - that would goes any change in what happened in the previous years. Now we are now various discussions about an excise tax increase in Japan towards the end of the year. But this will be implemented, if anything in October. And I don't think, it will affect particularly 2018 and we have more effects in 2019, okay.
Judy Hong: Yeah, got it. Okay. And then just finally, Andre, I understand your comment about the TPSAC recommendation, not binding and it's more advisory nature as we think about the modified risk application. But I am just wondering if that is affecting sort of your conversations with other governments as you discussed tax structures and regulations. I think some of the headlines talking about the recommendation, potentially could be viewed as something that the other governments may considering, so I am just wondering if that shape of the conversation is changing at all post the TPSAC meeting.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Well, I think we need to separate the regulatory discussions from fiscal, although, you're right, sometimes, they are related. I think, we see across the world very encouraging signs of various governments and agencies, embracing harm reduction through innovative products. I don't know, if I am right, there is in Public Health England report that is a clear endorsement of the new product, and talks about the harm reduction potential of electronic cigarette and of heated tobacco product. So there is an increasing movement, and faster than I expected in favor of the category. Okay. And despite - irrespective of TPSAC that I will come back, I think the policy announcement of the FDA is very clear, okay. That the new category has a very significant role to play in the policy of FDA. So even in countries you may refer to Korea potentially, but there were some discussion about excise taxes, I think they all recognize that this products are not cigarettes and they left open adjustments, and Martin can correct me here, because he was much more involved in this as President of Asia, open in revising the tax rates, if there is more evidence about the harm reduction potential of this product. So I don't think the dynamic here is changed, there will be some degree of volatility potentially, and I think the signs overall at very encouraging. Now, clearly there are some people of goodwill that take the discussion around the TPSAC out of context and you've seen titles saying FDA rejects IQOS MRTP, we all need to know that FDA has neither approved nor rejected anything. This is an ongoing process, okay. But clearly, outside the U.S., we are very attentive and we correct with governments and other people, when necessary to put the situation to the right context. But as you know, there are a lot of people out there, that would take any opportunity to discredit RRPs, because it is not in their interest. But I don't think that's a subject of our conversation today.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hi, good morning.
Chris Growe: Hi, I just had a question for you to follow a bit on Judy's question, and your response to her. I just want to think about the pricing and how that will flow through in the year. Is that right to think about, if we can separate combustibles from the totality of the company to think about 6% type pricing. As I think about it, your allowances are going to grow for IQOS and for devices. And the more your HeatSticks volume growth at least to this point you haven't taken much in the way of pricing against that, that would also likely way on that percentage of pricing. If I'm thinking about it the right way, is that the way to think about that?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes, except that as I said many times. We have to be very careful with the pricing of the RRPs. Because, there is always the right price in order to maximize speed of switching. Make sure that governments do understand that we are not greedy and trying to benefit from more favorable tax regimes. Not making them too cheap, because that also worries some in terms of unintended use by young people and that balance and also making them available over time, so our portfolio of products to all people in any country. As I said initially, I think it's the right approach to make innovation rather premium, because that's more credible, and we've seen that this is correct. We also try as you know IQOS not at the premium segment, but in mid-price segments in certain places. We, frankly speaking, don't see any difference in the speed of conversion at the initial stages, because that's not the biggest consideration. But over time, we need to offer smokers a variety of products at different price. And as I explained as we have new versions also of IQOS coming on stream over time, we may decide to keep some devices and variance at a lower price, and some of the higher. So we have access to a larger part of the smoking population. At the same time, we also fulfill our promise that will give the product to as many people as possible. We also need to know that as we gain economies of scale, the cost of the devices themselves is going down. Already this year, we see a decrease, but if I take to where we started kind of commercial production to today, we have 15% to 20% reduction in the cost, which you may decide to pass-on the consumers are not over time. So there are number of variables in here and the same you'll see on the HeatSticks as we gain experience and more efficiency in our production. So these are on the positive side, but we cannot put them all in the pocket in 2018. But I think these benefits coming on more and more in the years to come.
Chris Growe: Okay. That was good. Thank you for that. And then, just a question for you on strategy behind IQOS for 2018. Is your goal to get into the most markets you can or to be deeper into your existing markets. And if I could also ask like how do you factor in Platform 2, for example, on the expansion of that product throughout the year, is that factor into your assumptions?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes. I think for 2018, our priorities to focus and go deeper into the existing markets. It doesn't preclude us from opening new markets, it make strategic sense, okay. But I would rather put more effort and go deeper in the existing markets rather than expanding more. And I think that makes sense, because we are in a sufficient number of markets now, okay. So I don't know if I answer your question on this if it's clear.
Chris Growe: That is clear. And just is Platform 2, is that like a meaningful contributor, I guess, the way to ask that for 2018? Is that just something still fully developing?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Okay. We are just testing in a couple of places, we started in Dominican Republic, a small scale test, learn better about the product. I can't exclude we will do another few market tests, and - but I don't see any large expansion in 2018. As I said, we need to build the category understanding in the existing markets, get the momentum with IQOS and then we can envisage all these things in the years after. Now bearing in mind that as we add platforms to our infrastructure, clearly, they are not incremental, because the infrastructure can support all the other platforms, the retail shops, the coaches everything, so - but as I said, our job this year is focus and that's what we are going to do.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, Andre.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hey, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to go back to TPSAC in the comments and get a sense from you about the potential timing of when, you are expecting the FDA to, I guess, approve hopefully your PMTA for IQOS? Just trying to get a sense of when that could happen?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Well, the short answer is, I don't know exactly. There is a statutory time that points to the first quarter, but it's up to the FDA to decide, okay. I have no indication from the FDA, or when they will take a decision, okay. And then for the MRTP clearly, we know this is a one year, but they can stop the clock at any time. As I said in my remarks, we will - we have now the results of the first six months of the long-term exposure response study that our final reports are written and as soon as we have them, we'll submit them to the FDA, latest May this year. And I think that will - this study will answer some of the questions that are raised also on the TPSAC, okay. So we will see how this goes. And as I said, we stand ready to continue working with the agencies in order to answer any questions they may have, so that we help them with the final approval. As we are seeing from the TPSAC there was - because I think overall the TPSAC was encouraging, and I think the dialogue, as you've seen was very cordial and with a lot of respect to our people. I think, it's a great job. There was some questions raised regarding in particular the specific margin or how you communicate this products to consumers. But I think, can be addressed. So we'll see how we deal with this - with the agency. But the process is ongoing.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Understood. And then on IQOS, you touched on this a little bit, but curious as you step up spending behind IQOS, can you give us a sense of how long it is taking to convert a consumer from combustibles cigs to IQOS? And is that conversion process shortening as either you're getting better at it or word of mouth is increasing? And then should we anticipate that the stepped-up spending this year will be evenly spread throughout the year or will it be more first-half weighted.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Obviously, as the product becomes more visible, the word of mouth is helping. Okay. So the effort initially is not different, because you need to contact people, and you need coaches to take them through. And, sorry, it takes the initially the initial two to three to four weeks for every person to fully switch. Okay. But if I - and as I said, it also depends on the restrictions we have in the market. Now, if I take - what we are doing also is implementing digital tools, so that some of the consumer explanations and let's call it handholding during their conversion period can be done digitally and not by physical coaches, which clearly can both accelerate the number of people and reduce costs. And that to certain degree recollected in our current projection. Now, if I take market like Korea for example, the amount of coaches we used compared to the market share we have is much lower than what we had in Italy for example. That's also because there was already a high awareness and comprehension of the product because of Japan. So it went much faster. And I think this momentum will build over time. Also as we have more and more markets, for example, in Europe with sizeable share. But it's a bit early for me to take into the projection. So we have a more conservative probably approach to this for this year.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. But in terms of the spending, Andre, that you talked about you're stepping up.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Bonnie, I don't really know. I think it's evenly spread, but probably can somebody help me. There is a lot in the first quarter, because we are building infrastructure in Europe in particular and hence the results. But if you ask me how it goes by quarter, honestly, I don't know. I guess, the guys can find out and let you know.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. It'd be great. And then just a final question on competition in our RRPs and really how IQOS has performed. Again, you touched on this a bit, but I'm curious where competitor products had been introduced, curious to hear more about the consumer behavior in terms of trial of these competitive products, possible stickiness factors of IQOS and then what's been happening to the promotional activities to drive trial behind all of these new technologies and how much are you guys willing to step up spending to retain share?
Andre Calantzopoulos: First of all, I think it's a good thing that competitors are coming into the category because so far we were the only ones bearing all the cost of educating people about the category. And I think also from an overall public health perspective that's a great that is happening. Then I've always said that this is going to happen is welcome. I don't think that our spending just now is about defending our share against competitors, okay. It's much more about continuing to move people into the category. And I think after that, the better product and better ecosystem will always prevail. Okay. And this is what we're staying focused on or continuously upgrading the product that consumer experience the interaction we have with them through our call centers, coaches, retail shops, accessories we offer, so an experience ecosystem that brings the brand equity. Okay. And I don't think we change anything there, because we have competition. Obviously, we're not going to have 100% of the segment. That's pretty clear, but I think there is enough room for everybody. And as we've seen in Japan, despite everything and the limitations we had, even in Sendai, we have 67 something share of the segment despite the fact that all the competitors are there, and the whole category is constantly growing, and we're growing share. So I'm fairly optimistic and I think it's very good that others are in - are coming in. As I said, because we're bearing the whole burden on our own just now.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Thank you.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hey, Michael.
Michael Lavery: I'm wondering if you can just give us a sense of how you think about beyond 2018. I believe you've said before that you would revisit that and I'm not sure if that's still the plan or is there a time we could expect an update there or how you think about what some of the investments you're making this year can get you going forward.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes, I think we'd discussed this in our Investors Day in September if I'm not mistaken, Nick. As I said, a part of the cost that are in our base for this year are going - are not going to be incremental or by any means proportional to the volume growth in the years to come. And as we have fully converted people or fully switched people, clearly we should see the benefit next year. Also this year in the base for example, we have two elements, we also have the foundation that is going to be in the base of $80 million per year. And we also have the drag from the GCC that should abide by the yearend. So 2019 should be better in my view. And then we'll give you a bit more color about the thing going forward, bearing in mind all the uncertainty about, yeah, the volumes of IQOS and the speed of the category. But we'll do this towards the end of the year when I think we have a better reading than we had so far. Although I think as I said, things are going very much in the right direction and faster than I expected so.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, just back on TEEPS, with the Dominican Republic launch, it seems like that's certainly generally a lower priced market. Without that upfront cost for the device does that give you more flexibility and where that products - looks like it has opportunities relative to IQOS.
Andre Calantzopoulos: It's not a question of price, okay, at this stage. First of all, this is not a launch, just a test to understand - small scale test to understand how people use the product and gain the experience, okay. I think the TEEPS or Platform 2 can also address a category of more conservative consumers where - because the ritual closer and because all these electronics and all the hassle that's quite around this is lesser. That I think can attract much more conservative smokers. Yes, it gives you also a pricing flexibility, but frankly speaking, if we take the device, if you take it per day, it's probably $0.15 per day. So on a pack of cigarettes, even in developing market, it's not exactly an insurmountable amount of money, okay. Don't forget it lasts for 8,000 experiences and as the batteries get better it will last longer. So I think that we have this flexibility to go both directions. But for sure, there is a category of smokers that will feel much more comfortable with Platform 1 that they will feel with Platform 1. And I see much more impact there just on only pricing, using as a pricing proposition.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. First off, thank you so much for the incremental color around the first quarter. I think that will prove incredibly helpful. My first question also on IQOS of course is can you offer any updated views on kind of how you're seeing cannibalization in your portfolio with IQOS continuing to gain momentum. I'm thinking specifically about Japan, where it does look like the rate of Marlboro market share losses accelerated throughout the end of the year. Thank you.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Sorry.
Martin King: Vivien, you asked about cannibalization?
Vivien Azer: Yes, please.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Sorry. I think cannibalization rates are coming down over time, as obviously the product become more known. And if we take Japan or Korea it attracts smokers that switch, do it from different price categories and up-trading, okay. Clearly, as it is premium position it will always disproportionately attract people from the premium segment, not only because of price, but also because the most progressive smokers are in the premium segment typically, okay. So - but if we look at the initial cannibalization rates and where we are just now in Japan, if I'm not mistaken, Martin, they have come down quite substantially. We are still slightly above our market share.
Martin King: Just a few points above.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Just a few points above. They used to be 10, 15 points above our market shares. Okay.
Vivien Azer: Okay. Thank you. And then on to South Korea, could you add any commentary around the competitive landscape there given there is a third heat-not-burn player in that market? Thanks.
Andre Calantzopoulos: As you've seen from the last quarter, I mean, IQOS is booming is Korea. Now, KT&G announced their product and that - they don't have full national availability at this stage if I'm not mistaken. Maybe Martin can explain a bit better this.
Martin King: Yeah, KT&G is still selling through one C store chain. I'm sure they will expand it as their capacity becomes more available. And it's competition, as Andre said, it helps accelerate the overall category. And it comes down to the whole ecosystem. The quality of our product versus theirs. And we're confident that we have a great product.
Vivien Azer: Terrific. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: First of all, thank you very much. I realized time is going quickly. And thank you also to your openness. It really is appreciated. So my first question, can you just give us the latest CVS share in Japan? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Let me find this, Adam. Okay. National…
Adam Spielman: Please.
Andre Calantzopoulos: So it went from - if I take - I have the numbers here. July 2 was 12.8, 14.7 in October, 16.2 in December and 16.7 the third week of January. That's very - it continues increasing. Okay. Tokyo is faster and [for Qualco] [ph] faster, but we're around these numbers, okay.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you very much. That's very helpful. And the second question, I suppose, follows on from that. I think in answer to Matt, you said, you'd hope to do at least 60 billion of IQOS in 2018. And I was just wondering, should we think this main increment is equally balanced between Asia and Europe or do you see the incremental, it's twisted either to Asia or Europe?
Andre Calantzopoulos: In terms of absolute incremental, it's still Asia. In terms of percent incremental it's vastly more in Europe.
Adam Spielman: I was thinking in absolute terms.
Andre Calantzopoulos: In absolute it's still Asia. But…
Adam Spielman: This is - so it's really dependent on Japan and Korea and I guess any other markets you may choose to launch in is what you're saying.
Andre Calantzopoulos: But in Europe, it's a very big incremental.
Adam Spielman: In - as well. Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And my final question is around TPSAC. So the thing that really surprised me was the data that came out that the intent to purchase in the U.S. doesn't seem to be affected by any health claim. And I was wondering whether you think, whether the experience in other markets where you've tested shows that making a health claim on the packs, does that have any influence? Or is it the case that actually health claims are not what's important, what's really important is coaching and what you're doing already?
Andre Calantzopoulos: I mean, the experience is very simple. Smokers ask a very simple question, is this better than cigarettes for me and for the people around me? And the more clear you are in this answer, the more convincing you are and when people subsequently ask you what are the key reason to believe that if they are. But that's a fundamental question, okay. Now, it's pretty clear, based on the cultural characteristics of people and we should put as we said also the TPSAC, pre-market surveys are as good as they can be, but only post-market you can have actual understanding of how people behave, okay. What we see at them is in different countries people have different drivers. In Japan, the key driver is the perception that you convey to other people, okay. Much more than me and everybody who knows Japan understands their cultural difference. So, Japan, the fact was we could communicate that this is vastly better for the people around you was an important driver. It doesn't mean that the health is not an important driver as well for people. Now, the other thing that sometimes people in public do not understand is, first of all it's not about label on the pack, it's about what you tell people. Okay, and also, the fact that consumers that adopt the product talk about it. Okay. I mean, there are plenty of testimonials in Japan of people saying I feel much better. That has changed my life, and so on. So even if there is not an explicit health communication, people do experience a difference with the product. And that we should take into consideration and regulators need to understand that. I mean, this is how people behave in real life. So I think having the ability to say that this is better than cigarettes for you and the people around you is a fundamental importance and it's various importance in different cultures. It's more important in Europe for example than it is in Japan. And I don't think the U.S. is very different fundamentally from what we see in Europe, okay. And even within Europe, you see various degrees in various countries. All these things has to be much more granular. It depends on how you communicate to the individual person, because each person has different needs. That's what's called market and it's how you build the category. Okay.
Adam Spielman: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much indeed.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Oh, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually a couple of quick ones. Just out of interest, what do you think the total heated tobacco segment is within the Japanese market as in the fourth quarter?
Andre Calantzopoulos: How much, it is probably 16%, 17%?
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: What you said…
Andre Calantzopoulos: I would guess about 17% national, 18% - I'm not sure. I don't have the numbers.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: So you would compare that against the 13.9%, so you think the rest of the market is 3.1%.
Andre Calantzopoulos: Something like that.
Martin King: Yeah, I mean, in Sendai, we have the more or less two-thirds share. In the rest of the nation our SKU is higher because of the availability of the other products isn't completely nationwide. So that could be a good benchmark.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Okay. Okay. And just, secondly, the - in terms of the - I think at the - in terms of the Korean product, there was a sort of discussion about whether or not it broken any patents belonging to Philip Morris International. Is that something you can comment on? Is there any developments there or is that something that's not being pursued.
Andre Calantzopoulos: I would make a general comment here that we look at any - I think that we evaluate any competitive product and look at if there is any infringement to our IP. And we will act upon this. But I will not make any public comment further on this.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Okay. Just a question on Japan and IQOS then, just is the - was it fair to say that the vast majority of the IQOS HeatSticks sold are flavored, whether it'd be menthol or other flavor? What sort of - is that a very much an obvious dynamic within the marketplace?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Well, Japan has a very high proportion of menthol smokers, so it's natural to have a high proportion of menthol also in IQOS. It is higher than the average market. But, because…
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Is it the majority?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes, it is the majority. Okay. But it's also looking up where the smokers come from, okay. As I said, the more progressive and lighter smokers are also menthol smokers so you have this kind of combination. But, yes, it's menthol. It is not other flavors.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: And then is that experience the same in Europe or is that not the case? Do you find people switching across to menthol?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Yes, in Europe also you have kind of higher menthol than non-menthol compared to the relative markets. I think the key reason is very simple, okay, for people who move to the new category there is a taste difference obviously between IQOS and conventional cigarettes, partially, as I explained many times, comes from the fact that to reduce many of the toxicants. And some of the toxicants have flavor and nice smell, like formaldehydes and so on. So it's probably easier from time to time to move to a different taste category. But that's fine. I mean, there is nothing wrong with it. And whether they continue with non-menthol or menthol IQOS, the essential thing is to switch them to these products and that's exactly what we're doing.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Okay. Okay, all right. And just of interest, in terms of France, what - obviously, the French government seem to be sort of telling everybody there is going to just a €1 a pack price increase in March. Given the base for that, I mean, what do you think - is there any estimate you can give on sort of - is that something that you've taken into account and do you - what would you expect in terms of French volumes?
Andre Calantzopoulos: Well, as in many markets, in France our pricing is based on the same factors. It is what is the price productivity of a price increase, versus price gaps and versus volume impact overall in the market, okay? So in the situation of France, where we have a pretty significant increase, in our pricing, we try to balance the three elements and don't forget that France has a low-price productivity traditionally and on the new regime that has not improved. So that's why we try to balance now. Overall, I think there will be, given the size of - given the magnitude of the price increase, a reduction in overall volume, and unfortunately, an increase in illicit trade which the government seems to not have taken into consideration. But on the other side, we've gained market share in the past and I think we'll continue gaining some share. So, overall, we have baked all this in our guidance. But, yes, France will have an overall total market decline. Okay. That's inevitable.
Jonathan Stephen Leinster: Okay. Okay. Thanks very much. Cheers.
Andre Calantzopoulos: You're welcome.
Operator: And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to the management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you all for joining us today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the IR team. As a reminder, we will begin reporting results based on our new regional structure that Andre outlined in his remarks. As of the first quarter of 2018, we plan revise three years of historical data reflecting the new structure by the end of March. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Nick Rolli - Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management, and the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First, we’ll be talking about results for the third quarter of 2017 and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflects cigarettes and PMI’s heated tobacco units for those markets that have commercial sales of IQOS. A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer for the last time on our quarterly earnings calls. As I’m sure most of you know that he will be assuming the duties of Chief Operating Officer on January 1, 2018. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We’re pleased by our third quarter performance, notably reflecting very strong currency and financial result, including growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 11.2%; sequential improvement in our total shipment volume performance supported by both cigarettes and heated tobacco units; higher total international market, excluding China and the U. S., and the continued positive momentum for IQOS in all geographies, particularly Japan and Korea. However, industry wide dynamics in Saudi Arabia and Russia that we have flagged previously are putting pressure on our results and moderating our growth outlook for the year. In Saudi Arabia, the significant excise tax increase in June, which resulted in the doubling of retail prices, is currently driving higher than anticipated declines in cigarette industry volume, especially in the highly profitable premium segment where Marlboro is the leading brand. In Russia, cigarette industry volume is also softer than expected, while net pricing in the market remains constrained by the competitive environment. We are therefore revising our 2017 reported continue reported diluted EPS guidance to a range $4.75 to $4.80 at prevailing exchange rates. Our guidance also now includes approximately $0.17 of unfavorable currency compared to $0.14 previously due principally to Egyptian pound. Excluding currency and the favorable $0.04 tax item recorded in the first quarter, our guidance represents a growth rate of approximately 9% to 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. Our full year outlook continues to reflect a total shipment volume decline of around 3% at the low end of the 3% to 4% decline range that we expected earlier this year, as well as currency neutral net revenue growth of over 7%. We do however anticipate a moderate decline in our full year adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency. This primarily reflects the impact of the industry dynamics in Saudi and Russia, coupled with high investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS consistent with our last duration for a smoke free future. Additionally, for the fourth quarter, we estimate the positive currency variance on our reported diluted EPS at prevailing exchange rate. This is due to favorable comparison related to the Egyptian pound, which has an adverse transactional currency impact on our results in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to its significant devaluation versus the U. S. dollar. Let me now take you through our third quarter results in greater detail, beginning with our total shipment volume, which declined by 0.5%, 1.3% excluding inventory movements. The sequential improvement in our total volume decline, notably reflected heated tobacco volume growth driven by Japan and Korea, as well as cigarette volume grow in Indonesia and Pakistan coupled with a deceleration in the cigarette volume decline in the Philippines, one of our largest cigarette shipment volume markets. We expect total volume growth in the fourth quarter driven by heated tobacco units and despite the anticipated cigarette volume drive from Saudi Arabia where industry volume declined by over 30% in the third quarter, and should remain weak into 2018 and other gulf co-operation council markets, which are expected to implement a tax structure similar to that of Saudi Arabia. We recorded very strong currency neutral financial results in the quarter, building up on our sequential quarterly momentum in the first half of this year. Net revenues increased by 9%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales, notably in Japan as well as favorable pricing of our combustible tobacco portfolio. Adjusted OCI increased by 6.8%, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues, partly offset by the increased investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS, particularly in the new region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 11.2%, supporting year-to-date September growth of 7.1%. Please note that our third quarter financial results on a reported basis were impacted by the Egyptian pound, which depreciated by approximately 50% versus the U. S. dollar since the third quarter of 2016, based on average quarterly rate and contributed approximately $0.08 of the total $0.12 negative currency impact in our EPS. Thanks for the exceptional performance of IQOS, our third quarter net revenues for RRPs reached $947 million and accounted for nearly 30% of our total net revenues. Please keep in mind that the portion of this net revenues are from IQOS devices, which yield the negative margin due to introductory discount offered in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. While we remain in the early stages of our transformations to a smoke-free future, the size of our RRP net revenues confirms the exciting progress that we are already making on this journey. Our pricing variance of $309 million in the quarter reflects positive contributions from all four regions, and was driven by Asia and Latin America & Canada, in particular. Our September year-to-date pricing variance of $1.1 billion came despite essentially no net pricing in Russia. Turning to market share. We recorded a second straight quarter of strong sequential growth in our total international share, excluding China and the U.S., driven by both our cigarette and heated tobacco brands. Our international market share was also up slightly versus the third quarter of 2016. I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Total industry volume in the third quarter declined by 4.5%, in part due to estimated 2016 trade inventory movements related to the Tobacco Products Directive, mainly in Italy, France and the U.K. September year-to-date industry volume declined by 2.7%, consistent with our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%. Our regional market share, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, was essentially flat in the quarter. Share in Germany and Spain remained under some pressure, largely due to Marlboro’s move above round price points, which I have discussed in prior quarters. However, France and Poland recorded strong market share gains, driven by Marlboro and Chesterfield, respectively. Share in Italy increased slightly, driven by the strong growth of HEETS. We have now grown our share sequentially in Italy for three consecutive quarters. Regional adjusted OCI in the quarter declined by 7.6%, excluding currency, primarily reflecting higher investments behind the commercialization of IQOS. We expect a return to currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the fourth quarter, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume and a favorable cigarette industry volume comparison. Moving to Russia. Total industry volume declined by 7.9% in the quarter, due largely to the impact of further excise-tax driven price increases, as well as recent growth in illicit trade. For the full-year, we now anticipate a decline of around 7% compared to a range of 5% to 6% previously, mainly reflecting the growth in illicit trade and lower expected trade inventory movements at year end due to a shift in the planned 2018 excise tax increase from January to July. Our August quarter-to-date cigarette share increased by 40 basis points versus the same period last year. The growth was driven notably by Philip Morris, largely reflecting the successful portfolio consolidation of low-price local brands, as well as adult smoker downtrading in the market. Our quarter-to-date share also increased sequentially, growing by 10 basis points versus the second quarter. As noted earlier, net price realization in Russia is a challenge this year due to the ongoing competitive environment. In the Philippines, our profit growth continued in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher pricing. Importantly, price increases at the bottom of the market, albeit delayed, have further narrowed the price gaps of lower priced brands to Marlboro and Fortune. Marlboro, in particular, has benefited from the narrowing price gaps, which contributed to a share increase of 3.5 points for the brand in the quarter. While our total cigarette share declined by 2.4 points, it was up by 1.6 points versus the second quarter, reflecting share gains for both Marlboro and finally Fortune. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume in the third quarter grew by 6.5%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison related to inventory movements, mainly associated with the timing of Ramadan. Excluding this movement, industry volume was stable. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a cigarette industry decline of around 3%, due mainly to the soft economic environment and related pressure on consumer spending. Our cigarette market share declined by 60 basis points in the quarter due primarily to Sampoerna U and Sampoerna A, mainly reflecting the impact of price increases partly offset by the strong performance of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild. Share for Marlboro increased by 20 basis points, driven by the continued growth of our machine-made kretek Marlboro Filter Black offer, up by 1.7 points, following distribution expansion, partly offset by the decline of Marlboro in the whites segment. This was mainly due to its price increase above the round price point of 20,000 Rupiah per pack. In Japan, the spectacular performance of IQOS continues to drive our results. Our total market share increased by 5.3 points to 33.2% in the third quarter with HeatSticks up by 8.4 points to 11.9%. HeatSticks is currently our largest brand in Japan and the second-largest brand industry-wide. September year-to-date total industry volume decreased by 4.1%, excluding inventory movement, consistent with the secular decline range for cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS. Our retail off-take shares in Japan further highlight the success of IQOS, irrespective of geography and the presence of competitive smoke-free products. HeatSticks closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 14.6% nationally, up by 1.9 points versus last week of the second quarter, with share gains across all areas. Importantly, we are beginning to fully supply the Japanese market with HeatSticks and build normal inventory levels commensurate with the growth in demand, a process that we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. As part of this effort, we began the process of shifting our HeatSticks shipments to Japan from air freight to sea freight during the third quarter. However, we effectively remain supply-constrained in the market due to IQOS device capacity. This limitation should gradually ease over the coming months, in part due to the increasing contribution of devices from our second supplier. We expect to be able to fully supply the market with devices in early 2018 based on our current demand forecast. The current constraint on devices also reflects a growing number of consumers who choose to own multiple devices or who upgrade to the latest device model sooner than we had initially assumed. Turning to Korea, the exceptional early performance of IQOS continues. National market share for HEETS reached 2.5% in the quarter, despite a relatively limited distribution focusing on Seoul and other major cities. This success has been driven in large part by high IQOS awareness, which exceeded 50% among adult smokers nationally within just four months of launch. In fact, before IQOS was even launched in Korea, its awareness had reached around 20%. Another measure of the early success of IQOS in Korea is the high level of full and predominant conversion, which reached 83% in September. This is already above the 70% to 80% range generally observed in our more established IQOS launch markets. Looking now at some of our IQOS launch markets in the EU Region, we're approaching and even exceeding, in the case of Greece, a national market share of 1% with solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2016. As our weighted distribution in this market still only ranges from around 35% to 75%, this clearly implies higher shares within the areas where we are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts. Additionally, in all five markets presented on this slide, we increased our sequential market share compared to the second quarter. In EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada Region launch markets, where our focus remains more targeted such as those presented on this slide, we’re also pleased with our overall progress. With the exception of Spain where IQOS was only launched in the fourth quarter of 2016, we grew our focus area offtake share by at least 50 basis points in each market over the past year, and also increased our share sequentially compared to the second quarter. It is important to note that the positive momentum for IQOS outside Asia has been achieved despite the more challenging environment for building IQOS awareness and product comprehension among adult smokers, which is due largely to the stricter limitations on consumer communication. Furthermore, adult smokers outside Asia who purchase IQOS generally have similar high levels of product conversion. Turning now to shareholders returns. In September, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4.28 per share. This marked the tenth consecutive year in which PMI has increased its dividend, representing a total increase of 132.6% or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% since PMI became a public company in 2008. Before concluding, let me share a few comments on the management changes and new geographic segmentation, announced on September 28, which are intended to drive the Company's transformation towards a smoke-free future while maintaining its financial performance. These changes should enable faster decision-making and a greater focus on both parts of our business, i. e. combustible and the reduced risk product. Effective January 1, 2018, PMI will operate in six geographic regions, up from the current four, as you can see from the slides presented. A detailed split of the markets by region is included in the glossary of this presentation. We will begin reporting results based on the new regional structure as of the first quarter of 2018 and plan to provide three years of historical data, reflecting the new structure no later than our first-quarter earnings release in April next year. To conclude, we recorded very strong currency-neutral financial results in the quarter, supported by a sequential improvement in our total shipment volume performance. The strong momentum for IQOS continues. To-date, we have launched IQOS in key cities in 31 markets and more than 3.7 million adult consumers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. Our revised 2017 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding currency and the favorable tax item compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. This strong full-year outlook reflects currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7%. Finally, we remain focused on generously rewarding our shareholders with our robust cash flow. For the year, we continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion, and a capital expenditure of $1.6 billion. Thank you. And I will be happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Spielman from Citigroup.
Adam Spielman: And I have a couple of questions please. First of all, you’ve obviously seen good growth in Japan, but nonetheless slower growth than you saw in Q2. And I’m talking about the market share growing 190 basis quarter-on-quarter on the IMS basis versus 290 last quarter. And I was wondering is that entirely due to the fact that you have supply constraints on the devices. Or is it perhaps because your -- now should not as you grow growing market share is harder, or is it somewhat with the competition. That would be my first question.
Jacek Olczak: The largest weight on the supply of devices compound by fact that we observe more and more consumers, converted consumers who decided to own more than one device. But that obviously creates additional bottlenecks in those devices, which we shipped instead of going to the new consumers in July. I mean, they go to the existing consumers. Obviously, there is some impact of some competitive products. As you know, they are not nationally available. I’m very pleased that even in the places where they are available, I mean IQOS continues grow. As I said, our total highest weights to the device availability rather than our dynamic in the market, but you’re right to say Adam that the higher you are presumably it’s more difficult to grow. But I still would think we have quite the runway to deliver in Japan.
Adam Spielman: And then turning to Europe. One of the things that strikes me is the big contrasting growth rates between Europe and East Asia. And I was wondering if looking forward, there is anything that you can do to accelerated the growth or whether the strategy is to do what you’re continue to do, which is to grow market share but at a rate, which is much slower than in East Asia?
Jacek Olczak: I mean we wish to grow the market share of IQOS in Europe in the level, which we have in the Japan and Korea, just the operating environment is different. I mean the market in communication and the channels for the communications, which are available to us in Asian market, are not necessarily available are not available in Europe. So we are in discussions also with the regulators and we’re doing our efforts because it is mainly based on the one-to-one marketing in July. And obviously takes time. So, if I would compare the efforts to which we’re putting in place and the productivity of those efforts in Europe, they’re pretty high. Now, I know that we why are particular into company we’re excited about IQOS but I have with my experiencing in this company reflects the one thing. All European markets, despite the fact that some people may perceive the growth of IQOS to be a lower than I don’t expected in the Asia, are well ahead of any comparable product launch in a combustible category. So we know that we're pushing the right product in the market that we focus on a right product in a market. And there is no discussions that will continue with that. I think 2018 as you noticed Italy after some period of time is now crossing one share of the market, I think that 2018 in many markets in the Europe will be a turning point. But we just have to continue to stay focused in ways than what we’re seeing is working conversion rates from those who we approach who purchase device on a very high level. So I think it’s just the matter of the effort and the results are going to come, and there will be a tipping point or turning point in this markets where word of mouth would start playing much higher role to the extent as we observe in Japan and Korea.
Adam Spielman: And one final question from me. You said you will build inventory further in Q4. Really the question is when we’re looking at 2018, do you feel you need to build inventory of IQOS any further, or will you be comfortable if it is at the levels you want in East Asia, and in guess in Europe as well?
Jacek Olczak: We have highlighted this 2 billion little bit or more than 2 billion inventory movement essentially Japan, driven in Japan. This number contains as you might have figured it out yourself contain reduction of inventories on combustibles, because the volumes are going down. And bringing the inventories of IQOS to something that you will consider the sustainable level, which the moment where we start the low thinking of device capacity, et cetera, which allow us to continue supply the market without any disturbance. It is not a typical inventory build-up, which you have ahead of the launch and later on or next period, you take adjustment for -- I do not expect that the pipeline of inventory to Japan to the normal level, which would correspond to our anticipated demand for the product would have to be reversed in 2018. So this is not a classical think, which we had traditional, conventional business that is inventory movement to the positive in a one quarter or one period, we’re resulting in a payback period, negative payback periods in the next period. I do not expect this to happen with this one. So yes, we highlighting that we shipping the product ahead of IMS or will be market sales, but we need to build this inventories operation, we cannot run to normal operations and they should stay in our base also in a base of our revenue growth for 2018.
Adam Spielman: So you're going to actually be inventory build in '18, I think as we're seeing…
Jacek Olczak: We’re building inventory to the desired durations. And as you know, when your targeting duration is always the question of the forecasted future sales we know where the outlook for the demand is. And therefore, obviously, three months of inventory. For example, three months of inventory today in Japan is a much higher in absolute terms that the tree months of inventories year ago. And that obviously create optically or in fact creates the inventory moment, but essentially I'm just trying to keep the inventory, build the inventory to what we think is the right level. Taking into considerations that the product is subject to the surges in the demand much higher than any other launch new products in a conventional business, and bearing that in a mean time until we have a full capacity in other locations in Bologna that have to manage the risk of continue each of supplying the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: One or two just start with the combustible business. So arguably the competitive and pricing environment this year has been more challenging in some of your markets, like Russia and Germany. So just wanted to get your color just in terms of what you think is different this year, and how you are thinking about whether you need to really shift your strategy there?
Jacek Olczak: Purely on a pricing front, the biggest surprise to the negative unfortunately came from Russia. Like all the pricing for that launch in a year, net pricing, net manufacturers’ pricing just readily passing the January talks, came as a surprise. And due to the size of the market and our position in that market that clearly put their big pressure on our numbers. And I have to admit at the beginning of the year we knew that the pricing is getting a bit -- not as we already expect, but I admit that at the beginning of the year, we didn’t talk that it's going to last for deadlock. If you want to see a rainbow, maybe you will have to go for the rain. So I was saying it’s presumably should go well for the 2018 because the prices are moving slowly in Russia, so at least '18 should look much better versus ’17 as we have now. But Russia was clearly the only market on the pricing, which got reached took us by to the negative place to price. If I look at the German and a few other markets, if you’re referring to some delay in price increases et cetera, Judy, it was always like this. So this is not that I'm happy about it, but it's not something which is surprising. I have seen it -- so it’s a little bit of the normalcy in there. And then obviously this whole GCC in Saudi Arabia, in particular in the quarter, which is a mix of the prices went up so the industry platform is very heavy, very high target increase. But the market is reacting as is reacting to the 100% price increase. I think and many investors have underestimated or underappreciated the size of the GCC in terms of the volume, but also profitability. Saudi 2016 was a market of, if I remember correctly, around 32 billion units. PMI Philip Morris has about 41% share, Marlboro is half of 28%, actually more than a half of that is Marlboro there. Margins and this is where that you will see it -- margins in Saudi available of PMI average margins and clearly Marlboro is well above the Marlboro average PMI margins. And the market goes at least at this stage by 30 or more than 30% down that starts putting quite a significant pressure on our financial. I have to say it like this. We have, both at the beginning of the year this guidance of 9% to 12% EPS growth, and I know today that if not Saudi and Russia we would be flying well above 12%, well above 12%. Knowing what has happened to IQOS, which comes very strongly. If I wouldn’t have a Saudi and Russia we would be flying well above 12%.
Judy Hong: So then on IQOS, I mean, it seems like you’ve up the investments in EU pretty significantly year-to-date. I just wanted to get a sense of if IQOS profitability is tracking breakeven as you indicated before. And then as we think about the expansion plans in EU, how should we think about the phasing of some of these markets in terms of going to a fuller distribution and the ramp, and should be expected to see in that market in 2018?
Jacek Olczak: We have said that IQOS will be breakeven in 2017. And actually in the quarter, IQOS already contributed total PMI to the bottom line. So, as we’re actually going to do the better...
Judy Hong: Can you quantify how much?
Jacek Olczak: Judy, maybe one day I will, but I did not today. But we said that we breakeven, we essentially coming to the breakeven in Q2 about and a Q3 confirm that there is a net contributor to the bottom line, which is very handy, if you like, also from a perspective that we have this again Saudi and the Russia, Russia event. So despite the two severe adverse situations, we can still deliver, in my opinion, pretty strong result. There is one component when we talk about the investment in our IQOS. There was this component of devices. And we have been saying from the very beginning, if devices to some extent being inflating, if you like, our revenues, but we not make margins on the devices quite opposite. Devices alone are a drag on our margins. And if I would do the calculation and excluded devices from take last quarter Q3 results, my margin, my OCI margin would be up somewhere in the range of 80 basis points to 90 basis points. And what went on a one hand is a positive because if consumers are buying second device, it means that we’re really built better even loyalty of consumers to stay with IQOS, which is very good also versus the potential competitive and result bringing the market. But on the margins, it puts a little bit of pressure. As you know, as of mid of the year or second quarter of this year, we started to leave the prices of device and targeting about $110 worldwide, it will take us a time when the device price will go up in market. So, we’re trying to address. But obviously, devices will not be as accretive to our margin in the bottom line as HeatSticks or combustible products. We also have to be careful when we look at the numbers.
Judy Hong: And then my just last question in Korea. So I know there is post of vote this week on taking the IQOS tax up to 80% or 90% of the combustible. So I’m just curious, as you think about other markets and the discussions you’re having on the tax structure. Is the conversation shifting to there is a relative the risk difference and so there is some level of tax differential that the governments are pursuing? Or do you think that the current tax rate going up to this 80% or 90% eventually is actually little bit more disappointing?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we’re always weighing the opinion that the product whereas the different tax treatment in the combustible classical cigarettes. So, on a one hand yes I mean in Korea tries to move the tax up. I think they are recognizing that the product should have, should enjoy the different taxations than a combustible. So we’ll see where we lag. The decision is not final. But my understanding is that the product will have a real enjoy if you like a lower taxation with combustibles, which taking into consideration, the risk profile et cetera of this product is absolutely understandable from any aspects, public policy smokers, et cetera. So as you know in some countries, the tax differential is very attractive on RRPs or IQOS versus combustibles. I don’t think in a long, long term that level of a tax differential will be maintained, if stays perfect. But I do think that there will be -- that this product will enjoy a lower taxation within the conventional cigarette. Remember also is the growing understanding of a harm reducing principals, in which the product innovation plays the important role. Even the most recent FDA announcements squarely fit into this direction. And I would assume that the tax policies, as many other regulatory policies, will do differentiate both categories to the benefit of the reduced risk policy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So I just wanted to revisit the guidance change please. I very much appreciate your candor around the pricing development in Russia. It seems you’re going in expectations, as well as the big drags in the GCC. But since February, you’ve opted the 9% to 12% guidance. So it seems to me that perhaps there was another lever that you're hopping, like materialize, it’s been offset to justify something the high end. So if you could just comment please on your division to hold behind the guidance up until now, given that some of these negative factors that you called out were known over the course of the year.
Jacek Olczak: Well, if Russia pricing environment would improve faster or earlier, essentially would be squarely in our 9 to 12 or in the -- or then has to go to the 9 to 10. The Russia alone would clearly -- or shorter duration of this price situations in Russia is like, would keep us in the upper end of the guidance. I said before that GCC in Russia is this wouldn’t have happened this year, but would be well above 12%. I don’t want to quantify this one, but I'm not talking 10 or 20 basis points, we will be flying about 12%. Assuming that IQOS obviously stays as is, which is coming strongly -- is coming very strongly. So as I said, it’s very handy on the one hand that we have this great performance of IQOS, and it is coming at the moment when we have to somehow mitigate financially, if you like, the pressures which will have this year in Russia and Saudi. Saudi will continue at least from the annualization perspective for that next year. We’ll have to see where the markets stabilize. They have some other part of the GCC of the Gulf operation council countries to change excise, the way it’s changing now in October. But Saudi alone is a 65% and profitability is even more. So I think the biggest identified impact and a drag we already have there.
Vivien Azer: And then my next just on pricing more broadly, I fully appreciate the nuance around Russia, given the multi-year half change, which has been quite aggressive. But if I look at your business over the course of '17 with the exception of Latin America, it does look like on the combustibles business, price mix realization has decelerated across the board. And this is the harsh I guess from investors a lot in terms of different sustainability of the pricing model. So given that we’re seeing that decelerating price mix across a number of your geographies, I was just wondering if you can comment on the durability of the pricing model please.
Jacek Olczak: It’s just Russia is I would add to it normally would have, which should have been, if you like, there is a level of pricing in Russia now. Our pricing variance would be squarely in what we’re always saying, 6% and 6.5% actually. So that’s presumably we know that we are now below 6% and still pretty stronger price realization, is just the missing component of Russia. I mean it's all our countries. There are countries, which in effectiveness of a tax structure et cetera pricing is always a bit of a questionable, because it’s a big trade of between volumes and pricing, like Italy and France, for example. But there’s other -- the no known type of a market. Other than that, yes, I mean there were some delays in pricing in Germany. Frankly speaking, every time when we have over the last few years, has been taking prices in Germany they were always delays. So as I said earlier, it's not that it makes me happy but this is not surprising. I mean Russia I don’t think anybody achieved the success in Russia with what has happened in Russia is positive.
Vivien Azer: And my last question just on IQOS, specifically I'm looking at Germany and the reason I am focused on that market is just pretty much equitable were so good relative to other European market. It looks like perhaps you lost share on IQOS in Germany, if I'm reading the chart right. You had 60 basis points of share in the third quarter. I believe it was 80 basis points in the second?
Jacek Olczak: No, I don’t think we lost the share in any of this place. The only place which we have highlighted, which is going -- which has a growth but this is a very -- comparative other others small growth is Spain. But that’s a different thing. But Germany -- I mean Q3 the numbers were 0.6 for the quarter, 0.4 quarter before. So remember that we do not present really in Germany, we presented in a few cities, so the focus is there. I’ve been recently in Munich and I think the thing start working slowly. Germany is not -- I don’t want to offend anybody, not a fastest market in the world. They produce the fast, but things takes time in Germany. Therefore, I'm very much looking somewhere in euro that I can focus more on markets like Germany and others.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: So if I could go back to just to heated tobacco category in Japan, generally, as you talked a lot of device constraints and some of the limiting impacts that maybe having in the short-term on progression of market share, which regardless is still very good. Could you -- I know this is a difficult topic to elaborate on. But could you give us any observations you have about the interaction between IQOS and competitive products that are launching in the market? I think it's clear that it hasn’t stopped your progression, but I’m sure that consumers want to sample the various products that come out. Are you getting meaningful observations from consumer who are using IQOS and one of the peer products? And then making that decision, potentially using them in a dual manner or switching back to IQOS fully? Just in any context you can share on that?
Jacek Olczak: Well, there’re obviously some interactions from IQOS users with competitive products and vice versa as they cannot especially and they cannot buy IQOS. The feedback we’re receiving is that the taste wise and overall experience and the taste is very important, because people using a product for a satisfaction and satisfaction is stage. IQOS seems to come very strongly. So at this stage, to be very frank with you, I’m not that much worried about the competitive offering here. But obviously, there always will be a trial in new category and why people should believe one product presentations in a category, other products are in the categories, we always will have the trial -- trying the other propositions. But nothing really which would disturb me at this stage. As is innovation, we are working also on further improvements of our products and I guess competitors is exactly focused on the same aspect. So, the game is over. So far we’re winning and I hope we will continue winning.
Matthew Grainger: And just with respect to share repurchase and the dividend increase, you just put into effect. Could you just give us an update on how you’re thinking about the potential for repurchases next year? I mean, currency at least on our estimates looks pretty much neutral and my sense is that you’ve always been hoping that it would swing in a more positive direction before you would feel very comfortable pursuing repurchases. But given good earnings momentum and the fact that it doesn’t appear to be a headwind next year, does that make you more optimistic about the prospect of reinstituting a bit of buyback?
Jacek Olczak: I think our focus will continue to be on the dividend, even at the times when our balance sheet was or is under pressure. We’re still under pressure. We still haven’t recovered where we should recover for -- to be in line with our prescribed ratios coming from credit ratings. I don’t think in the near-term we will get back to the buyback unless there is a sudden reverse on the currency. There are currencies we have to come each time positive to us, I would have to be in the times of a better weak dollar that we would recover fully the desired balance sheet trends and start thinking how to deploy the cash to our shareholders in other forms than just dividends. So I think our focus will remain on the dividend and reward shareholders for the dividend, hopefully dividend growth.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. I think that’s pretty clear. Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of your thinking on IQOS spending. Has that increased? And specifically, I’m curious if that’s part of the guidance adjustment? Or since you held your revenue guidance for same, is it just your guidance is maybe -- it doesn’t have an upper end, it’s open ended. So, is it just that you’re closer to 7% than you were previously? Or is it that you've kept the revenue guidance, seen the weakness in Russia and Saudi Arabia, but you’ve got an offset somewhere else that’s lower margin. What’s the right way to reconcile all those pieces?
Jacek Olczak: Well, definitely we’ll deliver revenue about 7%, and the upper end of the guidance always is on the revenues alike. It’s always a factor how many devices we’ll be able to ship and how many HeatSticks we’ll be able to ship et cetera. I think we have a good view now on what's going to happen to the volumes and the price in Russia GCC et cetera. So it’s just on this one. Remember I think was a quarter or two quarters ago, I said that we're approaching a time when we have up 7% in revenue and I do hope and actually I think it will become a new norm for PMI. So as a mix of the volume growth and the pricing growth, I think is a good quality top line growth, which the Company is capable, is able to offer now. And obviously, we’ll be may be much higher that seven in this quarter was -- you could see the quarter revenue growth even if I was to be very aggressive and adjust the entire revenue growth by the growth, by contribution of devices, which as I said earlier answering one of the questions are drag on the margins, at least at this stage. I still would be well above our past target, if you like the 4% to 6%. The thing we approaching with PMI at the time this type of top line growth should become a -- not necessary on quarters, as you know very well, we never manage the business quarter-to-quarter, we focus in the longer period of time. But I think this is what we can, when we can deliver what we can achieve.
Michael Lavery: And just on IQOS marketing investment spend piece of it. Is that incrementally a higher number or is that -- are your plans there pretty much the same as they were and it’s just the…
Jacek Olczak: Higher than last year, obviously, we're not increasing versus what we've planned for this year. We’re just implementing the plans. There is this variable component, as I mentioned earlier. We've seen that investment, one should also count that the devices if you like or some loss on the devices and that’s a variable component because consumers decides to buy more devices than one per person and obviously, somehow increases the investment. But as I said, we're working for the pricing in our schemes will address it. But on the other hand, we're essentially -- we have first manifestation of the loyalty of the consumers, because while consumers will buy will purchase more than one device if they are not sure to stay with that product within a category. So I would read it very positively for the future periods. And that’s -- this means that we have a consumer and the consumer is happy with the proposition. As you know, we're rolling out new versions of the devices. I think this will become a norm that every period or so, there will be additional devices. There was a growing demand for accessories for the personalization, et cetera. I think that Japan obviously will be on the forefront because there is a larger at this stage consumer groups to serve. So there will be other revenue and hopefully also margin from the big opportunities which are ahead of us. So the things which are coming a little bit faster than expected and may put some pressure, again this multiple device ownership this year with the negative margin finally. And we take a bit of a pressure, but I think it's very good for the next period.
Michael Lavery: And just back on -- you've touched on how you have been able to get enough capacity to stop building the inventory in Japan, and save on the air freight. But do you still expect to be capacity constrained through this year? And if so, obviously, then that would mean…
Jacek Olczak: On a fixed states we should now, if you remember, we have targeted year end installed capacity 50 billion, and now with the latest plans and the installations, et cetera, I think we should be above the 60 billion here at the install. So we’re already lifting the numbers. We’ll update in the investors community in February, or what is outlook for the capacity for next year. As we’re still locking in some plans, but that I think, on the HeatStick side, we start getting comfortable. Device I think as of this quarter, as of last or the fourth quarter, we should also be okay. We activated the second supplier, which offer is as even bigger capacity than the first one. So I think as of beginning of next year, assuming our forecast for demand is what we have decide, I think we should be -- we should have a first year of the start of a normal operations when it comes to the supply side of the equation.
Michael Lavery: Just one on Indonesia, your competitor JP obviously is making up bigger push there with an acquisition. Does that impact any of your thinking on what some of the competitive risks in that market might be?
Jacek Olczak: I kind of think, you mean Philippines, right or JP?
Michael Lavery: Well, Indonesia specifically where big part of distributor and…
Jacek Olczak: Okay. But I don’t think that -- well, I am not saying acquisition. I'm just saying that I don’t think it's going to drastically change the dynamic in Indonesia. Philippines yes, actually so the positive happens to be also JP. So my focus in more on the Philippines than in JP and Indonesia.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: A lot has already been asked and discussed, especially regarding the stepped up spending behind IQOS. But I guess I wanted to go back to something you mentioned in your prepared remarks in terms of the required higher consumer spend to increase awareness. I'm trying to understand why this might be different in some of the markets you’re pushing deeper in versus some of your more established IQOS markets.
Jacek Olczak: Because not in all markets we can say what we know about IQOS and what I think we should say to consumers that they have an access to the full information what this program does versus combustible cigarette. As you know, these regulations -- regulation is always a somehow retroactive, if you think, if you like in a sense that it’s difficult to regulate the things, which are not in the market. They are in the market and then a regulators start thinking what to do. So we’re not operating in the regimes where it’s clear we recognize that this is a heated versus combustible tobacco product. And therefore we can make X, Y, Z type of claims. So we have to somehow adjust to the local market regulations conditions, et cetera. We know very well that consumers could switch to IQOS, who adopt the IQOS, pretty quickly and they experienced. If they fully switch out of the conventional cigarette, they’ll realize the benefit of switching to the product. I mean the symptoms, which they experience, are very much similar to those who have quit smoking, so they all positive. So this is the word of mouth consumers talked about the things, but this obviously takes a bit more time. The second thing is that in different markets, you have a different marketing channel still open, being the communication channels where I can advertise when I can talk to consumers, et cetera. Some markets we only -- I give it a example of Germany. In Germany, we can use outdoor but very few things we can say on this outdoors by regulations. So I think there will be some development soon. But for a time being, we are little bit restricted. In Italy, theoretically, we can say more things or practically we can say more things. But I don’t have outdoor or print and we essentially restricted to the communications in the tobacco. The tobacco this is nothing else than the convenience store when the people are coming for 20-30 seconds transaction time. So all of this markets each of them has a different type of challenges and we have to adjust our structures and infrastructure in this market to take the battle. And as I said earlier, essentially with the consumer one-by-one knowing that there is consumer number X, which will be a tipping point and then the whole thing will create a snowball effect, which we have created in Japan or very fast actually in Korea.
Bonnie Herzog: And then just a final couple of quick questions on Japan. I guess first, could you update us on how the new HeatStick variance you introduced into the market outperforming. And do you anticipate more introductions? And then on your combustible business, could you give us an update on the price increase and how you expect that to play out for the remainder of the year in that market? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: The new variant, the menthol with the flavor, I mean it was very well received. As we producing -- we're shipping what we’re selling was we produced. So is also behind. There is obviously some, if you like, internal cannibalizations and now in the presence of more variance consumer are switching from other variants. Variant is responding that face variant is responding through some taste preferences, which were existing or exist in a combustible business. So we will try in some markets to -- there was an important segment in terms of taste segment preferences, we’ll try to cater to this need. But so far is essentially Japan. And with regards to pricing in Japan, well you know the history, right. We tried we ended up with a Marlboro price increase. And I guess for the New Year time, it’s going to stay unless there are some changes around the taxations in Japan. But I think for the long -- for the first time in a long history PMI in Japan, we’re frankly speaking Japan is missing nothing in terms of generating the growth of OCI in a current situation. Thanks to the fabulous volume performance. We’re frankly speaking and we have a phenomenal OCI growth in Japan and somehow pricing. If it comes it would be nice cherry on the cake. We obviously know our positions on the pricing in the market. But what was always the bottleneck in Japan that you cannot grow the market without the pricing. We actually found the solution that you can grow the profitability in the market absent the pricing, which normally should have happened but it’s not taking place.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: So just a quick question for you. As you think about number you gave 60 billion sticks available, HeatSticks available, at the end of the year and that growing through 2018. I just wanted to understand how we should about launches for IQOS in other markets, particularly in Europe where you’ve got a base, if you will, for the product. And I guess related to that, how do we think about platform two and when that made launch or may this go through test market?
Jacek Olczak: Platform probably start in the second -- platform will go to the test market this year, but we still have not announced where we're going to do it. The 60 billion or about 60 billion is a year-end annualized capacity. So with nothing on the capacity for next year, which obviously is not the plan, 60 billion plus we already have in pocket. And obviously we adding the machinery and then activating the other factories in just Italy. We actually have the first shipment from production and shipment from Romania factory. So, I mean it goes as per planned. So as I said, we’ll update on the capacity in February. So there’s capacity, remember initially we targeted 100 billion year end 2018. And because now we will start the year with a higher capacity is obviously logical that the year-end installed capacity 2018 already will be lifted at least proportional.
Chris Growe: So think about from that standpoint with 15 billion sticks of availability in the fourth quarter. Is that sufficient to start a national launch in another market? Obviously you have Korea building as well here, so it’s larger…
Jacek Olczak: You will have the markets well I mean -- in all of this market, we always balance where is the right moment when we want to go national. And we tried to build a much bigger larger IQOS communities within a territory. And therefore as I said very often this national market share are not really reflecting the pockets in which we focus. And we have places in Italy, in Switzerland, in Germany, where locally if you like markets are 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% depends on the location. But this is how we want to build the whole thing before we start spreading the results is to thinly around -- across the broader geographies. If you look at the markets also, we started already some developing market, which is also very important in our strategy. I think on the chart we had Colombia, which came to the 1.4% market share in Q3, very strong start. So we will be in a number of geographies, trying to either open the market for the first time is was is starting with a one city, two city capital cities. And in cities where the market where we already presented with some cities to assess where which markets, we think this markets and already for the national expansions, taking into consideration also availability of the marketing channels, et cetera. So how labor and capital is like intensive, this might be for us to the next year. But I think what we have created through to 2017 is a very nice base of a market to select from for 2018 expansion plans. So I think this was our objective. And some markets may go full speed 2018, some will go 2019. We have now the luxury, if you like, of a choosing how we want to push the pedal there.
Chris Growe: And then just a quick follow up on your total cost in the quarter, constant currency were up pretty strongly by our estimate. Does that -- do you think that they will continue in the fourth quarter? And should that continue into 2018 as you consider more of these launches, and just more investment behind IQOS, in particular?
Jacek Olczak: There is investment behind IQOS remembering the total cost, you also have just the impact of IOQS, right. So on a purely COGS, due to cost on the COGS, due to cost. The cost will be flat, very marginally different, due to COGS. Now, if you take the volume impact, you will have a positive on combustibles because we produce less and you have a negative, if you like, on IQOS because we produce more. And actually that negative on IQOS offsets the positive on a convention.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Leinster with Berenberg.
Jon Leinster: Couple of questions, if I might. First of all, just a very specific one. In the Asia region in Q3 on the conventional business scale, PMI cost, to put the price mix in Q3 seems to be decelerated very sharply. So I can understand even with Russia and then so on so forth. But why is the price mix in Asia for the conventional business decelerated through sharpening at the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: It would be driven by Philippines on the volume, Australia on the volume mix, and the rest would be on that positive side. I'm just thinking what drove those CI and where were the variances coming from.
Jon Leinster: Assuming Philippine volume up, Australia volumes down?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, Australia is presumably is also the mix component. Philippines should be on the positive need because Marlboro is nicely growing there, but volumes are lower. And I guess there was in Australia, if I remember, there might be some other smaller markets also there.
Jon Leinster: And if you’re constrained on the device side, does that mean on the HeatSticks side in the third quarter, you could have produced considerably more?
Jacek Olczak: On the HeatSticks side in the third quarter?
Jon Leinster: Well, it’s the same as you’re basically constrained by volumes, and you are saying that the constraint is on the device side. Does that therefore mean that you could have done well above just under 10 billion units?
Jacek Olczak: Not really, because the production is still ramping up. If I would take the year-to-date production versus what we have shipped, or sold if you like, I think the delta is literally couple of billion, I guess. So this is somewhere in the pipeline and the factory warehouse, et cetera. So now we’re shipping to, because now we start having some level of inventories in Japan. Japan is not much restricted on the HeatSticks sales. But obviously, they can supply the market with the HeatSticks, but if you don’t generate the new consumers because you have devices, that is becoming the bottleneck. So I guess as I said in Q1 I assume when the devices should be in the free supply and HeatSticks will have an inventory and will continue to be in a full supply, we should start seeing a first quarter of operations result in constraint on neither the device nor the HeatStick.
Jon Leinster: And also in discussion with platform two, I mean, the capacity that you’ve talked about the 100 billion or indeed more HeatSticks at the end of this year, $100 billion or more end of next year. Does that presumably a price to platform one or IQOS plus platform two is sort of made in the same way. Is that correct? And is that likely to be actually a meaningful number for platform two in ’18 or no?
Jacek Olczak: Well, to some extent, yes because there’re two processes in making HeatSticks, one is the tobacco processing that process is shared between platform one and platform two. So capacity can be shared when it comes to making the final product, the stick, the HeatSticks and the platform two will have to have different machinery. So partially, the capacity is within this numbers, partially capacity for the P2E within this number. But remember, we’ll go to the test market this year. We’ll learn, start to assume that we may need to modify something and then we’ll start thinking whether the right markets when we start launching the P2. So I don’t is that much of a issue for us in 2018 that will obviously have some capacity for 2018 then we’ll have to decide how we want to expand that capacity earmarked only for P2 going into 2019 beyond.
Jon Leinster: Just to be clear, if the capacity -- if P2 on the secondary side, can you see traditional conventional machines to produce the stick on the P2?
Jacek Olczak: No, the machinery line is different. We always were saying the concept of putting few components together and formula route, which is a cigarette or the HeatSticks is the same. Therefore, we’re trying to -- our objective is to do it as much as possible within existing facilities because we can use our people and the scale. And therefore, the learning curve is heavily picking up, but machine wise or CapEx wise, if you like, this will require a separate program, separate investment.
Jon Leinster: So, P2 picks up. We can expect another build out of capacity in different build out capacity?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, but I think we also have learned how to build the capacity on P1. So, once we build the first RRP factories, remember that the quality assurance processes are different than in combustibles, et cetera. So very likely that P2 will be produced somewhere along the P1. So I think there is a lot of part of investments, which were made behind the P1, will serve the P2. But that will require a separate dedicated equipment.
Jon Leinster: And lastly, just in the switch from air freight to sea freight particularly for IQOS. When it comes out factories sold, it goes presumably to PNS or whatever it is. And at that point, who gets the benefit of the lower costs of sea freight versus air freight. Is that margin benefit to you or is that the margin benefit to TNS or is it split somewhat?
Jacek Olczak: This is Philip Morris International Inc who take the full benefit of…
Jon Leinster: At the lower cost. Okay, fine…
Jacek Olczak: It’s us it’s just our cost because we cover the air freight. This doesn’t change anything on the revenue recognition, because always somehow like factories to warehouse, et cetera plus-minus. But this is always at the center of manufacturing. It technically creates, optically creates that higher inventories, which somebody was loading to at the beginning of this call today, because when I have air freight inventories, how long is the plane flight, is a flight from Italy to Japan. You could assume next day you have a cigarette on the other side. When I put the cigarettes on the boats on the ships and obviously you count the eight weeks or so of either inventory, revenues recognize, but inventories not as accessible to the market for further commercialization because it’s on water. So this is just a technicality of this thing. But as we’re trying to put the HeatSticks to the same model or operations models which we have combustible. There is a significant different in shipments and the sea shipments, air freight…
Jon Leinster: Yes. But who gets the benefit of the shifting in terms of…
Jacek Olczak: Yes, it’s all to us, it’s nothing to whoever distributes or anybody else in a supply chain.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question today will come from the line of Owen Bennett with Jefferies.
Owen Bennett: Hi guys. My questions has been asked. Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Okay, have a good day.
Nick Rolli: Well, thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR team here in Switzerland. Again, thank you again and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Philip Morris International's third quarter 2017 conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 second quarter results and you may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2017 and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and PMI's heated tobacco units for those markets that have commercial sales of IQOS. A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We are pleased by our performance in the second quarter, notably reflecting strong currency neutral financial results, including growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8.7%, sequential improvement in our total shipment volume declined compared to the first quarter, and market share growth for Marlboro across a broad range of geographies and continued positive momentum for IQOS, notably in Japan, but also across other launch markets. As announced this morning, we are revising for currency only our 2017 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to a range of $4.78 to $4.93. Our guidance now includes approximately $0.14 of unfavorable currency. Excluding currency and the favorable $0.04 tax item recorded in the first quarter, our guidance continues to represent the growth of approximately 9% to 12%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. As a reminder, we expect higher currency neutral growth in the second half of 2017, mainly reflecting increased heated tobacco unit shipment volume, partly offset by continued investment behind the commercialization of IQOS. The $0.06 increase in the unfavorable currency impacting on our guidance, as compared to our previous guidance on April 20, is due principally to the depreciation of the Japanese Yen and Russian Ruble versus the U.S. Dollar. Please note that the currency impact of the Yen depreciation relates to the unhedged portion of our 2017 forecast sales to Japan and is amplified by the strong performance of IQOS. Let me now take you through our second-quarter results in more detail, beginning with our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which declined by 5.0%. The decline was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in the Asia and EEMA regions. In Asia, this notably reflected a challenging consumer-spending environment in Indonesia, as well as ongoing declines of low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. In EEMA, this mainly reflected the impact of excise tax-driven price increases in Russia and an increase in illicit trade in Turkey. The decline was also due to lower volume in Saudi Arabia related to the introduction in June of an excise tax that resulted in the doubling of retail selling prices. In the case of Marlboro, the retail price increased by SAR 12 to reach SAR 24, or approximately $6.40 per pack. The cigarette volume decline was partly offset by the strong growth of our heated tobacco products principally in Japan, which increased by 5.2 billion units to reach 6.4 billion units in the quarter. As expected, we recorded a sequential improvement in our total volume decline during the second quarter, driven by favorable evolutions compared to the first quarter in three of our four Regions EU, EEMA, and Latin America & Canada. Excluding the negative impact on our volume performance of industry-wide trade inventory movements principally in Indonesia and Pakistan, the Asia Region would also have recorded a favorable evolution. For the full-year, we continue to anticipate a total shipment volume decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year. This reflects a further expected sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters, notably driven by the Asia Region with higher RRP volume and improved cigarette volume in markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. In Pakistan specifically, we expect the recent fiscal restructuring, which introduced a new excise tax tier for lower-priced products, to ease the pressure on cigarette industry volume from illicit trade over the balance of the year. We recorded strong currency-neutral results in the second quarter. Net revenues increased by 7%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales, notably in Japan, as well as favorable pricing. Adjusted OCI increased by 5.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues, partly offset by increased investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS, notably in the EU Region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 8.7%. Net revenues for our RRP portfolio reached $615 million or 8.9% of total net revenues, in the second quarter, continuing the strong sequential growth trend. As we have noted previously, a portion of our RRP net revenues are from IQOS devices, which yield a negative margin due to introductory discounts offered in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. For reference, IQOS devices contributed approximately 22% of our RRP net revenues in 2016. Underpinned by the strong growth outlook for RRPs, we now anticipate total currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7% this year. We recorded a pricing variance of $367 million in the second quarter, supported by all Regions. Our year-to-date June pricing variance of $775 million represents 6.1% of first half 2016 net revenues, this is despite no net pricing in Russia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Turning to market share, we recorded strong sequential growth in the second quarter, with our total international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 80 basis points to 27.6%. This growth was driven by both our cigarette and heated tobacco portfolios. Within the cigarette category, Marlboro's international share increased sequentially by 10 basis points to 9.6%. I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Total industry volume in the second quarter declined by 1%, with sequential improvement compared to the first quarter that included a higher recovery from illicit trade in Poland and a lower impact from the 10s pack ban in Italy. June year-to-date industry volume declined by 1.8%, slightly better than our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%. Our Regional market share was down by 20 basis points in the quarter mainly due to Germany, Italy, and Spain, partly offset by France and Poland. In Germany, the lower share largely reflected the combined impact of price increases in March this year, which for reference saw the per pack price of Marlboro and L&M increased by €0.30 to €6.30 and €5.90, respectively, as well as the later timing of competitors' price increases. In Italy and Spain, the lower shares reflected a continuation of the pressures related to Marlboro price points discussed last quarter, though it is worth highlighting that our shares for Marlboro in these markets increased by 40 and 20 basis points respectively, versus the first quarter. Regional adjusted OCI in the quarter declined by 3.7%, excluding currency, primarily reflecting higher investments behind the commercialization of IQOS. These investments are supporting the encouraging market and off take share trends in our launch markets, which I will cover later in the presentation. Moving to Russia, total industry volume declined by 6.2% in the quarter due primarily to the impact of excise tax-driven price increases. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline in the range of 5% to 6%. Our May quarter-to-date cigarette share increased slightly versus the same period last year, and continued the fairly stable sequential share performance of the past four quarters. Recently launched Philip Morris continues to grow share, reflecting the successful morphing of Optima and Apollo Soyuz, as well as adult smoker down trading in the market. While the industry volume decline and market share trends have been in line with expectations, our price realization is lower than anticipated due to increased competitive pricing. This is putting pressure on our ability to grow profitability in the market. In the Philippines, higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix, reflecting the strong performance of Marlboro, drove another quarter of profitability growth. While our cigarette share declined in the quarter, Marlboro's share increased by 3.8 points, driven by in-switching from lower-priced brands. Importantly, we are beginning to see a stabilization in our cigarette share, which increased by 20 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter. The cigarette industry volume decline rate moderated sequentially with a decline of 5.7% in the second quarter following a 15.3% decline in the prior quarter. As we look toward the balance of the year, we are encouraged by the combination of recent competitor price increases and lower competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This has led to a reduction in the price gaps between our portfolio, notably Fortune, and lower-priced competitor brands, enhancing the overall competitiveness of our portfolio particularly in the low and super-low price segments. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume in the second quarter was adversely impacted by three main factors: a challenging comparison, due largely to inventory movements mainly associated with the timing of Ramadan; above inflation tax-driven retail price increases; and the effect of higher utility prices on consumer spending. We now anticipate a decline of around 3% this year. Our cigarette market share declined by 60 basis points in the quarter, due mainly to the soft performance of our hand-rolled kretek portfolio. The decline was partly offset by Marlboro, reflecting the growth of Marlboro Filter Black in the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment, and the strong early performance of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild, a lighter-tasting machine-made kretek product that we launched in May. These two offerings are driving our growth in the overall machine-made kretek segment, the largest and fastest-growing product segment industry-wide. In Japan, the spectacular growth of HeatSticks continues to drive our results. The brand's shipments in the second quarter increased by 37% on a sequential basis to reach 5.7 billion units, accounting for over 40% of our total shipments in Japan. Total market share increased by 4.5 points to 32%, with HeatSticks up by 7.8 points to 10.0%. On a sequential basis, HeatSticks grew by an impressive 2.9 points versus last quarter. During the second quarter, we expanded the availability of two new HeatSticks variants, in the smooth taste and differentiated menthol taste segments respectively, and both are performing very well. Total industry volume declined by 3.2% excluding inventory movements, consistent with the secular decline rate for cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS. The strong performance of IQOS in Japan is further evidenced by our retail offtake shares, as seen on the slide. HeatSticks closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 12.7% nationally, up by 3.1 points versus the last week of the first quarter. This growth was achieved despite a continued cap on the number of IQOS devices supplied to the market, as well as the increasing presence of competitors' products in select geographies. Turning to the commercialization of IQOS more broadly, we have now launched IQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally, following city launches in Korea in May and the Czech Republic earlier this month. We are particularly pleased with the early performance in Korea, and last week announced increased distribution within Seoul, as well as further expansion into four additional cities. We remain on track to be in key cities or nationwide in a total of 30 to 35 markets by yearend, subject to capacity. Importantly, we continue to grow the national share of our heated tobacco portfolio sequentially in many of our early launch markets beyond Japan. For example, in Italy, Portugal and Romania, our national share increased to 0.6% or above in the second quarter. While we have expanded the weighted retail distribution of our heated tobacco portfolio across these markets, Japan remains, for the time being, the only market with national coverage, due to capacity constraints. In many of our more recent launch markets, we are recording positive sequential quarterly offtake share trends within the current focus areas, as seen on this slide. Our performance in Greece for example, has been particularly strong, reaching 2% share in the Athens region less than one year after launch. To conclude, our second-quarter results were robust, reflecting sequential improvements in total volume and market share compared to the first quarter. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter was strong, driven by the continued momentum of IQOS and favorable pricing. We now expect full-year currency-neutral net revenue growth of over 7% in 2017. Our 2017 EPS guidance, revised today for currency only, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12%, excluding currency and the favorable tax item, this compares to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. Finally, we remain focused on generously rewarding our shareholders with our robust cash flow. For the year, we continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion and capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. Thank you. And I'll be happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the name Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
Nicholas Rolli: Hello, Vivien.
Jacek Olczak: Hello, Vivien.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Patty Kanada: Hi, good morning. This is Patty…
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning, Bonnie.
Patty Kanada: Hi, this is Patty Kanada calling in for Bonnie. Just a quick question on South Korea, is there - could you give us a sense of what you've learnt so far with IQOS there in terms of conversation rates, cannibalization, any big surprises you could share? Are you feeling incrementally more or less optimistic about the replicability of the Japan model there?
Jacek Olczak: It's very early stages, but for reasons we are not talking about the market share et cetera. But I think first reaction of Korean smokers are much better than what we experienced at the same period when we entered Japan, largely much better. I guess, obviously, Korea benefits from the somehow cross-border growing awareness coming from Japan. So the grant at the consumer level really was a better prepared. But, I think Korea might equally or better surprise us in terms of the results in Japan. This would be my reading at this stage.
Patty Kanada: Okay. Just one quick follow-up on Japan pricing. Could you confirm that you applied to rise prices in September, and if so, would that be absent of any sort of tax increase, which I think is more typically the time that we see pricing?
Jacek Olczak: Finally, we have applied for the price increase of Marlboro and a conventional - the conventional cigarettes. And timing for the implementation is September this year. I'm not aware at this stage of any other competitor price changes in Japan.
Patty Kanada: Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning. Hi.
Nicholas Rolli: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: So, Jacek, a couple of questions first on your guidance. First, just in terms of thinking about your revenue growth guidance FX neutral, now you're expecting over 7%, but you haven't changed the earnings guidance FX neutral; so I just wanted to get a sense of why not higher in terms of earnings, even with higher revenue. And then, even the 7% revenue growth guidance seems somewhat conservative in the context of IQOS likely to really build much more contribution in the back half with the capacity ramping up. So just trying to get a sense of - I know you said over 7%, but kind of what sort of contribution from IQOS in the back half should we expect in terms of the revenue?
Jacek Olczak: Look, Judy, it all boils down to the available capacity, okay? I think we observe as we speak a better productivity from the installed machines. So we might be able to go beyond the 32 billion, which we had initially announced available capacity for this year. If this would happen, I mean, it clearly will be able to sell or to ship more. But I can say, look, if we have that product available and then we can actually do the revenue better than 7%. But at this stage, we'll just say that we will be about 7%. More precisely that number will be - I think we'll update it that outlook in Q3, as we will know so much really the productions we had capacity with them. When it comes to the one point lift in our revenue guidance if you like, and they're not lifting the guidance. I mean, we have a range, 9% to 12%, so this is pretty - or relatively broad territory. I have highlighted in my remarks that we actually have a pretty challenging situation from a pricing perspective in Russia, so we have to be relatively cautious on this one. Although, very recently it comes from good news from the fiscal authorities with regards on the view on the potential excise increase in 2018, which will not really or at all change the 2017, but gives us a better outlook for 2018. And we still have to see what is the total impact from this very high tax price increase in Saudi. Okay, and that's very much the Q2 - sorry, Q3, Q4 type of event, which we have in front of us. We'll see what we'll have. We're continuously investing behind the IQOS. As you could see, the growth rate in all geographies are very solid, very good, very encouraging. We opened recently Korea. We have a few other markets which we will have - very likely - we'll have to very likely put up the investment to support that revenue level, which these markets are generating now. We will see how we close. But I think it's a nice problem to have as long as we see the good quality of a top-line growth and you presumably notice that for the first time we're not only driving the revenue by pricing variance, but there is a pretty good contribution at the revenue level from a volume mix actually or product mix. So I think the quality very nicely comes to the top line. And I think it will one day also flow very nicely to the bottom line.
Judy Hong: Okay. And then, just - my second question is just in terms of thinking about IQOS and seeing particularly in the markets where obviously some of the competitive products have launched. So in Sendai in Japan, you obviously had a little bit more of a lead time in IQOS being in those markets before glo came in. In Korea, it sounds like you're going to have glo going in more quickly. Korea Tobacco talking about a competitive launch there too. So I'm just wondering from your perspective, just not having that much of a lead-time in those markets, do you think that that's going to curtail IQOS' performance? Or if you kind of look at markets in Japan, just the broader category expansion could be accelerated and so for IQOS could continue to grow. So how do you sort of think about the timing of some of these competitive launches now in some of the markets that could be sooner than what you saw in Japan?
Jacek Olczak: Look, I think that - we actually welcome the competitors entering the Heat-not-Burn category, because from a consumer awareness perspective, et cetera, it's actually going to be helpful other than us riding the - building the awareness of the category, the product, the brand in our own. We have been coexisting at least at the city-type basis, with competitors' product, the [GET product and the BET] [ph] product. You see the trajectory of - the growth trajectory of IQOS in these places, I mean, it's still pretty comfortable. But overall, I think it's actually not that bad, but the competitors also coming to the market and the general awareness of the product is - of the product categories - sorry - is growth. I mean, IQOS, it is early days. I mean, we'll have to look at the national expansion like here announced by the competitors in Japan. I mean, how it is going to change the dynamics in terms of the growth rates of IQOS. But at this stage, I think we feel pretty confident that consumer will - we will continue having a high conversion rate and very importantly higher stickiness rate to our proposition.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. And then just finally quickly on the hedging on the Yen, because it sounds like second quarter, the FX was a lot worse than many people had anticipated, so can you just give a sense of what happened in 2Q from a hedge perspective and where we are at this point?
Jacek Olczak: Well, at the beginning of the year, if I remember, we said that we will cover to the Yen for about 40%. We obviously brought up the hedge ratio higher to about 50%. But in the meantime, the cash flows and revenue from Japan start shooting higher also than we initially thought. So it's a little bit now of a moving target. So therefore, we have the exposure - we have this exposure, still uncovered exposure on Yen. But the Yen in Q2, just Q2, if I take the actual, right, the $0.11 which we had in the quarter, the Yen actually contributed to the negative only by $0.01. I think it's more what we think will be the cash flows and our hedge ratios going forward and it will value this at the spot rate. So this obviously changes the outlook, i.e., the guidance over $0.14. So, two currencies which moved us in this quarter were Euro by $0.04 and Egyptian pound over $0.04. And Egyptian pound is something which we need to pay attention, because we had the - last quarter of 2016 we had a quite big negative currency variance, despite the fact that the majority of the currencies were actually improving versus dollar. And these were the transactional losses, which we incurred on Egyptian pound. Now, Egyptian pound is relatively are pretty stable since then, after this massive devaluation. So at the current spot rate we should have a complete reversal of the negative variance on a currency line in Q4, which may lead to the - or it should lead the current spot rate to the situations that we will have some negative currency in Q3. And we should flip completely to the positive currency in Q4 and this blended will give us this $0.14, which we have announced today in the guidance.
Judy Hong: Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: Hi, good morning. Thanks, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Matthew.
Matthew Grainger: Thanks. I wanted to come back to the Russia pricing dynamic and sounds like this may continue for at least a few more months. Is that going to have any impact on your expectations for 6% combustible pricing for the year or any impacts on your ability to reach potentially the higher end of the EPS guidance range? And when we think about potential offsets in the P&L to help compensate for lower pricing there, do you have sufficient flexibility in other markets to compensate for that without having to make any changes in your RRP investment plans?
Jacek Olczak: Matthew, without going into specifically the pricing variance for the full year, which obviously Russia will wait, because now for the six months, two quarters, we essentially have no net pricing despite the fact that for the first two quarters PMI had about 6% pricing variance, but it's going to wait for the year. I'd rather focus that the pricing situation in Russia is, in fact, well factored in our net revenue outlook for the year by above 7%, this is probably trying to manage the situations, clearly it always have had not allow the pricing opportunity to take extra pricing in Russia, I mean, net revenue and pricing volumes correspondingly would be high. This is the situations in Russia today. To remember usually as of Q2, us, I guess, industry where even net positive start of a pricing situation in Russia, right, to generate tax increases pass on a little bit ahead was that back end of the year, the previous year, and the current year, and now we aimed in June, and my estimates are correct, industry and us are presumably few rubles maybe up to 5 rubles below the pass-on as of January this year. So actually the only pricing which we have in Russia today, is the fading out annualization of the past year, and you have no net pricing due to current year. But as I said, this is factored in at 7% higher revenue growth for us. That's the situation.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Thanks. And just in terms of the impact on the EPS outlook and where you might found that range, obviously you don't want pullback it all on standing behind IQOS in the broader RRP platforms. Are there - are you confidence that there is enough additional offsets in the combustible business maybe stronger profit performance in other combustible markets that could help compensate for that or its pricing doesn't come through, does that limit your ability to maybe get to the higher end of the 9% to 12% range?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean, the few factors which we have for the Q3 and Q4 ahead us. First, I think, we expect the correction of volumes in Indonesia due to the timing, right, because Indonesia along due to the timing of this inventory movements around Ramadan and et cetera, I guess our estimate is about 2 billion units in Indonesia, which we should see the payback of that in Q3. There is a bit lower growth in Indonesia compared to the last year, but pricing goes through the consumer is a bit softer than in past years. Philippines are going where we wanted Philippines to go. So that's - I wouldn't expect any surprises price gap's getting close. Marlboro performance well. I think we might also improve our competitive situation and profitability situations at the bottom end of the market, I think, Philippines should nicely be continue contributing. Indonesia, I said, should have a better second half of the year than the first half of the year. Pakistan a little help on the volumes, the Pakistan is not really the driver of the financial performance, but it's good to solve this problem. Russia, I don't think - I wouldn't count on any surprises on a pricing there on both sides. And the question mark is how consumers going to take this 100% of doubling the prices in Saudi, and they are still a few other GCC states, which as we understand also planned to increase the taxes between now and the year-end, so we'll have to see how this unfolds. The EU has a good strength both on the underlying volumes. Share is in a good shape is more the questions how much, we will report in terms of the investment behind than IQOS, which we may reach the sacrifice the profitability within EU for the sake of building the right revenue opportunity, which lies in front of IQOS in EU. This is how I will do. The range is 9% to 12%, how we - there was the reasons why we expanded that range, I think we will deliver in the range. That's clearly the report today we have to have. We have not revised the range, both the target EPS range probably 5% in currency. We will reach the high-end of the range. Look, I mean, the speculations we'll have to see.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Hopefully, Russia improves. And then can I just ask about plain packaging in France and the UK, UK is pretty recent, but France since beginning of the year. Can you just give us whatever observation you have at this point on consumer behavior and reaction what the impact has been on mix dynamics volumes? Has there been any shift in pricing dynamics in the super-low segment in the UK since May?
Jacek Olczak: I think, you guys, a little bit still early to talk about this. France is a few months longer with plain packaging. And I don't want to sound sarcastic, okay. But I remember when we had these discussions in Australia, a couple of years ago, the early quarters of implementation, there was the market share erosions and down trading, and people were trying to connect the dots between plain packaging, and what is happening in the market, which we were arguing that this is correlation of quotation at the best place. In France actually Marlboro grew share in the quarter by 60 basis points. This is the quarter post plain packaging implementation. And I am not implying discussed through of the plain packaging, I think this is the never argument for each the market dynamics at this in a short-term is nothing so there was the plain packaging implementation. We always - we are using this argument that the two things are somehow thought to relate. And actually my total share, if I recall the number correctly in a release. I think, we grew the share total PMI by almost one full 90 basis points, while doesn't seem there is a down trading in a market, doesn't seem that the premium brands or premium segments at this stage is impacted by plain packaging, but I won't to be surprised frankly speaking, that it would be.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Great. Thanks, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Michael.
Michael Lavery: Thanks. With the question earlier, you touched a little bit on some of the awareness boost that you get from having Japan right next door and some interaction there. Can you just talk a little bit about in other markets, how you're expanding for this year compares to what you had expected or thought that it would be. And related to that how much does national distribution really help in terms of just getting in front of many more people and helping the word of mouth or sort of network effect, and are you spending and need to offset not having national distribution in some markets in Europe, for example?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you. It's a very good question actually, because, yes, the national distribution would help in the building the momentum and growing the awareness on behalf of our international distribution requires the full availability of full capacity, okay, to meet very lightly searching demand. So reasons why we holding many of our markets essentially, all of our markets outside Japan for the city-type of territories, it's for the reasons that we'll create essentially on a manageable constraint on the supply chain. We are barely still until the end of this quarter. We are coping with Japan. The capacity should start this in Q3, Q4. But again, as we have highlighted through before over the - I mean the priorities to stabilize Japan from a supply chain perspective, okay. And we need to leave the quota for the devices, we also working on developing the second device suppliers. We will have a full flexibility on devices hopefully full flexibility of the HeatSticks volume for Japan. And then we can start leveraging the expanded distribution as the factor of increasing the awareness in our market. But you're absolutely spot on I your question. There is some correlations between broader availability of the product and the awareness. It's a little bit opportunity. But in territories, surely focused at the stages even this restricted part of the territories as much as obviously, one can restrict territory in a given market. In these restricted territories, the growth trajectory, acceptance, conversations are very positive. I mean, you see this on the chart which regularly update this performance on every market. There are differences between the markets. But they have one common denominator, they all have good offer, that's very encouraging for us. And with regards to spending, we will maintain high level of spending in Japan that's pretty obvious, but we are now serving, Japan summer this year will close by past 3 million consumers. So that's an obviously entails, so requires some support, which we have a link to do. And obviously building up, or preparing the rest of the market mainly, EU. You will see by the spending year-on-year in comparison behind IQOS in particular in the EU Region. Obviously, Korea will come in Asia. This is on the early stages so there will be investment, mainly at Korea.
Michael Lavery: Okay, yes. Thank you. And then just on Indonesia, certainly the machine-made kreteks have been gaining a lot of momentum, and you have typically been underrepresented there. How significant you think this Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild launch can be? And how do you see the portfolio evolving as far as where the consumer demand has been making shifts?
Jacek Olczak: It can be very significant. I mean, where we trying to compete on a full flavor pipe part of the machine-made and the lighter - or lighters, smoother part of that segment. It is a growing segment. I mean, this largely - fastest growing segment. We obviously - it's important segment for us, it's a building block of our continuous leadership in the market. So we will be very focused there. We also very pleased with the Marlboro trends to the kreteks segment, if you like. Very good results despite that there were some sort of cannibalization between Marlboro Whites and Marlboro - to Marlboro kretek combined Marlboro Fresh nicely grew this year. I think there is still a distribution expansion ahead of this brand. So despite that they are not in international wide availability, they're very nicely both the proposition already contributing to the overall share of the Indonesian market. So we are very pleased with this, and we'll continue focus on this. There will be some happening from time to time, which is very much around the pricing. There are some brands, which are sitting at around per pack price points. But we had it in the past. So this is sort of a cyclical type of a thing, and - but we'll focus to conclude the answering your questions, we'll focus on the machine-made segment going forward.
Michael Lavery: I think the Marlboro kretek launched about eight or nine months ago. And you said, it still has some distribution upside. How do you expect the distribution trajectory for Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild with that move a little more quickly or something similar?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I mean, we're building this distribution, will it go faster than Marlboro. It's hard to - for me to say now, but clearly, we have that expansion. The classical launch planned in Indonesia, with you start with x number of territories. You build that brand there, and then, you start going to a number of territories, pretty large market, right. So we don't have despite the fact that we think we have a pretty strong capability to deploy - deployment capability in Indonesia. We have the capability to have our Indonesia in one month or two months in terms of a national distribution.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
Christopher Growe: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Growe: Good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could first on the volume performance in the quarter, particularly also around the combustible volumes. Was this quarter in line with your expectations from like a - so the sequential progress you made in volume. There were some puts and takes this quarter, no doubt, but does this put you on track towards your progress towards that negative 3 to negative 4 for the year?
Jacek Olczak: No. It was IQOS could, I guess, by not better than we initially would have thought, but this is more the function of how much product we have available. So we just - which has essentially sold those [indiscernible] what we could. And on the combustible business, on the conventional business not much actually surprises. I mean, we knew that, we have that [indiscernible] but the timing in Indonesia. I have quantified this is roughly about $2 billion for us, but this what should see in Q3. So the Q3 should come stronger versus the Q3 last year. Pakistan, I think, authorities addressing this problem with illicit trade. They're trying to help addressing this problem with creation of this extra tax tier, it's very helpful. I mean, that come as a surprise, but the results volume-wise, I think should start growing Q3 and Q4. And we know that we expecting that tax increase in GCC. Okay, Saudi started - okay, it's a little bit of impact on Q2 volume. But we sometime - we've somehow been factoring this in our projection. So remember that during the first quarter earnings call, I said, that we expect the total combined volume for the year to be 2% to 3%. I think, I came that we might actually come - 3% to 4% and that we may come closer to the 3%, actually pretty sure we're going to come closer to the 3% based on what we have achieved in Q2, how we've seen our situations level for the Q3 and Q4.
Christopher Growe: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. When I think about - sorry, go ahead.
Jacek Olczak: Go on. Go on.
Christopher Growe: Just a question relation to your IQOS capacity, we know generally, which you have available for the year. How big of a step forward do you make in Q3, is this the quarter we are going to see a marked improvement in your capacity availability in the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: Well, Q4 is higher than Q2. But…
Christopher Growe: Thank you. Yes.
Jacek Olczak: And then Q4 will be higher than Q3.
Christopher Growe: Okay. Got you.
Jacek Olczak: But, look, it's - we're gaining - we're taking the benefits now of a better productivity. We can run the machine faster and we can install machine faster. So it's not necessary that we can accelerate the CapEx as such. But once the machine arrives at the factory, we can put them in a production much faster than the first groups of machines. So it's obvious gain on the timing of implementation. And clearly we have a gain that the factory people are doing the spectacular job with how well they start running this machines, and this is becoming material. So I have said as answer to the one of the previous questions, we will end up with the higher volume than a 32 billion. That's very clear to me. But at this stage, I wouldn't like to commit to this, because this is a productivity gains. So the calculation is a little bit more complicated. But for sure, we are going to end up with higher volume than 32 billion guaranteed.
Christopher Growe: Okay. Just to be clear, are there any markets where you'd have a national - you want to be national by the end of the year. Or it just a matter of the incremental capacity being used for incremental markets to get to those 30 to 35 markets?
Jacek Olczak: I think, we'll try to build the full - we'll have to unblock the supply chain for Japan first, which includes proper lifting hopefully the caps on the devices. We have on hand in Japan, onshore, the right inventory. So we can have smooth operations from the supply chain perspective in Japan. That's our objective number one. So most of the capacity will be - our priority on the capacity allocations would be for Japan. So I don't think we might be in a situation to push any market outside Japan for the national distribution. I don't think we'll be in the positions to do so. But then obviously is Korea, as I hinted, Korea started better than Japan, and we have to start factoring Korea in this calculations as well. So I think - so we will now go national outside Japan this year, like, 99% guarantee.
Christopher Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for you time and your color. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: Hi, can you hear me out?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi, guys. Sorry about that. So I did want to follow-up on IQOS, please. So my first question on Japan. We noticed some e-commerce activity on Amazon Prime is that something that you guys are pushing as an initiative? Because it creates a little bit of a disconnect for me when I hear that you guys are still capacity constraint?
Jacek Olczak: Look, this unavailability or not the full availability of the devices has created a lot of opportunities for our people, completely not related to Philip Morris, and I guess, this is from what you're referring to. So we have a number of e-commerce sites in a various number of places, not only in Japan, but outside Japan, with our devices somehow are being sold. And you know, Vivien, very well, we have a listed of $100 plus-minus the currency in different countries. And we ended up with devices being sold on this various e-commerce site at the prices of $600, $800 or even $1000. So that's the situation, until the moment when we completely lift the caps on the devices. And we will be in the - in ability to supply fully the market, we'll have all of these things. We have our online sales, our own online PMI sales in the different countries. You can go to the iqos.com, korea.com, et cetera. But we are not pushing this for the third party channel.
Vivien Azer: Great. Thanks for the clarification. My second question on IQOS development recognizing the bulk of the business is still coming out of Japan. But as you look beyond Japan, in some of these other markets, considering that you have made some adjustments to the product packaging and branding. Have you noticed any differences in terms of initial cannibalization now that you've deemphasized or in some cases, totally eliminated the Marlboro aspect of the HEETS branding?
Jacek Olczak: No, there is no correlation. Actually, where we're selling the product, there's a Marlboro and the Marlboro trademark in Japan or as HeatSticks from Marlboro in other places, which is the [Park, Dresden and other] [ph] places, there is no differences in cannibalization between the two geography.
Vivien Azer: Great. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: And you next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. So my first question is about IQOS is Europe. You said a couple of times that you're increasing the marketing there. But when I look at Slide 20 and Slide 21, I see sequentially the growth is slower. So it slowed a bit in Italy, in Switzerland, throughout the same in Portugal, but faster, I think in Romania, slowed in Germany, slowed in Greece in second quarter, slowed in Russia. But I just wondering, what I should make of that, particularly in light of the fact that you said that when you get to sort of 1% or 2%, or 3% market share we should expected to accelerate? So that would be my first question. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Good afternoon, Adam. Look, the territories which we are listing on the slide, okay, you have to look that we still very much focus depends on the country, on the cities, right, not even on the entire territories. If I give example of Switzerland, right, because presumably, might for some, look like a slowdown in the penetration of the growth of a market share. I mean, you have to really zoom what is happening in Geneva, Lausanne, Neuchatel and Zurich, I mean, a few places where we're really focused, okay. Some of these places, iQOS is already above 3% or 4%, some of the place, I think, is even closer to the 6%. Obviously, in this territory, altogether, including the villages, you have to look at the urbanization, non-urbanization of Switzerland, I mean, this turns to 0.9%. We're not worried about this at all. In every zooming territory in which we are, we have a good trajectory, and therefore, the investment is behind these markets to have a right base going forward, but also remember that we expanding our territories, which are not even in Europe, which are not even in this chart. That is obviously entails the additional spend. We don't read the chart in a way that - Greece, in my opinion, have a very spectacular growth rate, and we know that the Greece could have gone higher if we would allow Greece to expand broader. We're just focusing on what we focus. It's good that is relatively faster or slower, the famous 2%, 3% that which we think is the point from which the word of mouth et cetera, start to help.
Adam Spielman: So as I just to be clear, what you said about Switzerland, just zooming on that. But in Zurich and Geneva, we're accelerating up to, I don't know 3% or 4%. But nonetheless the rest of Switzerland is going backwards so fast that overall the market share has only gone up 10 bps on a nationwide basis?
Jacek Olczak: No. I am talking that the 42% weighted distribution on our Switzerland, but the real focus is on few cities. And obviously for the distributions, when you have a HeatSticks available in the stores, et cetera, there is not much of the IQOS sales shop - support, okay. The focus is in the big cities of relative to the size of Switzerland. And there, if I look at the readings, as I said, in the places like Lausanne, Geneva, few others, I mean, they pretty impressive. That is what I mean.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you. So moving onto the conventional business. In the past, you used to have a target of 46% top line growth. That's growth constant currency. This half, you've done minus 2%. You obviously said that it will accelerate a bit in the second half, helped by Indonesia, in particular, but also Philippines, for example. The question is, do you - are you happy enough with the way the combustible business is going? Do you feel that you are just happy to let it go, the current run-rate, so do you think you need a total increased investments there?
Jacek Olczak: No, we're happy with the progress we're making on the conventional business. I mean, you have to - there is a reason why we're talking about the total revenue line and the combined volumes, et cetera, because you'll have to now factor back to the combustible business, the volumes and the margins and the revenues which we are cannibalizing on the way, okay? So that's the job. Am I happy with the development of pricing in Russia? Clearly, not, okay. So it's - and am I happy that the consumer - are we happy that the consumer in Indonesia is a bit softer? I mean, obviously not. Am I happy that Mighty was not really playing fairly or faring the market? No. So we always will have the [indiscernible] the situation. But the way we love to handle that thing is actually we can grow the revenue or deliver the pricing value, for the six months of 6%, despite the fact that we had this clearer headwind that we can deliver the good quality, in my opinion, very good quality, in my opinion top-line growth of 7% or above for the full year, which is a nice mixing of the pricing and the volume rather than just the pricing with just the past [indiscernible]. I'm very pleased with this development. I mean, we're very much looking at the quality of the top-line growth. And you see this quarter, and revenue level at least, I mean, for the first time we're turning into positive volume type of a territory in terms of the contribution from IQOS.
Adam Spielman: And then very quickly, any comments on the Platform 4 test in Birmingham and do you have anything sort of new or specific you should say about the - I think it's going to be in 4Q that Platform 2 test that you're thinking about.
Jacek Olczak: The old platform as we said before, sorry the two and three before the year-end should go to the test market.
Adam Spielman: City test, yeah.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah, city test market and platform for the product growth is now hearing the comments of the feedback which we get from the consumers in Birmingham. And this is incorporating or incorporating this feedback into the next version of the product. This was the purpose of the test market. I think the MESH, we delivered on what we wanted to deliver. But also that has also to see what else we should add to the product in terms of the performance of that, try to address what are the consumer needs. But that's the part of our - you will see more of the things that the test market is for the purpose of really verifying in real-life what we need to do and then go back quickly to the drawing board and follow up shortly with the new product release. We somehow went for this very quickly in Japan. But people may not remember that their version of the IQOS device, which we have sold initially during the test market in Nagoya is a different product version which we have nationally expanded. And it is a different product version what we are shipping to Japan right now. So Japan is already at the third generation or release if you like of the devices and you incorporate the feedback from the consumers. And I guess, other platforms will follow the same sort of a pattern.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. I have more questions, but I think I should give somebody else a go. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Leinster with Berenberg.
Jonathan Leinster: Hi, Jonathan. Yeah, now a few questions, if I may. First of all, with regard to Japan, what sort of inventory levels, trade inventory levels are there in terms of IQOS? And given you just talked about still being sort of capacity-constrained and wanting to build out a supply chain and such, what level of inventory in a perfect world would you be looking at in that sort of environment?
Jacek Olczak: Well, usually we target inventory in terms of the duration, right? So if I would compare the duration of inventory there for IQOS compared to what we strategically or normally maintain for the conventional IQOS would be below conventional, so that's clearly the level of inventories which is not sufficient to maintain the current level of operation. Now, obviously on a conventional business in Japan even before the opening of a new product category, the market is in a secular decline rate, et cetera. So from time to time, your inventories automatically have a longer duration if you don't adjust the volume. IQOS is a reverse situation. I mean, as result - on a projected volume, what we think is the duration. And if I don't ship the product next week the inventory is going to grow dramatically, because I'm on the increasing shipments to the retailer. So I would - our thinking is that we should end up in Japan with the inventories at minimum duration-wise with the level of conventional cigarettes. And actually if we could, we would like to build that inventory higher, because let us remember that we still today have one operation - one manufacturing center supplying the market. So our dependence from the risk perspective is - risk management perspective is extremely hard, completely different than what we have on the conventional cigarettes. But we have said it already with the Q1 that if we can build inventory in Japan, which will allow us to operate more freely the supply chain, we will do it this year.
Jonathan Leinster: Sorry, I missed the last one, did you say, 10 billion?
Jacek Olczak: No, I didn't say 10 billion.
Jonathan Leinster: Sorry, okay, and what…
Jacek Olczak: I was referring to the duration of inventories, okay. So without…
Jonathan Leinster: And what duration normally would there be on the FMC [ph] side then?
Jacek Olczak: You're talking somewhere between up to about three months. But you need to take into consideration that the shipments to Japan are literally taking - are going by water. So your inventory is essentially on the water. So two-thirds of that duration is not accessible for sales in Japan, because it's in the pipeline to Japan. It's the [indiscernible].
Jonathan Leinster: Okay, okay. And in terms of capacity constraints, I mean, when we were into Q3, I mean, I think you were suggesting that you were still capacity constrained in terms of Japan, so does that mean the leaning come off now in Q4?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we'll have increased sales and shipments to Japan, because that capacity - we're producing more week-by-week and month-by-month. But what we say that, hopefully, around the Q4 we should be in that situation that we can ship to the shops what is required and somehow in parallel get the inventory right, which would absorb any sales. We can leave the surge in demand or we can leave the quarter on the devices and Japan will not be putting further constraints on the supply chain. You'll have gradual expansion…
Jonathan Leinster: All right, and in terms of the - okay, gradual expansion, okay. I was going to say, in Japan, in terms of the Marlboro price rise, I mean, clearly, there was some there that one of your competitors increased prices of one of its major brands last year and then there was not much of the response from anybody. And conversely, in France, there has been a tax rise, but there has been no increase in prices including obviously Marlboro which is the largest brand. I mean, can you explain, first of all, what's the theory behind moving the prices for Marlboro in Japan? And secondly, with regards to France, why has the industry decided to simply absorb the tax?
Jacek Olczak: Not, I mean, the pricing decisions are made to - are in our case country-by-country basis. So I wouldn't link the price development on our side in France to what we have done in Japan. We just think that taking into considerations the market dynamics, the projected elasticity, et cetera that we could increase the prices in Japan. As you might have heard, the initial attempt was to increase for more brands than just Marlboro. We ended up with Marlboro increase. So this is what it is. And I have no clue whatsoever why the industry, as you phrase it, have decided not to pass on the tax in France. I can speak for Philip Morris. Again, it's the case in Italy very often, we look at tax structure, we look at brand elasticity, and we're just running the numbers whether this makes sense or not in the current configuration, the increased prices from the view of growing the profitability and we just moving the pricing variance with the volume variance and vice versa, that's the situation. Having said that, and as you noticed, despite the fact that - we didn't have the pricing in France where there is no pricing still in Japan et cetera, we still had the 6% pricing variance for the six months of the year. So somehow, they have this factored in 12 months.
Jonathan Leinster: But just following up on that, in Japan you'd be quite happy if Marlboro is the only price that went up?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we're always happy, if you like, if the prices are going up.
Jonathan Leinster: Yeah, okay. And very lastly, what do you think that the total sort of conventional cigarette volumes globally are likely to decline this year?
Jacek Olczak: I guess, somewhere this 2% to 3%. And I don't think we would - if the Pakistan - we will have to now start factoring in this. Russia, I think this 5% to 6% about right. Euro, volume view, which we have to forecast, should be around what we have said. I think Indonesia should now have a bit of better volumes. The question is what's going to continue to happen in Philippines. But we observe some relatively moderations in the decline rates relative. Pakistan, which is a big market thinking the international volumes. I think the 2% to 3% of the industry seems like a right number for the year.
Jonathan Leinster: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo.
Thomas Russo: Yes, hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Tom, thank you for calling.
Thomas Russo: Yes, right, good morning. Couple of quick questions. The first, I read the - maybe your General Counsels appearing before the FDA in light of the submissions. I would love to have an update on the submissions, their progress, and then what the steps might be for Altria under your agreement with them, what opportunities do they have to start to roll out IQOS, first question.
Jacek Olczak: I guess you're referring to that Marc Firestone recent address with regards to illicit trade.
Thomas Russo: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, well, I mean, look, I mean, there is a number of countries which we see a pretty good improvement on illicit trade. But I think also Marc was trying to show in our experiences, one can help in collaborations industry and collaborations with the government, continuing probing this trend, so…
Thomas Russo: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: And, as I said, I mean, we follow up for a while. You see that over the last two, three years, we've made a pretty, I would argue, significant improvement with regards to illicit trade. There are still some pockets which have to be addressed. But globally I think it is getting better. And with regards to Altria, I think Altria waits, as we are waiting for FDA, premarket approval authorization with the FDA.
Thomas Russo: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: And counting just my calendar days, somewhere before the year-end it should happen. So Altria would be - should be good to go to launch the product in the U.S. And I know from our collaborations with Altria that Altria is working on the plans to - for this to happen. We're just waiting for FDA.
Thomas Russo: Great. Also, I read, Jacek, at some place, reference to a new IQOS Heat cigarette manufacturing facility authorized to get built in Germany. What is the timing of that and what's the capacity of that?
Jacek Olczak: Production of Germany will lead to the capacity beyond January 2019.
Thomas Russo: Oh, I see.
Jacek Olczak: Our numbers for today are, as we said, 50 year-end installed this year, plus minus now the productivity gains which I highlighted in answer to the previous questions.
Thomas Russo: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: That we actually may leave the 100 year-end installed capacity 2018 and Dresden facilities to start contributing beyond. So this is our second, if you like, greenfield operations of Cologne. In the meantime, we talk about Greece, we talk about Romania, et cetera, which are the retrofitting or converting the conventional capacity into the RRP capacity, so we got…
Thomas Russo: Great. And then, what happens in the capacity at launch for Dresden, how large would that start and how will it grow over time?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we will build it to the appropriate level of capacity.
Thomas Russo: Well, that's a good answer, thank you. And then who will supply the actual products to the U.S. market?
Jacek Olczak: Initially, PMI.
Thomas Russo: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: And then we'll have to see.
Thomas Russo: Thanks for the update. Bye.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: And with that, I'll hand the program back over to you, Mr. Nick Rolli, for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining us. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team here in Switzerland. Thanks again and have a nice day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-20 09:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 first quarter results and you may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First we'll be talking about results for the first quarter of 2017, and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume and PMI market share performance now reflect cigarettes PMI’s heated tobacco units for those markets that have commercial sales of iQOS. A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning while increasing our 2017 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rate for $0.04 to a range of 484 to $4.99 for a favorable tax item only. Our guidance continues to include $0.08 of unfavorable currency. Excluding currency and the tax item our guidance represents a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12 % compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. AS a reminder, we expect that our currency neutral financial growth to be skewed towards the second half of 2017 notably reflecting increased heated tobacco unit capacity and improving returns on our RRP investments as the year unfolds. Let me now thank you for our first quarter results beginning with our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume which declined by 9.4 or 7.8% excluding estimated inventory movement. The decline was due primary to the impact of lower cigarette industry volume partly reflecting the micro-economic environment in Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines and Russia as well as the high prevalence of illicit trade in Pakistan and Philippines. As seen on the left side of the slide over half of the total decline consisted of low price segment volume some of which contributed very little, if any, unit margin. This limited the impact on our profitability and differs dramatically from the overall price segment split of our premium position portfolio as shown on the right. Our first quarter volume decline was slightly larger than anticipated due to essentially to the lower industry volume in Pakistan and Philippines as well as the magnitude of unfavorable inventory movements in Italy and Spain. For the full year, we expect a combined decline of 3% to 4% broadly in line with last year. The expected improvement over the balance of the 2017 is supported by three main factors, the lapping of challenging first half comparisons versus 2016 in select geographies such as Argentina, the EU region and Turkey. A lower impact of estimated unfavorable inventory movements on full year basis and significantly higher heated tobacco unit volume. Despite the cigarette driven volume decline net revenues in the first quarter increased by 1.7% excluding currency. This growth reflected favorable pricing particularly in Asia and EEMA regions as well as higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales. For the year we continue to anticipate currency neutral net revenue growth above 6%. Adjusted OCI declined by 1.7% excluding currency primarily reflecting lower cigarette volume as well as significantly higher investments behind the commercialization of iQOS notably in the EU region and Japan. Adjusted diluted EPS were flat at $0.98 with no currency impact as the favorable effect of currency such as the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Russian ruble Swiss franc were offset by the negative effect related to the Egyptian pound, Mexican peso and Turkish lira. Our strong pricing variance represents 6.7% of first quarter 2016 net revenues and included positive contributions from all four regions. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of market. Notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Turkey as well as other's shown on the slide. Our first quarter markets were excluding China and the US declined by 0.9 points to 26.8% due principally to brands in below premium price segment such as low price Morven Gold in Pakistan, Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines and next global is in Russia. Our premium brands performed well in the quarter contributing 0.2 points of market share growth driven by the strong performance of our heated tobacco brand. I will now discuss a few of our key geographies beginning with the origin. Industrial volume declined by 2.8% in the quarter, consistent with the secular decrease in the market and our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%. Our volume was down by 7.1% but was impacted by estimated unfavorable distributor cigarette inventor movements notably related to the implementation of the tobacco products directed in France, Italy and Spain. Excluding this event from movement, our volume declined by 2.9% broadly in line with the industry. Our regional market share was essentially flat in the quarter with growth in market such as France, Germany, Poland and the UK, offset by declines notably in Italy and Spain. In Italy, the share decline was due mainly to Philip Morris reflecting the growth of the super-low price segment as well as Marlboro which is the only major cigarette brand above their own €5 per pack price point. Marlboro was also impacted by the TPD's ban on pack sizes of 10 cigarettes which contributed approximately 12% of the brand cigarette volume prior to the ban. On a sequential basis, our total share in Italy was slightly up versus the fourth quarter supported by the growth of fees. In Spain, the share declined was due principally from Marlboro cigarettes notably reflecting the brands passing of around €5 per pack price point in the vending channel which accounts for nearly 30% of Marlboro cigarette volume. Moving to Russia. Industry volume declined by 7.9% in the quarter due primarily to the impact of X size pack delivering price increases. For the full year, we expect the decline to moderate to a range of 5% to 6%. Our February quarter to-date, cigarette share declined by 0.4 points versus the same period last year due mainly to the slower penetration of competitors price increases. However, our share has increased sequentially over the past few quarters driven by low price above three as well as Philip Morris which gets benefited in part from the consolidation of certain local brands in the Philip Morris trademark. As evidenced by the brand driving our sequential cigarette share performance, we are serving further down trading in Russia. While the presence of big parts has declined following the ban of the production as of July last year, residual volumes remained in the supply chain and we are continuing to witness price competition around limited pack editions with discounts equivalent to the per stick price of big pack. Importantly, we are effectively balancing our market share and profitability growth in Russia. Turning now to the Philippines. We continue to prioritize the growth of our premium portfolio's profitability over the defense of the low margin volume and share. Higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix reflecting the strong performance of Marlboro draw profitability growth in the quarter despite the cigarette industry volume decline of 15.6%. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 5 points to 32.5% driven by switching from lower priced brands. To further highlight Marlboro strength, the sequential share has now increased for 11 straight quarters. Our total cigarette share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the timing of competitor's price increases as well as continued competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This led to widened price gaps notably compared to Fortune and Jackpot. We are therefore encouraged by the government's renewed focus on addressing illicit trade including excise stock stamp compliance. We are hopeful for sustained enforcement to address the usual long term which we believe should ensure that prices at the bottom of the market reflect full excise stocks payment. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.5% in the quarter reflecting the continued soft economic environment and above inflation tax driven retail price increases. While history shows that quarterly trends in the market can be volatile, we anticipate the decline of 1% to 2% for the full year in line with 2016. Our cigarette markets are declined by 0.5 points in the quarter due mainly to Sampoerna A, our leading lighter-tasting machine made exotic brand as well as Marlboro in the white segment following it's passing of the 20,000 rupiah per pack price point. The decline was partly offset by the growth of full-flavor machine made kretek offer such as U Bold and Marlboro Filter Black. The latter has been gradually expanded, and since it's initial launch in 25 cities last September and reached 1% international share in the first quarter. In Japan, the strong performance of IQOS continues to be the primary driver of our result. Market share increased by 5.4 points in the quarter to 30% driven mainly by the growth of Marlboro HeatSticks. Marlboro share including cigarettes and HeatSticks increased by 5.7 points to 17.1%. Industrial volume declined by 7.4% or by 4.3% excluding inventory movement. The strong performance of IQOS in Japan is further evidence by the weakly uptick shares for Marlboro HeatSticks. As seen on this chart, the brand closed the quarter with a weakly uptick share of 9.6% nationally, 11.6% in Tokyo and 14.9% in Sendai. We believe that the strong uptick performance in Sendai in particular clearly demonstrates the growing potential of the heated tobacco category in Japan. Turning to the commercialization of IQOS more broadly, we have now launched IQOS in key cities in 24 markets globally following city launches in Columbia and Lithuania during the first quarter and in Poland and Serbia earlier this month. By year end, we continue to expect IQOS to be in key cities nationwide in a total of 32 to 35 markets subject to capacity. Importantly, our heated tobacco portfolio is beginning to achieve strong international market share growth sequentially in some of our yearly launch market beyond Japan. For example in Italy, Switzerland and Portugal, our national share reached 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.4% respectively in the first quarter of 2017. These results have been achieved despite IQOS focus area representing less than 35% of cigarette industry volume in each market. Our share performance in Germany is also well full of highlighting. Giving the limited focus area and relatively brief period since launch, national market share data are not yet meaningful. However, heats have recorded strong sequential uptick share growth in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, reaching a combined share of 0.6% in the first quarter and 0.8% in the last week of March. Let me now provide an update on our heated tobacco unit capacity. We entered 2017 with approximately 15 billion units of installed annual capacity and continued to anticipate approximately 50 billion units of such capacity at the year-end. This translates to over 32 billion units in expected total capacity available for commercializations in 2017. As additional capacity has come online this year, we have begun to gradually increase the number of IQOS devices available for sale in Japan and will continue to do so as the year unfolds. In addition, we have started to implement our plans to reach installed annual capacity of 100 billion units by the end of 2018. As a result, we expect to have approximately 75 billion units in total capacity available for commercializations in 2018. In support of this plan, we recently announced our decision to convert our cigarette factory in Greece to heated tobacco unit production. Consequently, we are increasing our plant capital expenditures in 2017 to $1.6 billion from the $1.5 billion previously communicated. We continue to target operating cash flow of $8.5 billion this year. In conclusion, our first quarter results generally came in as expected. Our cigarette volume was lower than anticipated. Our key assumptions for the full year remain intact, namely currency neutral net revenue growth of about 6%, supported by favorable pricing as well as higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales. To build up on the exceptional performance of IQOS, we are making significant investments behind both commercialization and the expansion of heated tobacco unit capacity. Importantly, we currently estimate that approximately 1.8 million adult consumers have already quit smoking cigarettes and switched to IQOS. Finally, the full year outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2017 EPS guidance reflects the growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% excluding currency and the favorable tax item, compared to a adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. Thank you and I will be happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Chris. Good morning.
Chris Growe: Hi Jacek. How are you? Thank you. I just want to ask you two questions if I could. I just want to get a sense of you have this IQOS available in 24 markets today, there has been some comments saying it's going to go into France and there is more markets still to come throughout the year. As you look at your capacity development throughout the year, you've given the numbers clearly what's available for the year, but you're having a pretty quick uptake obviously in Japan I mean you need more and more volume for that market. I just want to get a sense of is it more important now to have this available in more markets or to make it more widely available in the existing markets in which you're in, do you have the capacity to do both of those in 2017?
Jacek Olczak: Okay, it look it takes a bit of time in each market to build necessary capacity infrastructure in order for the national expansion. So, I mean what we have learned so far from experience we have with the commercialization of IQOS is that that is the start always with one or two cities and start building the expansion based on what we had been learned and what we have installed in these cities. This requires quite significant employment of additional sales force but also creation establishment of IQOS stores, boutiques, Brexit stores etcetera. So, we always will need that runway and essentially opening in these markets earlier does not put at this stage that much of a constrain on available capacity but allows us to build faster much broader ways ahead of 2018 or 2019. So this is how we look at this thing. And as you might have noticed Chris, we also have making now the decision to take this theoretical capacity expansion of a 4 billion per month which we have announced half a year ago that we have that option, we have decided to essentially implement this plan. So, we already committing ourselves to this 100 billion year-end capacity next year to essentially accelerating our plans.
Chris Growe: Okay. And do you still expect IQOS to achieve break-even probability in 2017?
Jacek Olczak: Absolutely.
Chris Growe: Okay and one quick one if I could on the volume performance for the underlying business and it was obviously weaker than we thought obviously weaker than with the new thought. And there is obviously some adjustments from inventory and timing changes and you gave some color around that but going forward, you'd expect a pretty significant improvement in the underlying volume performance of the business. I just want to get a sense of, so we look across a lot of the markets is there some pretty significant market share declines in some markets, do those start to narrow or is it more about IQOS developing and contributing to your overall volume? I just want get a sense of that balance you expect for the rest of the year.
Jacek Olczak: Look, I mean at some markets when we have posted in the quarter some more sizable market share loses, we have highlighted in my remarks and in my remarks the sequential development. So, in both markets we can see the improvements Q1 and Q4 or the sequential within a quarter etcetera. So, I think we keep that strong grip on the conventional business in the market where we for whatever reasons under pressure. I mean Italy is a little bit more complicated because on the one hand we were focusing on a combustible business while also building the base for the IQOS. But there are some problems in Italy which frankly speaking beyond our power to execute as we noted the tax structuring in Italy is not very supporting for narrowing the price gaps, Marlboro is above the Marlboro in a conventional business, on a conventional cigarette, is above the €5 price point. So, I guess there will be some pressure on Italy on Marlboro in Italy in a conventional business continuing for the year. But on the other hand, Germany still continues to be on the strong term, France despite the fact that we have a first quarter, I know it’s bit early of the plain pack implementation but France posted very good results in a quarter. And the rest is purely the comps. Remember that we are comparing the first quarter to the relatively strong, weaker declines in Q1 of the first quarter last year in Argentina and then we had this in the last year for tax increase. The others, number of average geographies but we also faced a bit of most challenging comps in the Q1. What came if I may ask is what came as worse than our expectations frankly speaking is Italy and Spain when we have to take the inventory adjustments. I mean, we know that comparing to the Q1 last year, we will have to adjust but I think during the TPD buildup of inventories and especially in Italy conversion of stance or ban on the sales of tones. We have anticipated the higher conversion of tones to twenties when it comes to the retail stock replenishment and I think this went this come weaker than we thought, is it over or is it going to continue, we will have to see. But anyway I mean we don't expect any major at this point inventory adjustment for the year. So, at least this had to be in these removed and as I said number of the comps if you look both in the yield but in other regions I mean we sure we should have it, I mean it should be more helpful and more supportive. And as I said, we still feel confident on the total volume outlook. Obviously, as you know we're focusing more on the combined volume, otherwise we will have to start making a number of assumptions with regard to the cannibalization etcetera but I think they are good proximity that we can close the year with the volume performance at par and may be even slightly better than what we have had for the full year last year.
Chris Growe: Okay. That was very good color. Thanks for your time.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with the Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Vivian.
Vivien Azer: So, just to follow up on Chris's question. So, if we're still looking to break even in '17 Jacek, given the momentum that the business is seeing, year on balance it would seem that you're still on track to generate incremental profits from IQOS in 2018 but how are you thinking about the need for reinvestment spending given your first mover advantage in the traction that you're seeing from the product and would you be able to offer any kind of order of magnitude guidance around what that level of profitability might look like? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Look, we have said it I guess earlier this year that we look and we can reconfirm this here from this today, we are looking at the revenue growth above 6% and earlier we have said that we are still looking at the margin, operating profit margin expansion somewhere in the tune of 10 to 20 points. Clearly we could say that to achieve that better margin expansion but it is not factored in increase investments namely behind the IQOS. This is both on the OpEx and operating cost and I announced as we announced today also on the CapEx to prepare the capacity. So, I think we well invested frankly speaking on the both sides both on a combustible, although there is some reallocation or allocation of the resources from a combustible business to reduce these product but I think we feel that pretty comfortable with the investment which we plan to make this year as I said to support the revenue growth above 6%.
Vivien Azer: That's helpful and just in terms of the longer term outlook for 2020, Olczak, you would point it to a higher profit number when you spoke at the Cage Conference. So, can you just offer a little bit contexts on what the implied HeatSticks volumes would be for that 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion an incremental profit? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, a number of times recently I'm being confronted with this question, Vivian. Yes, we gave that outlook I guess three years ago or so. And I have already admitted, maybe I shouldn’t, I have admitted I think at the Cage Conference a few weeks ago both numbers seems to be wrong. Either 2020 was wrong and we are going to keep the target well ahead of this deadline or definitely the volume number was wrong. I mean, you could at the pace which we are cruising today, we see the penetrations in the markets are in Japan; it goes well above the 3% to 5% which we have marked the target for 2020. So, you have to give us the time to really put our brace around what really the size of that opportunity today. Clearly, it's a much bigger opportunity that we have felt two years ago but they would refrain from giving a new target at this stage. We have also said to investors that in 2018, somewhere in 2018 we'll try to come up with a new improved vapor for PMI and I guess this would be the best timing to put some milestones what we want to achieve with our big objective to go to this smoke-free future as PMI.
Vivien Azer: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Judy.
Judy Hong: So, first in Japan, so there's been some press reports about PM planning to take some pricing on your combustible business. So, can you confirm whether you file for price increase application in Japan and combustibles?
Jacek Olczak: Judy, you will appreciate but I can’t comment on our future pricing decisions, at least at this stage. So, we will have to leave it as it is now.
Judy Hong: But when you kind of think about your full year guidance at this point, does that include any of the potential price increase in Japan?
Jacek Olczak: Judy, please I can’t comment on our future pricing.
Judy Hong: That’s fine. Alright. And then I guess staying in Japan, so obviously you've seen a pretty strong share gains even in Sendai as your competitor have launched in that market. So, how do you sort of look at that market and kind of what are the lessons learned in looking at that market and applying kind of a similar share performance to the broader Japanese market or your ability to kind of defend your share as your competitors begin to expand more nationally in Japan?
Jacek Olczak: Look, we just look at Sendai and maybe the data is not fully reliable for us and for our competitors. They are our competitors there but I think in Sendai in the quarter, the total heat-not-burn category must have crossed 20% market share. What I hear, what I know from our side and what I hear about our competitor without operating with some sort of a capacity limitation and I know that they are quite awaiting in Sendai and other places in Japan to buy IQOS or competitors device, which tells me that demand today is 20% and is growing and it has a large portion of unsatisfied demand. The people are not allowed to buy devices because the devices are not available. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sendai category and heat-not-burn category in Sendai would cross the 30% share of total market by the yearend and may be even that number is wrong. I think we clearly can see the word of mouth in fact that people have been adults who have successfully managed to quit smoking and have moved to heat-not-burn category and sharing the benefit with the peers, with their colleagues etcetera. So, it’s a classical word of mouth type of an effect. Category is gaining awareness both in terms of its existence and the benefit that category work for us. So, it's our long goals for the great future but I think is a big question now what is really the how long that growth rates are going to be there and what is the ultimate size of that thing. Is it a 100% of the market? I guess, no but people, this is you remember me saying on number of occasions, this is not the most innovative industry if you look at the history of this industry, right. The filter cigarette, the filter bud and that's about it. And then little bit about the capsules and a three or four months. It still get a while to convert cigarettes, conventional cigarettes from a non-filter to filter cigarette. But it happen in a less than in about five years 10 years depends on the market. Maybe, we in a front of such opportunity here, we'll have to see. I mean, it's all goes into the right direction. Obviously, Japan is a little bit in a better situation due to the marketing channels availability compared to our markets etcetera. But even if we start factoring this in, you may just this feel to the on a timeline of the curve, the difference of a one or two years but since that the product might have -- there are consumer sizeable group of consumers, very sizeable group of consumers who are waiting for that one.
Judy Hong: Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the capacity related question. So, with the €300 million investment that you've talked about for the Greece plan, that gives you 20 billion additional fixed from an IQOS HeatSticks perspective. So, that would be 50 billion plus 20 billion, 70 billion. So, would there be incremental CapEx if you were to get to a 100 billion capacity by end of 2018 and should we take that into consideration just from a CapEx for a '18 perspective?
Jacek Olczak: Well, there won't be impact on the CapEx in '18. We have not announced the number of the CapEx for '18. So, we have to wait a bit, till the thing which we have. The Greek numbers, which your or number for the Greece conversion, Greek factory conversion is included in my 1.6 for this year as CapEx impact on the cash flow. And then I guess we will have other factory conversions, the capacity expansion capacities, which we'll be announcing as the year unfolds, in order to build up that 100 billion. Okay, because always is the question of the machinery and equipment and is obviously the questions where we're going to host and when we're going to locate that manufacturing capacity; especially we're thinking in a context of converting existing combustible assets.
Judy Hong: Alright, okay, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, Olczak.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I have a couple of quick questions on IQOS. Could you give us an update of from your test for platform two? I believe you were testing that in the first quarter and if so could you again give us an update on how that performed and any plans to roll that out?
Jacek Olczak: Bonnie, we remember, kept on these two many occasions. We haven’t test platform two in the first quarter. We have said we're going to test it later this year.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: We have P3 and the P4 as well in some cities or in some locations. But we have not done this test yet.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. So, it's on task then to be tested this year still.
Jacek Olczak: Oh, right.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then question on your tax benefit for IQOS. I guess I'd like to better understand these tax benefits in the market share and so on average are you still seeing around a 20% benefit across all of these markets and then curious, what are the economics on IQOS in markets where there is no tax benefit. Could you still generate profits on IQOS that would be comparable to your combustible cig business?
Jacek Olczak: To my, first to think the IQOS lower talks on heat-not-burn category is by the first country-by-country but it would be better or a higher benefit than a 20%. I guess, Japan is in about plus/minus 20% benefit. That's one. Second is, from my knowledge, frankly speaking, I don’t recall a country in which we have commercialized about frankly speaking to commercialize in which the heat-not-burn category is not classified as a lower with a lower tax benefit.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright.
Jacek Olczak: I might be wrong, but I don’t think so we have any single country to their market today, when we wouldn’t have the when heat-not-burn wouldn’t have a lower tax classification.
Bonnie Herzog: That's what I thought, Olczak. But what about a scenario where fast-forward several years where some of these governments might change the tax benefits which we can argue why that should be the case. But just let's think about a worst case scenario. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense of in the economics on IQOS if you had no tax benefit. There must, help us understand that and how you think about that.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. Well, IQOS saw the HeatSticks are sold at a price of a premium segment, right, on the mark.
Bonnie Herzog: Right.
Jacek Olczak: So, that’s even excluding the tax benefit, we are premiumizing our portfolio and we're operating with the positive mix product mix category territory. Secondly, as we roll out and build up the capacity, we also are gradually lowering the cost of the manufacturing. So, as we have said from the very beginning of our journey in this new category, we would one should expect that one day the consumerable the HeatSticks will be manufactured at the very close unit cost to the conventional cigarette. So, I have a cost approaching the conventional cigarette and I am operating at the margin level of the premium segment. So, would be equal if I would have a rapid expansion of the Marlboro volumes across the geographies. So, at least from a mix perspective, I am better off. At this margins clearly market-by-market are better than my other profit margins or unit margins on my entire portfolio.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. Okay, and then just a last quick question, certainly your conversion rates with IQOS and HeatSticks has been very high, which is great, but I'm curious to hear about trial. How is that been building in some of your IQOS markets in terms of just essentially recruiting new users to try this technology?
Jacek Olczak: Well, okay, I mean Japan is clear that the trial is frankly speaking limited because it build the factor of how many devices we allow the trade to sell. So, this trial is -- the number doesn't exist in a sense. I mean, there are the line of people a waiting list for the devices in many shelfs. So, the trial is people are buying and getting the device. In other markets, frankly speaking the trial rates are about the same as we had mid-term in Japan. In a sense, when we went to from a 60% coverage to the national expansions, you remember we have lifted the trial rates and we have lifted the conversion rates and all of the markets and most of the market where we are now with like or say enjoying about the same at the same statistics and the same leading KPI view if you like. Remember that the trial, that the product which we selling other our selloff through our selected trade partners is only for adult smokers. Right. So, we don’t have that much interest if at all from the non-smokers but by the other all the roles of conversion, the product is only allowed to be sold to adult. It's obvious because it's a tobacco nicotine containing product but also only to the smokers. And that's also important for us that we don’t create an unintended consequences of when it comes to people who successfully quit smoking or people who never smoked before.
Bonnie Herzog: Right, okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you. So, I'm a little bit confused about your attitude towards market share in the conventional business. When I look at the sequential market share, so I'm looking at the market share you place in Q1 versus what you placed in Q4. Outside Europe, you've seen declines in pretty much every geography that you've list in the press release. As in my question, but which is worrying to me, the listeners who've attended your prepared remarks, you imply that this is roughly in line with expectations are not a big concern. So, am I wrong to read that there has been a decline sequentially since 4Q outside Europe? And my how concerned are you about the market share trends in conventional?
Jacek Olczak: Adam, I very gladly has to unconfuse you.
Adam Spielman: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: We will have to go geography-by-geography and how we look at this trends. If I take the significant market share erosions which we observed, one obvious comes for example, Philippines; very sizeable market and we have a total significant share losses and it obviously waits on a total PMI of volume and a share performance. But we have highlighted very much that instead of protecting low margin volumes in absence of the proper law enforcement when it comes to compliance with regards to the tax takers, we just about two years ago changed the strategy and what goes on managing the more growth, the price reduction of the price gap and so far the strategy is very successful. Marlboro grows significant market share despite the fact that there is some down trading in the market. And secondly, we in a double-digit bottom digit, bottom line policy either of territory. Then you have some markets where the trends okay Indonesia is as we know is the continuous shift between the hand roll to machine made etcetera. I mean, that in the recent launches which we have made in the machine made segment including the Marlboro Black kretek, which quarter in a market and not in a full even distribution has achieved the very strong 1% market share. So, that by Indonesian standard is very strong. And also both the initiatives etcetera. I think so far there goes well. While we grow the markets share Indonesia, I mean, that remains to be seen. Can flood the market share, I feel as well positive about this one. That that's the large markets, we done a short fluctuations of share erosions matter for PMI. Then you have the market which you have typical sort of a Q1 distortion which are driven by the price increase patterns, which is take the Mexico, you take another in just as the timing of the price increases may change year-on-year, makes up a different purchasing pattern by the trade and therefore you might have this fluctuation. Now, we are watching carefully the performance of the combustible business and we obviously as always watching very carefully the markets are perform. I have mentioned other performance in Italy and I call it off as that’s going be going to stay for a while because there is a structural problem with the market, is a pretty wide price gap, lack of effective tax solutions at the bottom of the market. On a compound, temporarily I hope with the elimination of the packs of 10 cigarette, it's obviously Marlboro has some quite significant exposure in that part of the market. Spain, okay, it's always when you cross their price points, you need to softer for a couple of quarters until -- either the market takes the next pricing the consumer has adjusted let's say. On the other hand I have a very high priced Marlboro in France, and continues to grow. So, I hope that on my at least partially help to unconfuse you.
Adam Spielman: And just with, first of all thank you because you have. And second of all just to sort of throw the comments forward. You say that in the full-year even I expect to see -3% and -4% volume declines on a total basis. My guess is that's going to be how can we put it. It is going to be somewhat weak in the second quarter and gradually improved to that -3% to -4% both I'm guessing is conventional business is less paired and as the HeatSticks picks up. Is that how we should think about it sequentially?
Jacek Olczak: We should have, well, maybe I'll turn it to the other. And I think as of Q2, we should expect a much more robust revenue growth which is a combination of a pricing better volume makes which frankly speaking we didn’t talk about the mix plus a 50 in the quarter by mixing the Q1 much better or much lower than the mixing in the Q1 last year. So some of the – as I said as of Q2 we should see much stronger volume sort of revenue growth on the rate to as I said to achieve that of 6% for the full year net of currency revenue growth.
Adam Spielman: And can I ask if a very quick follow up somewhat technical question. when you quote Q6 market share in Europe I’m thinking about in Italy and Switzerland for example, is this off-take market share or is this shipment market share?
Jacek Olczak: This will be off take market share. It depends on the market we state are available but we usually refer to what we call market sales, so it’s not asked to the distributor but is distributor sales. It may not in our markets be of the retail but to retail now depends.
Jacek Olczak: I understand, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jeffery.
Michael Lavery: Good morning. Just a question on – it looks like your volumes from fourth quarter to first quarter grew by around 20%, but your revenues by more like 2016/17 can you just touch on what’s driving that acceleration and what’s giving them the mix lift. Is it countries, growth now in countries with a bigger tax benefits, or is it more, is it driven by more devices outside Japan, what’s happening on the margin there?
Jacek Olczak: There could be some distortion from the devices, but as we said for the full year 16, when we’re announcing full year results, I mean, roughly, devices in the RRPs related revenues should account for about 20, 22% somewhere in this range. So it might have a bit of higher shipment of the devices. But I wouldn’t look at this purely from the quarterly perspective because there are different services obviously applies and we’ve to start shipping more devices in order to follow this order to higher shipments of the heat sticks. So you’ll always will some distortion there. On the IMS basins and maybe go back to appropriate question before, on IMS basis by recall the shipments of, at least in Japan, sorry, an IMS basin the sales, in Japan, quarter-on-quarter grew about 30% and then what we see is about, if there is any distortions in the revenues presumably more from other location and devices.
Michael Lavery: Okay that’s helpful. And then just looking at Japan even on unadjusted for inventory movement basis and more so when adjusted taking at the cigarettes and the heat stick volume together at the category level it looks like there is positive growth, which is clearly better than historically it’s been, are you seeing increased use educations or what do you think is driving some of that better toll momentum overall?\\
Jacek Olczak: I want to say that Japan, I think Japan is somewhere straightly in-line with the secular type of decline. So I think Japan is in the – in this 3% to 4% type of a decline altogether, I mean all the categories and I don’t think in the longer term this should change ups and obviously any other changes to the market. But as we’re today I mean, this is one should expect as a baseline for Japan total category should be some more I think in the range of 3% to 4%. Now there is some, I think JT was taking some price increases on a C category, okay. They were relatively lower total share, but I think there might be some elasticity kicking in and always on a quarterly basis Japan numbers, you have to properly, one have to properly adjust for all the pipelining of the new product launches on a – it’s always on a conventional business, but I think it still continues. There might be some comps as well when JT was taking – last year [indiscernible] as I said nothing today would indicate that the total category trend in Japan would be outside 3% to 4%--
Michael Lavery: Okay, thank you. And just one last follow up on capacity, I know you’ve outlined a lot of things about that, if you clarify this one, forgive me if I missed it. But, I know you had been saying you expected to be off of capacity constraints at the end of Q1 that’s now obviously been a few weeks. Are you still rationing devices in Japan or do you have the flood gates open or what is the right way to think about, where you sit today?
Jacek Olczak: We start shipping, we start slowly lifting the quotas for Japan as of Q2, but we will not be in a position to significantly lift it before Q3 – the devices because we’re still catching up with the capacity of HeatStick. But capacity of HeatStick every month from the January, February, March, we’re already increasing it, you can see this in our shipments and we’re going to continue doing this for the whole year.
Michael Lavery: Okay, great, thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, now we’ll conclude today’s question and answer portion on today’s call. I’d hand the program back over to management for any additional remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team. We're back here in Switzerland. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the Philip Morris International first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2016 fourth quarter and full year results and you may access the release on our new company website at www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, and comparing them to the same period in 2015, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note that in the first quarter of 2017, we will begin to report our shipment volume on a combined basis including both cigarettes and HeatSticks. We will also report our combined estimated market share in certain markets, as we currently do for Japan, to the extent that reliable data is available. It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join André for the question-and-answer period. André?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. 2016 was a pivotal year for PMI, reflecting exciting progress in our transformation from combustible tobacco products to a Reduced-Risk Products focused company. While our combustible tobacco portfolio continue to drive our income growth, we began to see clear signs of the enormous potential of our RRP portfolio. As expected, we closed 2016 with exceptionally strong quarterly results, driven by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs coupled with a favorable cost comparison. Net revenues increased by 10.5% excluding currency while adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS increased by over 47% and 51%, respectively, on the same basis. Full-year net revenues increased by 4.4% excluding currency driven by a favorable pricing variance equivalent to 6% of prior-year net revenues, and the strong performance of RRPs, notably HeatSticks and IQOS devices. As in any year, we faced some unique challenges in 2016 such as the very large excise tax increase in Argentina, the surge of illicit trade in Pakistan and the cigarette industry volume declines in the Philippines and Thailand. In aggregate, these items had an adverse effect on our volume and net revenues but a very limited impact on our adjusted OCI due to the low corresponding margins. Please note that approximately 22% of our $733 million in 2016 (4:21) RRP net revenues were from IQOS devices, which yielded a negative margin due to introductory discounts offer in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. Clearly, the economics of the devices will improve over time as we reach broader adult smoker acceptance. Adjusted operating company's income increased by a robust 10.3% excluding currency, driven by higher net revenues on the same basis and a favorable cost comparison versus 2015 notwithstanding continued investment behind RRPs. Our results were strong across all four regions, with currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth ranging from 8.7% in the European Union to 12.6% in EEMA. Adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.6 points to 41.8%, or by 2.4 points to 43.6% excluding currency, again, with gains across all four regions. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 11.8% excluding currency in 2016. Importantly, adjusted diluted EPS grew by 1.4% including currency, representing the first such increase since 2013. Full-year free cash flow was stable at $6.9 billion despite unfavorable currency of $340 million and our previously announced increase in capital expenditures to support the manufacturing capacity expansion of HeatSticks. Excluding currency, free cash flow increased by 4.9%. As I mentioned previously, our strong financial results were achieved despite a cigarette shipment volume decline in 2016. Some 40% of the decline was due to Pakistan and the Philippines, where the volume erosion was concentrated in low-unit margin brands that had a limited impact on our bottom line. A portion of our cigarette volume decline was also due to in-switching to HeatSticks from our own cigarette brand, a trend that we expect to continue going forward. HeatSticks volume reached 7.4 billion units, which reflected our maximum manufacturing capacity for 2016. HeatSticks volume would have been much higher absent this capacity restriction, which obliged us to limit IQOS device sales in Japan since June. Our cigarette market share excluding China and the U.S. declined by 0.6 points in 2016, with low-price Fortune and super-low price Jackpot, both in the Philippines, accounting for 0.5 points of the total decline. Cigarette share for the balance of our portfolio was essentially stable. Marlboro continued its widespread growth with cigarette share increases in the EU, Asia, and Latin America, and Canada regions. Importantly, the brand's cigarette share growth in Asia was achieved in spite of the impact of Marlboro HeatSticks growth in Japan. Marlboro's decline in EEMA was due essentially to Algeria, reflecting significant adult smoker rejection of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. As noted during our September Investor Day, we instituted a number of initiatives to address this weakness and, as of the fourth quarter, the brand had already recovered close to 6 points of market share compared to its nadir in the second quarter. I will now discuss our performance in a few of our key geographies, beginning with the European Union region. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI increased for the second straight year, with higher pricing driving growth of over 8%. Full year cigarette industry volume declined by 1.6%, with the decrease concentrated in the fourth quarter. This primarily reflects a difficult comparison with 2015, which benefited from the estimated positive impact of immigration and a recovery from illicit trade. Our regional cigarette share was flat in 2016, with growth notably in France, Poland, and Spain, offset mainly by a decline in Italy as a result of our price increase in the second quarter of 2016 and the growth of the super-low price segment. Marlboro's share increased by 0.2 points, growing in most key markets, with the exception of Italy. Moving to Russia, cigarette industry volume again exceeded our expectations in 2016, with the decline moderating to 4.6% despite a third straight year of weighted average industry retail price increases of above 20%. Our cigarette market share declined by 1.2 points, due mainly to the slower penetration of competitors' price increases at retail. In addition, following the ban of the production of big packs, effective July 2016, many competitors launched limited pack editions at a discount equivalent to the per-stick price of big packs. We have deployed initiatives to improve our share performance and, indeed, stabilized our sequential quarterly share in the second half of the year. Strong pricing drove another year of double-digit OCI growth excluding currency, more than offsetting the adverse cigarette volume impact. For reference, amendments to the tax code effective January 2017 were enacted last November, raising the ad valorem rate to 14.5% and increasing both the specific and minimum excise tax. The weighted average total excise tax pass-on for the industry is around RUB 13 per pack, which equates to an average retail price increase of around 10% and is above the approximately RUB 10 per pack average pass-on for 2016. Importantly, the tax code also now includes the introduction of a weight-based specific excise tax on heated tobacco products. Turning now to Japan, the growth of RRPs in 2016 had a notable impact on cigarette industry volume, which declined by 4.6% for the full year and by 7.4% in the fourth quarter. HeatSticks' national market share continued its strong sequential growth, reaching 4.9% in the fourth quarter. During the final week of December, HeatSticks' national market share reached an estimated 5.5%, and its off-take share increased to 7%. Our full-year cigarette market share declined by 0.4 points to 24.9%, due mainly to the impact of HeatSticks. The rate of in-switching to HeatSticks from our own cigarette portfolio declined as the year progressed to an estimated 32% in late 2016. Our combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks increased by 1.7 points to 27.1% in 2016, and by 3.1 points to 28.3% in the fourth quarter. Indonesia continued to be an important profit driver for PMI in 2016 with double-digit OCI growth, mainly reflecting strong pricing. Cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4%, due mainly to the soft economic environment and higher retail prices driven by weighted average excise tax increase in 2016 of around 15% industry-wide. The excise tax increase for 2017 is around 10% on the same basis, though the government also increased the VAT rate on cigarettes to 9.1% from 8.7% last year. As a result, the weighted average total pass-on for the industry in 2017 is approximately 6% at the retail level compared to 8% in 2016. The 0.9 points decline in our cigarette market share was due mainly to the soft performance of our lighter-tasting machine-made kretek brand, reflecting the impact of competitors' discounted product offerings. Our share decline was partly offset by the strong performance of our full-flavor machine kretek brand, U Bold. In addition, our Marlboro Filter Black kretek offering, which we launched in 25 cities last September, is performing well and already reached the national market share of 0.5% in the fourth quarter. Our actions to address our last year's share weakness will continue bearing fruit this year and we project that Indonesia will again be a key contributor to our OCI growth in 2017. Profit in the Philippines continued to improve in 2016 through higher pricing and favorable mix. While our total cigarette share declined by 2.1 points due mainly to Fortune and Jackpot, Marlboro performed exceptionally, increasing its volume by 25%. Cigarette industry volume declined by 12%, due principally to the impact of excise tax-driven retail price increases at the bottom of the market in late 2015. Industry volume decreased by 13.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of further excise tax-driven price increases at the end of October last year. Effective January 1 of this year, the excise tax structure in the Philippines was reduced to one tier, with a specific rate of PHP 30 per pack. This completed the tax tier harmonization process, which saw weighted average excise tax increases of 33% on a compound annual basis since 2013. Based on current legislation, the specific rate is scheduled to increase by 4% annually, beginning in 2018. While we expect continued volume softness this year due mainly to the final step in the excise tax tier convergence, we remain positive about the long-term growth potential in this important market. In the Latin America and Canada region, strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth of 12.4% in 2016 was driven by higher pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada. Our original cigarette market share increased by 0.7 points, driven by Marlboro and supported by share gains in Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in 2016, due mainly to tax-driven retail price increases in Argentina and Brazil. We expect the industry volume declines in both markets to moderate in 2017. To close on 2016, I will highlight the favorable performance of IQOS across the many launch markets beyond Japan. While this performance requires some additional context given the smaller scale of the launches and the role of HeatSticks capacity constraints in the second half of last year, it nonetheless serves as a positive indicator of the potential for IQOS broadly. One measure that we closely monitor is the rate of IQOS purchasers who fully or predominantly convert to the product. Conversion rates have grown over time and at the end of 2016 stood at approximately 70% or higher. As a reminder, Japan only reached this level in May last year, over 18 months after launch. This confirms that IQOS resonates strongly with adult smokers who try it, irrespective of the market. We also clearly monitor HeatSticks off-take volumes. During the fourth quarter of 2016, estimated off-take volume in all markets with launches prior to mid-year grew at a compound weekly rate of over 6%, comparable to Japan during the initial launch phase. Such performance augurs well for our planned national expansions which, in Japan, had an accelerating effect. Turning now to 2017. We enter the year with positive momentum and favorable trends across many of our key geographies, although currency volatility remains an issue. As announced this morning, our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2017 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.70 to $4.85 versus $4.48 in 2016, and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.18. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency of approximately 9% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. We expect our currency-neutral financial growth to be slightly skewed toward the second half of 2017, reflecting the timing of HeatSticks capacity and phasing of RRP investments, as well as unfavorable cigarette industry volume comparisons with the first half of 2016, notably in Argentina, the EU Region, and Turkey. The $0.18 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates included in our 2017 guidance is driven primarily by the Turkish lira, Euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, partly offset by the Russian ruble. We've currently hedged approximately 40% of our 2017 forecast sales to Japan which, at prevailing exchange rates, translates to an effective rate of ¥ 114 to the U.S. dollar versus ¥ 111 in 2016. As I noted during last September's Investors Day, the advent of RRPs introduces some additional variables into the attractive and predictable growth equation of our industry. These variables are somewhat less range-bound and linear (18:48) given the emerging nature of the category, but also offer exponential upside. For this reason, we have widened our EPS guidance rates this year to $0.15. Our EPS guidance reflects net revenue growth in excess of our current currency-neutral annual growth target range of 4% to 6%. We expect this growth to be driven by two main factors: higher RRP volume, reflecting both HeatSticks and IQOS devices; and a favorable pricing variance. The anticipated pricing variance is equivalent to approximately 6% of our 2016 net revenues. As of today, we have implemented or announced over 60% of the pricing that is included in our guidance. Our guidance also reflects significant incremental investment behind the deployment of our RRP portfolio, partly offset by the judicious reallocation of resources from our combustible tobacco portfolio to RRPs in the relevant markets. For this year, we are targeting operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion, reflecting higher net earnings. We plan to use this cash flow primarily for capital expenditures to support the growth of our business and for dividends, at the board's discretion, to our shareholders. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion this year versus $1.2 billion in 2016. The projected increase is driven by higher investments to support RRP capacity expansion, notably for HeatSticks. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the ninth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 126% at the compound annual growth rate of approximately 11%. While we expect our combustible tobacco business to remain the primary driver of our financial results in the near term, our Reduced-Risk Products portfolio provides us with the single-largest opportunity to significantly accelerate the growth of our company and generously reward our shareholders. In 2017, the majority of our RRP commercialization focus will remain on IQOS. To-date, we have launched IQOS in key cities in 20 markets, as seen on this slide, and aim to expand nationally in many of these markets this year as HeatSticks capacity becomes available. We are also targeting launches in key cities in an additional 10 to 15 markets by year-end, subject to capacity. We began 2017 with approximately 15 billion units of installed annual HeatSticks capacity and expect over 32 billion units in total capacity to be available for commercialization this year. We continue to anticipate an installed annual capacity of approximately 50 billion units by year-end. We look forward to unleashing the true potential of IQOS once the pressure on HeatSticks capacity eases as the year unfolds. Moving to our other RRP platforms, we expect to conduct city tests for our Platform 2 heated tobacco product and our Platform 3 nicotine-containing product this year. We began the city test of our Platform 4 MESH vaporization technology in Birmingham, UK, late last year. And though still very early, we're pleased by the initial results and our related learnings thus far. In conclusion, 2016 was a pivotal year for PMI, reflecting exciting progress in our transformation from combustible tobacco products to Reduced-Risk Products focused company. We recorded strong full year currency-neutral financial results, driven by our combustible tobacco business and including an important net revenue growth contribution from RRPs for the first time. IQOS is performing exceptionally, with its most visible success in Japan, and high conversion rates and off-take volume growth broadly. As of year-end 2016, we estimate that approximately 1.4 million adult consumers have quit smoking cigarettes and converted to IQOS. Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2017 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hi, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, first, just in terms of 2017 guidance, it's now calling for 9% to 12% earnings growth. It's a little bit better than the 8% to 10% algorithm that you had given at the September meeting. So, can you just talk about what's changed in terms of thinking about 2017? And, obviously, you've talked about the IQOS contribution from a revenue standpoint. But are you expecting profit contribution to kick-in in 2017 from an IQOS standpoint?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. The reason, first of all, we increased the range, as I explained, is because there is obviously a bit more volatility as regarding the IQOS HeatSticks sales, but also our capacity. And that explains, more or less, the vast majority of the variability, I would say, okay. Clearly, IQOS is going to play a big role in our revenue growth next year and here, I would like to give some clarification for all the people on the call and broadly to understand. There is always in the revenues coming from – a part of the revenues coming from IQOS is due to the device sales. And as I said, this initial commercialization phase, the bottom line contribution of device sales is negative. And if we take 2016 as a proxy, if you look at total IQOS revenues, 22% of those revenues were linked to device sales. And just to give you another rule of thumb, for your own projections, if we look forward, and I would think that will work for the first year or two, obviously, of IQOS sales, if we have rapid expansion, you should count for every incremental billion sales of HeatSticks, roughly 300,000 to 350,000 sales of devices of IQOS, which have a negative margin. So, we cannot apply our current operating profit margins to the devices. That's all I want all of you to understand, okay. Having said that, clearly, IQOS will be an increasingly important contributor to our revenue growth. And also, we have to take into consideration there will be much more substantial cannibalization. As I said, 32% of the people switching into IQOS in Japan come from our own brand, and if we take European Union countries, we'll be north of 40%. That's why we said, as we approach this as one company and one business, we'll be reporting combined volumes, because it will be very difficult over time to split the two and calculate cannibalization rate. So overall, I think we have a very strong guidance for the year. That's really clear. And I'm very happy with – I don't know if I answered your question entirely or not.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. I think that's certainly helpful. Just, if I can follow up on Japan, André, just in terms of what you've seen post the Glo launch in Sendai, and how you think that that's impacting the broader – the heated tobacco category, as well as your market share performance in that market?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Well, first of all, it's a very good thing that other companies launched heat-not-burn and, in general, Reduced-Risk Products. Because I said many times, once you convince people to move out of cigarettes, then clearly, in my view, the better products in the new category will eventually succeed and prevail. It's very early days and, obviously, as in any test market, you also have some sales going – not staying in the city, but going somewhere else. But the results are fairly good. Now, this has not impacted at all the IQOS share, that continued to grow during the period, which to your point, outlines that there is a lot of demand for this new category in Japan. And that's very encouraging for all of us.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And then just finally, Jacek, does the inventory impact in the quarter – it sounds like you had a pretty positive impact in both Japan and Russia, maybe a 2-point of an impact. So, maybe just at the total company level, if you can quantify the inventory impact and how that will impact the 2017 combustible volume, if this reverses in the coming quarters? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Yes. I mean, Russia ended up with a higher inventory, but it was a pretty normal reaction to the price rollouts into the market. So, usually you hike a little bit the inventory, and I think some of this is going to unwind during the year. And the second thing on Japan is the more – look, we have a little bit, to be frank, and to link back to what André said, I mean IQOS volumes versus the combustible volumes in Japan is a little bit harder for us to predict. So, we might have some temporary disallocations of inventories to the sales there. I think we're going to correct that. But on the other hand, we ended up, frankly speaking, with almost no inventories for the IQOS combustibles – sorry, for the IQOS RRPs. So, I think you will see these corrections going forward into 2017.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hello.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. I guess, first question on IQOS, you've referenced it being present in 30 to 35 markets during 2017 or by the end of 2017. Is it possible to give a sense for how many markets you're targeting to potentially receive full investment in field sales resources, essentially the level of resources that you'd need to fully activate the IQOS platform and break through that 2% to 3% market share threshold as opposed to markets that you'll be in more than just an initial capacity?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. The first thing is we need to differentiate whether in these markets we do city productions or national launches, okay, because that absorbs capacity (31:17) resources. Now, as an overall picture for this year, clearly, there is substantial incremental investment in commercial expenses behind IQOS. Despite the fact that in the relevant markets, we have also reallocated resources from our existing business to IQOS because everybody will be doing IQOS for a national launch. So, overall, I think this is all in the guidance, bearing in mind that, you know, if we see more traction and we have the capacity, we may put even more resources behind during the year in terms of field forces and other commercial activities. And if we have capacity constraints, we may postpone some launches, and we all need to live with this variability because it's very difficult for me to predict precisely how this is going to unfold. But overall, the trend is extremely positive, and that's what is reflected in the guidance.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. Thanks, André. And, Jacek, I was hoping you could speak maybe at a general level to the potential impact of U.S. tax reform on the company. And I know there's a range of possibilities. The statutory rate may go down, that applies to your repatriation. You could have a territorial system where repatriation is tax free. Interest deductibility could be changed. So, I'm just curious how you'd contextualize the potential implications for PM?
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: You have mentioned all variables which are being discussed between the President Trump and the Republicans. We will have to see how this is going to reconcile. I think we'll be preemptive at this stage to give any more sound estimate. I mean, clearly – I mean a tax reform should allow – what we hear from the U.S. – I mean, it should allow for the different repatriation pattern to U.S. But we'll have to see what's going to happen. If you go to the note, I guess, 11 in our filings, I mean, you'll see we always break down how much tax we pay on a foreign basis – I mean how much the profit taxes we pay before repatriations to U.S. And the rate – the blended rate would be somewhere in the range 22%, 22.5%, that's the foreign taxes which we pay on our earnings, which we generate outside U.S. And then, obviously, to our effective tax rate, which you have today, you have to add the different various cost of the repatriations of this earnings to U.S. and, obviously, the top-up to the 35% statutory in the U.S. But whatever happens – I mean, we will not be able, with the current tax regimes staying as they are today, to go to the tax rate lower than this 22%, 22.5%. Okay. This is as the rule of thumb I would use.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, again.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, André and Jacek.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hi, Bonnie.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hi.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I guess my first question is on pricing, which was very strong during the quarter. So, I'm curious what you learned from consumer behavior by taking this much pricing, and then what your elasticity was, and then with pricing consistent across your different brands. In other words, I guess I'm trying to understand if you were able to maintain the same level of price gaps within your portfolio.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Well, there were a couple of price increases that came a bit earlier. In the Philippines we increased, if I recall correctly, in October. We came in the quarter. And in Turkey, the government adjusted the minimum excise-specific tax, effective January 1, we took the pricing a bit ahead of that. So, all these prices appear in the quarter clearly. There is nothing exceptional, it's in the normal course of things, okay. I think the pricing was more or less the same across segments in absolute terms in the majority of the market. So, there's no any particular opening of (35:50) that I can think about, and we have not seen elasticities changing. However, the only thing we need to observe now is Turkey, because in Turkey, if you take the beginning of 2016 to the end, we took TRY 3 per pack price increase, which is around 30% plus average and Turkey grew also because of the reduction of the contraband volume last year especially in the half of the year. So, we can expect a little bit of weaknesses, I would assume, given that magnitude of price increases. And I think we will recover as the year unfolds, that's at second half, but we will see softness in the first part of the year. But that's all I can say about this whole thing.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then I wanted to go back to something on your guidance that you mentioned, I just wanted to be clear. So, your guidance assumes that IQOS in total will still be breakeven. I think that's what you mentioned at your Investor Day, so I just wanted to clarify that. And then wanted to understand your plans for spending by IQOS or behind IQOS this year. And then maybe help us quantify how big of an increase you're anticipating, if you could do that.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. Yes, IQOS will breakeven towards the end of next year. If you remember – I'm sorry, this...
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Wait. Okay...
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: We're still in (37:31) in 2016.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: I'm sorry about that.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No, no.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: This year, okay, and we still have significant capacity constraints in the third quarter, if you remember.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: And then we have a very aggressive capacity build-up plan. And clearly, the whole volume is going to be skewed towards the second half of the year. This is also the reason that the first quarter is going to be probably the weakest in the year because we don't have the capacity but many European markets, for example, and others, are making all the investments ahead of the deployment in the first quarter and second quarter. So, that's how I see it unfolding during the year. And these are substantial incremental investments I can't quantify, but they're very substantial. The increment is much higher than this year. Okay.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just my final question, I'd be curious to hear from you guys the feedback you've been receiving from public health experts and then governments around the world given the success you've had with IQOS and the science you've been publishing. Anything you can share with us regarding conversations and progress you're making would really be helpful. Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Look, I can comment generally, and I also have direct contacts with a number of people. I think there is a positive momentum building, okay, and I must say faster than I personally anticipated. Now, as you know very well, there are still people that have not embraced the principle of harm reduction of the product and that will continue requiring a significant amount of work going forward. But I believe the trend is very positive and I'm very happy with the progress we're making. Okay. I'm not saying there will be no hurdles. I'm not saying there is not going to be difficulties. But I think the way we are received and the science is received is positive, very positive.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I just had a couple of questions for you, if I could. The first, and I hope this is not a repeat of earlier questions, but you talked about shifting resources from combustibles to RRPs, and I know you're probably trying to find the right balance across many of those markets. I'm thinking like a market like Japan, can you talk about how resources have shifted if that's a percentage or some measurement of that to explain how that shifts from one to the other? And then just to be clear, I'm sorry if I missed it, have you said how much your costs are up in 2017 and would that be inclusive of RRP investments?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. On your first question, okay, first of all, the allocation – the reallocation is done on the relevant market. We are not reducing resources in a market where we don't plan to launch RRPs and put them behind the RRPs. And the explanation is the allocation is based on the fact that, as I said in Investors Day, we try to get as fast as possible to the 2% or 3% market share that we believe is the tipping point to go from linear (40:48) expansion to exponential growth of IQOS because then, the consumers or the adopters of IQOS become the ambassadors of the product and the brand. So, it's market-specific and the amount of reallocation you do is also based on the competitive environment, the consumer dynamics and so on and so forth. So, there is no rule of thumb. And I don't remember exactly how much money we reallocated in Japan, but there has been a significant shift of things that are very measurable like your direct marketing budget. But also that's where it becomes a little bit more difficult, it's how really the time of a field force that exists is allocated between the two categories. Okay. In many markets, as I said, you need incremental ground forces during the initial period well and above the field forces we have. Because we've seen very clearly that the more people you put on the ground, the faster the reaction, as we see in Italy now, as we see in Switzerland now, more resources. In Italy, we've doubled the market share in just 10 weeks because now we have the resources on the ground. So, that's the rule of thumb. Now, as of the overall costs, clearly in 2017, we will be above our 1% to 3% more or less target because of all these deployments. Okay. So, the cost – but they're all in the guidance, by the way.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Chris, we have said – it's Jacek here, we have said that we look to grow the revenues above the 6% or the upper-end of the current (42:45) and clearly still we're lifting EPS. So, you could see that we are not diluting the margins. I think we should look for the year when we will have a small but still the margin expansion operating profit margin expansion, not to the tune which we had in 2016. André mentioned that there is a device sales in this revenue and, for a time being, they yield a negative margin. So, that's obviously dilutive. But the HeatSticks, and still the performance of the combustibles were both (43:18) 6% pricing. I mean, that should allow us for some margin expansion, say 10, 20 basis points, and we will see how the year unfolds.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just one other follow-up question, if I could, which is that, if you were able to get approval as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product in the U.S. in 2017, I'm just curious what that would mean to you in other international markets, in Japan? I'm obviously getting to – could you make a, or would you make, a claim and would that, for some reason, cause you to accelerate your investments in IQOS?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay, Chris. First of all, it is highly unlikely we will get approval for MRTP in 2017.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. As you know, the FDA gave a guidance that they would – may take X-days, but I mean that may take more time. What we believe is more within the 2017 realm, is the product authorization for the U.S. market without claims, okay. And we will submit that application, the PMTA application, in the first quarter this year, okay. Now, irrespective of the approval in the U.S. – the FDA approval obviously helps the credibility internationally, but it doesn't apply to Japan, okay.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: In Japan and other markets, our claim structure, as we said, follows the local legislation, but also the conclusion of our own science. So, what we communicate to the consumers is driven by local laws and our own science. And the FDA cannot be applied to these places. But, obviously, it will add credibility to their entire scientific dossier, and that's why it is important to us.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for your time.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. So, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on your go-to-market execution on IQOS for some of the newer markets that you've entered, perhaps Canada. If you could comment on the excise tax structure, retail footprint, and relative pricing versus combustibles? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. First of all, the first variable is clearly what marketing freedoms you have. Okay. What we learned, as I said for many markets, is in the initial phase, unless – until you get this critical mass, you need the right amount of people on the ground that talk to the consumers, explain the product, and help the consumers in the conversion. And as a general principle, as of this year, we will start introducing digital tools to – we are a little bit too manual and labor-intensive and we'll introduce, where the law allows, digital tools to help the conversion. And that is something we'll do everywhere, but the speed by which IQOS switching occurs depends also on the freedoms we have in the market. In Canada, you have very limited ability to communicate with consumers under the current regime. So Canada is going to take some time, okay. Clearly, the tax we received is more favorable than the tax levy on cigarettes in Canada. And pricing, I don't exactly remember, because depends on the State of Canada in which we go. But I think, in any case, we will be at the premium end of the market, okay. I think we're, yeah, we're premium like Belmont price. But in Canada, it varies from state – province to province, so I can't make a general comment. Okay. Did I answer your question?
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: You did. Thank you. And if I could just follow up, so of the 20 markets, is there any market where you have not gotten a favorable tax treatment?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: No.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Very good.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Jacek is the underlying factor (47:46).
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just one on the combustibles, if I could. In the EU, you guys called out the kind of anniversarying of a benefit from immigration as well as illicit. How do we think about kind of full-year industry volumes for the EU? And I think you called out some softness on the comps in the first half. But order of magnitude, how much is one-half versus two halves going to differ, do you think? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: For the moment, we assume that EU will go to its secular 2% to 3% decline rate this year. Okay, last year, we assumed the same, we had a positive surprise. But logically, it should go there, because we don't have the one-offs of immigration and so on. And, yes, the employment is getting better in Europe. The outlook in GDP growth is moderately better. But when you look at the whole thing, I have to assume, at this stage, 2% to 3% decline, okay, that's what we're working with. Now, just for you (48:55) on this quarter comparison, don't forget that in European Union countries, we have the implementation of the Tobacco Product Directive. And there are cutoff days for certain products, for 10s, for 20s, for 19s (49:07), so it has been a little bit of a rocky thing with trade loadings and unloadings, which should ease now as we move into this year, okay. So, yes, there will be some unfavorable comparisons at the beginning of the year, but that's how I see EU. We'll see as the year unfolds.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to touch on the Philippines. We know, about a week or two ago, your local competitor took some pricing, and you took pricing in the fourth quarter on Marlboro. Mix has been a big driver there, obviously, lifting Marlboro's share up. What do price gaps look like now, and can you sustain that trading-up momentum over the course of this year?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Look, our major competitor increased prices but they are implementing also some discounting schemes, so we still need to see the prices flowing through to the market, okay?. Plus, as you know, there are still a lot of non-tax-paid volumes and fake stamps on the market. But I'm very encouraged that the government seems to start moving in this direction but still we need to see it happening. Now, we increased the price of Marlboro and the per-stick price is theoretically PHP 3.50. In some places, it went up to PHP 4. We have to assume there will be some impact on Marlboro initially but, so far, it looks better than what we anticipate. So, I think the up-trading may stop for a while at the beginning, but it will continue over time because still, the price gaps are very attractive. Okay. The big problem in the Philippines that we had in 2016, in terms of low-end of the market volumes, will continue. Because with the implementation of our price increase, per-stick prices still went up at the bottom end and these are pretty substantial increases for low-income consumers. The good news is we don't see smoking incidence decrease, but we see a decrease in sticks per day, which means that once we get up stability now that we got the excise tax kind of convergence of the tiers done, I hope that over time, probably towards the end of this year, we'll start seeing some stability, and then daily consumption will start coming up to the previous level. But we have to assume conservatively, at least for the Philippines, the trend is not going to change in terms of volume for the year.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then on IQOS, you've touched on some of the capacity constraints. Sorry if I missed this. Can you just revisit – I believe you've been saying you thought that those capacity constraints would ease at the end of this quarter. Is that still the case?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Yes. But we start the year with 15 billion installed capacity which, if everything goes right, that gives you, mathematically, the equivalent of 1.2 billion per month, okay. And we'll ramp up the capacity to 50 billion at the year-end, but the average for the year is something around 32 billion given all these machines that are being installed assuming the plan goes into perfection. So, that's basically a variable. So, we'll have some constraints still in the first quarter, obviously. And we'll start getting more capacity as we move on, and we'll have the max capacity, obviously, in the fourth quarter of the year. And that will dictate, obviously, the pace of sales as well.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: We talked to consumers in Korea and Hong Kong who are getting product from Japan, obviously, because you haven't launched there yet. But do you expect to move into those markets sooner than later? Do you have any sense of what timing that might look like?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Yes, we have a plan, obviously.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: There are more markets where consumers are getting the product from other places, so...
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay. So, yes, I think Korea has very good potential given the characteristics of consumers and the market and, eventually, we'll be in this markets. But you appreciate I can't say exactly when.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: No. That makes sense. And then just one last one on Indonesia. We've seen the leaf crop there this year be hurt by bad weather. It looks like it's set to rebound very strongly next year. I know you have some ability to smooth – you at least have big inventories in leaf stocks. How much can you smooth any potential impact from the expensive leaf that might be coming through now? Is that any headwind there or do you have different ways to offset that?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: It's more of the cloves (54:12) than leaf – the leaf as well. I think we are able to amortize these shocks now because we have sufficient inventory. It's a bit tighter on the leaf, a bit better on the cloves (54:24), which...
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.
Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of few questions, if I can, just a little quick accounting one. When you put in the $733 million of sales, is that counting all of the IQOS, HeatSticks devices at full price with the discounts going through as cost of sales? Or is that actually the sort of net realizations?
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: It's the net realization. Discounts go into consumers and the trade will be deducted from obviously from the revenues. You have on a net basis net after allowances.
Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. And just out of interest on the sort of (55:10) fourth quarter sales, how much of that was actually do you think sold on a discount.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: It depends by the market. There are different schemes. Devices, they were all sold at the promotional price, on a discount. And the HeatSticks, you will have to go market by market, and the different stages, they might run different schemes. Usually, market at the beginning will have some small discount on the HeatSticks and then depends on the market situation, I mean, at the full price of cigarette price (55:43)...
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: It's mostly full price. In many markets you can't even discount the HeatSticks. It's illegal by legislation. So, it's mostly discounts.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: The (55:54) from the devices.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: It's the devices and that's why I caution everybody not to take this to the bottom line straight at the same margin as the rest because it's negative. But it pays off very quickly. It's pretty obvious. I mean, it...
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: And then just today the French sort of put out their price list today and obviously there has been some big tax increases going through. And yourself and one of your big competitors didn't change prices at all. What's the thinking behind that?
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Look, I cannot comment on pricing. You appreciate that. The only thing I can tell you is in France, given the structure of the excise tax that is all ad valorem essentially, it's not a big deal because the trade-off between volume and pricing is very often neutral. And that's the only comment I can make at least temporarily.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: I thought it was a turnover tax on the actual companies...
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: ...which works like an ad valorem component.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: The turnover of the distributors net of excise taxes, that boils down to a pass-on of around €0.18.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: €0.18? Okay. Awesome. Okay. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.
André Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Hi, Adam.
Operator: Adam, your line is open. Please state your question.
Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Well, we lost Adam.
Operator: There is no response from that line. At this time, I will turn the call to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas M. Rolli - Philip Morris International, Inc.: Well, thank you very much. That concludes the call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team. We're currently in Switzerland. And the next presentation will be at the CAGNY Conference on February 22 in Florida. Thank you again. Have a great day.

Analysts: Michael Lavery – CLSA Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo James Bushnell – Exane Pam Kaufman – Morgan Stanley Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs Chris Growe – Stifel Adam Spielman – Citi Thomas Russo – Russo & Gardner
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2016 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter of 2016 and comparing them to the same period in 2015, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full-year outlook and third-quarter results, and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third-quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release. Let me begin with our full-year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive. Moving to our third-quarter results, net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA Region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4.0%, excluding currency. Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all Regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets including those shown on this slide which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter. We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia, as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU Region. Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full-year 2016. Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS launch markets contributed to this growth. While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter, due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro's cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia Regions. Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full-year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%. Our Regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in four of the Region's top six markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain. In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment. In addition, this month the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted-average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted-average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%. In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize, and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalization on our cigarette share, and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches. iQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, these share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June. PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015. In North Africa, our third-quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during Investor Day. In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal. I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full-year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016, and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 tax increase has been lapped. In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full-year outlook remains strong. Thank you and I will be happy now to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Michael.
Michael Lavery: Could you just talk about Russia for a minute? We've seen the consumer there be pretty resilient in the past; you are now calling out some share pressure from pricing ahead of competitors. Are you seeing a change in the consumer approach and are they – is there any change in their willingness to spend? Especially, if so, could you give any sort of estimate of what you think the impact of the proposed tax increase might be as well?
Jacek Olczak: I'll start with the last part. I mean that the impact as I said is about RUB11 at pass-on so it's around the same level as we had last year.
Michael Lavery: I'm sorry, could I clarify? I guess I meant with that increase do you expect any different category impact this year versus last year next year versus this year?
Jacek Olczak: No, not really. I guess it's sort of the same increase as we had last year and there was this 1 percentage point change in ad valorem, but I don’t think it’s going to change the dynamics between the segments. What you see in Russia on the consumer level is, yes, the consumer is looking for value. He is looking for a value. No don’t question about it I mean that the premium segment, if at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean it will hold pretty strong pretty well. There is down-trading. We observe a down-trading in the market, but more between the mid and the value segments. This is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most frequent. We're also launching our own initiatives in this segment. So I guess also the share pressure which we have in Russia this year I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017.
Michael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And then, with respect to Japan I know it's maybe too early for you even to know but do you have a sense with the proposed indoor smoking ban, if that might apply to iQOS as well?
Jacek Olczak: Not at this level of detail that go into these discussions, but I can say that we have a number of places in Japan where the existing smoking bans have been lifted due to the fact that iQOS is not a combustible product; therefore, there is no burning, there is no smoke. So we will have to see how this is going to evolve. But in a current environment with the restrictions for smoking, et cetera, as you noted, iQOS continues to gain the penetrations in the markets, so I don't think it's going to stall the growth prospects of iQOS in Japan.
Michael Lavery: Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: My first question has to do with your volume and I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the declines in the quarter. And then what gives you the confidence that you are going to still be able to hit the down around 3.9% for the full-year? Then curious to hear how that compares with your expectations for the industry volume for the full-year?
Jacek Olczak: We wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the investors day. I think the trends are pretty much known at this stage I think there's some improvement will continue into the 2017. Specifically to us, I think and then I start maybe with the Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast, obviously to the price increase. I think this high inflationary environment somehow, somehow helps. So I think sequentially we should see some less of the pressure from the volumes coming from or the clients from Argentina, Algeria which created quite the pressure on our volumes in Marlboro including Marlboro this year, we start seeing the first signs of recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line we crossed the lowest point. I think already in Q4 and going into 2017 I think the pressure from Algeria and North Africa should ease Indonesia. I think the tax proposal, which came from the Ministry of Finance is manageable. You're looking for the just tax pass-on of about say 10% versus the 15% increase which took place this year, so I think this should be helpful. In additions to the fact that I think at least judging for the last few quarters performance of our share there, I think we should have a less – in fact, all share losses in 2017 than this year and hopefully on a bit stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because it's all questions: how much we manage our mix to the positive territory. And so far we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow and it's a very strong growth. Actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while. Even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market, I think we would be fine with this. Pakistan, which also put quite a dent in our volume this year – it's presumably the most difficult to predict the market, because of the other forces which obviously play a role there. The contraband I think recently has reached about a third of the market, so the question is: where is the level of separation and that's it or we can expect worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact. It doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So and Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side, but comparable, like we had this year. And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share declines, so next year I guess on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that was really helpful and I appreciate that. Then I do have another question I guess on your other brand volume, which was down considerably in the quarter. So I was hoping you could talk a little about your strategy with some of these brands. You touched on having a greater – you remember at the investor day you touched on having a greater focus on a fewer number of brands going forward, so I guess I'm assuming this is consistent with the sharper declines we have been seeing for some of the smaller brands. And I guess I was also hoping you could confirm that although these brands are declining rapidly, they are contributing nicely to margins as they are likely promoted less.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, these brands will, in most cases, actually have a pretty low margin. The two big brands which are in our categories is to be a fortune, and very much a Jackpot in Philippines. So these are the brands which have a near zero sort of the margin territory and a lot of consumers are going from these brands to Marlboro, so we actually, through the positive mix, are improving pretty fast our financial situation there – our financial results there. We will have also brands in Indonesia in this other category which are not necessarily on the higher end of the margin spectrum. So I would rather say brand like a Jackpot in the Philippines we would presumably treat or we are actually treating this more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand which we do manage and we stay focused, but we do also recognize that, at least at this stage, Marlboro due to the closer of the price gap is a more attractive proposition for the consumer. And we are absolutely fine with that. In Indonesia, many of these local brands are the brands which we do support but we also try to focus on what is less dilutive to our margins.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then maybe my final question, Jacek. You guys definitely walked through iQOS a lot at your investor day, but could you possibly highlight a few possible updates in the last few months on the improvements you've seen with conversion and maybe cannibalization rates?
Jacek Olczak: Conversion, I don't I have a fresher number than what we have showed at investor day. There may be a few numbers which I still remember because some of these KPIs we are tracking weekly or even more frequently. I think at Tokyo – if you might remember, the Tokyo market share of the offshore at the investor day which we shared was 7%. We now stand at 7.3%, so we continue to growth and the same is for Japan. I think a national off take share the last week or the third week of September which we have shared during the investor day. 5.2 now turns to be 5.5. You see the pretty rapid share advancement; you’re talking 20 basis points, 30 basis points in a span of a couple few weeks. I have the same in Italy. When I think the share in Italy, the launch area was 60 basis points, 0.6. And now I think we lifted this last week of – sorry, first week of October I think the reading would be 0.8. Switzerland we lifted from 0.4 to 0.5. The penetration rate, the number of devices sold continues to grow. So I think in all geographies, from the top of my head, there was a continuous growth momentum very much in line of what we have shared with the investors at investor day.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
James Bushnell: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
James Bushnell: I have two questions, please. The first one is on iQOS in Japan. Clearly, you have limited the expansion because of the supply constraints you have. I just wondered if you could give us an estimate of what proportion of consumers don’t have access to the product right now and whether the existing users over-index to smokers of a particular strength or taste of cigarettes. That was my first question.
Jacek Olczak: We see less and less of a proportional representation of former Marlboro smokers compared to the underlying share of Marlboros. But, clearly, the iQOS is making more or less significant inroads into the competitive combustible portfolio. Now how much really we have left unhappy consumers in Japan at this stage, I know that they are waiting release. I know that the consumers have to enroll by name of this release, but to be frank, I don’t have a number at this stage. The number is somewhere, but clearly we will see how much of that backlog, if you like, of unserved consumers we will have the moment when we leave the cup which we estimate to happen somewhere in the end of the Q1 next year when we will be very comfortable with our HeatSticks supply. But my gut feeling is we’re not talking about a 5% or 10% unsatisfied demand. I think the number is much higher than that.
James Bushnell: Okay, great. Thank you. And then my second question, more of a modeling one, which is your associate and minority lines moved quite a bit since Q2. I just wondered if the numbers we are looking at in Q3 we could consider as more normalized, post some of the changes you’ve had in those areas.
Jacek Olczak: I think so. There might be some movement. I think Russia should be – the Megapolis should be okay. I think maybe there’s some movement in North Africa around some of the structures which we have in Egypt, but I think we should be pretty much in line of what we could expect there. There are some currency – the currency movements might have an impact on this line. As you know, we have had some exposure in Egypt on the – we have to take a dollar exposure in Egypt and there are some limitations in availability on the dollars in the country, so we might have some distortions of these lines coming from North Africa, Egypt as I mentioned.
James Bushnell: Okay, great. Understood. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
Pam Kaufman: Hi, this is actually Pam Kaufman on for Matt. I just wanted to ask on pricing, it improved sequentially to about 6.5% but needs to accelerate further to reach your benchmark of 6% for the full year, and presumably would help bridge the gap to strong fourth quarter earnings growth. Can you review where you have seen incremental pricing recently that would allow you to deliver on this target for the full year?
Jacek Olczak: We should have in Q4 of this year the strongest pricing variance compared to all the quarters. We are looking in well in the north of $500 million pricing variance in the quarter and actually maybe even closer to $600 million. We should have – all-in-all in the fourth quarter we should expect above the 10% uplift on the revenue quarter on quarter. On an ex-currency basis. As I said, this – the growth in the fourth quarter, on the one hand, will be coming from the favorable comps which we have on the cost, while we still continue spending obviously more behind in iQOS, but this is more on the combustible part of the spending compared to the Q4 last year. But we also are looking into – we expect to have quite a significant uplift in the net revenue and corresponding contributions to the bottom line.
Pam Kaufman: Okay, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi, Olczak.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: So my question is on actually the mix impact, because in addition to pretty healthy pricing, it sounds like the third quarter also benefited from strong mix. So how much is this geographic mix impact? And then, when you think about the impact on iQOS, either on price mix, is there a way to kind of quantify how that would’ve impacted either the price or mix in the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: The raise is doing well so obviously due to the margin, geographical margin split – on a geographical basis the mix is working in our favor. If you go into individual countries, the countries with the worst mix in the quarter were actually Indonesia and, if I recall, actually was UK. But overall – but that’s it essentially. When it comes to iQOS, yes, obviously we’ve already start adding the support to the revenue growth and it’s going to be even stronger in Q1 of this year already. I guess when we close the year we will start talking more about the financial impact of iQOS, at least at the revenue level, but there is already some volume impact. You know we have a capacity of about $7 billion available this year. We sold a bit less than $4 billion, so I think we’ve been very transparent what one can expect from the volumes of iQOS in the fourth quarter and that’s going to help lifting the revenue growth quite a bit.
Judy Hong: Okay. So if we think about it, I think iQOS added about 1% to your total volume so the revenue impact would’ve been higher in the second quarter? I’m so sorry, in the third quarter.
Jacek Olczak: Well, the pricing is at the Marlboro level, as you remember, plus remember in the revenue line we also have devices because we are selling the devices as well. So you have an uplift from the volume at the Marlboro price in a given geography, plus obviously the taxes and also the price at which we have – the volume at which we’re selling the devices to consumers. They both contribute to the revenue.
Judy Hong: Okay. Then just, in Japan, it seems like your obviously contribution from iQOS is still very strong, but your combustibles share has also gotten better. So can you just walk through how sustainable that scenario of actually seeing combustible improvement plus the iQOS contribution? Because it sounds like maybe Japan your volume would have been up high single digit, ex inventory, if you add the iQOS volume.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, I think if you will take the full-year impact, iQOS clearly is already a significant contributor to our business there. Look, I have to actually thank you for raising these questions, because I should say how proud we are that in one year we managed to sort out the share pressure on our conventional business in Japan, despite the fact that part of that share we had to gain through the cannibalization to iQOS and, in addition, we saw successful with iQOS. I think the market share – the biggest dynamics now which you will have in a market I guess is the cannibalizations in both months between a combustible category, including own portfolio and iQOS. But the share leakage which we have to other taste segments or new taste segments, it seems at this stage that we have very successfully addressed. So it’s pretty remarkable results actually for our Japanese organization.
Judy Hong: Okay. Then just finally on currency. I know at the investor day you talked about currency in 2017 being less of a headwind versus 2016. So just if we kind of hold spot rates at these levels, is there any kind of guidance you can give? A little bit more specific guidance on 2017, particularly around the yen, just given your hedged strategy?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, I guess two questions actually. Sorry, two facts which would help maybe better predict the currency on your side of ocean. On the right is your elections impact decision about the interest rates so I am a little bit more remote from this one. I guess the number of currencies, if I look at how currencies were playing against us this year – and remember we started Q1 I guess it was at $0.19, Q2 we were $0.08 on EPS, Q3 we are $0.04. So clearly we could see that the number of currencies started to put less pressure on us. A currency, which I singled out during the investors day, which many of us sometimes tend to forget, we had some exposures in North Africa and in particular in Egypt. So the Egyptian pound is a little bit of the worry. I don't know how they are going to relax the currency rules and how much it's going to translate into the devaluation. Other than that ruble is doing pretty okay. Euro, Japanese yen, some of you know that we hedge; we already hedged some positions in 2017, but the yen already started to contribute positively in the last few months, in the last quarter definitely. So – I – we’ll have to wait until February when we will be post elections, post the Fed's decision and presumably these two big unknowns will be removed we will see how the market price the currency at that time.
Judy Hong: Okay thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Chris.
Chris Growe: Good morning. I had just two questions, if I could. I wanted to ask first of all, as we think about iQOS in Japan in particular and just given the constraints you have to your capacity right now, should we foresee further market share expansion in that market? Or are you kind of at a limit right now on how much you can sell in that market incrementally?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we are still selling devices, not to the level where there is the demand for the device. As you know, without the device you cannot trigger the consumption of HeatSticks. But we somehow manage the growth or limiting the growth to the corresponding growth in the available production volume which we have. The capacity which we have, 7 billion, this year is not the 7 billion divided by 12 in equal installment per month. It's very much in adding back. So the peak of this annualized capacity is going to be in December this year. So, yes, we can add some devices, but we are not satisfying the whole demand for the devices from the consumers. And this demand is a default is newcomers – people who want to leave the combustible category, quit smoking and they move to iQOS, to heat not burn – but also existing consumers who want now a second device, et cetera, because they, for the convenience, whatever other purposes, they want to have more devices. By the way we are selling more devices week after week, quarter after quarter but not the extent or the demand is for the devices in the market.
Chris Growe: Okay. Then my second question, just in relation to volumes overall, there was a lot of timing differentials in certain markets this year. Did overall the timing differential lead to a plus or a minus for volume this quarter? Do you have a good sense of what volume would have been?
Jacek Olczak: I don't think a quarter is actually a good way of looking at things. There's always distortions. If I take nine months this year, year to date, I think the total distortion, if I remember, were in the tune of 200 million units by total volume. It's a lot of things which will net of over the period time, the timing of the shipments, the inventories, et cetera. If I take Q3 on the year-to-date basis versus Q3 year-to-date basis last year I think the total due to the shipment, timing of the shipments inventories would be about 200 million units.
Chris Growe: Units, okay. If I could add just one quick one, in terms of the next nine or 10 markets where you have to announce for the launch of iQOS, should we expect that to come soon or would that be a separate announcement or? Certainly by the end of the year you indicated you wanted to be in 20 markets, correct?
Jacek Olczak: Yes
Chris Growe: Okay
Jacek Olczak: But we’ve added recently Denmark. I think we added – we're about adding Holland, Canada I think we talked about this I think at investors day. It's getting dynamics to this point that I think we will be more giving of updates on a quarterly basis, what we have done in a quarter, than proactively start talking where we go because it's becoming a little bit like a map of United Nations.
Chris Growe: Right. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman: Thank you for taking my question.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Adam.
Adam Spielman: I just want to be a little bit – make sure that I have understood what's happening in the fourth quarter correctly. If I've understood it correctly, you said, first of all, there will be pricing variance of close to $600 million and then on top of that there will be benefits from reduced costs, firstly, relating to the European Tobacco Products Directive and, secondly, less spending on reduced-risk products. And then, finally – and I'm just checking that I heard you correctly – your spending on conventional products will not change. Is that correct? In the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter?
Jacek Olczak: You are almost correct, but not fully correct. The pricing variance will be up to the $600 million – $500 million plus up to $600 million you’ll have about $500 million or so in the comps. Not necessarily it means that the costs will be get down, but in the comps, Q4 on Q4, you will have in debt $500 million higher spending on iQOS, or RRPs, but less spending in that quarter on combustibles. But I think, for modeling purposes, I would just think you all have uplift in revenue through the price and support of the volume coming from either some improved trends, but very much for the iQOS and better comps on the cost Q4 on Q4.
Adam Spielman: Can you just – less spent on combustibles; is there any way of quantifying that, sort of percentage change?
Jacek Olczak: No, but look, we have taken some costs ahead of the tobacco product directive implementation – there were some related costs in a number of markets in the EU. We accelerated that spending in Q4 2015 and most of these initiatives have already taken place. And in many countries the tobacco product directive now is in the physical product implementations in the shops of all infrastructure retooling of machines and all the other associated costs that have already been incurred. Therefore, optically it looks like we have less spending on combustibles in Q4, but this is in comparison to Q4 last year.
Adam Spielman: Okay, thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Russo & Gardner.
Thomas Russo: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Tom.
Thomas Russo: Hi, can you just remind us what the year-end likely capacity will be for iQOS stick productions end of 2016, end of 2017, and end of 2018? If you can give some measure of those. And did you say that the production lift that we are looking at present will kick in by the end of January of next year? And if so, when do you think you release the restrictions on device sales in Japan and other markets if we're up and running by the end of January?
Jacek Olczak: I think the release on the cap on devices will happen towards the end of Q1 next year – of 2017. Capacity is always two numbers to – it's a pretty dynamic situation the two numbers to remember. We have available total capacity this year over 7 billion, but in December annualized, our capacity times 12, is 15 billion.
Thomas Russo: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: From December that wants to figure it out, what is my underlying capacity for the month of January, for example? The first month after December it's 15 divided by 12. And then we adding 15 January, February and every month after that, so we will have a commercial capacity for the full year of 2017 of 32 billion, hopefully a bit more than 32 billion, and we will close 2017, i.e., December with 50 billion capacity. If you take January 2018, my monthly capacity is 50 divided by 12.
Thomas Russo: Perfect.
Jacek Olczak: But if you remember then will be in the mode that we can add 4 billion capacity per month, if needed, if we start committing the capacity in the early part of 2017.
Thomas Russo: Yes, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Thomas Russo: Perfect.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR team, thank you again. And Have a great day.

Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance therefore now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. Consequently, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed toward the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April. Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3% excluding estimated inventory movement due in large part to decreases in low margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. These markets accounted for approximately two points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8% respectively excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia regions, as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7% excluding currency. Our favorable pricing variance of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month we received approval from the Minister of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by ¥10 per pack effective August 1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenue. Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin American and Canada regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA region. Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU region declined by a modest 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the four favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015 with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast a decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%. Our cigarette market share in the EU region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in four of the region's other largest markets by industry volume where Marlboro's share increased. In Germany, the share decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movements, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M, leaving its round €5 price point in 2015. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as adult smoker downtrading to the mid and super low price segment. Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5% excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. In the EEMA region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1% excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth consistent with our full year target. Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market shares decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitor's price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast the full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%. Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volumes supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA region came despite negative volume mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitcal instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro. In Algeria specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax driven price increases earlier this year, and the lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. In the Latin American and Canada region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter, due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, following a significant excise tax increase in May which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partially offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada. Turning now to the Asia region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4% excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume mix and higher cost related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015, related to distributor inventory movement. For the full year, we are targeting original adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. Our positive full year outlook for the Asia region is supported by favorable developments in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower priced brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix. In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite the cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%. In Japan, we're also seeing signs of stabilization in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movement. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap of the leading brand in the market, while recent launches such as Lark 7.0 Splash Purple in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum. I will now cover iQOS beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national roll out in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more than double its first quarter share. Giving the success of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016. The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates two other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalization from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we begin to the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in uptrading as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product. The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlighted potential in our other launch market which today are in earlier stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch market. Chart highlights our weekly indexed offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year. The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rate in both Italy and Switzerland consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in ten markets by the end of June, following this commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year. In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets. Total cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan. We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with our launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow, broadly in line with last year's level. The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 report to diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. Thank you, and I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Jacek, I just wanted to ask two questions about guidance, I guess. One, just from a volume perspective, in the past, you've talked about an expectation for volume declines down 1% to 1.5%, and the industry down 2% to 2.5%. Obviously, you're down about 3% in the first half, so just have your full year expectations changed? And when we look at the impact of a few large excise tax increases like Argentina and Algeria has the excise environment in any way shifted or become more challenging?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: First, on the volume, look, I think at this stage, I think we prefer to say that we will likely, very likely miss our volume expectations, initial expectations for the year. I think we'll come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which – 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies which not necessary put a big pressure on our bottom line, but it's – at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year. This obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think initially we say that the industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5%. I think industry might be lower by 2.5%, but we'll have to see, okay, just to be on the cautious side. Now, when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is I think at this moment we could see the impact on the volume, and I think it may continue for some time. Maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary market. I guess the time will be – will help the consumers to accommodate to the price level, I would argue faster than in other situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything which would be a very disturbing on excise increase. And in Algeria, it's much more – the whole context of North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the borders in the individual market countries there. Plus we have a specific-to-us issue which I highlighted in my remarks connected with the rollout of Architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had – I have to admit the first market in which we've been confronted with the less or lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have rolled out new Marlboro to a hundred plus markets, and this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds from the beginning of the year. We're obviously working on addressing that thing with marketing perception program, but it may take us some time to address it. So, hopefully, part of that improvement we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Jacek. And I guess thanks for clarifying on the volumes. As far as the EPS guidance, you reiterated 10% to 12%, but it seems like it's going to be around 2% through the first nine months, so that, just based on our rough numbers, suggests about 50% growth in Q4 and basically would imply maybe that the margins are similar throughout the year, rather than stepping down in Q4. So I guess mechanically I can see how it works, but if the comparison to last year's elevated spending in fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year, so in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any other specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to, just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Look, for the full year, we said that our total cost, conventional combustible cigarettes and RRPs will not be higher than 1% excluding currency full year 2016 versus full year 2015. Now, for part of this cost and the timing of the cost increases year-on-year are more in the beginning of the year rather than the second half of the year. So, when we enter into Q3, but Q4 very much, we really will have very favorable comparisons not only on the cost line, also on the revenue. I just want to remind that, you may remember the number presumably very well, where the EPS minus almost 4% in Q4 last year, so I mean it clearly will come very strong, with very strong growth this year. And then it just happened, this is a phasing and a timing of the quarters, partially the comp, partially the events of the current year, how we're going to make it. Look, we're very confident of achieving 10% to 12%. But do understand that the pacing of the quarters is not maybe ideal, but the year has four quarters and we're working on delivering the 10% to 12% EPS growth, ex-currency.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I wanted to circle back with a quick question on the volume deceleration you mentioned in the year. You are now expecting shipment volume to be worse than you originally anticipated, so I guess I'm curious to hear from you, what is offsetting the weaker volume to give you the confidence to maintain your currency-neutral EPS guidance of 10% to 12%? And should we assume growth will be closer to the lower end of that range, given the weaker volume?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Look, it's a difficult question. Thank you, because actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS. That the volumes which we did the guidance or the expectations for the volume which we share obviously on combustible cigarettes, and as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we started selling quite a significant volume of iQOS which are not included in this number. Now, clearly, iQOS sales or HeatStick sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines which we have on the combustible business. That's on a positive side, will not fully offset because we have a capacity limitation on the HeatSticks which I will cover in a second. Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes, which we – may come short this year. They're coming from the relatively lower margin places except for Algeria, where we have a problem with Marlboro. And in the Pakistan volumes or Philippines volumes, they count in statistics, if you like, but they're not really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines, because the market is losing and we're losing the extremely low margin volumes or zero margin volumes at the bottom of the market and we're having some positive recovery through the mix for Marlboro. Now, coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total PMI for iQOS in the quarter to 1.6 billion. They're almost four times higher than what we had in the first quarter, so we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have unlimited capacity. You might remember, we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by a billion or so this year, but I wouldn't expect any further miracles on the capacity this year, and we may continue with some pressure on capacity for the beginning of this year. We are right now revising our CapEx plans, and we, in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plant which we're building in Italy in order to be able to satisfy the market demand.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And I actually did want to ask you also about what you're seeing in Japan with iQOS. You called out in the press release your combustible cig share in Japan was 25.8%, and then for iQOS, your HeatSticks, I should say 2.2% and you noted that your combined national share in Japan is 27.5% which is a nice share gain of over two share points versus the year ago period. So I was hoping you could talk about the rate of cannibalization from iQOS that you're seeing, it seems maybe low. And are you seeing lower cannibalization in Japan, for instance, versus other markets? I'd just love to hear sort of the differences in cannibalization rates by market.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: We did, and we do indeed see a better cannibalization, i.e. lower cannibalization rate in Japan now as we had six or so months ago. So I had the numbers and mentioned the numbers in my remarks. I mean that's a pretty nice improvement. And we see the same in other places, okay, in other markets outside Japan, although obviously, we're in a much more focused smaller territories, et cetera. Now Japan's share which we have disclosed today allowed us to leave the total corporate share, i.e., for both combined territories by more than two points. I think that's significant especially in Japan. Now, what's more important, if you look at the exit shares of June, so if I take the last week, the last two weeks, how it's been accruing in Japan, we have crossed the five points, 5% share of market mark in Tokyo, okay. And we're still growing. So I mean the volume growth is somewhere in the range of about 20% plus on a monthly basis. So we could see the push, we could see the consumers coming to iQOS stores and to other places in which devices are available. Almost fully prepared, fully, one could say converted already to the use of iQOS as the conversion rates are doubled of what we had at the beginning of our iQOS journey in Japan. We estimate, Bonnie, that at this point in time, we must have about 600,000 exclusive or fully switch users of iQOS in Japan, essentially translated the 600,000 people in Japan who quit combustible smoking and they fully adopted iQOS. I think it's spectacular.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great to hear. Thanks for the color there. And just one final question, if I may, on your margins. Your operating margins were down 200 bps in the quarter. So I guess I'm trying to understand what some of the key drivers of the margin contraction were? Also curious to understand why margins were down this much, considering your volume declines that you mentioned in the quarter were really mainly in the low margin geographies. So I guess I would have assumed you would have had a little bit more of a positive mix there?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: I think the inventory comps in which we had, and the shipments driven comps which we had in Japan were very much behind the PMI and the Asia margins. I mean you're talking about 1.9 billion difference in the shipments in Japan on the conventional cigarettes, on the combustible cigarette, and this would clearly give you the impact just from that in the north of $70 million. So I think that is what we've been missing. We have – the way we're looking at this thing also is lifting the margins Q2 to Q1 because we ended up Q1 with not so great margins and I think sequentially we're going up, and I think we will have more of the margin improvement for the year when the pricing realization is getting usually stronger in a number of places. We have much better situations with the pricing in Ukraine which relative to a lot of other margins in Q1, a bit less or much less in Q2. And I think that things are going in the right direction. And as I said, I mean some of the volume headwinds which we have going forward, except for Algeria, they're not really coming from a high unit margin countries.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Jacek, I wanted to ask about pricing. In 2Q, your pricing variance of $344 million is still tracking a bit below kind of the full year run rate. So I know you called out a couple of factors, but maybe if you can just quantify the key drivers. And then it sounds like you're still expecting a 6% pricing variance for the full year which implies a big acceleration in the back half, so just wanted to get your comfort level around that. And then related to that, you also called out some increased promotional support on iQOS, it sounds like in Japan that kind of hurt pricing, so maybe you can give us some more color on that as well.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. I think the first half of the year Q1, a bit of Q2, is still impacted by Korea, right, so the price realization obviously looks at the lower level due to the comps. And as we had quite significant price reductions in Ukraine at the beginning of the year which I just mentioned a moment ago is phasing out and the situation is improving. So Korea impacting the outer quarters is no longer there, negative drag is no longer there. Ukraine should get better, plus we have a pricing which was taken in the quarter. So I think we'll have more of the realizations. Indonesia always plays a significant role, because beginning of the year, they're not really in the net price increases. Now they're moving into the positive price territories. So I think the 6% is achievable and I think we feel confident about this. There is a pricing – some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we have reduced in the end, per device discount, due to the higher volume of the devices which we're selling, I mean that puts a little bit of a negative on the pricing variance due to the allowances behind iQOS. But on the other hand, you always pre-sell devices first and then the HeatSticks with the adoptions rate are following very soon. And the HeatSticks actually are bringing the whole margin to the business. I think that's on a positive side.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I was hoping to get a little bit more color on Russia. I think your industry volume forecast is now a little bit better, down 7% for the full year. But it seems like your market share trends have worsened, particularly in kind of the low- to mid-priced brands. So, when you compare the situation this year versus last year where you were actually gaining share, what sort of changed in terms of the market share performance? Is it kind of your decision to not be as aggressive in the low- to mid-priced brands from a pricing perspective? Has the competitive landscape gotten worse? So just color on Russia.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: No. I think from the beginning of the year, we observed a bit of lower or slower price implementation from competition. So, yes, I mean I think I have said already in Q1 that we might feel some share pressure in Russia. We just stick to our plan and then we target double-digit OCI growth and I think we can deliver on that. I mean a part of this share pressure is literally the timing of the price implementation. So I don't think there is anything fundamentally broken with the brand. It's just the temporary opening of the price gaps in the market. So I wouldn't be too much worried about this. On the positive side, I mean, you remember, initially, we thought that the market with this price in mind should stay about a 9% or so decline since the elasticity continues to be on the more positive side for us. So I think 7% is the recent outlook for the industry volumes. I think we should be okay. Also, important is that we see a guidance-to-guidance improvement on global exchange rates. So I think that the whole pressure on the Russian economy is a little bit less which is improving a bit than initially we thought.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So just if I can clarify, the pricing, the timing of the price increases and the competitive actions, are, at this point, all of your competitors now in line with your pricing?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: They're all in line with the pricing but if I would be – for example, 80% of price implementations, coverage of the product with the new price in every retail outlet in Russia, competitions might be at the 60% or 50%.It's just rolling out the prices. The price increase does not just happen at the one day in all outlets, okay. Shipping the old product, new product, more of the new product, the new priced product. This is a typical price implementation in Russia, and actually in many other places as well. So we just see that the prices which they implemented in the market are in line with – if you like our pricing. It's just they have less of distribution, if you like, of their product with the new prices than us in a given moment in time. So, obviously, in this outlet, when the price gap is opening, at least temporarily, some of our brands might feel pressure.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's clear. And then just last question, just quickly on currency. So, on the yen, obviously it has been a big favorable move in the last few months, so wanted to just get an update on your hedged position on the yen? How much you're covered for this year, and what the effective hedge rate is for this year?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, with the forecasted cash flows, et cetera, from Japan for this year, we are about 70% hedged, and I think it was the first quarter in a long time when effective rate of the yen this quarter was by a bit but better than the effective rate of a yen the same quarter last year. So we're essentially moving the yen into positive territory.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Look, just wanted to follow up on iQOS. Sorry to belabor the point, but certainly your results are very encouraging. As we think about the outsized demand that you're seeing in Japan, how has that influenced your outlook for spend more broadly in the 20 markets that you're targeting?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we're still aiming at commercializing iQOS in the 20 cities market by the year-end. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean we have to bear in mind that we don't have a fully available capacity, and we are today in a situation that we have a national coverage – the only place where we have a national coverage is Japan. And we know that those who switch to iQOS, so 600,000-plus consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out-of-stock because they themselves told us that after two or three weeks of smoking iQOS, they actually don't want to, don't like to and they cannot switch back to cigarette. So we're a little bit trapped now in this situation that we have to make sure that Japan has a continuity of supply before we start put foot stronger on the pedal in other places. So we're preparing our iQOS stores. I think by now we have more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies obviously including Japan. We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force to the whole commercialization, so we can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, throwing more resources would just generate a higher demand. And we are not in a situation where when we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work. The second market which is close to national expansion, not full expansion, is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we started moving, if you remember the market share in the German part, I think we grew the volumes in that part by about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. I think we crossed about a 2% market share at the end of Q2. So it's not in our interest now, knowing that we don't have a continuity of supply at this moment, to push too much on iQOS.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. And just to follow up on that. When you're referring to kind of national distribution, should I understand that to mean that you've got kind of 100% of your targeted retail penetration in a market like Japan or you're getting close to that in Switzerland? Or are there more stores you that want to enter?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Japan I guess is fully covered now. I mean there may be a few outlets, okay. We have some limitations on the device sales because the only way we can manage the constraints on the HeatStick capacity is to limit the iQOS device sales. And actually to be frank, in all outlets in Japan, key accounts, general trade, et cetera, there are the purchase limits per store. And I think we're shipping the product only twice a week with very limited quantities in order to stop or slow down the conversion because it will result in a higher demand for the HeatSticks. And the HeatStick is a bottleneck which we have for now. And the same applies, to large extent, to other places. Now if I compare Switzerland, I think iQOS is now available in 200-plus outlets. So we're not really in the full national coverage in any of these places. Moscow, we're in a couple of stores. We have one store in Lisbon. So it's really very small. But if I look at the volume trend which you might remember from my presentation a few minutes ago, the volume trends are extremely encouraging. I mean you have a truly exponential growth.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: It's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. Just coming back to currency, I know it's early to look ahead to next year. But in our numbers, it looks like you've actually got a slight tailwind which of course we haven't really talked about for a long time. Just very roughly, does that seem accurate? And I guess related to that, can you just remind us some of your thinking about if and when you would consider resuming buyback?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, Michael, look, I wish I knew what the currency's going to be next year. But let me put that way, we had headwind on the currency for the last three years. So I think it would be very fair if some of this headwind converged into tailwind to us. Now once we have a strong tailwind on the currency, I think we might be then only in the situations to reconsider the buyback.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Would it be fair to say that you want to be careful so that you don't resume buybacks just to have to suspend them again? Is that part of how you think about it?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we'd rather – I think if we were to arrange the buyback, we would like to see the positive outlook for the next few years, so have something of the, I guess more longer lasting program than just one quarter or one year with the buyback. Remember, our focus always more strategically is on the dividend and creating the room for the dividend growth. And buyback comes – after all of other opportunities to invest, I mean buyback will come last.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then back on iQOS, can you remind us when full capacity comes online? I think you've said the end of this year, but how specific can you be? And then related to that, you have acceleration in, looks like every market, especially Japan which is the biggest, if that continues, is it possible you might need to postpone the other 10 markets that you expect to launch in this year just to be able to keep servicing the ones where you're already present?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, the other markets which we have in a plan for this year is they will – I think postponing the market would delay the entire commercializations. And we know that as of Q1, Q2 latest next year, based on our sales forecast obviously, we should be in a comfortable capacity territory. So I think we rather let the market go as we had per plan. One iQOS store will not put that much of a stretch initially on our capacity which is very mindful in the developments in Japan because that's every few percentage error on the forecast which we have translates into tens of hundreds of millions of HeatSticks. And this is where the focus is for the time being. Capacity, the initial plan of the building, the factory for 30 billion, we're actually accelerating that delivery of that capacity. And as I said, as of Q1, we should month-by-month see the progression in available capacity, but this is obviously confronted with the pretty steep growth curve which we have in Japan. So we have a little bit of a vicious cycle on this side, but we're right now also working on resolving that problem.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: But so just to clarify, I think you've got the 5 billion to 6 billion capacity out of Neuchâtel, the plant in Italy, when would that come online?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: We already started producing in Italy, okay. We're producing a little bit in still in a development center in Neuchâtel in Switzerland, and this is mainly to keep demand satisfied in Switzerland. And Bologna plant, both the training center and the new factory actually started producing the HeatSticks and they're already shipping everything to Japan and a few other places. So to start a factory from the structural perspective and infrastructure is ready. We're just in the phase of installing the machines. So there is a phase of installing the production line. And every month we will be better with the capacity. But we cannot just install 30 billion in one go. 30 billion translates into X number of machine groups, and one by one have to be installed, tested and moved into commercial production.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful color. And then just lastly on Italy, it looks like in your one slide you've shown an acceleration in momentum there from the beginning of the year. Obviously, that's a market where there have been relatively little traction. How much has that picked up? What kind of share are you seeing now? It seems I'm guessing still pretty small. But what have you seen made a difference that it's better than it was?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Because we see the higher conversion than we initially had, so Italy, like Japan, a month ago started with 30% or so conversion. And I think Italy is approaching 70% conversions. From every hundred devices which we sell, iQOS devices which we sell, 70 devices are in permanent use, so a consumer is fully switched to iQOS. And that share for total Italy is not a firm number because we're not really present in whole Italy, we're taking the places where we are, and assuming that we properly can estimate an underlying market in these places, it's a little bit of science and art actually together. I think we're approaching about a 0.3%, maybe above the 0.3% in the market share. So versus where we've been at the beginning, remember, Milan was for the long time 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.2% to 0.3% is quite a significant improvement. If I take it from a volume perspective, I mean we see in Italy, like in other places, about 20% volume growth every month, month by month. So we're starting with a slow base, I admit this thing, but the growth is there. So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify Italy to the national coverage like we did in Japan, obviously, we need to discount the different channels of communications which we have available in Italy versus in Japan. But I think the prospects are there. I think we should see more and more of Japan – of Italy improvement or strong performance towards in the second part of the year. And the trend of the volume trend as of Q1, Q2 which you had on the slide in my part of the presentation is just highlighted. We start pushing the right buttons there.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Philip Gorham of Morningstar.
Philip Gorham - Morningstar Holland BV: Hi. Just a quick one from me.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi.
Philip Gorham - Morningstar Holland BV: Clearly last month or so, we've had a number of geopolitical shocks, and I appreciate it's early days, but have you seen any signs in your categories in any of the effective markets that the consumer is in any way sort of changing their spending behavior. Thanks, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, you have some downtrading in some places in the North Africa, Egypt which, as you know, the macro economic situation is challenging. And Egypt will remain on the watch list for the remainder of the year. Algeria, which on the one hand is in our marketing of Marlboro, but on the other hand is a bit of a downtrading followed by the few steps of excise price increases. So, yes, I mean the macros are a bit weaker. I mean long-term I guess the region has a great potential. If the economy is in the south direction rather than the north direction, we'll put a pressure on the consumers.
Philip Gorham - Morningstar Holland BV: All right. Thanks.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas M. Rolli - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Communications: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team here in Switzerland. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Communications: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2016 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the first quarter of 2016 and comparing them to the same period in 2015, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our guidance therefore now includes $0.45 of unfavorable currency that continues to represent the growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016 to be skewed towards the second half of the year and the fourth quarter in particular. The $0.15 moderations in the currency impact on our guidance reflects the depreciations of the U.S. dollar against the number of our key currencies since we last provided guidance in mid-February. As shown on this slide, the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble were the principle drivers of the variance. Let me now review our first quarter results, which, as expected, were heavily impacted by a difficult comparison versus our exceptionally strong first quarter results in 2015 that masked otherwise solid performance. Organic cigarette volume in the quarter declined by 1.4% due mainly to the Asia region, principally Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, and partially offset by the EU and Latin America and Canada regions, as well as the favorable estimated impact of the leap year. As a reminder, our organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2015. Our cigarette volume benefited from the strong performance of our international brands, with the top seven, including premium-priced Marlboro and above-premium Parliament, all growing. For the full year, we continue to forecast a decline in our organic cigarette volume of 1% to 1.5%. This compares favorably to our forecast of a cigarette industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of 2% to 2.5%. On a currency-neutral basis, we recorded modest net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the quarter, while adjusted OCI declined slightly. As seen on this slide, our final share results faced particularly difficult comparisons in the quarter. The comparisons were challenging across all regions and even Asia, following the first quarter 2015 gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase. We recorded the pricing variance of $272 million in the first quarter driven by the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Importantly, our pricing variance was slightly positive in the Asia region despite the unfavorable comparison related to the gain in Korea last year. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia, as well as others shown on this slide. For the full year, we continue to anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined slightly in the first quarter due mainly to Asia region, notably Indonesia and Japan, partly offset by the EU and Latin America and Canada regions. Marlboro's market share was stable on the same basis with strong growth in the Asia, EU and LA&C regions, offset by a decline in the EEMA region due largely to North Africa. Let me now discuss our regional results beginning with the EU, where first quarter cigarette industry volume increased by 0.6%. The strong industry performance continues to reflect the improving economies, notably in the Southern Europe, a decline in illicit trade, less out-switching for the fine-cut category and a lower prevalence of E-Vapor product. We also attribute some of the growth to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. Our positive momentum continued in the quarter, with regional cigarette share increasing by 0.6 points to 38.7%. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, the top three selling industry cigarette brands in the region, all grew share in the quarter, underscoring the broad strength of our portfolio. We are progressing well with the commercialization of iQOS in the region. In Switzerland, iQOS is currently present in six key cities, representing approximately one-third of total cigarette industry volume. During the last week of March, we reached a HeatStick offtake share of 0.8% in the launch area, the highest level since the launch last August. At 1.9% market share, HeatStick offtake share was even higher in the French-speaking part of the launch area where we have concentrated the majority of our support thus far. In Italy, HeatStick's offtake share has been stable at around 0.2% in the expansions area covering Bologna, Milan, Modena, Rome and Turin. We recently launched the latest version of the iQOS device, and are refocusing our marketing approach and touch points to increase the effectiveness of our engagement. This includes the rollout of iQOS embassies, which leveraged the iQOS flagship store concept that we have successfully deployed in Japan. Turning to the EEMA region, we faced particularly difficult comparisons this year following currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI growth of 14.1% and 24.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015. We also faced challenges in some of our key EEMA markets. In Ukraine, the overall economic and geopolitical uncertainty contributed to a very competitive pricing environment, which began in late 2015 and is now starting to improve. In Algeria, sizable excess tax-driven retail price increases over the past year of approximately 21%, on an industry weighted average basis, put pressure on Marlboro's share, though this was partly offset by the strong performance of L&M. We expect better performance in this market as the year unfolds and remain confident in the outlook for the region this year. In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by 6% in the quarter, a resilient performance given the significant retail price increases over the past year of approximately 23% on an industry weighted average basis. For the full year, we maintained our forecast for a cigarette industry volume decline of around 9%. Our market share declined by 0.2 points to 27.8% in the February quarter-to-date period, which we attribute mainly to price increases for some of our product that reached adult smokers sooner than competitors' price increases. The down trading in our portfolio from the medium to lower price segment was consistent with the broader industry trend. Our strong pricing resulted in another quarter of solid, double-digit, currency-neutral OCI growth, and we are targeting similar growth for the full year on the same basis. In Turkey, cigarette industry volume grew by 11.7% in the first quarter as the industry continued to benefit from a significant reduction in illicit trade. Our February quarter-to-date market share increased by 0.6 points to 43.9%, driven by the continued strength of Marlboro, which grew by 1.1 points to 10%. Currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter was exceptional and benefited from our January price increases, as well as higher cigarette volume driven by the growth in both industry volume and market share. Moving to the Asia region, our financial results were similarly impacted by a difficult comparison due principally to the gain in Korea that I mentioned earlier. Beyond this distortion, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter, notably Marlboro's regional cigarette market share and volume increased by 0.5 points and 5.1%, respectively. In Australia, the super low-priced segment is showing signs of stabilization and March price increases for cigarette brands in this segment were above the excise tax pass-on. Importantly, we grew our share in the quarter by 1.1 points to 36.4%, driven by Bond Street and Choice. In the Philippines, price cuts were stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the first quarter of 2015. The narrowed price gap between Marlboro and lower priced brands continued to support our strong overall share, which increased by 1.4 points to 73.6%. Let me now cover some specific Asia region markets in more detail. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in the first quarter due mainly to the soft economy and the impact of industry weighted average price increases of around 11% in the quarter, which exceeded the inflation rate of around 4%. The decline also reflects the difficult comparison versus the first quarter of 2015, in which cigarette industry volume grew by 6%. Our market share declined by 1.3 points to 34.1% due primarily to share loss in the machine-made kretek segment, reflecting the growth of competitors' plus-4 cigarette offers, value propositions with four extra cigarettes per pack. The decline was partly offset by our favorable performance in the hand-rolled kretek segment, where we solidified our leadership positions and grew segment share. We expect our share loss in the quarter to be a temporary phenomenon, and we have a number of initiatives in place to restore growth, particularly in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we forecast a cigarette industry volume decline of 1% to 2%, and are targeting double-digit currency neutral OCI growth. In Japan, cigarette industry volume increased by 2.3% in the first quarter, driven by estimated retail trade inventory movement and adult smoker purchases ahead of price increases for select competitors' brands effective April 1. Excluding this favorable inventory movement, we estimate that cigarette industry volume was essentially flat. Our cigarette market share declined by 1.6 points due to inventory movement, competitors' offerings in the differentiated menthol taste segment, and cannibalization by HeatStick. We continue to invest behind the pipeline of innovations for our cigarette brand portfolio, including the national rollout of Parliament Crystal Blast in March. As you may be aware, last week we submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase the prices of nearly all Lark variants and some Parliament variants by 7 yen per pack effective August 1 – by 10 yen per pack effective August 1. These variants represent approximately 45% of our cigarette volume in Japan. We are very excited by the performance of iQOS in Japan. As seen on this chart, weekly HeatStick offtake share increased steadily through the end of the first quarter reaching 2.4% in the expansion area and 3.4% in Tokyo during the last week of March. On a quarterly basis we recorded a HeatStick offtake share of 1.8% in the expansions area and estimate that this equates to a first quarter national market share of approximately 0.8%. The positive HeatStick offtake share momentum is a clear indicator that iQOS is resonating with Japanese adult smokers. Importantly we are seeing a steady increase in the proportion of iQOS purchasers who have predominantly or fully converted to it, reaching approximately 60% in February. In addition, I am pleased to confirm that yesterday we commenced the full expansion of iQOS nationally. Let me conclude my comment on regional performance with the Latin America and the Canada region where our cigarette volume increased by 2.4% in the quarter driven principally by Mexico, partly offset by Argentina. Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 39.3% reflecting growth in the majority of our key markets. Marlboro had a very strong quarter with their share up by 1.2 points and volume growth of 8.5%. Our strong net revenue and adjusted OCI growth rates, excluding currency, were driven mainly by pricing in Argentina and Canada. In conclusion, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with year-on-year performance adversely impacted by a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015. Nevertheless, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS which is demonstrated in particular by the steady weekly growth in HeatSticks' offtake share in Japan. Importantly, our iQOS conversion model is clearly working. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level. The outlook for 2016 remains strong. To reflect currency movements, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance which, on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect the growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.40. Thank you, and I am now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Marshall with Barclays.
William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, or good afternoon to you guys. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning to you. Hi.
William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to – first again on Indonesia a little bit. You talked about targeting double-digit profit growth in that market this year. When we think about Indonesia over the long term, is this – should we think about it a little bit differently where maybe it will be more of a profit growth market and less of a kind of volume revenue market going forward? Or is this just a one-time factor in 2016? And then maybe we get a little bit more volume growth in the out-years?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, Bill, to be frank I'm sure am thinking Indonesia can have all three, i.e., can be a volume, revenue and a bottom-line OCI growth target. We still remain confident in the longer run, Indonesia total market can be in the growth rate over somewhere around 1%, 1% to 2%. We have said it on a number of occasions in the past that depends on the macroeconomic factors which may impact temporarily the purchasing power, et cetera. The market may have some slowdown, I think what we observed, that we forecast to observe this year, due to the – a bit of a – the softer – due to the softer economy, et cetera. Then Indonesia maybe go into some decline this year. But pricing remains strong. The cost outlook for Indonesia, I mean, it seems pretty positive. And therefore, we're very confident that this year as in the years in the past, I mean Indonesia, not only will it grow double-digit bottom line, but also, can remain a very significant contributor to overall PMI performance. So I'm very positive on Indonesia, both in the short and the longer term. But, as many developing economies, they might have some periods of a relative slowdown, and then as you know they will go to acceleration.
William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. Yeah. If you can do all three, I think that would be fantastic. And then just a quick follow-up. On Japan, just can you walk us through the decision not to apply for price increase on Marlboro?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I mean I think it's pretty obvious if you look at to what the price increase our key competitor has announced earlier this quarter. So we in some part are also reacting of – to the price moves announced or registered by others. So I think it's pretty obvious why we just selected that part of the portfolio.
William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, my first question has to do with the negative mix shifts that we saw in the quarter. While I appreciate the more muted price realization, the negative mix in particular in the EU comes as a little bit of a surprise, given that the momentum that we're seeing in Marlboro. So can you expand on that a little bit, please?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think actually, if I talk historically, I mean, the EU had a relatively good mix, a relatively low mix. I think it's maybe there are some movements in timing of movements between our countries. I think the biggest challenge which we'll have to compete with, if you like, in the quarter was essentially coming, the lack of a pricing variance from Korea, and that's on a total PMI basis and obviously weighted quite largely on the Asia regions. If I would add a lack of the pricing – or extra gain from Korea, our revenue would be in a 4.5% growth territory and this is still despite a pretty challenging comp from Q1 over last year. So I think it's mostly the price which was driving the revenues and obviously also the bottom line there. And then obviously, you have a couple of comps which were coming from outside the EU region, that were coming mostly from the volume. I mean Russia, both total market and especially PMI performance, so they're completely different comps. And Indonesia and Asia also contributed.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on iQOS, given the strong demand that you've seen in Japan and the delay in the national launch, which I guess occurred yesterday, how are we thinking about the incremental market introductions that are anticipated for the year? Will the strong demand in Japan perhaps delay some of the, I think it's 13 markets that you're targeting by year-end?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we targeted 20 markets to be present with iQOS on the city level, on the national level by the year-end. I mean, clearly the Japanese performance is – and I could say it like this: it comes with our expectations, and our expectations are very high and our expectations are rising as we speak. So clearly, the focus today is to satisfy the full demand in Japan. I would like to remind that we operating this year with not fully accessible capacity because the factory in Polonia, our greenfield construction will be completed somewhere towards the end of this year. But so far, I think our plans are absolutely valid for this year and we're very excited, not only by Japan. I mean, we have said on – I have said in my presentations also, very good results which we achieved so far in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, but that's very encouraging. And in all places which we have make iQOS available today, we approaching or actually exceeding the conversions rate, which we are – at this stage achieving in Japan. So, it's – it's a lot of fine-tuning of the conversion model, of the route-to-market, route-to-consumer, and I think we're on the very strong progress on this side. So we're very encouraged by the results.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, Jacek. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. So, as we think about the cadence of profit growth and earnings growth this year, clearly we're still in a period of more accelerated rollout costs behind iQOS. I don't know if it's – I may be asking for too much detail here, but can you give us a rough sense for how material the step-up in investment was as a headwind to earnings growth this quarter? Or how it compares to Q4? And you mentioned in the release that the earnings growth profile could be more second-half-weighted than Q4-weighted. So just wondering if you could sort of help set expectations for Q2?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Actually, you're always asking for lot of details, right? Look, let me put it this way, absent the iQOS partially comps but also increased investment, I guess the cost for the quarter would come about flat. Essentially that would be flat. So all the cost growth in the quarter you could – one could attribute it to the investment behind iQOS. It's obviously on ex-currency, always on ex-currency basis. To give a bit more light into how we see the quarters going forward, we still are to confirm that our outlook for the total costs for the year, and this is now all-inclusive again on ex-currency basis or conventional and RRP, Reduced-Risk Products on ex-currency basis, the cost outlook still remains at about 1% for the full year. So we'll have, obviously, some comps issues in the quarters. If you look at the pacing of our growth rate, if I take it on an EPS level, second, third, fourth quarter, look, as much as we would be explaining the difficult comps in the Q1 of this year, I mean, clearly we will all have a different situation, 180 degrees different situations in Q4 of this year. So obviously one should expect there quite a strong, very strong actually growth rate on EPS level in Q4. And in Q2 and in Q3, we will be going somewhere below obviously the guidance which we gave for the full year. This will very much also depend on the timing of some expenses, et cetera. I think revenue line is going be cruising closer to what we said is for the full year, so somewhere in a corridor of a 5% to 6% quarter this year versus the quarters of the last year. We should see the evolutions of our revenue. So it's much more the differences which we have in comps coming from the investment, partially behind the conventional, but very much obviously driven by the deployment of iQOS.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Jacek. That's a good amount of detail. And just a follow-up on the EU, as we think about the growth outlook for volumes and mix in the region, how do you think about the potential for the favorable immigration impact that you mentioned to potentially support stable volumes over a longer period of time, or potentially positive volumes? Because it sort of continues to be more constructive on a volume level than we would have expected.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Look, the way we look, I look at this – the EU region is that I still would maintain that all of our parameters staying equal, EU is in a sort, or should be in a sort of a secular decline of 1% to 2% per annum, okay? And I think obviously when you had the recovery of the illicit trade, which you had some – much of this pressure from the fine-cut products, some recovery from electronic E-Vapor products, electronic cigarettes, I mean that we could see that these trends could be better than the secular trend. And then, we all reading, watching the same news, and we all hear about the immigrations. I mean that these things are getting into a bit larger scale, at least recently. It's difficult to put a number, how much does this contribute to the volume fluctuations. But this will be difficult to deny at this stage at least that there is some impact of that fig. I mean, we recognize it – I recognized it in my remarks, but as much as I am willing, and you know me, on many occasions to give more details, I can't offer you a number. But there is some impact. Clearly there is some positive impact on the EU from immigration.
Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks again, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Michael.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: You've mentioned that the comps outlook in Indonesia is favorable but there is a – increase in clove cost we're seeing, maybe around 20 or so percent. Is that adding any pressure or is that just because you're able to source it in ways that you're not exposed to as much of that, or, what's the outlook there? Is that something we should be looking – watching out for over the rest of the year?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: No. I think actually the cost in Indonesia if you take the – it's – what's in the market, it's somehow at the level or somewhere at the level of last year, you know, they're actually better off. And remember that what hits our P&L is the cost going through the – through the balance sheet for the inventories, right? So if you – obviously, for obvious reasons, we'll not disclose how long the inventories do we have but that impact is not immediately going through the P&L. It takes some while to impact our cost. But the input costs in general for Indonesia is at this stage pretty positive, I mean, a stable positive. So therefore it's another compounding factor supporting our thesis with Indonesia, our business in Indonesia can grow at a double-digit bottom line.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And we've seen Gudang Garam take pretty aggressive pricing in late in the fourth quarter but then you're still seeing your share under some pressure in this quarter. And you've specifically mentioned some machine-made discounting. What's the pricing environment look like? Is it other competitors that are putting pressure on or were there price increases not maybe broad enough? Or can you just dissect a little bit some of your share moves and what you expect over the course of the rest of the year?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. I think everyone is – we don't see anything abnormal in the speed or frequency, if you like, of the pricing being taken in Indonesia. Obviously, with some positive adjustments due to the size of the – or relatively higher size of excise passed on – they'll pass on, which our industry was confronted this year. So I think as an industry, if I follow what the competition price moves are there, there's nothing really abnormal taking there. Obviously the prices are going a little bit higher due to this, as I mentioned, as a higher pass-on to be passed to consumers. Now the four extra stick price segment, of some four-stick discounting which has happened there, that segment of extra four sticks in the pipe which was sold at the price of the competitor's product with the four sticks less was therefore some time, I think, until the relatively late – okay, let's say maybe second half of the last year, the segment was at about 3% to 4% if I am not mistaken, size of the total market. So it is a segment that's not very sizable segment. We have our more sizable segments in the market. This accelerated I think due to some offerings or introductions from some competitors. We're not very active in that segment. I think our recent, the most recent reading of the size of the segment is somewhere in the range of 9%, maybe slightly above 9%. So it's growing. It accelerated the growth recently. I think in that environment when the consumer is confronted with the frequent price increases and maybe of a slightly higher nature than in the past, clearly some form of a price also discounting, I mean, it might be attractive to some consumers. So that puts obviously especially if you look into the quarterly shares, the monthly shares, they put a pressure on some of our propositions in the market. But – and I mean, overall I would think it's like a manageable situation.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly could we talk a little bit – could you talk a little bit about Australia? You mentioned share gains there but that sounds like there's still is negative mix and, of course, volume decline but are you seeing that as a – overall drag on profitability or are the share gains able to – and some pricing are able to give a lift? Or what's the outlook there – just in terms of how that's shaping up?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we are still comparing ourself to relatively late part of the – our – period of our performance in Asia – sorry, in Australia. I think Q4 2014, first quarter of 2015, however, we still were a little bit in a more – we're in a much more difficult situations in Australia. Australia is not a drag, neither nor in the quarter. No, I would think in our outlook for the full year, that sort of a drag would not even near the drag which we have had in the past periods. I mean the situation, I think the price increase at least, taking this at its face value as it is now, why the price announcement versus the excise increase, we'll have to see how it develops. But it seems that the dynamics in terms of the deep discount growth segment combined with these price increases from us and competitors might be a couple of steps in the right direction. So while I'm getting very cautiously more optimistic on Australia, but it's still, some time to go. But I think that the worst is definitely far behind us.
Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I just have one quick question first on the pricing in Japan. When do you expect to hear feedback on your application? And is this price increase factored into your guidance?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: I think we should expect something as always in Japan I think within 90 days, if I am not mistaken. That's about the time period when the MOF has to come back with a decision. And to be very frank with you, that price in Japan, the price increase of a 10 yen on the – on these two brands, is not fully factored in our guidance. But let me remind you that if the prices are approved, they will go into the market in the later part of the year. And as you know, guidance has a number of variable components, and this will – we'll see how it unfolds. But factually this pricing is not in our guidance.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That helps. And then the EU Tobacco Products Directive, which will be implemented in May, just curious to hear from you some of the key issues and concerns? And then what are you doing to mitigate those? And then also the costs associated with complying, were those above your expectations, Jacek?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, big part of this cost we have incurred in the Q3, very much Q4 actually of last year. I mean, perchance you remember we've had these – we make these decisions actually to preempt debt spending and some of these preparations calls – when it calls, to the product retooling machines, et cetera. It's a number of a cost buckets, which we'll have to cover, we decided already to take in 2015 – in the 2015. I think we were prepared. You know, each of the biggest challenges that obviously this directive does not hit due to the transition periods, which were put by the different member states, the transition periods are different in the different member states. So logistically it is quite an exercise. They might be, it doesn't have to happen, but it might be that there will be some distortions on a shipment level. I don't think it's going to obviously impact the consumption or retail uptake, but there might be some difference on a shipment level in the quarters going forward. But it's difficult, frankly speaking, to predict. There are a number of formats which will have to be replaced, one format has to cease its existence at retail level, has to be replaced by the same cigarette but in a different pack format, et cetera. So it's more of the logistic supply chain type of a stretch at this stage rather than anything else. I don't think structurally it's going to change our outlook in terms of our performance, both on the top and bottom line for the EU region.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then, in terms of Russia, I was actually hoping you could drill down just a little bit further on your business there. You took a price increase in that market. So I guess I'd like to hear the impact of that as well as then your expectation for possible share gains in this market? And essentially your outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of Russia?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: I mean, I will start with the total market. I mean, the first quarter, again, as many quarters of last year came pretty strong on a total industry size. I think 6% is clearly on the low side of one could expect from the market. We have a 20%, 23% on a weighted basis, price increases. So clearly, the elasticities are still on a – what I used to call attractive side, i.e., minus 0.3, minus 0.5, somewhere in this territory. So that's good. Market share, I mean, it seems that this year we are a little bit faster than competitions with rolling out the prices, or maybe actually competition is a bit slower versus us in lowering of the prices. It's presumably a more appropriate description of the situation. Look, Russia also compares this year versus pretty strong share advancement last year. So 20 basis points, 30 basis points sort of a share pressure. I mean, it doesn't really disturb us dramatically. I mean, that the more important it is that the total volume of the industry somehow seems on a stronger size, relative again to the price increases. In our portfolio – and the downtrading in the market, so our brands' performance and the downtrading in the market, I mean, it goes frankly speaking in line of – what we would be expecting. It is not – we don't see acceleration of a downtrading. You have this medium to value segment sort of one share point to – up to two share points year-on-year fluctuations or difference there. I mean, our brand's performing in their respective segments pretty strong. So I think the outlook in terms, again, on the profitability, which I guess is the most important at this stage, I mean, is pretty positive. And yes, we might have some sort of occasional share pressure, but it is more as I said also in my remarks, it's more the timing of whose products going to hit first the market with the price increase. Nothing structural.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one final quick question on iQOS. I just wanted to confirm that you're on track to file the two applications to the FDA in the fall of this year?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: We're targeting to apply towards the end of this year. That's correct.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you so much, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So one, just going back to Japan, Jacek. I mean, the market share trend there continues to be soft, and just wanted to get a little bit more color, just in terms of your effort to improve cigarette market share in that market. And are you increasingly looking at that market with iQOS now more holistically and trying to kind of look at the total market share including iQOS? And in markets like Tokyo where your iQOS market share is pretty strong, is that where you also see a bit more impact on the combustible market share?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I mean we try to look at this stage of the – I guess the two product propositions separately. There are challenges which we are facing on our combustible business and we're trying to get the right portfolio of innovations into the market to address that problem. I think the launch of the Parliament Crystal Blast towards the end of first quarter, which is an operating initiative which we're bringing to address the pressure which we'll have in this new taste menthol category, the capsule product, et cetera. So by no means, we are refocusing our attention from a combustible to iQOS. Now, having said so, the story of iQOS is getting more and more exciting every time we look at the results from Japan. Now, I have to admit one thing; this is not that we are trying to mask somehow our performance in the conventional business. However, 0.8%, if I take the offtake shares from the places where iQOS is available today in Japan and I recalculate this to have an equivalent in-market sales market share to compare it to what we refer to on the conventional business, 0.8% in a quarter, knowing that there was a cannibalizations from my own portfolio and very much skewed towards Marlboro, I would guess if we just assume that half of that or close to half of that was for the cannibalization, clearly, iQOS already has an impact also on my conventional share performance. If I would just, as I said earlier, apply that or to use that number to explain the market share performance of Marlboro, about half of the Marlboro decline, I could – I should actually attribute to the iQOS cannibalization. It's a good cannibalization. However, this is what we might observe for some time. So, Judy, we're trying to address both conventional and both RRP, but we do have to recognize that it might be some of these interactions between both categories.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then I had a couple of questions on FX. One is just if I look at Q1, the sales impact from FX in Europe was much more sizable than with the euro sort of decline on a year-over-year basis would have shown. So, I'm wondering if there's any sort of hedging you've started to do more on the euro side or if there was anything that I'm missing just in terms of FX impact on sales in Europe, in EU?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: No. I don't think, Judy, you're missing anything. We didn't do anything on the euro for the hedges which would have an impact. I think it's just – I guess it's just the timing. We always operate with a third of our quarterly numbers, but the end of the day, it's a sum of the parts of the monthly exchange rates which we use for the – for our P&L for our income statement. Maybe it's just the timing of – euro was pretty volatile, pretty dynamic in terms of the depreciation last year. Maybe it's just the comps between the year – between both quarters.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then the other question on FX was just when I looked at your guidance for the full year, the $0.15 favorability, there's some favorability on the yen movement, but it seems like some of the hedging that you put on also limits some of that impact. So, can you just remind us where you were hedged on the yen and what that impact would be for the balance of the year if you sort of look at the effect of yen?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we had – well, at the beginning of the year, always when we give the hedge coverage, we're about a 70-or-so percent. So clearly, I mean, there might be a moment – and we always hedge, as you remember, 12 months to 18 months ahead. So, it's not 100% of the yen positions or cash flows which are hedged for this year, but a very, very significant portion of the yen projected cash flows are hedged. Maybe what's going to – what will help you is that some of the hedges are executed in the form of calls and put options, right, the collar option strategy, which not necessarily have to have an impact if we see the development of the year of the yen going outside the bracket. And only some of that is done for the forwards, okay? Forwards, obviously, you can't walk away. But with that collar options, you have some flexibility, so you can take an advantage of what is the spot rate can be.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And I guess presumably, then some of those strategies would benefit as you move into the first part of 2016 as the hedges roll off.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Yes. Well, as I said, I mean, because we always look 12 months, 18 months ahead, there is already some portion of the 2017 expected cash flows from Japan for – in yen which hedged. But obviously, they hedge also at the rate which are more corresponding to the – some of them to the more recent relative strengthening of the yen.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. I just have two questions for you, a bit of follow-ups from earlier questions. I want to ask first if I could, when I look at the price realization in Asia, there was a larger effect from the Korea price benefit a year ago than I thought. I guess it does suggest that there was even stronger pricing in that Asia region than what I had modeled given that it was positive in the quarter. I guess I just want to understand that the comparison factor on pricing, obviously, was one of the major drags in the Asia division. That should help show better pricing in Q2 going forward based on what we know today. Is that a reasonable assumption?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: It's a very reasonable assumption. You will still have a small, relative to the first quarter, small drag from Korea, but relatively not smaller than what we had in the first quarter. But the pricing in Asia in the quarter, okay, obviously masked by the Korea, but we had a very strong pricing in Indonesia, we had a pricing in Philippines, when we had a pricing in a few other locations. So, overall, I mean, Asia should be at a much better pricing level or price realizations level, which what you just saw in the Q1.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sure. I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you. And then the other question I had was just in relation to the development of iQOS. And you've had this very strong development in Japan, but a slower development in countries like Italy and Switzerland, where it's been around about the same amount of time. And you talked about some – a couple of the undertakings by the company to enhance the development of iQOS, say, in Italy or Switzerland. I just wanted to understand, is that about spending more money? Are you doing more embassies or stores in those markets? Just what you're doing to try and boost the national expansion, if you will, and the adoption of the product in markets where it just hasn't developed at the same rate as Japan.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: I think we need to adjust for the marketing and the overall commercial environment which we have in Japan versus what we've had in Switzerland or Italy or many other places. And this is – covers the trade channels, what I call route to the customer, route to the trade, et cetera. So I think we're adjusting this one and trying to figure it out such a composition of the – all available to our blogs, which were the result. We've had manageable level of spending, if you like, versus the conversion rates which we can achieve. Now, Italy is – I think we're going to crack the Italy also this year. And I remain very positive on this despite the fact that for the couple of quarters, they're all – we're talking about the 0.2% market share. I mean that's not much of an issue I think, frankly speaking, in this stage. If I look what we have achieved and achieving in part of Switzerland and as you noticed, we, in some places, going deliberately very focused in order to nail down the model properly on the smaller territory, and then when we feel comfortable, we explode. I mean, let me remind you, I mean, we had, as you remember, the market shares conversions rate which we had at Nagoya at the time of the city test, right, of the test market. And no one at – if you were to look at that progression of the share development in Nagoya, you wouldn't figure it out that we can accelerate the conversions and the market share to the levels which we have in the 60% of Japan, including Tokyo and other main cities. So I think we're trying to get comfortable in the smaller territory that we know that we can amplify it and explode, and – or amplify the right components of our marketing mix, broadly marketing mix, and then we go to the national level. And it's actually – it's in a part of a, obviously, higher cost spend, higher investment, but more prudently invested into something which really gives you a proper result. So – and I am excited about Japan, but very excited about Switzerland, and I am sure we're going to demonstrate later on this year, what we can do in Italy as well.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That was a very good answer. Thank you for your time.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you for taking the question. I'd just like to come back to the question about what's driving the much better than historic volumes in the European Union. And you've obviously mentioned four factors, but I'm just wondering – and you've said it's really impossible or hard to quantify the impact from migration. But I guess what I'm trying to ask is what the evidence is, how good the evidence is of the impact from reduced illicit and whether – and what sort of evidence you have, and whether you can quantify this in any way. And also quantify the impact of reduced headwind from E-Vapor.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think we get a better reading at the market or on the total region level when it comes to the illicit trade. I mean it's obviously always an estimate, well, because the methodologies were equally applied from year-on-year. I think we have a better comfort about saying that, yes, there is a contributions of the illicit trade. And that contributions goes in a, I guess, in a – well, it depends now versus what period, but you're talking about the few couple points of growth is coming from illicit trade. Now, you will have to zoom into Germany, which presumably has a much larger impact than, for example, UK when the illicit trade is still on the growth. Italy had good results. I mean, Southern Europe actually is doing better. As you know, the recent moves also over the last few months of some reinforcing the border controls or reintroducing, actually, the border controls in between that, some EU states, EU market and also outside, I mean, they clearly are another factor which also contributes to tightening the domestic tax paid market. I always give a example of Turkey, which I know is outside Europe, but Turkey has reduced illicit trade year-on-year by about 10 points, 11 points, which is about half. I mean Turkish market normally wouldn't be growing – or Turkish consumption, if you like, wouldn't be growing by 10% or 11%. We're talking about the industry tax paid volumes growing to this magnitude, and this is clearly the recovery coming from a 10 points, 11 points almost of the recovery from illicit trade. So, yes, you'll see the correlations. And – but I said to one of the questions earlier, it's more comfortable for us to talk about the illicit trade because there's quite a lot of data available or estimates available, and you can deduct with a high dose of a probability that this is a contributing factor. Immigration is more something which we hear about from a – reading the newspapers, et cetera. But clearly, there are movements in this location of population, immigrations, et cetera. In some places, I think they do have a factor, they do have an impact on the industry here.
Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: And E-Vapor?
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: And E-Vapor, well, if you look where the product was in some places like Italy, for example, a year or so ago, and you know how much was the trial, which at least temporarily took consumers from a conventional cigarette, and where these products are today, I mean they're cruising somewhere at the 1% or below even 1% market share in most of the places. I mean, clearly, those consumers get back to the conventional cigarette. So this again, you will have to go into market-by-market basis. What is happening, as you know, the e-cigarette category does not attract a lot of loyalty to the category itself. There's a lot of dual usage, dual consumption, most of the time, so far, leading to consumer turning its back to E-Cigarettes and coming back to the conventional product.
Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas M. Rolli - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Communications: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. We're in Switzerland. Thank you, again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2015 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations App. During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 and comparing them to the same period in 2014, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join André for the question-and-answer period. André.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full-year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. Of particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M, which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9% respectively. Strong pricing across all regions combined with substantially lower and favorable volume/mix compared to recent years resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 5.8% and 6.6% respectively. Despite significant incremental investments behind both iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio announced last July and disclosed in today's press release, our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the raised guidance range that we reaffirmed last November. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full-year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS. In the fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization. Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with that of the full year. Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions, more than offsetting unfavorable volume/mix, mainly the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency-neutral adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter. Our full-year 2015 results confirm that our business fundamentals are strong, and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter in particular should further reinforce our momentum in 2016. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35. This was $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency of approximately 10% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. This reflects a currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We'll revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment. The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates included in our 2016 guidance, is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesia rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. These four currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. We have currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of 118 yen to the U.S. dollar versus 110 yen in 2015. Pricing was the key driver of our full-year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing variance of $2.1 billion, supported by strong contributions from all four regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. This year, we anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by an improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2015 and 2014. For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis. Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide, with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7%, and share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable. Marlboro was a key driver of market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S., by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all four regions and continued to benefit from the roll-out of Architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. Importantly, our 2015 share in the top-30 PMI OCI markets grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of these markets. This underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable markets. While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our top line growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our midterm targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency. In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016, to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iQOS. This resulted in a total cost base increase, excluding currency, of 3.6% excluding RRPs or 5.3% including RRPs. In 2016, we expect our total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost-saving programs and also held by the moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf, clove and non-tobacco materials. Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies, beginning the EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014 respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attribute the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe, a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade, less outreaching to the fine-cut category and a lower prevalence of e-vapor product. Our positive cigarette share momentum in the region continued in 2015, with fourth quarter and full-year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in five of the six largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. As we had anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro, following its crossing of five euro per-pack price point in the first quarter of 2015. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further reinforced their positions as the region's top-three cigarette industry brands by volume for the second consecutive year. Full-year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point by 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 0.2 share points to 5.8%. The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth excluding currency and acquisitions of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the region's first adjusted OCI increase on the same basis since 2009. In 2016, we forecast mid-single digit currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the region. I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region, where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate averaged more than 20% year-over-year, as well as lower consumer purchasing power. Our full-year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%, driven mainly by low-price Bond Street and super-low price Next, which benefited from adult smoker down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share points, despite the overall premium segment decline of 0.7 points. In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase, resulting in an average tax pass-on of around 10 rubles per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average basis. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of five rubles per pack last November and a further five rubles per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter. Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of illicit trade, which declined by over five percentage points to around 14% in 2015. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened, with three quarters of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter. In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while leaving the ad valorem rate unchanged, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around 40 kurus per pack at the retail level. We implemented a retail selling price increase of one lira per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus enhancing unit margin. I will now touch on our Asia region, beginning with Indonesia, where estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015, in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by one point to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine-made kretek brands taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full-year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%. Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market, thanks to its growing adult population and rising income levels. In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter, following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the super-low price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around one peso per cigarette, and narrowing of 50 centavos per cigarette or 33% since December 2013. The improved price gaps have been a key driver of our strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full-year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of this share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.4%. Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continue to improve profitability in this important market. In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated, due mainly to trade inventory build-up from competitors' recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015, due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan. Turning to our reduced-risk products portfolio, let me briefly highlight the progress that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch markets, with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and the initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to Modena, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally. In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoker coverage, we estimate there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated off-take share for Marlboro HeatSticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly off-take shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. Please note that off-take share represents retail sales volume for HeatSticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and HeatSticks within a given geographic area. I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial that we have made with iQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY Conference later this month. I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement, considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion on our net earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the Sampoerna Rights Issue are not included in our free cash flow. In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again, despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates. We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously, with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% at a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of our peer group company. In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with the continued roll-out of the 2.0 Architecture driving volume and share growth. We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable HeatStick off-take share momentum in Japan. Our strong free cash flow continues to support our generous dividends. Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew C. Grainger: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi.
Matthew C. Grainger: I just had two questions about pricing. I guess first, André, I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment in Japan, since Japan Tobacco has requested a price increase on Mevius. I was wondering whether you've made any similar requests on your portfolio or if you can talk us through how you're thinking about the opportunity there.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Clearly, the move from Japan Tobacco is encouraging, but you appreciate I cannot make any further comments on pricing in Japan, for obvious reasons.
Matthew C. Grainger: Okay. But that, I guess, would confirm that you haven't made any formal requests yet.
André Calantzopoulos: I didn't say that.
Matthew C. Grainger: Regardless of what your intentions might be. Okay. And then, I guess just a broader question then. Your comments about the expectation for a 6% pricing variance this year implies about $1.6 billion in pricing, a bit below the $1.8 billion that we would typically think of as being sort of a midterm target. And I know that Korea accounts for a portion of that gap. But if we exclude that, is there more an issue of rounding, or do you see the potential for a more moderate level of pricing across the industry this year in light of macroeconomic weakness?
André Calantzopoulos: Well as you rightly said, Korea is the biggest swing because it swings about almost 1 point of pricing variance year-to-year compared to our previous year's revenues. Apart that, there is nothing particular here that we should be reading, so we're very confident about the pricing environment. I think it's very positive and the excise tax environment is also positive, so not much change compared to the previous year.
Matthew C. Grainger: Okay. And then I guess one other quick follow-up. Just within Indonesia, you mentioned the impact of crossing some critical pricing thresholds during the fourth quarter. Is that a temporary price gap issue or something that could linger for a few quarters?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think this is temporary because sooner or later, others are crossing the critical points. Now, that had more impact for us in this quarter. There is another phenomenon that had a lot of increased activity, I would say, towards the end of the year in Indonesia, which is a number of competitive offerings that sell essentially 20 sticks per pack at the price of 16. Now, these propositions typically are not viable longer term because if you remember, the excise tax in Indonesia is specific and on a per-stick basis. But temporarily, you have some distortions because of these launches that should ease during the year. So that's essentially what happened in Indonesia in the quarter.
Matthew C. Grainger: Okay. Thanks and congratulations on the results this year.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you for your question.
Matthew C. Grainger: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Judy.
Judy E. Hong: André, I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Russian market. Obviously, the shipment number in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by inventory movement. But I think your share also was a little bit softer sequentially. So just wondering what's going on competitively. What are you seeing in terms of down-trading situation in terms of the consumers? And then if you look out for 2016, your view in terms of how the industry volume would look like in Russia.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, let's start with this inventory that has a little bit distorted the numbers of the fourth quarter overall, so for PMI. Essentially, it's an one-off adjustment because we decided to have our own warehouses in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there. That's one-off. In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, you appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted the total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the price increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we'll all be very happy. That's how I see the market. Now, in terms of downtrading, clearly there is downtrading. It's not dramatic. But we see if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the mid segment and premium segment to essentially the low-price segment, not the super-low, which is fairly stable. And we gain share in both premium, low and super-low segment. So I think we're well positioned overall in this environment. Now again, Russia, you know the economy's a bit weak. The ruble has devalued. But overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we've already taking pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall, if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?
Judy E. Hong: Yeah. That's helpful. And then I guess my second question is just in terms of the investments that you made in 2015 and I guess more specifically lapping of that in 2016. Because your comment that your cost base is still going up 1% year-over-year implies that the incremental investment's actually staying in the cost base in 2016 and so forth. So are these investments that you've made in 2015 still continuing as it relates to some of these iQOS commercialization? Or can you just give us a little bit sense of kind of that lapping of that and costs still going up on a year-over-year basis?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. What happened is, first of all, the direction we gave for 2016 is 1% approximately up, including reduced-risk products, where we have obviously incremental spending compared to 2015. Okay, that's the first item. And don't forget, our target is 1% to 3% per year, excluding RRP. So just to facilitate your understanding, I would say that 40% of the incremental spending in the last quarter is nonrecurring in 2016, roughly, okay? And we clearly had also quite substantial incremental spending on iQOS in the fourth quarter. Now, the nonrecurring items relate to obviously the implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive in 2016, but some of the costs have to happen in 2015. It's also some restructuring that we don't report under reported, but in the normal earnings, plus some one-off items. So in total, that's what – how I would see it. And I hope I helped you a little bit to understand.
Judy E. Hong: So, I guess what you're saying is that 60% of the incremental spending is still recurring so you have that still in 2016. And then obviously, the 1% total cost base going up also still includes some of the commercialization spending related to iQOS that would be more incremental in nature.
André Calantzopoulos: Exactly.
Judy E. Hong: Okay. Understood. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Bushnell of Exane.
James Bushnell: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first was on pricing in Europe. Obviously, you've had a good year there, and the outlook looks good in terms of OCI growth. But the pricing numbers seem to be a little softer than earlier in the year, and I just wondered if you could give us some color around that, please. And then the second question was on the retention rates you're getting in iQOS. The market share numbers you mentioned sound quite impressive, but I just wondered if the 30% retention rates you mentioned in the past was still consistent and how it was looking in Switzerland, for example, as well. Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. In Europe; pricing in Europe is unchanged. What we make some difference in the quarter is, if you remember, in Germany in 2014, we took pricing in the middle of the year toward the second half. And in 2015, we anticipated earlier. So until the third quarter, we had two overlapping annualization of pricing from the previous year, from 2014, and the pricing in 2015, which we don't have – we didn't have in the last quarter. But as you know, we announced pricing in Germany, so we are back in the normal course. Okay. That will explain this. Now, I will give much more granularity about iQOS in CAGNY. I don't want to steal the thunders of everybody, but the retention rates are much higher than the 30%. And that's very encouraging in Japan, actually.
James Bushnell: Great. Okay. Well, look forward to CAGNY. Thanks a lot for your answer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie L. Herzog: Hi, André and Jacek.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Bonnie.
Jacek Olczak: Hi.
Bonnie L. Herzog: My first question is on the EU. How sustainable are the improved trends you've been seeing throughout the region? And also, you continue to highlight a lower prevalence of e-vapor products in the EU. So I'm curious how much of a factor that's been to the improved combustible cig volume; possibly these consumers have been switching back.
André Calantzopoulos: Look, I hope the trends in Europe are sustainable. I mean where we forecast, it's early in the year. But from everything we know, including pricing, we think we may be a bit lower than last year, a bit higher decline but well above actually our 2% to 3% secular decline that we anticipate. So to me it looks fairly good in Europe, okay? And part of that is attributed, obviously, to a lower share of e-cigarettes but also a little bit less illicit trade. And I think maybe because the economies also are improving, higher average daily consumption, which you don't see in the trends. But that explains part of the volume, clearly.
Bonnie L. Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And then I have a question on your share repurchase program. So if your FX headwind stays where it's at, say, for the next couple of quarters, is this an okay level for you to resume your share repurchases? Or do you need this headwind to reverse to be comfortable before you'd resume your buyback? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's going to give you comfort? Is it more visibility or a lower headwind?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, a lower headwind, obviously, because at current levels, it makes no sense to resume share repurchases. So once we see reversal, then we can revisit the issue. And I hope we will see at some stage.
Bonnie L. Herzog: Yes. Agreed. If I may ask just one final quick question on your Marlboro 2.0 roll-out. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of your Marlboro 2.0 is rolled out? Is it complete, I guess? And is there typically a lag before you see the full impact of this on your overall Marlboro share?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think we're seeing the impact already.
Bonnie L. Herzog: Yeah.
André Calantzopoulos: And all the indications we have from the markets where we're already one or more years in the market is, all the fundamentals are improving; the perception is improving; the image is improving. So it has worked very well and actually beyond what I personally expected. So I don't know exactly weighted where we are. We're in 100 markets. I think it's 95% of the volume of Marlboro already or something like that. And everywhere, we've seen positive results. And if you remember, this is not just packaging. It's the whole communication of consumers, product improvement that were extremely well received by our consumers and also competitive smokers.
Bonnie L. Herzog: Okay. So trends are increasing. Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Christopher Growe: Hi. Good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Growe: Hi. I wanted to ask, first of all, in relation to volume, which did weaken a little bit sequentially in the fourth quarter – there are some unique factors that are leading to that – and if you look at the strong performance in the first nine months. As you look – as you move into 2016, you've indicated global volumes down about the same rate as they were last year. Are there any markets in particular where we should kind of keep a watch out here? I mean we've taken out the big ones so like Russia, Indonesia. Are those the ones you see being kind of the weakest here to lead out the year but improving throughout 2016?
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. I mean if we look overall, clearly, Russia, as I said, we have to make some assumptions. Last year, we're a bit positively surprised. I hope that's going to be the case, but we have to assume some decline in Russia. So we assumed, as I said, around 9% at this stage. On the positive side, clearly, Korea, because last year we had quite impressive decline, about – apples-to-apples, I would say 20%, which this year hopefully, we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So that's on the positive side. We had a good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we are going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better. In markets where we're less impacted, clearly, is India that had a big decline last year because of excise and VAT increases. But as you know, we have minimal exposure there and Brazil. And Brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we had a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates and also an excise tax increase that comes in two tranches in Brazil; one in May and one in December. So that's where I see it. Now, Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass on of the excise tax in the previous year of about 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%, not dramatic but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have – on the positive side we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%. So how this is going to pay at the end of the year is very difficult to predict. Conservatively, we have assumed some decline, but we'll see if that materializes or not. And that's for the key markets. I don't know if I said that.
Christopher Growe: Okay. That was helpful. Thank you. I just had one quick follow-up, which is in relation to generally the global macro uncertainty, some of the risks we've seen in some of these key markets. And you have some pricing going up at a healthy rate, just due to excise tax pass-along. Are you seeing any changes in elasticity? Is it too early to tell for that? But I'm just curious if we're seeing kind of that weaker consumer reacting negatively to price increases in some of the key markets where you're taking those now.
André Calantzopoulos: I mean, look, I must say that I'm positively surprised by elasticities rather than the opposite, actually. They come more on our side than I thought. So now, again, some of the emerging markets we have to watch as the economy weakens, but we don't see many – any signs – I'm sorry – of this occurring at this stage. So we'll keep you abreast of how this is going during the year. But I think we baked this in our forecast for total market for the year of to 2% to 2.5%.
Christopher Growe: Okay. That's very encouraging. Have you said what percentage of your pricing you have in place already for the year?
André Calantzopoulos: I would say about 50%, slightly higher than that, at this stage.
Christopher Growe: Okay. Thank you for the time.
André Calantzopoulos: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So my first question has to do with Latin America in terms of the cadence of the local currency profit growth. The profit growth had been quite robust for the first nine months of the year and it did decelerate. I was wondering if you could just – and on an easy comp So I was wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit, please.
André Calantzopoulos: I'm sorry. I'm not sure...
Vivien Azer: So I'm showing that you had very strong double-digit profit growth in Latin America in the first nine months of the year that ended up resulting in full-year very robust local currency profit growth. But in the fourth quarter, your local currency profit growth was plus 1%, so it kind of – it's a big difference from what we have been seeing.
André Calantzopoulos: Profit, there is costs. It's more a question of costs rather than...
Jacek Olczak: And Argentina.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. And we had the Argentina devaluation as well. That was reflected in the last quarter. But in terms of pricing, there is no difference. We had regular price increases in Argentina. We're taking pricing in Mexico. But there is sometimes difference in timing of price increases, so that can explain some swings. I would not be reading these quarters with religiousness, I would say. Okay?
Vivien Azer: So the cost increase in Argentina is a one-time factor, or do we think – is that something that kind of persists for the next three quarters?
Jacek Olczak: More of that – sorry – Jacek. It's more of the one factor. You should also look for the Latin comparing the Q4 of the last year, of 2014, because I think there was a different pattern of the shipment ahead of the tax price change in Mexico.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah.
Jacek Olczak: So this might swing around.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much. My second question has to do with the EU and with plain packaging. You called out some investments in the UK, but you also called out negative mix shift. So I'm wondering if you could just expand on some of the changes that you're making in terms of your go to market as well as an update on the market landscape itself, if it's downtrading just in your portfolio, or are we already starting to see downtrading in the UK?
André Calantzopoulos: Well first of all in the UK in particular, we've essentially taken back our distribution from Imperial. So in the quarter we had particularly particular specific expenses due to this take-back and double cost obviously, because we're still paying material and we're building up our own distribution. I don't see any acceleration in downtrading in the UK in terms of trends. And if we try to correlate this to plain packaging, clearly there's not yet plain packaging in the UK, I would say. But in general, because I get very often this question, is UK going to become Australia. The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia downtrading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing. Because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the UK. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the UK, even if eventually plain packaging is implemented because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market. And I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends. Now in the EU in general, I don't see much downtrading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable and we grew share with Marlboro. So overall, I'm very positive about the trends in the European Union. And do not forget that we have a portfolio with Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield that covers quite comfortably all price segments. So I think we're fairly confident about the prospects of the business in the European Union.
Vivien Azer: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery: Good morning.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Michael.
Michael Lavery: Just want to come back to Japan. Can you confirm that I'm reading this right? Your market share table in the release, that's just cigarettes; that doesn't include any sales from iQOS. That's correct?
André Calantzopoulos: This is correct.
Michael Lavery: And so would it be closer to flat market share if iQOS were included? And where do you see iQOS taking share from? Is it more from your own brands or from competitors?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, we would see obviously some correction. And we should not forget that in particularly in the last quarter, there were competitive introductions in the market. And clearly because of the support of iQOS as we expand it nationally, we had no activities on our portfolio of cigarettes during that quarter, okay. So that explains both the comparisons in terms of competitive pipelining and us focusing on iQOS the higher decline in the share. Now from what we know today, approximately 40% of the people that switch and adopt iQOS come from our own brands, which is higher obviously than our market share in Japan. But I hope this is correct because we are primarily targeting our own consumers as well, and it's Marlboro. So that's a little bit the proportion we see today, 40% coming from our portfolio and 60% from competitive brands.
Michael Lavery: And does having iQOS in the market influence any of your thinking on pricing on your cigarette brands and maybe give you more flexibility there?
André Calantzopoulos: No. This is completely separate, okay. I don't see any.
Michael Lavery: Okay. And then just on Indonesia, the machine-made full flavor certainly has been, that segment's been gaining steam. You called out machine-made in general as part of your momentum there. But certainly in full flavor, you're underrepresented. Can you be a little more specific on any of your progress there in gaining a bigger footing in that segment?
André Calantzopoulos: Well we are getting some part of the segment clearly, due to the success of Dji Sam Soe Magnum and Blue, which are in that segment. We introduced last year U Bold, which is a full-flavor extension of U Mild that is doing well in the areas that was launched and we plan to expand now nationally. And one of the things that shows the segment growing faster is that some of the introductions I've described previously, 20 packs for the price of 16, are labeled as full flavor but they are more low tar and nicotine product, okay. So there is some artificial boosting of that segment. But overall, we are making progress in that segment, and we have plans to further expand our presence in the segment, clearly.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly on margins. Obviously, two years in a row now you've had significant spending increases in the fourth quarter. Obviously, you've called out that some of the items are transitory, but can you give a sense of where margins go from here? Do you expect a return to levels two years ago anytime soon? Is there a little bit of a new normal? What's the right way to put the margin environment in context?
André Calantzopoulos: Well as I said in my remarks, we expect OCI to grow above our 6% to 8% range next year. So obviously, margins will expand. And we expect and we're targeting margin expansion in every – so yes, you will see a margin increase.
Michael Lavery: And specifically you said in every region as well?
André Calantzopoulos: Yes.
Michael Lavery: All right. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.
William Marshall: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: Good morning.
William Marshall: My first question, I just want to talk a little bit about your cash flow and allocation. As you highlighted in your prepared remarks, you've done a great job keeping your cash flow steady, despite the foreign currency headwinds. If you take the midpoint of your EPS guidance for 2016 though, your dividend payout is around 95%. So I was just curious if there's a level where you start to get a little uncomfortable; and kind of what lengths would you go to on the dividend to just ensure that you could at least maintain if not increase it slightly like we saw last year?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, as I said, we will not decrease the dividend, okay? So, yes, it is a high payout ratio, undoubtedly. And given currencies, it will remain high for the next couple of years, no matter what. I hope over time as we grow profit and we grow cash flow, we'll come back to more normal levels. And if the currencies stabilize, clearly, we'll recover much faster the return to normality, I would say. But as we always said, dividends is sacrosanct and we will go to a large extent to maintain the dividend.
William Marshall: That's very helpful. Just out of curiosity, is the 65% payout ratio – over the long term, obviously – is that kind of still in play? Or is that something that's kind of been pushed out a little bit, just given the currency situation?
André Calantzopoulos: Look, this discussion about 65%, as I said, is a bit theoretical short term because we will remain, no matter what happens, unless the currencies turn back to half of where they are today compared to...
William Marshall: Right.
André Calantzopoulos: Dollars as to half. Once that the situation becomes a bit more clear on where we'll go directionally, then we'll revisit this payout ratio and we may want to modify it, okay. That kind of theoretical discussion today.
William Marshall: Okay. Yeah. Very good. Thank you. And then just finally, I just wanted to dig a little bit into the Philippines. It sounds like you're happy with the progress there. Even with volume down as much as it is for the category, it sounds like you're more than happy to trade the bottom end volume for the share gains on Marlboro and it's at the top end. So just curious if you could give a little bit of color on how you feel about the Philippines. Have we turned a corner there and we're going to continue to see improvement? Or is there still more work to do in that market? Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos: We definitely see improvement, undoubtedly. Pricing at the bottom has increased; compliance is increasing quite significantly. The back-stops have helped. And as the – finally, as of next year, we are in the final stage of merging the two tiers. Over time, we have the possibility to unleash the profitability of the market also by growing Marlboro price. So overall the prospects are extremely good, in my view, touch wood. And it's pretty clear that with these kind of margins of price increases at the bottom, you will have some total market decline temporarily because it's 50% price increase over one-and-a-half-year period. So you would expect some market decline. But overall, I think it looks pretty good, as I said. So I'm very happy with what's happening in the Philippines.
William Marshall: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
André Calantzopoulos: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
Owen M. Bennett: Afternoon, guys. Just a quick one from me. I was just wondering in terms of projections for Indonesian industry volumes next year because I know you were saying 1% to 3% over the medium term. I was just wondering if you could be a bit more specific now and for fiscal year 2016. Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: Yes. As I said, it's a slightly different forecast Indonesia at the beginning of the year. My view is, yes, there is a little bit of pricing, higher pricing this year because of a higher tax. Last year, we had a 5% tax pass on. This year, we're 7.5%. The economy is a bit softer, but on the other side, minimum wages went up 11%. So how this is going to unfold is difficult for me to forecast. We have assumed conservative some slight market decline. Whether this materializes or not, we'll know over the few months as the pass on of the prices evolves. And that's how I see the total market for the month.
Owen M. Bennett: Okay. Cool. Thanks very much.
André Calantzopoulos: Long term, you're right. That's the way we look at the market, 1% to 3% growth.
Owen M. Bennett: Cool. Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.
Jonathan Leinster: Good morning, gentlemen. Just a question on costs. I think you mentioned earlier on that there was some favorable leaf costs, tow acetate and packaging. In dollar terms, could you give some indication of where those major costs are actually headed?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think overall, we see stability in leaf prices. And on clove prices, we have some favorability year-to-year, but we should not forget that we run longer inventories. So on average, you see the impact in the years to come. So the outlook there in terms of leaf and clove is pretty good. And the clove crops were fairly large, so we could secure sufficient inventories at lower prices. Our overall cost, as I said, only including RRPs, should be in the range of 1%, probably slightly below. So we see a moderation clearly in the cost going forward. Now 1% of the total cost base based on 2015 – sorry – is $150 million. That's what it is, okay?
Jonathan Leinster: And secondly, on the iQOS, clearly, when you launched in Japan and Italy, you'd managed to secure somewhat favorable tax treatment of HeatSticks, vis-à-vis combustible cigarettes. And I was wondering, given your recent launches, have you managed to achieve a similar sort of negotiated settlement with Switzerland and Russia and various other countries you've launched into?
André Calantzopoulos: Switzerland, for sure. Russia is still in discussion. But in the vast majority of the markets we have launched, it's lower rates than cigarettes.
Jonathan Leinster: And is that actually – are you now actually pricing those HeatSticks below cigarettes, or are you still actually pricing at the same level in those markets?
André Calantzopoulos: At this stage, we price parity with Marlboro, except for Switzerland, where we are slightly lower. And in Russia, where we use Parliament and Marlboro, and we're about the normal Parliament price. So we work with different pricing models and different go-to-market models of this type and clearly, with larger tool of best practices so we accelerate future deployment and also improve cost efficiency as we become a bit more intelligent about how these products with the markets.
Jonathan Leinster: Thanks. And lastly, just can you give us a update on where the legal challenges are to plain packaging? And indeed, is there any update on the Ukrainian-led WTO dispute?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Basically, this year is an important year because as you have mentioned of the pending cases, we have WTO; that the decision should come towards the second half of the year. And we have the UK High Court, which should rule before May, maybe earlier. So we'll know these important outcomes in the course of this year. So that's where we stand in terms of the pending cases at this stage.
Jonathan Leinster: Okay. But is there anything to add to the sort of WTO dispute? Has that been taken forward?
André Calantzopoulos: Sorry?
Jonathan Leinster: Is there anything to add with regards to the WTO dispute? Has there been any particular...
André Calantzopoulos: Well, it's a normal process that is followed.
Jonathan Leinster: Right.
André Calantzopoulos: There is a lot of interest from what we understand, but we're not in the proceedings, obviously, because it's between Member States, so...
Jonathan Leinster: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos: So we'll see how this unfolds.
Jonathan Leinster: Okay. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos: You're welcome.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Haitong Securities. Erik A. Bloomquist - Haitong Securities (UK) Ltd. Hi. I was wondering if you could just comment on the outlook in Australia. I mean the Prime Minister's been talking about continuing the 12.5% excise tax increases that have dented Australian volumes. Does that sound like a real risk, or will there be some fiscal sensibility in the light of rising illicit trade in your view? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Look, there are discussions of this nature and clearly, our explanations to the government is that they should put some stop in this out-of-cycle excise tax increases. This year, we have the last one. Now, despite all this tax increases which, as you know are pretty substantial because sometimes they are more than one Australian dollar per pack on 20s equivalent, the total market was down only 2.6% in 2015. And I think that has remarkable elasticity. Now, downtrading has continued, although recently at a lower pace. And as far as we are concerned, our share has stabilized finally. We have increased our segment share for the discount segment, so we're in a position to influence the segment. And essentially, I believe – I mean we also announced a price increase today in Australia. So the way I see Australia is, it has been a slight drag on our OCI this year, much, much less than last year. Conservatively, we forecast another small drag next year but we'll see now how this pricing unfolds. So that's the situation in Australia. Obviously, our objective is not to have the excise tax increase out of the normal ones that are the CPI indexation. Erik A. Bloomquist - Haitong Securities (UK) Ltd. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I will now return the call to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nicholas M. Rolli: Well thank you very much. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations team. We're currently in Switzerland. And as André mentioned earlier, next presentation will be at the Cagney Consumer Conference on Wednesday, February 17, and that will be webcast as well. Thank you all for joining us. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2015 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Phillip Morris International Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Phillip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.  During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter of 2015 and comparing them to the same period in 2014 unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations as well as reconciliations to US GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides which are posted on our website. Reduced risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer the products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for review the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. My pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Our strong performance in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Organic cigarette volume declined by a modest 1.5% reflecting global cigarette industry volume primarily in the Asia region partly offset by market share gains mainly in the EEMA region and Latin America and Canada region. The cigarette volumes of Marlboro and L&M our two largest brands increased by 2.1% and 9.3% respectively in the quarter. On a September year-to-date basis, our organic cigarette volume declined by 0.6% or by approximately 1.1% excluding estimated inventory movement. For 2015, we continue to forecast an organic cigarette volume decline in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the quarter grew by 5.9% and 9.3% respectively excluding currency. This growth was driven by strong pricing across all the regions partly offset by the impact of lower volume mainly in the Asia region. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency grew by 15.8% to $1.61. Our strong currency neutral result in the third quarter has derived September year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15.8% to $4.62 on the same basis.  As previously disclosed our fourth quarter results will be impacted by incremental investments to support the expansion of iQOS including accelerated spending behind planned launches in 2015 and 2016 and to further reinforce the favorable momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio. As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are revising a narrowing our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.35 to $4.40 at prevailing exchange rate to reflect a slightly more unfavorable currency impact largely offset by an improved business outlook driven mainly by the EU and EEMA regions. At prevailing exchange rate, our guidance now includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.22 per share versus $1.15 in our previous guidance. Excluding currency, our 2015 guidance represents a growth rate of 11% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. This growth rate is above 9% to 11% range that we provided in July. The evolution of the impact of exchange rates in our 2015 report the diluted EPS guidance is presented on this slide. While exchange rates have been volatile throughout the year the negative impact on our guidance has been relatively stable with the slight increase in our latest guidance that have been mainly by weakening of the Russian Ruble versus the U.S. dollar. Strong pricing remains the key driver of our financial performance. In the third quarter we recorded a variance of $522 million reflecting higher pricing across all four regions. We increase the retail prices during the quarter in key markets such as Argentina, Indonesia and Russia. September year-to-date pricing variance of $1.6 billion puts on track to achieve full year pricing above our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion. Our results in the third quarter were underpinned by continuous market share gains. International market share excluding China and the U.S. increase by 0.3 points to 29.2% with strong growth in EEMA and Latin America and Canada region. Marlboro was a key driver of this market share growth increasing by 0.4 points to 9.9%. The grand grew share in all of our regions as it continuous to ban it from rollout of architecture 2.0 which is now available in 84 markets largely. Importantly our share in the top 30 PMI is OCI markets grew by 0.5 points to 37.8% with share up or essentially flat in 18 of this market. I'll now provide an update on selected geographies beginning with the EU region. Excluding trade inventory movements estimated cigarette industry volume decline by 0.1% in the third quarter following declines of 2.7% and 2.3 in the first and second quarters respectively. We actually did the strong third quarter performance mainly to improving economic conditions and consumer sentiment and I'll forecast a full year 2015 decline of around 2%. Our cigarette markets in the EU region decline slightly in the third quarter due mainly to Italy. September year-to-date our cigarettes share increased by 0.1 point to 39.9%. Cigarette share in the quarter was supported by the growth of our two largest brands in the region. Share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 19.3% driven by strong performances in France and Spain. While share of L&M increased by 0.1 point to 7.1%. The combination of our strong pricing the more favorable cigarette industry volume trend and our stable overall cigarette market share resulted in third quarter and September year-to-date adjusted OCI growth of 7.4% and 8.1% respectively excluding currency and acquisitions. Turning now to Russia in our EEMA region estimated cigarette industry volumes declined by 4.6% in the third quarter. Giving the resilience of the September year-to-date cigarette industry volume trends we are revising our full year 2015 forecast to a decline of around 7%. Our market share performance in Russia remained strong. Our good quarter-to-date show increase by 1.3 points to 28.7% driven by low price bond street and super low max. Both brands continued to benefit from wider distribution particularly in the Eastern part of the country.  Higher pricing drove double-digit OCI growth excluding currency in the third quarter. In our gross, we announced the further retail selling price increase of 5 rubles per pack across the majority of our portfolio which will be increasingly reflected at retail as the fourth quarter progresses. Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 11.8% in the third quarter fueling September year-to-date growth of 9.6%. We attribute the strong growth to a significant reduction in real estate trade which is estimated to be at its lowest level in the past six years. Our August quarter-to-date market share increased by one point to 44.1%. This marked the first year-over-year quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2013 and was driven by L&M, Marlboro and Parliament. Favorable volume mix and pricing drove double-digit OCI growth excluding currency in the third quarter. Moving to Asia region while our market show Indonesia was flat in the third quarter it increased by 0.4 points to 35.2% September year-to-date. We are pleased by the strength of Sampoerna which has continued its growth trend despite its main volume having crossed the critical CHF15,000 per pack price point. Dji Sam Soe also continues to gain share, thanks mainly to its machine made magnum volumes.  Estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 1.1% in September year-to-date period. We attribute the decline primarily through a softening in the economic environment and now we expect flat full year cigarette industry volume in 2015. However we continue to expect an increase of 1% to 3% annually over the mid to long-term driven by growth in the adult population and rising income levels.  Last week, Sampoerna announced the approval by shareholders of its plan for a rights issue at an exercise price of CHF77,000 per share. The transactions will be one of the largest stock offerings in the past year across the whole of Southeast Asia and showcases the strength of our business in Indonesia. The total net proceeds for Sampoerna from the right issue will amount to approximately $1.4 billion after completion of the transaction 7.5% of Sampoerna issued and outstanding shares will be publicly owned in compliance of the Indonesia stock exchanges minimum public shareholding requirement that takes effect from January 30, 2016. Clearly this injection of cash will enhance our financial flexibility and we will determine how best to use it in the long-term interest of our shareholders while keeping a very watchful eye on currency movement. In the near-term the proceeds will be used by Sampoerna for working capital purposes. As you know beginning in 2015 excise payment terms in Indonesia has been shortened for the last two months of the year which will obviously put pressure on our year end working capital.  In Japan estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 1.5% in the third quarter resulting in a decrease of 2.2% for the September year-to-date period. For 2015 we continue to forecast the full year decline in the range of 2.5% to 3%. Our share in the quarter was down by 0.6 points to 25.3% due mainly to the strength and timing of competitors offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. We are committed to improving our share in this important market and are further investing behind our pipeline of innovations. The underlying business fundamentals in the Philippines continue to improve though show trends based on the total tax based cigarette market remained distorted due to higher estimated tax declarations by our principal local competitors.  Based on Nielsen retail audit data, which we believe provide additional insight into our performance in the current environment our August quarter-to-date market share increased by 1.4 points to 73.7% driven by Marlboro and our leading low price brand fortune. This positive share performance was driven by two main factors first reduced gaps since the beginning of the year following price increases for super low price brands at the bottom of the market have led to adult smoker upgrading to Marlboro across all three pillars and fortune.  And second, we have strengthened our portfolio for a range of investments in brand initiatives including new launches and innovative line extension. This is evidenced by the strong performance of Marlboro’s capsule and highly mentholated variant as well as the success of our fortune capsule variant which we launched in July this year. Favorable volume mix driven by a 17.8% increase in Marlboro’s shipment volume resulted in improved profitability in the third quarter. The excise tax driven cigarette industry volume decline in Korea continues to moderate sequentially resulting in a decline of approximately 17% September year-to-date excluding estimated inventory movements. And we now expect a similar decline for the full year. Our market share in Korea increased by 1.8 points in the third quarter to 20.4% driven by the strong performance of Marlboro. Shifting to our Reduced-Risk products portfolio, I will now provide a brief update on our commercializations and clinical assessment of iQOS. During the third quarter there were number of important commercial developments. We launched iQOS in Switzerland in August with an initial focus on five major cities and began the national expansion of iQOS in Japan in September. We also progressed with our expansion plan for Italy which includes additional city launches commencing later this quarter as well planned city launches in other markets in late 2015 and early 2016. For which we have accelerated investment spending this year.  Let me remind you that today, iQOS has been launched with the convenience claims of no ash and less smell. As we build our scientific evidence package which I will touch and now we expect to be able to broaden our claims.  Clinical trials are a cornerstone of our robust evidence package to substantiate reduced exposure and a reduced risk claims. We are conducting four types of clinical studies, pharmacokinetics studies, one week reduced exposure studies in the clinic, three month reduced exposure ambulatory studies, and the long-term exposure response studies. We have completed all of this except for the long-term studies. I will now share with you a selection of the results from our three months reduced exposure study in Japan. In the study we measured biomarkers of exposure to harmful and potentially harmful compounds refers to as HVACs in adult smokers were switched iQOS adult smokers who treat for the duration of the study and adult smokers who continues to smoke combustible cigarettes.  The biomarkers were measured in each group over five days in the clinics and then for 85 days outside the clinic. Allowing guys to assess changes in biomarkers of exposure in a closed to real work setting. We then confer the reductions in exposure biomarkers of the group that switch to iQOS with the group that quit. This slide shows the Japan's started results for four key biomarker of exposure. The data show that compared to adult smokers who continues smoking shown in red, the reductions in exposure biomarkers for adult smokers who switched to iQOS shown in blue approach those for the adult smokers who quit for the duration of the study which is shown in green.  In the study, we measured a total of 15 biomarkers of exposures to 15 HVACs. As illustrated by the chart, the average reductions in biomarkers of exposure for adult smokers who switched to iQOS shown in blue reached over 95% of the reduction of serving dose who assist smoking during the starting period shown in green. We expect to finalize the study reports by year end and it will fix to publish the data in the peer review of Scientific Journals in 2016. Recognizing how important it will that iQOS is accepted by adult smokers in the same three month study in Japan we measured the level of product satisfaction of participants who switched to iQOS.  As shown here, after an initial decline in product satisfaction the score rapidly increase and reached levels similar to dose for combustible cigarette. In summary, our scientific assessment of the risk profile of iQOS is well advanced and we are on course with our plan to demonstrate that iQOS is not only a reduced exposure product but also a reduced risk product. Turning now to our free cash flow, we generated $4.5 billion in the first nine months of the year. This is only moderately below our free cash flow for the same period in 2014 despite an adverse currency impact of $1.8 billion. Or resilient cash flow performance was supported by the prudent management of working capital and capital expenditures. In 2015, we continue to forecast free cash flow broadly in line with the last year level despite the significant currency headwinds. In September, our board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4.08 per share reflecting a strong confidence in our business fundamentals and the future prospects. These marks the eight consecutive dividend increase since the spin-off in the March 2008 representing a total increase of approximately 122% or compound annual growth of 12%. As of last Friday's market close our dividend yield of 4.9% was significantly above that of our proxy peer group, our tobacco peer companies and 10 year U.S. treasury notes. In conclusion, we deliver strong currency neutral result in the third quarter reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and the robust business fundamental. Our superior brand portfolio supported by superb commercial organization is driving strong pricing and the further market share gain. We continue to book to progress with the commercialization and clinical assessment of iQOS. Our resilience 2015 free cash flow has been supported by our prudent management of working capital and capital expenditures. Finally, on a currency neutral basis our 2015 EPS guidance reflect the growth rate of 11% to 12% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02. This impressive growth comes notwithstanding the significant incremental investments that we are making in the fourth quarter to support the expansion of iQOS and to range first the favorable momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio. Thank you and I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: As we look to the fourth quarter considering the very strong year-to-date results that we've seen the implied guidance for the fourth quarter clearly reflecting the incremental investment spending effect that you just called out. Can you help dimensional the size of those investment if possible as well? Can you address any trade inventory timing issues that might way on the fourth quarter?
Jacek Olczak: I think that most of the performance in that Q4 the fourth quarter will be driven by our accelerated and being pre-investments behind iQOS and combustible cigarettes. I think as we look at this today differential it should translate that will be slightly below the fourth quarter of last year maybe at par the fourth quarter of last year. So yes there will be a quite investments step up as I said mainly behind the iQOS and the combustible business.
Vivien Azer: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And as we look at the EU and the increasingly more favorable volume dynamics that we seeing, I know you guys called out production in illicit as well as reduced uptake and -- but can you comment on the evolution of price elasticities in that market because the volume trajectory looks particularly impressive giving the pricing that we are seeing in the region?
Jacek Olczak: The volumes trajectory is impressive and there is also the reason and also there isn't why as you remember we're revising the outlook for the total industry volume in the year. I think it is the second or third time actually I think this year and it has also led us to increase our overall EPS guidance for this year. Our elasticity is now turning over some period into their more attractive territory why could call it like this, that's for us always elasticity in the range of -0.3 to -0.5, this is what we think is the source of the underlying elasticity for the tobacco category and we observe essentially in the most of the countries including the Southern Europe. Hence the very strong performance coming from Spain, Italy. Obviously Italy will have their own challenges with Marlboro closing 5 Euro price point.  But overall I think the industry is pretty strong and our volumes obviously are pretty strong as well. I think that many of this positives for the Europe adult from the overall better volume trends to some extend depends on a geography supported by a more attractive elasticity all the reduction in illicit trade should continue to the 2016 so the way we look at this and I know that everyone is now puzzled with Q4 performance but we actually our focus is already on 2016 and how much of these are very positive momentum for the industry but very much for us will continue into the 2016.
Vivien Azer: Perfect. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Matthew.
Matthew Grainger: Thanks. Yeah just first on Indonesia we’ve seen continued deceleration in shipments in consumption this year which seems more linked to the economic environment than pricing but it’s hard to separate out how all of these factors maybe impacting margins and OCI for the Asia region so when you take into account all these various factors pricing, weaker consumption some of the investments you’ve made in selling infrastructure are you comfortable with how the profitability and margins of the Indonesian business have been progressing year-to-date?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, I am very comfortable I mean what we have seen in Indonesia was more in the I think event of the third quarter where we’ve been also adjusting capacity and it resulted in some extra cost which we had to incur but overall I am not that much worry of the shorter trend of the industry volume if you look at the smoking incidents in Indonesia it’s relatively flat as you remember Indonesia is the market when you have a relatively high incidence of stick sales individual stick sales and obviously this allows the consumers to adjust a little bit faster if there is softening on the macro side.  I think so we observing a slight decline in a daily consumption but as I said in my remarks I think if you look at the overall positive demographics of Indonesia and growing the income level et cetera I am still confident 1% to 3% growth outlook for the total industry in the longer term is absolutely attainable pricing is very strong we still obviously don’t know how the tax discussions in Indonesia will unfold for the next year. I think on a positive note is that since the government is recognizing that there was the issue which they inflated tax base due to the change in a payment terms for this year so conferring on a collection side from a government perspective 14 months to 12 months.  Let’s remain hopeful that the rate announced for the next year will take this into consideration at least to some extent we’ll have to see. But in terms of a bottom-line growth of Indonesia I am very confident we’ll have infrastructure brand portfolio is very strong, share for the year looks, market share development looks very attractive and I think Indonesia is the market in which we obviously have the high expectations of a high growth. So I don’t think it’s anything which would worry me at this stage why this should change.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. And then just one clarification just in terms of the bottom-line growth for Indonesia and long-term expectations there, is that consistent with how the businesses performing this year are you seeing growth or is this better characterized as the year where you are reinvesting a bit back into the market?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean we have been investing in Indonesia last and this year is behind deployment of a commercial organization as you know it’s a large country there is a very large sales force retail selling universe is one of the largest in the world. So that obviously requires some appropriate investments if we want to continue to have the right support behind the brands. We have the market in other parts of the world which also on an emerging side if you like and volumes are actually a little bit developing versus I may say versus Indonesia and we can drive the double-digit bottom-line growth. So I think you cannot ever extrapolate directly for one country to another but I think Indonesia is in a good shape to deliver a very solid OCI growth bottom-line growth and remains one of the key contributors to Asia and PNR [ph].
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Thanks Jacek. And then just one question on the regulatory side, just wanted to get your thoughts on the draft version of the PPP agreement which I know right now is sort of under negotiation and on hold. But assuming this is going to be negotiated and will go forward. What do you see is the practical impact of the tobacco carve out if it stays in and is there still a realistic potential for it to be negotiated out.
Jacek Olczak: Well as far as the PPP has no impact on a pending paces right. So it's mainly Australia, UK. But we'll have to see how PPP will be adopted by the rectified by the signature is. And if I may say on my side just say there is unfortunately there is negotiation during the negotiations people who are participating can traded away furnace and access to adjust this for all investors and instead they embrace the discrimination against the one single industry. I'm not sure that people have worried a doubt of the five or six countries actually more than a six countries reported cases when there was a state investors dispute on the -- related to tobaccos. So I think the whole process went in a completely wrong direction. What important for us is that it hasn't deteriorate our position is that we defending very much the trademarks around the plain packaging and does not impact any of our pending cases and we sure that PPP adopt.
Matthew Grainger: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Jacek Olczak: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning.
Nick Rolli: Good morning Judy.
Judy Hong: So just and thinking about 2016, I know it's a little bit too early but you talked about how you focused on continuing to growth in 2016. So as we look at this year obviously 11% to 12% expects currency growth above your kind a near to medium-term target that you lead out at your Investor Day in 2014. So given the momentum you have in EU, you're lapping the incremental spending behind the iQOS. Just any reason to think that that kind of above average or above near to medium-term growth in 2016 can continue at this point?
Jacek Olczak: Look Judy the outlook for the tobacco market has improved has improved this year. For us in particular in terms of the volume ex-pricing and overall profit growth. So I mean a many of the project its which will have offset this year which will have businesses this year in our opinion should continue in the 2016. I think it's a pretty much sure at this stage to talk about the specific guidance for 2016. Our target of 8% to 10% on EPS I think seems obtainable. But we need the more information to come up with the formal guidance for next year. I think in February we will be in a good positions to talk about.  But yes that the trends from the Europe to Russia all the way still repeated Russia remains in our worse place. The headline macros are not extremely positive although of the tobacco market size and the cigarette market side I mean that seems that consumer so far are navigating the pretty strongly. You will have to also understand that this year we're very pleased we're very happy with the performance of this year but not necessarily we've had the most challenging performance like the year before.  Correspondingly we'll have to see how the 2016 will compared to 2015. So I mean I remains very optimistic we've been I have to admit surprise ourselves by this strong performance of the EU region. I am very glad that it comes from the number of markets being total markets but also strong pricing and the markets trend. EEMA is very strong, Latin America is very strong. Asia we know that we have a couple of issues, mainly in Japan which I have to admit is a disappointing and below our expectations with regards to market share. But overall we look very optimistically into the 2016.
Judy Hong: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on FX. So I think I have it in my notes, I think earlier in the year you hedged about I can't remember the 60% on the Yens and the effective hedge rate was one-tenth or around that level. So can you just update on how you are hedged at this point and what the effective rate is?
Jacek Olczak: We don't talk that way at the beginning of the year we only give the hedge coverage ratio for the current year. So in February we are giving currency the guidance, we said that we will hedge up to 60%, obviously there were few moments during a year when the Yen strengthen at least for the short period of time. So we took advantage of that. If you remember our policies to look at have 12 to 18 months. So we prefer to assume that we have already have hedged some of our cash flow from Japan going in 2016.  We've already disclosed this number when we will give the guidance in February next year. When it comes to effective rate just to help a little bit to estimate the currency impact in Q3 within our effective Yen, effective rate of Yen to the Dollar for us was 111 slightly above 111 which comprise to about 98 Yen in Q3 of past year. So you could see for the hedging strategy we had about 9-10 Yen below the current spot rates of Yen.
Judy Hong: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Bushnell of Exane.
James Bushnell: Hi, good morning or good afternoon in Switzerland.
Jacek Olczak: Good afternoon, good morning.
James Bushnell: Thank you. I have two questions please. The first one is just around pricing in Europe. You have pricing around 5% which is a little bit softer than the first two quarters of the year. I just wonder if those anything specific you call out there or if that strictly a mathematical effects and then my second -- sorry, I'll let you answer the first question.
Jacek Olczak: No, this is mainly I guess the due to the timing of implementation. You might have never will have the perfect type of timing alignment. So some of the pricing which were taking in 2014 to some of the -- in 2015 depends on the counterfeit. It's nothing specific, nothing which is -- I think the pricing in the Europe is here so far and this full year is going to be very strong and a much stronger than we had in the past year.
James Bushnell: Okay, thank you and then just to drill in a bit more on Italy. You obviously have good pricing this year. I wondered if you could comment on what the outlook might be for the tax policy in 2016 and now that Marlboro is really above that ramp upfront which is hurt you on the share basis? Are you comfortable that moving it out further will not have similar effect? How are you thinking about the share loss of Marlboro in Italy?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean it's not anything which comes by surprise. I mean them usually when we cross their importance from psychological perspective one price point. Marlboro usually is a first brand in the market to do this. It's not really as I said surprised that the Marlboro has a bit of a headwind at that time. I think we -- I'm happy that the prices went up in Italy. There was a small reduction in the price -- I mean that's very helpful. You cross that price points and later on consumer is to be less sensitive with the next price increases. I think it's good that Marlboro is behind the price point. Let's put it that way.
James Bushnell: And is there any due from the Italian government in terms of what might happen to taxes next year?
Jacek Olczak: No, we'll have to see. I mean usually these discussions are taking place literally almost around the year end or beginning of the year. So for Italy we'll have to see how they want to approach. If they make the very good move as you remember at the beginning of this year. Let's hope that they will continue with this direction in 2016.
James Bushnell: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Chris.
Chris Growe: Good afternoon to you. Thank you. Two question for you if I could, the first would be that if your volume performance again this quarter was better than what I expected and you had some improvements in the EU and Russia in particular, little software in Indonesia in terms of your outlook there. So as you look at the overall line performance being stronger than certainly I thought for the quarter and we're just talking for like 1 to 1.5% decline in volume for the year we just push more towards the lower end of that range or just wanted to get some color around some of the big markets that are improving how that’s helping your overall volume performance.
Jacek Olczak: Look, I would still confirm it will be somewhere in the range of a 1% to 1.5% I don’t think we are in a position now to speculate we’ll be closer to 1%. As you know Q4 is always there a quarter when you have some distortions coming from a fact that end of the year or beginning of the year the tax increases, price changes et cetera. So I think for a cost of doubt for 1% to 1.5% is pretty realistic, EU has a good volume it’s no question about it, Russia we are rolling out the 5 rubles per pack price increase so some of this prices already will roll through the market we’ll see how that’s going impact the overall industry and our shipments volume that from the we have a sequential good performance in Korea, Philippines there is a good performance overall see how we close but it looks good and as I said before I think some of the positive industry trends and this is not just the quarter-on-quarter but longer term I think they should continue to happen in the 2016.
Chris Growe: Okay. Just one other question probably which is around the Asia division overall and we talk last quarter on the call about the Asia division approaching in your mid-term guidance sort of range for profitability this quarter and I think year-to-date you are up around 4% I guess so relate to that should we expect a stronger fourth quarter in that Asia region and then related to that should we see any inventory adjustments occurring in Japan in this fourth quarter it’s been kind of an up and down pattern for those this year.
Jacek Olczak: No we are taking the inventory adjustment are related to the lower than expected market share so obviously we don’t want to – high inventories and try to have something which reflects the at least short-term forecast. So depends how we perform in Q4 I mean there might be some inventory movement we are also comparing Q4 to the distorted Q4 last year when we are going to shutting down the factory in Holland in Europe, which ship most of the product to Japan used to be shipped from this factory.  So we are building some inventory to be on a safer side. If you go to the overall performance of the Asia region Asia is a recipient of increased investment this year behind iQOS and also behind the combustible cigarette because we are investing obviously Japan is in a full fledge rollout to about 60% of the total market we started in September we have not deployed all tools behind iQOS in the market we will be gearing up to opening more iQOS flagship stores is obviously is going to have a cost impact there was an increased investment behind the cigarette category in Philippines behind the very strong momentum and the narrowing of the price gaps continue investment in Indonesia.  So Asia will not have a spectacular performance this year better than the last year but we will not have a spectacular performance this year.
Chris Growe: Okay. Thank you for your time.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on iQOS in Italy and the draft tobacco products directive are you broadly happy with the directive and as it written such that you will be able to ultimately make reduce risk claims on iQOS? And then could you update us on any new product and or technology innovation behind iQOS and when you might be ready to roll something out?
Jacek Olczak: I think we are pleased with the development of the tobacco product directive so far is being transport into the Italian legislation I think critical for us is and therefore we announced publicly today the results of our 90 days or three months exposure study because that’s one of the key elements of us discussing with regulatory bodies on the claims and we’re going to maybe about the products so that will be positive. We're now at this stage when we fine tuning of finalizing the claims as seems them we have customers so we will not have as well achieve the proper understanding. As I think we have a pretty solid evidence at this stage to progress and support iQOS rollouts with the reduced at least exposure claims at this stage.  In terms of the new innovations, yes there is a pipeline of a new developments behind iQOS for obvious reasons Bonnie I can't tell you at this stage, but yes I mean I believe that pretty strong innovations that which will come into the market for this year and that to the new market as the large group of the new markets next year when they will see the further enhanced the improved versions of iQOS in terms of HeatSticks. And the variety of the blend type directions which we can offer as well as iQOS is the device in terms of attached field more user friendly electronics and so on. So as you remember [indiscernible] was launched in the pretty industrial I would say high performance iQOS device. But you are all in these the new version much more modern and a much more I believe actually to smokers to adult smokers. And I think we'll be deploying more of these innovations as we speak.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay thanks. And then I just have sort of big picture question as you think about your business overall, can you identify for us markets for you're seeing the biggest improvements and down trending pressures easing or moderating just in summary?
Jacek Olczak: Well I think EU overall is the holds very well actually improved very well. To the extent that the mix essentially issue for us does not exists in the EU market. But that's very good. You have in EEMA region you will have the strong performance we've up trading in the big part of the North Africa. Turkey holds very well I mean despite the fact that total industry volumes up and obviously some of this early stage recoveries usually initially fuel the bottom part of the market, but if I look at the parliament and the Marlboro share performance despite the strong market. I mean it's pretty -- it's very solid. You have obviously big up trading in Philippines right as a result above a closure of --. And well it's very important to us is that it's not the one product variance of Marlboro which takes the benefit of the up trading is across all variance of Marlboro we see the up trading. So that's important, but as we said we'll have to see how the pricing further unfolds in Philippines, but so far year it is that clears as we initially planned despite the fact that as you remember we had a couple of difficult years in Philippines but the recoveries is on a good track.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Bill Marshall of Barclays.
Bill Marshall: Hi. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Bill.
Bill Marshall: Just kind of building off with that question actually. I want to talk about trade because it feels like you mentioned a quite a bit in the press release today mostly on the positive side particularly in the EU and EEMA. A little bit more negative it sounded like in Asia with some increases in listed trade. Has this become more of a cyclical factor for you guys and kind of again going back to last question indicative of up trading and down trading? Or is it something that some governments are starting to take an even harder line and you're seeing some improvement there.
Jacek Olczak: No just to clarify I think the only market which we have a well sharp growing at least way at this stage is Australia. Okay, it would be something in Pakistan but the adjust [ph] is a little long. You have generally we can observe a better illicit or lower illicit trade levels in EU in the number of markets not just the one particular. And that's the product that's I think this is strongly supporting the total industry recovery or better trends. We have Philippines alone with the higher declarations coming from a mighty I mean that's clearly the recovery of that tax not paid volumes and Turkey has the extremely strong recovery. I think usually I think as its highest level if I recall Turkey was about 20% of the listed trade penetration and I think recently shrink to about 11%. So that's really lowest over the long period of time incidence of the listed trade in Turkey. If you pay net-net that's about 10 points of a straight recovery and you see year-to-date market in Turkey about 10%, there was underlying growth, secular growth in Turkey. But still 10% only can be explained by the recovery of the listed trade. So we see it in the number of geographies. Now we have invested also a lot of efforts manpower effort behind engaging with the government, engaging with the key stakeholders being the custom law enforcement etcetera international organization. I think it's finally I'm going to start bringing a very good fruit and that's thing that many of this positive development of the listed trade. So my opinion continues at least in the near future.
Bill Marshall: Okay, great. Thank you and then just a point of clarification when we talk about this spending particularly behind iQOS, did you push any of that spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter? And if so could you quantify any of that spending for us and what this could mean as we look forward to that push into 2016 at all or is this kind of your on track for the plan how do you saw it earlier in the year? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: I think we have a more of the push from a 2016 and in 2015 as we revised our plans and we rolled-out iQOS to the more geographies that we have initially planned at the beginning of the year. You might have some distortion, the timing in fact between Q3 and Q4 because once we accelerated our plans for deployment I mean as far as you need to have a plans developed on a solid when you come spending. So usually spending follows a little bit after the plans are discussed approved and released to the market ready to go.  But I think it's the more of the 2016 going to 2015 in terms of iQOS over an acceleration than just the Q3 to Q4 and if I remember we have been indicating that on the back half of the year we will have that we expect the higher spending on iQOS and throughout the list that as we observe during the first three quarters of the year much stronger momentum behind the cigarette business which have also step up some investment behind that cargo of our portfolio.
Bill Marshall: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery: Good morning, good afternoon.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Michael Lavery: I just wanted to follow up on Vivien's question first and clarify make sure I call what you said, you said that it might you are talking about 4Q, you are talking about parity to last year’s 4Q or maybe slightly below, was that on EPS basis?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, this was on EPS basis. Thanks for helping to clarify. I said this would be can't be slightly below last year maybe as parity. But this is on EPS currency to be to formally drive.
Michael Lavery: Also then if you've guessed, if my math is right you've got $3.61 for the 9 months-to-date this year. It looks like that would mean a 74 to 79 in fourth quarter for your full year guidance. But I reconcile it with slightly below last year? It felt like that's quite a bit below even with currency included.
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean I think you mark these both right. I think the guidance it depends on which point of a new guidance you are going to base the calculation to take out what we had in the Q4 and that's the -- about the results.
Michael Lavery: Okay and then just what maybe to dig into that a little bit more and get some color on as a spending you've got year-to-date and average quarterly organic growth rate of around 6.5% and organic EBIT growth around the 11% average, last year’s 4Q organic EBIT growth was down 12. So it's your easiest comparison and you have a lot of momentum this year. How much could you possibly spend in that? I mean it looks like you might need $300 million to $400 million of incremental investments to get to the kind a numbers you're talking about. Do you even have the abilities to spend that much in an effective way in one quarter?
Jacek Olczak: We have a very large organization. I think twice the sizeable brand iQOS itself. I think 400 is on a high side but I think it will be an obviously substantially do the comps. When you do the comps you have to just notice the one thing that growth on those CI level last year versus lowering the EPS level I mean it's slightly different. We have the few items that's below their CI level. But it will still stay with my maps in on an EPS in the Q1 and on an ex-currency basis we put the below what have last year.
Michael Lavery: Okay now that's very helpful. Thanks. And then just touching back on Indonesia, you're saying that you think the category volumes probably are going to be about flat this year. But with the last two quarters down over 4%. It looks like that would be, meaning about a 3% gain in 4Q or about 7 point improvement. Obviously there is some macro pressure there that's helping the inflation side because inflation is moderating. But is there any particular catalyst for why the category might accelerate that rapidly for 4Q or maybe we're missing.
Jacek Olczak: Well this is a cigarette industry estimate on the quarterly basis. And I said that in one of the previous calls I wouldn't pay that much attention how the estimate is being done and what the numbers are on the quarterly basis. I think for the full year I think it seems that Indonesia based on our outlook Indonesia will turn to be a flattish or flat versus last year. You might have some movement between the quarters. It's marginally the consumption level of the industry shipments volumes so will have to both into the timing of the price changes in the market and what's happened last quarter versus during the fourth quarter of last year. And what expect at this -- expect it will happen in a fourth quarter of this year.  I think for this year yes I mean you have the softer end of volumes in Indonesia I mean that's slightly a lower sort of a performance. But as I said in my remarks, it hasn't nothing really comes in Indonesia which will trouble us in our view then in the longer term the market is potential to grow with the 1% to 2% range. It's critical for us is to know whether the tax rate for the next year and then we done have the better estimate have Indonesia market will perform good. We think is that the pricing is very strong I think a lot of investments which we have made behind the commercial organization as well as the capacity restructuring between handmade and hand -- all than the machine by cigarette is done. There is solid performance next year.
Michael Lavery: Okay now that's helpful. And then just on Australia you've mentioned the strong pricing there and the gains in bond street and some other positives. Just on a total view that certainly was a big issue last year it seems like it's at the minimum now getting the same attention because it's improved a good bit. Can you just put that total your total business there in context and how you see the maybe next rest of the year or beyond in terms of outlook for that?
Jacek Olczak: Well I don't think we've -- with Australia yet okay. This year Australia by far less of a drop for our Asia and the total PMI performance that was last year. But we cannot say -- here that this kind of segments are moderated to muted its growth compared to how fast the segment was growing essentially all quarters of last year. We are much more presenting the segment with bond street I mean enhance the significant share advancement. We still observe quite a level of a discounting in the market.  So I mean now the market the total market size is a bit distorted because the just after the tax change tax exchange. We'll have to see I think we've did and before coming tax changes we should hopefully see moderation of the heavy discounting that very much at the bottom of the market and we’ll have to see the trends are slightly better but it’s I wouldn’t call that Australia is behind.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Phil Quorum [ph] of Morningstar.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Jacek you are building a compelling case behind iQOS my question is how would you characterize your confidence at this that – that will be the category that emerges with the highest acceptance rate among consumers? And then what’s the implication of that on other categories, would it still make sense to spend behind platforms three and four for example? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: I maybe start with the second part of your question I think it makes sense to continue our investment in terms of a product development and its assessment scientific assessment behind the other platforms because we think that there is a market for both fully electronic cigarette as well as the products which are based on a – heat not burg, heat not burn today offers consumers what we observe in the market a level of a satisfaction which is very comparable to the combustible cigarette.  Knowing that the evidence which we have presented also today makes us confident that this is a product which significantly reduces the risk profile of the consumers versus continuing smoking combustible cigarette I think we will be in a position to demonstrate based again on our studies and the whole portfolio of evidence that the product is reducing significantly the risk for smoking versus the traditional combustible product.  Acceptance is a very important component also in a few of our strategy of not only demonstrating that we can reduce the harm to individual but we can reduce the harm to population, because you might have a great product which is accepted which is of a reduce which has a reduced risk profile but is not accepted by consumers and frankly speaking you not address the problem the issue. So yes we remain very confident that the current product which we have iQOS has a big potential but we also think that consumers not all consumers will like to stay within tobacco based products and they may for variety of reasons they may elect to go into the straight non-tobacco based but nicotine based electronic cigarette as with – initial high interest in many markets including UK and some others in the Europe or the U.S. so yes we will continue investing behind all four platforms as we believe there is a room and a potential for each of these platforms going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.
Adam Spielman: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. On the reduced risk products can you tell me who will give you permission to make the claims either reduced exposure or reduced risk claims is that national versus in every country would it require EU central permission from Brazil for EU countries? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Well in the case of the United States that’s clearly FDA in the case of the EU the way that European tobacco product directive is being transferred it is being delegated to the individual member state. So we will have to have well the first we’ll have to determine what sort of a process individual member states wants to have in the territory to allow for the claims et cetera. But it’s very, very specific or very different country by country and market by market there are some markets today where we can go and make claims already as we say today.
Adam Spielman: And just follow-up. Within the markets that you also currently we’re currently talking about which I guess is the European markets particularly Italy, Switzerland which is obviously non-EU, Japan wherever countries where you have the best dialog and you think you got the best chance of making a health claimer or reduced risk reduced exposure claim.
Jacek Olczak: I think you know the countries we have a good engagement. The critical is that we need to support the discussions the engagement with the [indiscernible]. And therefore it was very critical for us that we progressing as per plan in the conducting this started as we announced today. The 90 days starter which was important I know beyond the one piece of EBITDA which you are bringing to the table. Obviously the more evidence you have at the table the more constructive discussions you have. As I think we’re on a good path in each of this country despite the fact that they have some differences in the regular projects.
Adam Spielman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Russo from Russo Guard [ph].
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Congratulations on wonderful numbers keep up the good work. I was curious I may have missed the comments on that Transpacific partners backed up forward revising legislations. And wondered what comments you may have made or what you might make on that.
Jacek Olczak: So thank you very much for congratulations. On the PPP I've made two comments one is that PPP is no impact on a pending phases which you have. So it's been most importantly the case which we have in Australia will not be impacted by the PPP. Going forward, we'll have to see solid PPP is going to be primarily adopted by the individual signatures of the street.  As I hear I mean in the US in particular although we're seeing some other places is not necessary that it receives enormous reception. For obvious reasons which I mentioned because the net of – have things allows one in Australia and if you look at the statistics of all the investors states disputes so far, it will bit more going to be see this comes with dispute between the investors and the days and on the two of the business relates to tobacco.  So difficult to find the logic while industry is convert. It was all about the later of what we called treatment it will access adjusted and some negotiators have violated or forgot about that principle. It's a sad story but as I said at this stage I don't think it impact on our abilities to defend our positions with regards to protecting our trade more.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And so did you will challenged because its present issue and arbitrary and we don't think it happen might this year is that cause of action regarding Australia.
Jacek Olczak: That's correct.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International’s Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 second quarter results. You may access the release on our Web site at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2015 and comparing them to the same periods in 2014, unless otherwise stated.A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site.Reduced risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second quarter. Organic cigarette volume was strong declining by a modest 1.4% due to lower cigarette industry volume across all regions, partly offset by market share gains in Asia, EEMA and Latin America and Canada region. On a June year-to-date basis, our organic cigarette volume was essentially flat or down by approximately 1% excluding inventory movements. For 2015, we forecast an organic cigarette volume decline in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the quarter were up by 4.5% and 6.1% respectively excluding currency and acquisitions. This growth was driven by strong pricing across all regions partially offset by lower volume largely in the Asia and EU regions. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency grew by 9.2% to $1.54. June year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS grew by 15.8% excluding currency. This growth benefited from a gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the excise tax increase effective January 2015. As announced in our earnings release this morning we are reaffirming our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.32 to $4.42. Our guidance includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15 per share at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding currency, our 2015 guidance continues to represent a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. Giving our better than anticipated volume and market share performance we now expect to be towards the upper-end of this range. As previously communicated our guidance includes incremental investment during the second half of the year to support the deployment of iQOS in Japan, Italy and additional 2015 launch markets. Our guidance now also includes accelerated spending in the fourth quarter behind planned iQOS launches in 2016, as well as incremental marketing investment in the second half to further reinforce the favorable momentum of our combustible business. As discussed in today’s press release, our guidance excludes the potential impact of the motion that is currently before the Québec court of appeal related to a judgment involving the two-class actions against our Canadian affiliate Rothmans, Benson & Hedges. Should the court of appeal deny the motion PMI expects to incur an after-tax charge of approximately $0.09 per share in the second quarter which would have a corresponding impact on our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance. Apparently RBH’s appeal on the merit of the case is pending before the appeal in court. Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our current guidance remains unchanged versus our April guidance there has been a shift since then in its composition. As you can see on this chart the positive impact of the euro has been offset notably by the unfavorable impact of the Russian ruble. Strong pricing was the key driver of our financial performance, in the second quarter we recorded a variance of $540 million reflecting higher pricing across all four regions. We increased the retail prices during the quarter in key markets such as Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia. Our June year-to-date pricing variance of $1.1 billion leaves us well positioned to achieve a full year pricing broadly in line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion. As a reminder, our first up pricing volumes includes the gain in Korea that I discussed earlier. Our results in the quarter were underpinned by continuous market share gains. Share in our top-30 OCI markets grew by 0.1 points to 37.5% with our share up or essentially flat in 17 of this market. Our share performance was supported by the strength of our leading brand portfolio which continues to benefit from the rollout of our new commercial approach. The integration of marketing and sales expertise increased consumer focus and field salesforce empowerment are proving to be a competitive advantage. Importantly, Marlboro was a key contributor to our share growth. The brand’s international share excluding China in the U.S. increased by 0.3 points to 9.5%, this performance was broad-based with share up in all four regions. Marlboro share benefited from the federal rollout of the new 2.0 architecture which was introduced in some 20 additional markets during the quarter predominantly in the EEMA region. By year-end, we expect to have rollout Marlboro 2.0 in approximately 100 markets. I will now provide an update on selected geographies beginning with the EU region. Cigarette industry volume in the second quarter declined by 3% or 2.3% excluding trade inventory movements. Consequently, we now expect a decline of 3% to 3.5% for the full year versus our previous forecast of approximately 4%. Our new forecast reflect the improving microeconomic conditions and moderation in the level of illicit trade led out switching to fine cut products and the lower prevalence of e-vapor products. The moderation the level of illicit trade in the quarter is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It’s concluded that the consumption of counterfeit and contraband products declined in 2014 across most EU markets with France and the UK being notable exceptions. While our cigarette market share for the EU region was stable at 40.4% in the second quarter our top-three brands, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield all gained share. Marlboro cigarette share was up in four of the top six largest markets by industry volume with particularly strong growth in Germany and Spain. However Marlboro share declined in Italy following the brand’s move above the €5 per pack retail price point during the first quarter. Adjusted OCI grew by 4.9% in the quarter excluding currency and acquisitions driven by strong pricing which more than offset our cigarette volume decline due to a lower total market. Turning now to Russia. The decline in cigarette industry volume accelerated to 4.2% in the quarter resulting in a June year-to-date decrease of 6.5%. We now expect a full year decline towards the lower end of our 8% to 10% forecast range. However, the economic environment remains fragile and we are witnessing some signs of down-tradings to the low price segment. Our excellent performance in this important market continues in the quarter. We recorded a May quarter-to-date share gain of 0.8 points to reach 27.6% driven notably by above premium parliament, as well as low price Bond Street and super-low mix, the above which also benefited from wider distribution in the Eastern part of the council. Our cigarette volume grew by 5.3% in the quarter. The combination of the volume increase and higher unit margins driven by significant retail price increases resulted in strong double-digit OCI growth in the quarter excluding currency. I will now cover selected markets in our Asia region beginning with Indonesia. Cigarette industry volume declined by 4.6% in the quarter, following strong first quarter growth of 6%. On a June year-to-date prices industry volume increased by 0.4%. The shift in adult smoker’s preferences from hand-rolls to machine-made kretek cigarette continued in the second quarter with the expansion of the overall machine-made kretek segment driven by the accelerated share growth of full-flavor products. The segment share of lighter-tasting products declined slightly. Our market share increased by 0.5 points to 35.2 despite our relatively high exposure to the declining hand-rolled kretek segment. The share growth was led by Dji Sam Soe Magnum which helped drive a 2.5 point increase in our share of the machine-made full-flavor kretek segment and Sampoerna A our leading machine-made lighter-tasting kretek brand. During the quarter we further realigned our production from hand-rolls to machine-made kretek cigarette. While this had an adverse impact on the Asia region's cost in the quarter, it should provide an operational foundation better suited for long-term growth. Over the mid to long-term we expect cigarette industry volume to increase within a range of 1% to 3% annually driven by the growing adult population and rising income levels. We forecast growth towards the lower end of this range in 2015 due to the recent softening of the economic environment. As announced last month Sampoerna will explore options to comply with the Indonesian Stock Exchange's mandatory requirement of 7.5% minimum public shareholding by January 30, 2016. This includes potential capital market transactions. In Japan cigarette industry volume increased by 11% in the quarter due to the timing of retail trade inventory movements related to the April 2014 tax driven price increases. However, industry volume declined by 1.7% excluding this distortion and by 2.6% on a June year-to-date basis consistent with our forecast of for a full year decline of 2.5% to 3%. Our market share declined by 1 point in the quarter to 25.4% so it was down by a more modest 0.4 points after adjusting for inventory movements. We continue to invest behind our brand and for 2015 expect our share to be broadly in line with last year's level. We’re supporting the Marlboro 2.0 architecture which we began rolling out at the end of March and also investing behind our strong pipeline of innovation as highlighted by the recent launch of the two large variance in the rapidly growing new taste menthol segment. In the Philippines the competitive environment continues to improve during the quarter benefiting from the introduction of tax terms. Smoking prevalence remained stable in the quarter, however average daily consumption declined due to higher retail prices. Although it did not deteriorate on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. This indicates that adult smokers have largely adjusted to higher prices at the bottom of the market. While our market share declined due to higher estimated duty paid volume by our principle local competitor, Marlboro's share increased by 2.1 points to 20.2%. The brand benefited from improved price cost which helped drive the volume increase of 18.1%. As a result of the improved competitive environment and the excellent performance of Marlboro we’re increasingly optimistic about the OCI outlook for the Philippines and are expecting strong growth this year excluding currency. Turning now to our RRP portfolio, we will commence the national expansion of iQOS in Japan this September. Building on the success of our pilot launch in Nagoya, iQOS will be rollout in few regions at the price of ¥9,980 or approximately $80. The rollout will feature an upgraded version of our iQOS in new colors and textures to broaden its appeal among adult smokers. Our expansion plan for Italy also remains on-track with additional city launches commencing later this year. I am also extremely pleased to announce the launch of iQOS in Switzerland this August. The launch will focus on five major cities with retail distribution in approximately 250 outlets by the end of October. The iQOS kit will feature the upgraded version of iQOS while the Marlboro HeatSticks will be available in regular, smooth and menthol variants. On our e-commerce platform the kit will have a retail price of CHF 80 or approximately $85 and HeatSticks will return with a premium positioning at CHF 8 per pack of 20. We generated free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the first half of the year. This was in line with our free cash flow for the first half of 2014 despite an adverse currency impact of $1.6 billion. Our resilient cash flow performance was supported by prudent cash flow management particularly with regard to working capital and capital expenditures. For 2015 we forecast free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year’s level despite the significant currency headwind. In conclusion our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second quarter with a modest organic cigarette volume decline and a strong currency neutral financial result driven by robust business fundamentals. In the combustible business our superior brand portfolio supported by a superb commercial organization is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Meanwhile our iQOS pilot launches are performing well we’re on-track with further rollouts in Japan and Italy and will soon be launching the product in Switzerland. We remain committed to returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As of last Friday’s market close our dividend yield of 4.9% was significantly above that of our tobacco peer growth and a 10 year U.S. treasury notes. On a currency neutral basis, our 2015 EPS guidance reflects the growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02. Given our better than anticipated performance we now expect to be towards the upper-end of this range. Thank you. And now we’ll be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: So first I guess if we think about your guidance for the full year you’re thinking the FX neutral earnings growth is coming in at the upper-end of the range. Obviously the first half has been pretty strong. So it sounds like maybe there is some incremental spending that you kind of called out around the iQOS as well as the combustibles. So, is there a way to kind of quantify some of that incremental spending beyond what you had anticipated at the beginning of the year? And then what is sort of prompting some of that incremental spending both on the iQOS side and then on the combustible side?
Jacek Olczak: Look Judy clearly as I said in my remarks there is incremental spending by accelerating some 2016 launches of iQOS towards the beginning of the year and we have to ramp-up the infrastructure already and preparations already this year. As we increasing the investment behind the combustible business but as you have noticed I mean there we have a very strong momentum share growth momentum in a number of markets behind Marlboro and other international brands so we think it’s just the right time to further support the performance of this brand. And frankly speaking we slowly start looking more already into the 2016 we’ve had things that will have a very strong 2016 but we are trying to maintain that momentum going forward. I will -- you have to excuse me but I will rather not quantify how much is the next job but clearly will be above our guidance absent this additional investment.
Judy Hong: And then just in the second quarter the margins in Asia came in a little bit softer and I think underlying FX neutral earnings or operating income growth was down a little bit which I guess it’s a little bit surprising given the strong volume performance that you had in Japan. So I know you sited the Indonesia distribution expenses. Can you just talk about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the second quarter Asia margins? And is the Indonesia cost increases sort of one-time for the quarter or is this sort of a continuation into the next few quarters?
Jacek Olczak: I think in Indonesia and specifically we had an extra expense in Q2 connecting with reallocating of the capacity between our hand-rolled facilities and the machine-made facilities. So this is more of the sort of the one timer but it’s clearly hits the entire Asia regions when it comes to the profit margins and overall profitability. I think for the full year, Asia clearly will have better much better performance that we had last year but last year Asia had a pretty I could say a lower lousy performance okay. But Asia is hitting towards their needs to -- is approaching their needs to long-term growth target. I mean they may miss it by a bit but I think Asia overall is looking good going forward for the full year.
Judy Hong: And then my last question, just on the Sampoerna decision that I guess you’re looking at in terms of some of the capital market transaction potentially. Can you just help us how you’re thinking about some of that decision? And to the extent that there is additional cash flow that comes in with that transaction would you think about that giving it some cushion to raise the dividends and start resuming the share buyback?
Jacek Olczak: Well, first we need to make a decision which other new -- we actually - we’re finally pursue in Indonesia but -- so I was parked for a moment the question how will a distributor eventual proceed from the transaction if the transactions happened I will just close that question, park that questions for the later. As you know I mean there is on the one hand the requirements to have public flow of over 7.5% we’re clearly below that 7.5% on the other hand you have a increased out rolls which are not necessary the most effective versus somehow in between these two parameters we’ll have to make our decision. But I will just -- we have to wait there some time until we conclude what is the best option for the Company and the shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: My first question has to do with your outlook on pricing, it clearly it’s been incredibly robust in the first half of the year and you noted the benefit of Korea. But as I look to the back half given how much pricing you’ve already realized. Are there any other callouts in terms of you guys ending up realizing pricing roughly in line with your historical average because right now it would look like you would be tracking ahead of that?
Jacek Olczak: We might come slightly above the historical average therefore the language which we use is they will brought in line so don’t haunt by $20 million or $30 million. But I think we are looking into the strong pricing for this year but overall pricing environment with the tax and the volumes total industry volume I think are playing on our side. So yes we’re looking for the strong pricing for this year.
Vivien Azer: The second question has to do with Russia while it’s encouraging to hear that you think volumes will come in at kind of the better end of the range is offset being the down-trading it feels to me like the down-trading has been at play for a while given the outsized volume gains that you’ve seen for your lower priced brands. So could you elaborate on that comment a little bit? Are you seeing down-trading accelerating, is that coincident with the second price increase having hit any other color I think would be helpful?
Jacek Olczak: I think that’s not until the Q1 I remember the same questions would been asked at that time I said that we don’t really observe much of an down-trading growth or down-trading at all in Russia I mean as we are currently into Q2 yes there was a price increase which was hitting the market in between I mean yes you could see that the market somehow consolidate in middle I mean the super low price segments are losing the low price it’s gaining the premium is slightly losing. So yes you have a down-trading. And we’ve always had the Russia on the watch out list due to the underlying macros and the overall sentiment et cetera. Good news is that the Russian volumes I mean it seems that we are confronted with a bit better elasticities that we price elasticities which we initially assumed. Hence our revision that more likely or most likely Russia will end the year with about 8% or closer to 8% industry volume decline versus the initial range of 8% to 10%. The volumes for the year-to-date are pretty strong taking into consideration overall market situations and the pricing taken. So yes I mean a down-trading is where we start seeing. Now it’s not really a big surprise because Russia operates with a comfort and a matured market with a pretty wide price drops. And the gap between a premium and the low price cigarettes are much higher than would you for example seen in the Western or in the European Union. So yes there is some room for the consumers to at least temporarily mitigate some of the micro headwinds by hopefully temporary going to the lower price segment. But remember Russia is one of the markets when you see the down-trading if micro is a bit of reoccur situations improve we could see the up trading. Good news for us is that I think portfolio wise and I think this was supported by the performance of our -- two or three brands but bumps -- bumps through next to the bottom of the market and premium model parliament or a cost premium parliament which all three brands are gaining share. So portfolio wise we’re okay we still have to continue watching how Russia unfolds in terms of dynamics between the price segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: I just had two questions first within EEMA results were obviously still quite good on an overall basis given all the volatility in the region, but I’ve noticed the price mix in OCI growth for both but it’s below trend. Typically we’ve seen them growing at a double-digit rate. So what factors could you call out that have contributed to the more moderate rate of growth in the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think the pricing was coming stronger and as planned I think you will slightly presumably would have an impact of some sort of a mix, I mean partially driven by Russia, okay, so this is what it is but overall I think EEMA is and Russia in particular we are expecting very strong performance this year for the full year both Russia and the EEMA. I mean a few other locations the upper geographies in EEMA which have a strong performance, North Africa I mean a few others so I think we feel positive on the outlook for this year for instance.
Matthew Grainger: And second question just on iQOS in Switzerland. Can you talk a little bit more about the determination of the price point for the HeatSticks themselves and just at a broader level what have your leanings’ been from Italy and Japan on relative price points. How does the retail price weighed francs compared to comparable pack of Marlboro cigarettes? Do we have any clarity on the tax treatment?
Jacek Olczak: Marlboro HeatStick for the pack of 20 is slightly below the Marlboro I think that it's 8 fracs 50 we decided to go in this market with Marlboro with 8 we have had a tax ratification and as in Japan in Italy iQOS HeatSticks are not classified as a cigarette product and hence will enjoy the lower taxation than the combustible cigarettes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little more on our Marlboro Architecture since you have seen such a positive impacts from Marlboro 2.0 in several markets and then could you give us an idea which particular markets do you feel there could be even more upside potential?
Jacek Olczak: Look it’s rolling as we speak as Marlboro 2.0 in the additional market as I said by year-end we should see the mark of about 100 markets so that essentially must covers most of our important geographies and as well we see and I think if you look at the performance of Marlboro in Germany I think it's clearly is an impact of a Marlboro 2.0 I think I would say that performance in Germany actually goes above our expectations and if I look at the demographics how we manage to change the demographic behind the Marlboro so it’s not just the market share current but also how the demographic if goes well from the future of Marlboro I mean Germany would be one of the market that we can see the further upside. But in general in essentially all geographies Marlboro the new support I mean all sorts of connected with the commercial approach et cetera, I mean the year the result.
Bonnie Herzog: And that’s a good point and you mentioned Germany because clearly it's done very well, so how realistic do you think it would be to assume the performance that you have seen there could be replicated in some of the other key markets?
Jacek Olczak: Well it is being replicated, I mean it might be to the -- not to that extent as in Germany but overall if I look at the changing demographics behind the Marlboro the LA 24 share the values of Marlboro of how Marlboro resonates more on the dynamic innovative sort of a brand. I mean this qualitative assessment of the Marlboro is by far better in essentially all geographies when we launch brand. I can't find in memory a market which wouldn't a big one. Our market share performance in a current period from place-to-place may also being targeted by the given the price situations I would call out for example Mexico, right? Where yes there is a bit of a down-trading in the market there are some pricing pressures at the bottom of the market so you might have a temporary sort of the brand share erosion but what we really focus on is to making sure that the underlying demographics behind the brands are getting better because this really once the pricing is unlocked also I mean that really will support or should support the further growth of the brand. So even in the market where Marlboro has a little bit of a share pressure within a premium segment Marlboro actually is the -- is performing very strong and is gaining share.
Bonnie Herzog: And then Jacek you guys announced the extension of your strategic framework with Altria Group. So what do you think the biggest benefit will be for instance could it be the acceleration of the pace that you are bringing new products to market, and/or increasing the number of new products? And then maybe could you give us an idea of how much your investment is behind reduced risks products broadly could increase as a result of this extended framework?
Jacek Olczak: Because as of existing as you remember agreement with Altria on the current generation of a cigarette product, and this agreement essentially will focus both companies will take them both companies focus behind the new generation of a cigarette focus I think Altria is bringing to the face of the table quite a knowledge on the existing products and other critical components I mean there we have our own research our own discoveries our own fruits of the investments in through R&D. And I think it make a good sense for both companies from the resource management propose the resources together and they work for jointly on the new generation. I think logically this should result in a acceleration of a development of a new generation cigarettes product and obviously in above us both companies could be in their respective markets faster in addressing the consumer needs. I wouldn’t you will appreciate I wouldn’t say how much in terms of a financial investment is required for obvious reasons.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery: Regardless of what the Indonesia transaction does or doesn’t look like, could you give a little sense of how you think about resuming buybacks and if there is any metrics you are looking for or if you would want to see a turn in currency for maybe even a little bit of time, if you are eager to try to get back to it or if you want to be more cautious and have some cushion on the balance sheet. What’s the way that you frame that internally?
Jacek Olczak: Look, if we are looking into sort of a sustainable share buyback program with where we have to go back to what took us out of the share buyback program with currency, and that’s clearly the, there’s a big headwind which we get from the currency and we have made it very clear that in underlying business performance whether you look at the top-line, bottom-line et cetera and the cash flow generation, it’s coming very seized, very strong, I mean the currency is essentially sending our credit metrics at the edge of our current credit rating. And therefore, we had to suspend it. So it’s the currency which is the main culprit behind the absence of the share buyback program this year. So we have to see the improvement on the currency front from this side.
Michael Lavery: And then just on iQOS, you’ve completed some clinical studies recently. On the national rollouts in Japan, and Italy and then also in the launch in Switzerland, is there any health claim associated with those that you are making on the product?
Jacek Olczak: Not a health claim but I think we are moving slowly into making the reduced exposure claims and this is also the result of the six short-term clinical studies which have been completed as per plan and the study results, they showed a substantial reduction in a relevant bio-micros of exposure in adult consumers who switched to iQOS. And this is compared obviously to adult consumers who continued to smoke conventional cigarette. We have the result of the studies and I believe part of our communications in these locations and other locations which we have not disclosed yet will have a component of the reduced exposure claim.
Michael Lavery: So just to clarify may be my word choice was a little offering health claim but you are making a reduced-risk or reduced exposure to claim associated with it?
Jacek Olczak: But they are two different things, reduced-risk and the reduced exposure. There’s reduced exposure. Based on the knowledge which we have today, based on the results of the clinical studies et cetera, I think we are getting into positions that we can make a reduced exposure claim, reduce risk claim is, I think it’s more of the story of the 2016 and depends on the regulatory framework in the countries in which we will be launching iQOS.
Michael Lavery: And then just on Australia. Could you give an update on what the pricing environment is looking like there, and if pricing from the latest round is sticking, or if there’s any more promotional intensity and I guess specifically to in the last quarter’s call you said it was looking like less of a drag if even maybe a drag at all this year. Is that still your view or could you give any update on, how you are thinking about that market?
Jacek Olczak: I mean we had the pricing in the Q, beginning of the Q2, I mean it somehow sticks, not maybe the talk about the perfections you would like to see but maybe life is not perfect, so we have to live with what we have. As clearly Australia is much less if at all the drag this year and that it used for us last year and I think that’s also the outlook for the full year. We’ll have now the August-September tax price, hopefully price change as well. And we’ll see who this unfolds. You have somehow the down trading in the market. It’s a little bit slightly better but I mean it’s not really something which I think at this stage would put us into a jeopardy in terms of our total PMI performance for the full year. But it’s vastly better than the last year. But we would like to grow the profitability in this market rather than just the comp basis be better than the last year.
Michael Lavery: And just one quick last one, in the Philippines, have you seen any impact from the launch of Chesterfield and L&M, is that becoming a meaningful part of that portfolio or is it still early?
Jacek Olczak: Well, it is still early. I think the early results are good but that’s a bit of the longer runway clearly building a portfolio to reflect the current market reality dynamics et cetera. And if I can just extrapolate and I think I have a good reason to extrapolate of a Chesterfield from other international markets in which we activate, that brand should do properly its designed job in the Philippines market, Philippines markets as well. But it’s too early at this stage to start looking. Sales Marlboro what is very important growth, very strong either share and the volumes and that’s great because this is what, it’s a good reflection of the trend of the Marlboro and obviously reaction to the lower price is up. Fortune is not doing that bad, it is quite a lot of initiatives about our second brand which we have the fortune and I think this brand also has a great future going forward. And I think Chesterfield and L&M are the brands which will maybe initially complement the portfolio and maybe one day they are going to play a more significant role in the overall portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe: I just had two questions for you if I could it will follow-on to one of Michael’s questions there. In relation to there is a comment about returning 100% of cash flow to investors. So I am just curious you’ve had some pretty strong operating cash flow performance this year, some working capital improvements. As you -- is it a two times of EBITDA target you’re kind of you are targeting here and therefore incremental cash flow if there is better working capital control is that just going towards debt reduction in the short run like we saw this quarter?
Jacek Olczak: No I mean with the credit rating which we should get it is about 2.5 right, because this is what is allowed for our credit rating if the cash if we deliver the cash flow for this year broadly with line with the last year, last year was about 6.5 slightly above the $6.5 billion that’s the nice cushion to have versus the dividend commitment which currently stands at about $6.1 billion-$6.2 billion so this is how we’re looking at the thing we want to have a nice cushion about a current historical dividend at the current level.
Chris Growe: One other question if I could please on the facility to make you reduced-risk products to Italy. Is that completed in the third quarter, is that going to be like fully operational? And then should we expect around Q3 to hear about more markets in which you’re going to begin launching that product?
Jacek Olczak: I think the structures et cetera are completed or about to be completed and we’re now moving to the installings and equipment to the machinery so I think it all goes as per plan as we said the capacity from that unit in addition to the training center which is producing the initial 5 billion capacity should be available as of 2016 so very shortly we should have an access to the incremental capacity coming from this effort.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall with Barclays.
Bill Marshall: Just first I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the decision to dissolve the JV with Swedish Match. And looking at that I would imagine that overtime your emphasis around that portfolio is nascent and smokers would come down is that an ability to rotate some of those resources back towards your existing business?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean the decision the mutual decision about dissolving the joint venture with Swedish Match was based on the fact that yes there is some potential for some product in some geographies as we made the progress. But I guess by standards or our standards the progress under both components the progress was slow so we just decided that maybe it’s better that both companies will just pursue the on growth opportunities and this is how we reached the decision of dissolving. Swedish Match sorry the joint venture with Swedish Match didn’t have a material impact on our financial so I wouldn’t count on any material reallocation of resources from Swedish Match joint venture to PMI.
Bill Marshall: And then just also kind of more of a housekeeping item, you laid out pretty detailed foreign currency impact in each of the individual currencies in the past, you’ve talked a little bit about hedging particularly on the yen from a transaction perspective. I was curious if you give us an update on any currencies that you were hedged on like the yen and at what levels and for what duration?
Jacek Olczak: Well we have about slightly -- well we have above 60% for this year but I’d like to remind everyone that our financial policies that we constantly look at the 12, 18 months ahead. So it’s fair to assume that we already start hedging our cash flows from a yen cash flows for 2016 when we’ll be giving the as was always the practiced tradition the guidance for the 2016 in February we’re going to update on the number, what is our current hedge ratio for the 2016 but as I said we already looking into 2016. And yes that is essential.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
James Bushnell: I had a couple of questions, my first one was just a follow-up on the snooze question, just interested in whether we should reach anything into peer mind’s philosophy to towards these do you see it as part of the reduced risk complex and therefore well worth exploring in a number of places or is it more do you see it as a niche for a few select markets? How are you thinking about that product at the moment?
Jacek Olczak: I think from a reduced-to-reduced perspective I mean as most theories has a potential from a consumer acceptance perspective based on our experience in a few geographies when the joint venture has launched the products and then commercialized the product that is things that this is with the longer shot that we were thinking, okay this is how I would look at this.
James Bushnell: And my second question was about Poland I think volumes are down on the market level about 5% which might not sound that great, but I think it’s the least bad read you have had there for a while. And I just wondered if there is anything changing there for the better and if you could just generally describe the dynamics that would be useful?
Jacek Olczak: No, Poland is one of the countries which we should still observe like in many other European Union geographies but there are improved situations with regards to illicit trade that’s in Poland between East and the West, so it always is more difficult to maybe keep these things under control there, but I know that the government is focused on addressing the illicit trade that is also addresses the budgetary needs. Our volumes you rightly noticed is getting better but compared to the many other markets in the European Union I still would like to see the Polish volumes total market volumes getting better. Our share is great, I mean our brands are performing great so on a business side we are in I think a great shape in Poland total our market still I think has a there room to improve but we’ll have to see when it's going to happen.
James Bushnell: And just one last question on iQOS, how is the retention rate of consumers who try iQOS progressing in Japan and Italy? And also just as a very small technical point, did I hear you right that as Marlboro cigarette priced to 8.50 in Switzerland and the HeatSticks are just below that or did I get that the wrong way around?
Jacek Olczak: Yes it is correct there is slightly price below Marlboro in Switzerland. In terms of -- with regards to the retention rate they are broadly the same as we had them in Q1, but frankly speaking we've spent more of the Q2 time in a test market to changing if you like some components of our marketing needs et cetera in preparations of the national rollout. But as I said already in the Q1 there is about a one-third of those who have really purchased iQOS device about the one-third is predominantly using the iQOS and there was a significant drop in the consumer who is sampling a inner transition.
James Bushnell: One key follow-up what is the difference in the new iQOS device versus the old ones?
Jacek Olczak: It is better look, better functionality, better feel and touch, we addressed some of the feedbacks we received from a consumer with regards to the electronics and operations of an electronics so we are being able to fit it into the new device. It's really a new better iQOS.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist: Your comment with respect to the contributions to European volume is interesting and is there a way you could break apart for us the contributions of the reduction in illicit and in e-vapor. So in aggregate are those worth about 1% to European Union volumes or is there pricing offsetting some of that benefit so the reduction in those is actually a bit greater?
Jacek Olczak: Look there is a pricing in Europe with ahead of the higher than the pricing we used to have in a first half of the last year, but -- so yes there is some impact on our volume on the other hand I think the underlying micros in many European markets our consumer sentiment is somehow helping us with the better elasticities that you will -- would you remember from a 2012-2013 period. I think -- and there is a not a exact mark how much is the coming from a illicit trade because you will have to go from market-to-market I think a contribution from illicit trade to the German volume presumably higher, contribution of illicit trade in some other places might be different. E-vapor product they didn't contributed that much in Germany because this was not really any sizable sort of a category but I think they are more helping France or Spain or other geographies. One thing which we also have to remember we observed a very serious slowdown in the dynamics of the fine cut or our tobacco product which is also the outcome of a parked price and I guess also the better consumer sort of a sentiment. And you remember this is the category which used to grow say in 2012-2013 in the Europe in the churn of a 6% to 7% per annum and this volumes now are growing I think around 1% mark. So you could see the drastic change in the dynamics which obviously was pushing or pulling the consumers from the manufactured cigarettes to the fine cut product much stronger in the past than we see now. So I mean I can't give you the number how much each of this on the total -- of this drivers on a total EU basis contributed I think we’ll have to go market-by-market and put some weight whereas there is more of the weight where is less of the weight which helps the total market performance. But look let's enjoy the good total market performance we know what are the drivers, we've been looking that finally one day all these things which were the significant headwind for us will unwind and will start converting into tailwinds and hope this is a more sustainable trend for this.
Erik Bloomquist: And then also related to the European vapor markets, does the imposition of the tobacco products directive does that also then create a bit of a headwind for that particular market and it is really something that probably vantages the Marlboro iQOS and HeatStick system given that you are already able to bring the product to already have a set regulatory environment where is the TPD in position will arguably make things more difficult for vapor. Is that something that you could expand on please?
Jacek Olczak: Well I mean as everything depends obviously how quickly this going to be transposed into the member state legislation and that’s the process which started there are some members state which already advanced there are some members state which give before the parliamentary et cetera discussion. I mean the deadline as we know is May 2016 we will be in a position to say how individual members think what sort of a framework they create above the novel tobacco product and the e-cigarette. As you remember in a TPD there was a distinction between above fair group of both categories then we will see how that’s going to play out.
Erik Bloomquist: And then lastly on the TPD with is set to Philip Morris’ litigation against it. Can you give us an update on where things stand and when we may next get the next set of news fill on that what the progress is in terms of challenging TPD2?
Jacek Olczak: Well it’s not much really of a development which happened, right? I mean the JC case in Ireland, was retained in Ireland which I think is a good news because it drove the other result in a clash of two similarly like cases at the ECJ level. I think it’s fair to assume that the ECJ the thing is that most important part of a challenge against the directive that ECJ which will reach the European Court of Justice, sorry, will reach a conclusion before the due date for the transpose implementation of the directive which I said deadline is May 2016. That’s essential.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.
Owen Bennett: And just a couple of questions please. Firstly, just on LatAm and over then the pricing leverage. And I am just wondering what was driving the very strong margins there and how sustainable these are into the rest of the year? And then secondly just on some industry volumes. And could you give an update on guidance for South Korea for the year now? And also possibly if you could comment on how industry volumes are trending in Australia especially with the recent price increases? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: So on LAC I think we have had a strong pricing coming from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada. So essentially for all our key geographies there we enjoyed the strong pricing. I think it should continue. So I mean LAC last year and this year they are really performing very strongly, I think they had a good momentum. As I mentioned earlier answering other questions I mean there is a bit of a share pressure in Mexico. But on the other hand, Mexican total industry volumes are doing better. So overall into the financials we are looking pretty okay. On South Korea, I mean it looks that our initial guidance for the market, total market for the year 20%-25% declined it is not lower to the closer to the 20%, I mean it’s still significant but let’s remember, you would remember how big the price increase was. Cutting overall is going better or slightly better than expected in our share is up. So I think yes I mean we have the price increase behind us. I mean let’s see how this is going to unfold. But so far it unfolds pretty strongly. And on Australia, now much really as I mentioned earlier which was, which would happen there, I mean if the prices went up there is some continue some sort of discounting. The down-trading is there may be to some extent at the lower level. Australian total market volume is obviously distorted year-on-year due to the price changes. And I think on the year-to-date basis, Australia is 0.7 actually up total market size. But it doesn’t mean that the market grows. I think it’s a little bit of a distortion there.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman: Most of my questions have been asked. So it’s really a question following up a couple that have already been asked in terms of the question on EEMA pricing, you said that and it was certainly below, the pricing was below my expectations, I didn’t reply to that, you said whether that’ll be some mix factor. But obviously you get pricing per se excluding mix and I was just wondering if for any geographies and you had good pricing in Russia we know. So over any geographies where pricing perhaps has gone backwards or has been disappointing within EU?
Jacek Olczak: Not really. And just one thing to clarify, always when we talk about the pricing is the pricing variance and when we report the volume mix, we put the mix with the volume the…
Adam Spielman: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, but yes I mean there was some negative mix for EEMA and I think largely driven by Russia. On the other hand, very encouraging and I haven’t seen this result for the long time. We have zero mix impact in EU, okay. So I mean that’s on the total PMI basis, I mean the mix is not that much of a major issue. Obviously we had a mix in Australia due to the down-trading, but is on a few isolated geographies.
Adam Spielman: Okay, so that’s very clear. And just coming on to EU obviously the volume decline has returned to its historical or nearly to its historic average. I was just wondering if you think elasticity is about where it was before or whether we have some ways to go before we return to what it used to be.
Jacek Olczak: I think many markets have returned to what we would call the standout part of the cover called product elasticity is minus 0.3, minus 0.5, and I see more and more markets which are squarely fitting into this range, even maybe some of that mean in the lower end of this range so in minus 0.3 territory so that’s good.
Adam Spielman: And just one final question following up a question the Bonnie asked clearly your market share is improving and a lot of that has to do with 2.0 but there is also the new commercial approach. And I was wondering really two questions related to that. Is it possible to say at all which is more important than the new brand architecture of a new commercial approach it is obviously a bit of both but are they equally important? And the second question related to that is, are there any important geographies where you haven’t rolled out the new commercial approach yet?
Jacek Olczak: I will start with the second one, important geographies in which we are in the middle of the rollout of the commercial approach is Indonesia from the last OCI market. Coming to how much you could lump with attribute to the commercial approach and how much the 2.0 output like that, Marlboro 2.0 is the concept, it’s a great concept, it’s a great design, it’s a great product line ups, it’s a great support materials and at the end of the day you need to have advanced skills organizations to properly implement this in a market so that’s your commercial approach. So this comes both together I mean it’s a great idea lousy implementations, no result you have idea, great salesforce I mean who cares no impact so I think it need to have always the optimum, the right mix of more than I get we are at this stage now.
Adam Spielman: And just apart from Indonesia are there any other markets you’d point to that perhaps don’t currently have big OCI contributions but perhaps you could hope to gain share and that you haven’t rolled it out and this would be my final question.
Jacek Olczak: From the -- no there are markets which are -- no from a significant market I guess it would be Indonesia which pops up to my mind now. I mean in many other markets we are well advance maybe there are some territories in some places but we also don’t necessarily aim at the covering 100% of the any given market territory I mean it has to has a economic sense and then in writing the details cost benefit analysis and no I think Indonesia would still stay on the list I would think about Indonesia.
Operator: And that was our final question. I now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: That concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team and we are currently in Switzerland today. Thank you again and have a wonderful day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we’ll be talking about results for the first quarter of 2015, and comparing them to the same period in 2014, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, data table showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to US GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a variety of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I’m pleased to report that PMI is off to an excellent start in 2015 with robust fundamentals driving a strong business performance that is benefitting from our investments last year. As announced in our earnings release this morning, we’re raising our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates by $0.05 to a range of $4.32 to $4.42. This increase reflect a better than expected volume and share performance in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the balance of the year. Our guidance continues to include approximately $1.15 per share of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 guidance represents a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our revised guidance remains unchanged versus our February guidance, there has been a shift since then in its composition. The positive impact of the appreciation of the Russian ruble and the depreciation of the Swiss franc has been offset by the unfavorable impact of a further strengthening of the US dollar versus most other currencies, particularly the euro. As exchange rates remain volatile, we do not foresee any share repurchases in 2015 and this is reflected in today’s guidance. Let me now take you through our first quarter results. Organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4%, driven by market share gains across all four regions and favorable inventory movements, notably in Italy, Spain and other markets supplied by manufacturing facilities in the EU region. This growth was partly offset by lower cigarette industry volume, principally in Japan, Korea and Russia. Excluding inventory movements, organic cigarette volume declined by an estimated 0.5%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 9.1% and 16.3% respectively, driven by strong pricing across all regions and favorable volume mix in the EU and EEMA regions. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 in the quarter grew by 23.5% excluding currency. Our performance in the quarter was flattered by a favorable comparison versus the challenging first quarter of 2014. As we have mentioned previously, the second half of the year will include incremental spending primarily behind the deployment of iQOS. Strong pricing was the key driver of our financial performance. Our quarterly pricing variance reached $552 million and included a gain from inventories that we were able to build in Korea prior to the recent tax change. Importantly, our first quarter pricing was strong across all four regions. We’re well positioned to achieve a full year pricing variance broadly in line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion. Our results were supported by solid market share gains. We performed very well in our top 30 OCI market, increasing share by 1.2 percentage points to 38.1%. Share growth was flat in 22 of these markets. Our share gains were geographically broad-based and driven by a range of brands, including Marlboro. The brand share grew by 0.1 point in the EU, 0.4 points in EEMA and 0.5 points in Latin America and Canada. Turning now to our regions, we continued to perform extremely well in EEMA, which was the largest contributor to our strong currency neutral results in the quarter. Regional market share increased by 0.7 points, driven by the success of Parliament, Marlboro and the L&M. We gained share in the key geographies of North Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 13.9% and 24.2%, respectively. This growth was driven by higher pricing notably in Russia, Egypt and the Middle East, and favorable volume mix in nearly all of our markets outside Eastern Europe. In Russia, our performance was outstanding. We achieved double digit OCI growth, excluding currency, despite the 9.3% decline in cigarette industry volume. Our strong brand portfolio helped drive market share gains and higher local currency unit margins through net pricing. February quarter to date market share reached 27.7%, an increase of 0.9 share points versus the same period last year. Parliament grew 0.5 points, which drove an increase in our premium segment share of 3.5%. Low-price Bond Street grew by 0.9 points. Despite significant excise tax driven price increases and the weakening of consumer purchasing power, we have not observed any material shift in price segment trends. However, as I mentioned at the CAGNY Conference in February, the macroeconomic environment in Russia continues to be fragile. We recently announced a further increase in retail selling prices of 4 rubles per pack across the majority of our portfolio, although this will not be reflected in the market until later this quarter. In the EU region, first quarter cigarette industry volume declined by 1.6%, or an estimated 2.7% after adjusting for favorable trade inventory movements. For the year, we forecast cigarette industry decline of approximately 4% as we expect the recently implemented price increases to impact adult smoker demand over the balance of the year. We maintained our regional cigarette share momentum in the first quarter with a gain of 0.4 points to 39.6%. This increase reflected share growth in the five largest markets by cigarette industry volume as well as the positive performance of our three largest brands in the region, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, which all gained share. We achieved adjusted OCI growth in the EU region of 12.9%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by higher pricing across most markets as well as favorable volume mix notably in Southern Europe. On the same basis, we expect the region to be a positive contributor to PMI’s adjusted OCI growth this year. I’ll now cover our Asia region beginning with Japan. Cigarette industry volume declined by 13.9% in the first quarter, due mainly to the impact of retail trade and consumer purchases last year in anticipation of the consumption tax-driven retail price increases effective April 1, 2014. After adjusting for these distortions, the decline was an estimated 3.5%. We forecast an industry decline for the year in the range of 2.5% to 3%, as the trend should improve now that we have the April 2014 price increases. Our market share increased by 0.1 point in the quarter. However, after adjusting for the aforementioned distortions, it declined moderately, due mainly to the timing of competitive brand launches. We expect our full year share to benefit from the recent roll out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture across all three pillars and strong pipeline of innovation. In the Philippines, we’ve made further retail price increases at the low end of the market in the first quarter. This has restored positive unit margins in the super-low price segment, while price gaps have narrowed and driven Marlboro’s share growth. We believe that the competitive environment is being improved by the recent introduction of tax spends. Despite significant price increases in this important market, smoking prevalence has remained stable. The reduction in average daily consumption has been due mainly for adult smokers of brands at the low end of the market. We attribute the decrease in large part to sticker shock following price increases for super-low priced brands of approximately 27% on average since October of last year. We expect average daily consumption to largely recover as the year unfolds and adult smokers adjust to new price levels. We’re pleased by our positive momentum in the first quarter and are optimistic about the improving OCI outlook in the Philippines. In Indonesia, first quarter cigarette industry volume grew by 5.9%. Quarterly volume result in the market can be volatile and thus may not be representative of the annual trend. For the year, we forecast growth of approximately 2%. Our market share grew by 0.8 points to 35.4%, mainly due to strong performances in the growing machine-made kretek segment by Dji Sam Soe Magnum and Magnum Blue, as well as our flagship in the segment Sampoerna A. However, our hand-rolled kretek brands remained under pressure as adult smokers continued to switch to machine-made products. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential share growth and we’re well positioned for further gains. We recently launched U Bold in the rapidly growing full flavor machine-made kretek segment where we’re currently underrepresented, but are gaining share. The Indonesian market offers exceptional long term prospects, thanks to its growing adult population and a favorable economic environment. We believe that we are best positioned within our industry to benefit from this trend. In the Latin America and Canada region, adjusted OCI grew by 35.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by pricing in Argentina, Canada and Mexico. This impressive OCI growth enabled the region to be an important contributor to PMI’s results despite its small relative base. Our share in the region grew by 0.9 points to 38.3%, driven mainly by Marlboro. Argentina and Brazil recorded strong share performances with growth of 1.4 and 2.4 points respectively. Turning now to our RRP portfolio, the performance of our iQOS pilot launches is in line with or exceeds our expectation. In both Nagoya and Milan sales of key stakes are growing sequentially. More importantly, the launches have provided valuable learnings that are being incorporated into our plans for future roll out and cover areas such as the flagship store concept, the logistics chain, after sales support, channel strategy as well as consumer communication and engagement. We remain on track to commence national expansion in Japan and Italy as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets later this year. Let me also quickly highlight that we launched the e-vapor product Solaris last month in Spain. We remain steadfast in our determination to offer an attractive dividend to our shareholders. At the close last Friday, our dividend yield was 5.1%. This was significantly above that of our proxy peer group and 10-year US Treasury notes. It was also well above the dividend yield of our main international tobacco competitors. In conclusion, we achieved strong currency neutral results in the first quarter, driven by robust business fundamentals that are underpinned by our investments last year. Our superior brand portfolio supported by a superb commercial organization is driving positive market share momentum and strong pricing. We continue to focus vigorously on our cost and for 2015 anticipate the total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%. The iQOS pilot launches are performing well and we’re on track with our plans for national expansion and additional launches later this year. We’re managing our cash flow prudently in order to provide a generous dividend and an attractive yield. Despite our free cash flow decline in the first quarter, due mainly to currency and temporary working capital movements, we forecast 2015 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year’s level. Overall, we’re off to an excellent start in 2015 and are optimistic of our business outlook. We’re raising our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance which on a currency neutral basis reflects a growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02. Thank you. And I’ll now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Just I’d say two questions for you. If I can ask the first one, as you saw the better volume performance here in the first quarter, even excluding the inventory movements, it was much better than I expected. Do you think this is going to hold for the year? Do you have an updated forecast for the industry overall? Are there areas of certain regions where you’re seeing this improvement maybe more than others and just curious how much that can hold through the year?
Jacek Olczak: As we said in the remarks that we expect the EU to be above the 4%. There are very strong volumes in the EU in the first quarter. Obviously, as you’ve noticed, also in our remarks we said there were some movements in – held by some inventory movements associated with the last quarter closure of the factory in Holland, which is the main supplier, but still excluding for those movements, I think we had a strong start. I think in a view of the pricing which we’re taking in EU, I think is prudent at this stage to hold that for a cusp of 4%, but we see – as with volume momentum in a number of markets, very importantly Southern Europe, but also other markets. And the rest of the world, I think general for the full year, the outlook is that the industry volume should be better than last year. It’s difficult very precisely to quantify now, but we could feel that volumes in the EEMA region, Asia, Latin America, there’s more of the structural improvement going forward. So I think we remain optimistic about the volume outlook for the full year for the industry and obviously for us.
Chris Growe: And just a follow on question in relation to your earnings guidance for the year, you had a much stronger first quarter performance than I think a lot of us had modeled and I’m sure what you’ve modeled as well. So I’m just curious with the increase in guidance for the year being less than the first quarter earnings be, I’m just wondering if there’s an incremental level of reinvestment, is there some conservatism built in, just how you look at the rest of the year and some of the areas you could use this flexibility to reinvest?
Jacek Olczak: I think the investment plan in terms of cost which we plan to spend for this year, I mean, the pricing of tax rate as per the plan, so I don’t think at this stage that we need to go back and reinvest. The brands and the commercial organization is well invested, the proper resources are allocated behind iQOS, that’s obviously going to be a second part of the year, end of Q3, more Q4 type of a spend. So this will impact obviously our results in the quarters. As I said, yes, the first quarter was somehow hedged by the inventory and as I mentioned Korea pricing, so this boosted the better performance. But even if I were to exclude this inventory movements and the Korea one-off pricing, we would have a very strong double digit growth in the quarter. We don’t see at this stage that we need to go and to change our investment plan. As you noticed, we reconfirmed that we expect the total cost base ex RRP to stay in the range of 1% ex currency obviously. But we’re pretty confident that we will fund it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: My first question is your Q1, it was clearly very strong, but I guess I was hoping you could maybe summarize what are the key items that give you the confidence to raise your full year guidance so early in the year?
Jacek Olczak: I think the confidence is coming – I mean, the one-offs which took place in Q1, I mean, they were all well estimated by us in the original guidance. I think this underlying momentum continuing from the last year which gives you more confidence that you can raise the guidance. So even as I said before, even exclude Korea and some inventory distortion, the underlying business in the EU but also in EEMA very much, as I give you that support, in your thinking, in your estimates for the full year, which prompted us to increase the guidance by $0.05. Nothing what we have been working on very hard last year, since that this was a temporary type of a solution, I mean, the permanent improvements in Philippines, we hold the share in Japan despite some blips in the quarter, EU is continuously delivering. So I mean the things that we spend our time and our efforts in the organization last year properly, so I think we build a solid base for this year. This is what it is.
Bonnie Herzog: And then in terms of Marlboro, your volume has rebounded and were strong in the quarter, so I was hoping you could drill down a little more on this, especially in light of your Marlboro 2.0 roll out? And then I’d like to hear from you how sustainable you think this is.
Jacek Olczak: Marlboro, as I said it on a number of occasions I think CAGNY, at the CAGE most recently, Marlboro is in a good shape. I mean, I think the way we improve the equity of the brand over the last two or so years, helped by the commercial [indiscernible] Marlboro Gold, now going to Marlboro 2.0 Architecture, I mean, all these components, I think, the things together, and Marlboro is responding in a number of geographies, it’s not just one or two places where we see the Marlboro uptake. The Marlboro 2.0 is just at this stage roll out in about 48 markets and we foresee that by the year end we should be in about 100, a bit more than 100 markets. So that’s an effort which we’ll continue. So I think Marlboro is receiving continued support in terms of Marlboro 2.0, plus market by market with a pipeline of innovations which is going to hit also later the year the market. So I’m confident about the Marlboro performance this year.
Bonnie Herzog: And then just my final question is on your RRP portfolios, first on iQOS, I was hoping you could talk further about some of the learnings you mentioned. And then second on Solaris, given the vapor slowdown, why was the timing right to roll out Solaris?
Jacek Olczak: Maybe I’ll start with Solaris, I think I mentioned this before. The reason we went with Solaris into the market first, I think the Altria product is compared to what you have available in the market, a very good product. And more importantly for us is also to go and test and learn how they’re selling the cigarettes, how a commercial organization should be adjusted, how you handle the trade, the supply chain, the communication with consumers, et cetera. I think before you start engaging larger geographies it’s just simply smart to go and test the waters in a more contained geographies, in this case Spain, and apply this learning which should greatly help us with the resource management going forward. Now, coming back to the iQOS, look, as I said, whatever we see – obviously there are differences between Milan and Nagoya and the differences are driven by the distribution spread, as much outlets handling iQOS in Milan than in Nagoya, there is a big difference in the communication possibilities, marketing possibilities, it’s much more open and broader reach which we can get in Japan. Obviously, this is reflected with their awareness levels to start which are about twice as high in Nagoya than in Milan. But if I drill it down to the number of consumers who have already purchased iQOS and the acceptance levels, how many have already adopted iQOS as a permanent product, as a main product, how many still are in between using about half of an iQOS, half of a combustible cigarette, and obviously there is a growth which using iQOS very rarely, occasionally and still stays with a combustible cigarette, this results are at least as far, if not better, which [indiscernible]. So if you go back to our test results, which I think we showed with investors during the Investor Day last year, we’re showing well above the 30% or above 35% adoption, I mean, the full adoption of iQOS today among those who have purchased it. And as I indicated, the uptake volume of the HeatSticks is in a continuous growth. I can’t remember how many weeks essentially since the launch, we can observe the sequential growth in HeatSticks. But obviously, adoption takes time, this is a new technology, it’s not something which the consumers are so broadly familiar, so it’s a lot of work to be done. But we’re very enthusiastic and optimistic based on the result which we see in this market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: First, I just want to clarify two things you said earlier, you mentioned that if you were to exclude the Korea pricing benefit and the inventory timing issues in the EU, you still would have had double digit constant currency growth, that’s in EPS, not operating income, correct?
Jacek Olczak: Yeah, that’s correct. This is on EPS.
Matthew Grainger: And the volume impact should be, to whatever extent there is a reversal of that, that should be concentrated in the second quarter?
Jacek Olczak: From the volumes, actually as much as they’re related to the typical timing differences between Q1 and Q2, which is mainly associated with the timing of the Easter holiday in various geographies, I think most of the volume are locked in Q1 and you will not have that, we shouldn’t have an impact of those volumes going into Q2.
Matthew Grainger: And then just two market-specific questions. On Asia first, could you just give us an update on market in competitive conditions in Australia? I know you called out positive share, but what are you seeing in terms of the industry volume reaction to the latest excise tax increases and the pricing headwinds that you faced in the market there?
Jacek Olczak: Due to the excise tax increase in the industry, we increased the prices, so there was a net price increase. Maybe it’s too early to call it, but I think what we can see in Australia at least for the first two months of current trading conditions is that the dynamics of the segment growth, mainly the discount segment, have somehow slowed down. I wouldn’t call it a success, but if I compare sequential quarter development last year versus if I take the Q3, very much Q4 and the beginning of the year, you could see some stabilization or signs of stabilizations in terms of growth of the discount segment. So that’s obviously very helpful. I think this is a result of maybe a different pricing, maybe per discounting strategies adopted by the players. So yes, I think we’re growing our share, share in the quarter was somehow flattered by the comps because we had the opening of the last year, but I think that Australia for 2015, I mean, it clearly is less of the size of the drag which we had last year. So I think we slowly, month by month, we are moving there in the right direction.
Matthew Grainger: One last question just on Japan, this is lots of areas of strength in the quarter, this is one where performance still seems a bit soft. I was surprised to see your volume still down double digits since you didn’t seemingly have the same inventory benefit last year that your competitors did. How does the double digit decline compare to how you see consumption on your brands during the quarter and is it just the roll out of 2.0 that gives you confidence that things improved through the year?
Jacek Olczak: As far as inventory, I think our shipments in the first quarter was just better than the total market. I think you could see these distortions which we had in Q1 last year somehow clearing – was cleared in Q1 of this year. Now, frankly speaking, the marginal share movement in Japan knowing that the market is very sensitive on a short term basis, like quarterly basis, the pipelining of the product with the competition for the new product introductions, I wouldn’t pay that much attention. We’re watching obviously the situation closely, but I think Japan has enough of the initiatives, including Marlboro 2.0, but also a pipeline of our new products to the market that we should see the share coming stronger in other part of the year. So I personally, we don’t think that this quarterly reading from Japan is a red slot which we should we worried about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: I guess a few questions on Russia, number one, just in terms of clarification on the inventory movement, is it your expectation that that was really – and I think you maybe talked about this on the context of the total company impact, but in 2Q, does the inventory movement in Q1 help come out in 2Q for Russia?
Jacek Olczak: No, I think the inventory adjustments in Russia, I think, they just corrected, the inventories at the distributor level which is more corresponding to the outlook for the total market and more importantly for the share which we have in Russia. So maybe there are some smaller distortions of this shipment, but I don’t think anything of the magnitude which we should expect, nor this was a payback from the last year. I think it’s just the normal course of the business, however, this was more connected with that recovering of recouping the inventories to the right level.
Judy Hong: And then just maybe underlying trend in Russia, just what you’re seeing in terms of the elasticity to the price increases that happened in December, the fact that you’re taking another pricing, does that imply that the impact on volume has been more favorable? And in the context of just competitive environment, obviously you’re gaining a lot of market share, what do you anticipate in terms of how the competitive dynamics play out in that market?
Jacek Olczak: Look, I think so far if you look at the current performance of the business and the way we look at the industry, I think the market holds very well. I mean, obviously, you have a high 9% sort of the volume declines for the total industry, but this has to be read in comparisons to the very high pricing the industry is taking, or we’re taking. So the elasticity is so far okay. We have this disconnect in terms of the macros reading from Russia, but as I mentioned, we looked very carefully into the price segments that will augment over the very recent period. And you essentially have to split in total to start concluding that you have acceleration of growth of the bottom of the market or down trading et cetera. Not at this stage, but as I said, Russia is something which presumably will remain on the watch list for the full year. Having our share growth and pricing, we grew our share for Parliament, so clearly this is not just share in the premium or above premium segment, other brands obviously contributed as well. We just announced another price increase. As you know, Russia on an ex currency looks very good. Obviously, currency has put a dent on the results, that’s very clear. And inflation is high and I think this was the reason why we decided to go now with the price. But so far, elasticity is working as per the expectations, we’re talking 3.4 type elasticity if you take the price increases versus the market decline.
Judy Hong: And then just lastly on the yen hedging, can you just update on where you are today versus the last guidance you’ve given?
Jacek Olczak: Judy, we usually don’t update what we do with regards to the hedging during a year. I can just maybe help you that if I take a $1.15 impact on our results with the previous guidance, I’ll confirm today in the $1.15, yen just moves in that guidance by $0.01. I said a $0.13 impact last guidance, and I have now $0.14 impact this guidance. So this is not the yen, clearly I think the hedge in place, they’re all in that same, but also I have to admit volatility on the yen is lower than we used to have it at the beginning of the period. Ruble, which I listed in my remarks, improved a lot, because the ruble is just $0.13 now in my guidance and it used to be $0.48, so this is a big improvement. Swiss francs was negative and turned positive in the guidance to $0.10. And there is a whole list of other currencies, obviously euro plays a role, but the yen was – yen played just a one role. Ruble was $0.35 in the guidance, 30% of the entire guidance is the major contributor to that balancing and us holding the $1.15 guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to Korea. You talked about the benefit from the inventory, I assume by that you mean that you were able to pull inventory ahead of January 1 so that you could sell product in this quarter with last year’s lower tax, is that correct?
Jacek Olczak: That’s correct.
Michael Lavery: And how long does that benefit last? Is the shelf life typically it’s close to six months maybe, will that benefit continue in 2Q or have you exhausted that inventory yet?
Jacek Olczak: It’s very much a function of how long your inventories you manage to be, obviously there are some limitations, some restrictions in the market, how much you can be, so we don’t have a free ride on this one. But I think mostly that benefit, at least in our case, should be attributed to the Q1, mostly, there might be some slip over going to Q2, but it’s mostly a Q1 event.
Michael Lavery: And then just looking at your guidance obviously you’re much more confident and it is early, how much volumes are far less predictable, but how much of the pricing that you're expecting that's reflected in your guidance, have you already realized or been able to take?
Jacek Olczak: Because we’re a bit deeper in the year, we usually at this year don’t give a number how much the pricing we have realized, but you might remember and initial guidance in February when we were announcing full year results, we have said that for the current 2015 year, we have 70% pricing realization. And there were a number of markets which we have taken the pricing since then. So clearly we are higher than 70%.
Michael Lavery: So you can't say by how much?
Jacek Olczak: No. For competitive reasons, et cetera, I can’t.
Michael Lavery: Okay, that's fine. Then just on Egypt, you called out higher manufacturing costs that came from the new business structure, but you also talked about favorable impacts from the new business structure as well. Can you just give a little summary of the puts and takes there and how that nets out?
Jacek Olczak: That’s the impact which we are carrying from Q2 last year – actually from mid of Q1 last year. So this is a quarter where we’re lapping that thing, so with very marginally, but still had an impact in Q1. It doesn’t impact your bottom line very much other than organic growth in the business, it just impacts that your revenues are slightly up and your costs are slightly up versus how we were reporting reflecting our business structure in 2013. So we’re comparing 100% apples to apples.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: My first question has to do with EU profitability. You guys have previously indicated that you expect to generate local currency profit growth in the EU given the strong start to the year and I recognize you have the offset later on on the national launch of iQOS, but can you give us a better sense of how strongly profits might inflect in the EU?
Jacek Olczak: Clearly, we’ve had a good start of the year, so that – obviously the different pace is going to continue for the Q2, Q3, because there was an underlying strength coming from top line. I think initially for the year, I think we said that we expect EU to contribute in the low single digit. I think I’m definitely confident that they can achieve this one. So let me make the statement at this stage.
Vivien Azer: In terms of the rollout of iQOS later on in the year you noted the potential for other pilots and/or national launches. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're looking for in order to make a determination around that? Is it an accommodative regulatory landscape from a tax perspective, is it supply chain, just any other color around that would be helpful?
Jacek Olczak: Clearly we’re looking into the market which give us the volume and margin opportunity, so for obvious reasons, I can’t share with you today the details. But as I said, it’s the consumer base, it’s our position in the market, it’s the margin structure, so these are the key components which we’re looking into. We have said from the very beginning that initially we will go to the market where the margins will be rather accretive to the rest of our business.
Vivien Azer: And my last question, any comment or update on Platform 2, please?
Jacek Olczak: Platform 2, we started [indiscernible] in Spain – sorry, Platform 2 – Solaris, Platform 2 goes on plan. So it’s nothing really to update versus what we have said before.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays Capital.
Bill Marshall: I just had one quick question for you. So I believe on earlier calls you guys have kind of left the door open for share repurchases this year. It sounds like from your comments earlier that's probably off the table for 2015. So I was just wondering in the context of your very strong quarter what kind of milestones could you point to that would make you feel more comfortable about buying back stock as we look forward maybe past 2015 into 2016.
Jacek Olczak: Look, we have not updated, unfortunately, we’re not in a position to update the currency guidance and this is the component or element which impact our reported numbers and cash flow very much, okay. So buyback or suspension of the buyback for this year is the outcome of that. I mean, we’ll have to see the improvement in the currency outlook is very much [indiscernible] versus all others to be able to go back to that share buyback. So yes, obviously the guidance increase – the outlook for the year increase helps, but this is still, I have to admit, overshadowed by the strong negative currency which we are confronted this year. So we need to wait, what’s going to happen with the currencies in order to take back the discussion on the – come back to the discussion on buyback.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I’ll now return the call to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you do have follow-up questions, the Investor Relations team will be here in Switzerland and available. Thank you again and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2014 Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management, and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we’ll be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, and comparing them to the same period in 2013 unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, data table showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisition, asset impairment, exit and other costs, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Please note that reduced risk products, or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer will join André for the question-and-answer period. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We anticipated that 2014 would be a particularly difficult and complex year for PMI and had in fact characterized it as an investment year. We aimed to address specific challenges in key markets such as Italy, Japan and the Philippines, while also investing behind a number of strategic initiatives, including the pilot launches of iQOS, the roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture and the optimization of our global manufacturing footprint. In addition, we faced an operating environment of continued macro-economic weakness and unprecedented currency headwinds. Within this context, I am very pleased to announce that we delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014, achieving adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.8%. This result exceeded the 6.5% to 7.5% guidance that we provided last November, due mainly to better than expected performances in the European Union and EEMA regions. In addition, we made very substantial progress in addressing our specific key market challenges and successfully executed on our strategic initiatives. As anticipated, our fourth quarter results came in below our exceptionally strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition to this challenging comparison, the pattern of our expenses and the timing of key investments in 2014 were skewed towards the final quarter. Our organic cigarette volume declined by 3.8% for the quarter, due to lower total cigarette industry volumes and inventory movements in the Asia and EEMA regions, partly offset by market share gains in the EU and EEMA regions. Excluding the adverse impact of inventory movements, volume for the quarter declined by approximately 2%. Net revenues increased by 1.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, with favorable pricing across all regions that more than offset unfavorable volume mix due principally to the Asia region. Adjusted OCI declined by 10.6% on the same basis, due mainly to the aforementioned pattern of expenses and timing of investments. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency of $1.31 decreased by 4.4%, compared to a 19.4% increase on the same basis in the fourth quarter of 2013. Despite a historically high adverse currency headwind, we enter 2015 with strong business fundamentals and accordingly, remain optimistic regarding our business prospects going forward. Consequently, this year we are targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions of 4% to 6% for net revenues and 6% to 8% for adjusted OCI. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2015 at prevailing exchange rate is in a range of $4.27 to $4.37 versus $4.76 in 2014, and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency, of approximately 8% to 10%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. As I will explain later, our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS and does not include any share repurchases. The $1.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, included in our 2015 guidance, is driven primarily by the Russian Ruble, the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Indonesian Rupiah. These four currencies account for approximately 42%, 13%, 11% and 5%, respectively, or over 70% collectively, of the total unfavorable currency variance. We have currently hedged approximately 60% of our 2015 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of 110 Yen to the U.S. dollar. Let me now discuss our progress in some of our regions and key markets, beginning with the marked improvement in the EU region. Total cigarette industry volume was down by 2.4% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year decline to 3.1%. This represents a significant moderation versus the 7.4% decline in 2013, which we attribute to the subdued performance of the e-vapor category, less out-switching to fine cut products, a reduction in illicit trade in several markets and lower than historical average pricing mainly in Italy. For 2015, we forecast a decline in industry -- in cigarette industry volume of approximately 4%. Our 2014 market share performance in the EU region was impressive, with a gain of 1 percentage point to 39.9% in the fourth quarter and 1 point to 39.8% for the full year. This result reflects share growth in all six of the region’s largest markets by cigarette industry volume, most notably in Italy and Poland. In fact, our share gains in conjunction with the moderating industry volume decline resulted in essentially stable PMI cigarette volume in the EU region last year. This is a remarkable achievement and by far, the region’s best cigarette volume performance since the spin. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield were the primary drivers of our share performance in the EU region. As of 2014, they represented the top three cigarette industry brands in the region by volume. For the year, Marlboro share grew by 0.3 points to 19.3%, L&M by 0.2 points to 7.1% and Chesterfield by 1.1 points to 5.5%. The performances of Marlboro in France and Spain, L&M in Germany, and Chesterfield in Italy and Poland were of particular note. For 2015, we expect the EU region to return to low single-digit adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions. The excise tax environment remains rationale. Our leading brand portfolio positions us well for further share gains, driven by the continued rollout of the Marlboro 2.0 architecture. In addition, pricing is expected to be stronger than in 2014, in part due to recently increased cigarette prices in key markets such as Italy, Poland and Spain. Let me briefly discuss the U.K. Government’s recent announcement that it intends to proceed with the introduction of plain packaging. We believe this decision is ill-advised and is not based on scientific evidence. While we maintain an ongoing dialogue with regulators and hope that reason will ultimately prevail, we are prepared to pursue other alternatives, including litigation, to ensure the protection of our intellectual property. Before closing on the EU Region, I would like to touch briefly on Italy, where the long-awaited tax reform was implemented last month. As shown on this slide, it includes a shift to a more specific structure and a higher minimum total tax, both important steps in the right direction. The reform also covered Reduced-Risk Products, with Marlboro HeatSticks now subject to a lower excise tax rate compared to cigarettes. We enter the year with favorable share momentum, driven by the strong performance of Chesterfield, and in mid-January we increased our cigarette prices by €0.20 per pack across our portfolio. I will now discuss selected markets from our Asia Region, beginning with Japan. Our strategy to stabilize market share last year was successful. Key drivers were the launch of our Be Marlboro marketing campaign, the introduction of Marlboro Clear Hybrid and the strengthening of the Lark brand family through morphing and new launches. We plan to maintain our focus on these two key brands in 2005 [sic] [2015] through a robust innovation pipeline, as highlighted by the recent launch of Marlboro Fusion Blast, a menthol cigarette with two different capsules that provide novel taste sensations. And, of course, Japan was the first market to introduce iQOS, with its pilot launch in Nagoya last November.  We plan to expand nationally in 2015. Industry volume in Japan declined by 3.4% in 2014, consistent with our projected 3% to 3.5% decline range. For 2015, we forecast that the decline will moderate to a range of 2.5% to 3%. In Indonesia, industry volume was up by 1.9% in 2014 to 314 billion units. This growth was driven by a 7.5% increase in the machine-made kretek segment, which now accounts for approximately 74% of the total market, partially offset by a 13.1% decline in the hand-rolled kretek segment. Our market share grew over the course of 2014 and reached 35.3% in the fourth quarter. This sequential improvement was driven by our strong performance in the machine-made kretek segment, due mainly to Dji Sam Soe Magnum and the successful launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue in April of 2014. We now hold approximately 30% share of this growing segment, led by our flagship brand Sampoerna A. There has been a significant moderation in the volume decline of our hand-rolled products, as competitive brands have followed Dji Sam Soe above the important 1,000 Rupiah per stick price point. As hand-rolled products face a significantly lower excise tax increase in 2015 than machine-made products, this bodes well for the segment, where we are the market leader. We forecast cigarette industry volume growth in 2015 of up to 2%, although the market will remain sensitive to fuel and commodity prices.  While the Philippines continued to be a challenge and a drain on our 2014 income performance, we have recently witnessed significant positive price movements at the lower end of the market. After we raised the recommended stick price of Jackpot from 1.25 Pesos to 1.50 Pesos in October, our main competitor increased the recommended stick prices of its brands by 0.25 pesos in December and further increases have occurred since then. This has reduced the stick price gap to Marlboro from 1.75 Pesos in January 2014 to between 1 Peso and 1.25 Pesos currently. We believe that the introduction of tax stamps will further improve the competitive environment in a market where cigarette consumption remained resilient last year at around 100 billion units. These developments augur well for profitability to improve over the mid-term and we remain bullish on the prospects for this market. I will finish my discussion of the Asia Region with a brief update on Korea. The 120% increase in total tobacco excise taxes effective January 1st will be disruptive given its impact on the average retail selling price. To pass the tax on, we increased the retail price per pack for both Marlboro and Parliament by 1,800 Korean Won, or approximately 67% to 4,500 Korean Won. For 2015, we forecast a decline in the underlying cigarette industry volume of approximately 20% to 25%. From an income perspective, however, the tax increase should not have a material impact on our business performance this year, due to a gain from inventories that we were able to build prior to the tax change. Let me now turn to Russia, where we performed exceptionally well in 2014. Market share reached 27.1%, up by one full share point versus prior year. Our share growth was driven by the strong performance of above-premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street, which positions us well for further expansion in 2015. Cigarette industry volume decreased by 9.2% in 2014, in line with our forecast of 9% to 10%. The decline was due primarily to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which averaged around 22% for PMI. These price increases helped us boost our unit margins and total profitability in the market, despite a 3.5% lower volume. For 2015, we forecast a decline in total cigarette industry volume of 8% to 10%, due to excise tax-driven price increases and a deteriorating macro-economic environment. Moving on to our brand portfolio, Marlboro was a key driver of our continued global market share momentum in 2014, with growth of 0.3 points in both the EU and EEMA Regions. The brand’s performance was particularly strong during the fourth quarter, with share growth in all four Regions, providing positive momentum heading into 2015. Marlboro’s share growth was driven by the successful initial rollout of architecture 2.0 in 26 markets, starting in the EU Region, and the expansion of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign to additional markets. Beyond Marlboro, we are very pleased by the strong 2014 performances of our other key international brands, which demonstrate that our investments behind them are clearly paying off. Of particular note was the continued robust growth of above-premium Parliament, with cigarette volume up by 5.6% versus 2013 and notable share gains in Russia and Turkey. Chesterfield had an exceptional year, with cigarette volume growth of 22.6%. In addition to its success in the EU Region, which I covered earlier, the brand grew cigarette volume in all other regions. L&M was also a success in 2014, with cigarette volume essentially stable or growing in three of our four regions and notable share gains in Germany, Russia and Ukraine. The unparalleled strength of our brand portfolio provides us with significant pricing power. 2014 was another robust year on this front, with a total pricing variance of $1.9 billion. This is in line with our historical annual average and was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada Region. For 2015, we foresee our pricing variance remaining broadly in line with that of last year. Please note that, as of today, we have implemented or announced approximately 70% of the pricing that is included in 2015 EPS guidance. We continue to focus vigorously on our cost base and in 2014, exceeded our gross productivity and cost savings target of $300 million, with significant savings related to specification rationalization and procurement. In 2015, we anticipate that our productivity and cost savings program, combined with savings associated with the manufacturing footprint initiatives that we implemented in 2014, should result in a total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%. Turning now to our RRP portfolio, 2014 opened a groundbreaking new chapter in the history of our company with the commercialization of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan, and Milan, Italy. As a reminder, neither pilot launch is being made with any health claims. The marketing focus is on innovation and product benefits, such as no ash and less smell. Although, it is still too early for a comprehensive quantitative assessment, I’m very pleased to share with you that both adult smoker and trade response is very positive and that the performance of iQOS is in line with, or exceeds key indicators that we established. We should be in a better position to provide data around the middle of this year. In Nagoya, total iQOS device sales are well ahead of projections and growing steadily every week. Sales of HeatSticks are also growing sequentially, but quite naturally do not yet reflect high rates of full conversion. However, as critical mass and product normalization build up over time, we would expect these rates to be in line with our 2013 whole offer test results. Based on our latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 34% and adult smoker profiles are on target. Furthermore, the iQOS flagship store concept is a success. Our logistics chain is working well and product defect and return rates are much lower than we had anticipated. In Milan, where the selling channel is limited by design to a subset of the tobacconist universe and consumer communication is severely restricted. iQOS device penetration has, as expected, lagged that of Nagoya. However, HeatSticks sales reflect a higher full conversion rate, consistent with the characteristics of the market. Based on our latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 16%. Other indicators are in line with Nagoya. In both markets, Marlboro HeatSticks are subject to a lower excise tax rate than cigarettes. Given the positive initial performance of iQOS, we are confirming our plans to commence national expansion in Japan and Italy, as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets later this year. These launches will be supported by a new release of iQOS that incorporates feedback from the pilot market and features a variety of colors and textures to broaden the product’s appeal amongst adult smokers. Our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS, which is skewed towards the second half of the year. We continued to reward our shareholders generously in 2014, despite a significant currency headwind that adversely impacted our free cash flow by $1.6 billion. Last September, our Board of Directors approved an increase of our dividend by a further 6.4% to $4 per share on an annualized basis. This represents an increase of approximately 117% since the spin-off in 2008 and equates to a dividend yield of 5% based on last Friday’s closing share price. In 2014, we paid $6 billion in total dividends to our shareholders and spent a further $3.8 billion to repurchase 45.2 million shares. We are currently operating in a debt level corridor that is close to the maximum that would still allow us to maintain our single-A credit rating. We remain committed to returning around 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, and are taking appropriate measures to further reduce our working capital and keep capital expenditures flat despite the expansion of RRP. At prevailing exchange rates, the adverse currency impact on our 2015 net earnings would be approximately $1.7 billion, which consequently will impact free cash flow. Furthermore, the currency environment remains extremely volatile. In this context, we are focused on managing our cash flow prudently and maintaining financial flexibility for business development opportunities. Consequently, we do not currently envisage any share repurchases in 2015 and this is reflected in our guidance. However, we will revisit the potential for such purchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment. In conclusion, we enter 2015 with confidence in our business outlook. We delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014, with adjusted diluted EPS growth above our guidance and successfully executed on a number of our key strategic initiatives that will generate attractive returns in the years to come. We also made substantial progress in addressing market specific challenges. Our business is supported by strong fundamentals and positive momentum. Our leading brand portfolio is driving continued robust pricing and market share gains, while our vigorous focus on our cost base, notably through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint is enhancing operational efficiency. These strong fundamentals are enhanced by our investment behind reduced-risk product. We are excited by the prospects for iQOS and are pleased by its performance thus far. For 2015, we are targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions of 4% to 6% for net revenues and 6% to 8% for adjusted OCI. We are further targeting growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8% to 10%, excluding currency. These targets are a clear reflection of the strong confidence that we have in both our business and the outlook for the year, particularly given our incremental spending behind the deployment of iQOS. Thank you. Jacek and I will now be very happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger: Hi. Good afternoon.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Matt.
Matthew Grainger: Hi. Thanks. Just two questions. One, I wanted to ask a bit more about Japan to better understand the inventory reduction there. Is that a function of how retailers are temporarily managing levels across manufacturers? And consequently, is that a timing issue that could reverse next year, or was that just the lag result of some of the share losses you’ve seen in over 2013 and earlier this year?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. To put this inventory movements in context, we should all remind -- remember that we had to close better than to resume during last year. And this is an $80 billion plus cigarette factory and consequently, we had to prepare for the closure and also move production to a number of other factories. We had to build in a particular case of Japan, some safety stocks but not only in the case of Japan during the year. And some of these inventories had to carry through the year end and will come back in 2015. For the particular case of Japan, however, the objective for the year was to adjust inventory hurdles to both the market decline in 2014 and anticipate it for 2015 and in addition to that to our lower market share. Okay. And the vast majority, clearly of these adjustments as we right sized will not come back. And as I said, because of maintaining some safety during the year, we had to do this adjustment in the last quarter. So that’s basically the whole story.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. If we are trying to put that in context, I think your many investors will look at the flat adjusted operating profit performance this year. And the expected acceleration back to 6 to 8 next year and view that as a fairly high hurdle. If we are trying to look at the some of the moving pieces that will shift from year-to-year, those inventory reductions in Japan over the course of the year that you sort of purposely of course corrected on, how much of a drag was that on this year’s full year adjusted -- total company adjusted operating profit?
André Calantzopoulos: I think the inventories in the last quarter, I can’t quantify exactly, I appreciate, but probably 1 point.
Jacek Olczak: Above the 1 point in our growth rate throughout the year. 1 point.
André Calantzopoulos: On adjusted basis, what was our volume development in the fourth quarter, I mean, we read it, André read it in the remarks. So, yes, there was a drag clearly coming from this rescheduling of a supply chain and the subsequent inventory.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. That’s helpful.
André Calantzopoulos: The key positives for the year, clearly is the improvement in the Philippines. I think that was big, I think issue we had in 2014. We -- I think we stabilized in any case the share at Japan that was even bigger, better than the inventories. I think the business in Europe is doing fine. So I think we fix the issues we had announced we need to fix in 2014. And we’ve just behind that. I think we can look with optimism into 2015 and that clearly explains the swing we have in terms of OCI growth.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Thanks André. And just Jacek, perhaps with respect to the dividend, I know this is a hypothetical question and you may just prefer not to address it. But the payout ratio is obviously extremely high right now, are there any guidelines you can provide on how you or the board would react if currency headwinds pushed the payout ratio even higher on a reported basis? Would the goal under those circumstances be to sustain some level of ongoing dividend growth even if that was only modest if you had, let’s say, 100% payout ratio?
Jacek Olczak: I can answer that question but I think André would be even more enthusiastic about answering this question.
André Calantzopoulos: Look we all understand there is huge currency volatility in 2015 and we have to be bit cautious. And clearly, dividend is more prerogative as you know very well. But I understand where your question points to or points at and I see a no scenario under which we will reduce the dividend in 2015, okay, even if we have to temporarily stay at a very high payout ratio.
Matthew Grainger: Okay. Okay. Thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell of Exane.
James Bushnell: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up a little bit on the last point, so you mentioned that the stock production in Japan took points of OCI growth in Q4. I’m thinking about Asia because that’s clearly where you have the most weakness in the quarter. I wondered if you could give us a feeling of the moving parts there? So was Australia the biggest drag on your profits? And I know there are some other things at the Philippines and you had some investments. So I just wonder if you’d help us think through what the big drags are there and then that would help in terms of modeling going forward? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Well, I think you mentioned them. Clearly, Australia was a big drag compared to 2013. And we had Japan overall as we said at the beginning of the year because we expect a lot of share at the time of the inventory adjustment, clearly, Japan would be another drag. Now, we’ve stabilized our share and quarter-to-quarter daily, Japan, on an underlying business basis is rather stable but where to make the timing of this inventory in Japan as I explained previously because we had to maintain certain safety stocks until the whole situation of Bergen op Zoom closure is resolved. So I would say its Australia and clearly, partially the Philippines. Don’t forget that in the Philippines, we increased prices ahead of main competitor there plus during the year we had to absorb partially excise tax. Now the good news about the Philippines is that we had the price movement at the bottom of the market. Prices per stick now of virtually any brand that comes are 2 or above, our price gaps are reducing. So the Philippines definitely are now going to be of any negativity and if any, they will turn positive this year and I think that’s an excellent develop, but we have to watch the situation that really carefully. But so far so good, I mean, I feel much better now, as I say, six months ago and three months ago, I can tell you.
James Bushnell: Okay. Thank you. And I wonder if you could comment also on the how you see the outlook in Australia this year, please?
André Calantzopoulos: It is early day, first of all, in Australia, the market decline is 10.6%, but if we correct for inventory movements 2013 to ’14, the underlying is roughly [4.6 points over there] [ph]. And as we know, this is entirely driven by the excise driven price increase that are pretty substantial in Australia. I think we know about the issues in Australia is the growth of the low price that the deep discount segment and some competitive activities. So we said that we have to put in place a strategy to extend the growth and I think our pricing strategy that is currently in pace is bring results. We see a slight deceleration of the deep discount segment, part of this is -- technical part of this is real. But I would not say, yes, that we can declare that the deep discount segment has stabilized. But sequentially looks like it doesn’t grow any more at the pace it used to be. We also see some positive price movement at the bottom end of the market. That’s good news. Business will be confirmed, because if there is price movement, it’s good, but we have to see how much of that is discounted back, if that sticks, this is also a positive development. Overall, I -- our estimate is that it’s unlikely that Australia will contribute positively to our OCI growth this year, but definitely we don’t anticipate this to be the kind of marginal drag that we had in 2014, okay. So it’s early days. We will see how the next three, four months unfold. I don’t know if I answered your question.
James Bushnell: Okay. No. It does. That was great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Yeah. Hi, André and Jacek.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi.
Jacek Olczak: Hi.
Judy Hong: So, maybe, first on FX, I guess, just maybe given the really the heightened level of FX volatility, can you talk about if there any plans to perhaps better align your revenue and cost structure in some of your key markets like Russia, Japan, and even your exposure to Swiss franc?
André Calantzopoulos: I think we look at our cost structures constantly and we are focused on improving productivity and efficiency. And I think that indication we gave that total cost excluding RRPs are going to grow by normal than 1%. It’s a clear sign that we are very focused on these items. Now every market is particular and Jacek will elaborate a bit more on this. But as a matter of principle, in many markets we have costs that are in local currency, but we also have costs that are in euros or in dollars, like tobacco, leaf and certain materials. And clearly rebalancing that cost structure is a bit more difficult. But today, I would say that in the vast majority of the market, even in Russia we are not dollarized in terms of the cost basis we have and agreements we have with the parties other than the materials I explained. So we see a reduction in the cost base as well as currencies devalued.
Jacek Olczak: You are absolutely, right. Judy, one thing which maybe will help looking at the same $0.80 EPS, negative variance is the currency net in '14, the transaction impact, negative transaction impact is just in a range of 10% of this total amount. So most of the impact which we are incurring is coming from translations. And to André’s point, if I take the largest individual market on net profitability per market we take Indonesia, Russia and we have a local cost, this in a range of 65% to 75% in total cost. So this is COGS in all discretionary marketing overhead etcetera spend. So we have obviously there quite a significant portion of the natural hedges for the cost structures already building, but as I said earlier, the impact on us is mainly coming from a translation.
Judy Hong: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just maybe looking at Russia and the industry volume was down 9.2% in 2014. Your volume actually did a lot better down 3.5%. I think you are commenting on 2015, industry being down in that 8% to 10% range. So my first question related to that is your confidence in keeping your volume decline much more modest versus the industry and obviously that implies continued market share in that market? And then secondly given that the tax increases in 2015 in Russia is more modest. Do you think that 8% to 10% volume decline is more representative just the macro pressures that you are experiencing in that market? And related to that just comment on how you are seeing sort of the pricing in that market and the consumer’s ability to absorb cigarette price increases in a pretty inflationary market?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. We had very, very good year in Russia in 2014 and I believe the portfolio fundamentals were plus the initiative should maintain a share growth momentum. Now whether this can fully compensate volume or not, this has to be seen, okay. The second important thing in Russia is a question of pricing. We had about 22% pricing in 2014 and November and December prices were up roughly 13% if move way above average on our portfolio which of course will carry forward almost entirely in 2016. You appreciate, I cannot comment about further price increases for the year. But the situation in Russia we all watch it very closely, clearly a combination of the sanctions in the oil price have an impact on the economy. We start seeing inflation and quite the unknown is for the year and this is not only particular to Philip Morris is what will happen with real incomes and salary, okay. So as you know we take pricing decision trying to balance our ways, consumer affordability, price gaps, illicit trade and clearly margin improvement and we will always pursue the opportunity within that equation. This is -- Russia is because of the microeconomic environment we have to assume that we will have a similar decline in 2015 that we had in 2014 despite as we rightly pointed out a lower excise tax, okay. So how this will unfold, I don’t know. I will be happiest man on earth if the decline is lower than what we perceived.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. Thank you, both.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, André.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the consumer behavior surrounding iQOS in your two test markets. For instance, could you give us a better sense of dual usage, repeat purchase for example, and then cannibalization rates maybe on Marlboro combustible or possibly any of your other brands? And then I would also like to hear from you what was the biggest positive surprise and the biggest negative surprise from your two tests.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. A lot of questions, Bonnie. First of all, I think overall we are obviously positively surprise by their performance we had. You appreciate, I cannot disclose precise numbers for competitive reasons, but clearly our device -- our iQOS device sales were well ahead of what we had initially projected and we are talking to thousands of units okay and we are not talking small quantities. And they continue every week at a pace of 3% to 4%, so this is not bad at all. Regarding conversion rates, it is a bit premature to measure this because as we are building a consumer base, it takes time to make the assessment and takes time for people to fully convert. The numbers we see in terms clearly of offtake or repeat purchase and mind you some of the consumers bought cartons at the beginning, so it’s difficult to judge daily purchases of product. We see that the rate of full conversion is clearly lagging behind the amount of units we sold. But that’s natural and we expect it, okay. We also need to understand the situation in Japan that people still have the ability to smoke combustible products in very many venues. So that’s natural that initially they use iQOS in situations like in warehouses or in office where they can’t use combustible products and mostly and slowly they will eventually convert more and more. So I don’t have yet a sufficient database to know exactly what the conversion fully conversion versus occasional are. We will have a better reading a couple of months, but all I am saying is that the progress is pretty good and steady okay. And we should not be totally impatient and think that everybody will convert in day one. Even with the people I go around, they took some time to convert. And the awareness of the product is right. I think the consumer profile is a target. And as I said also in my remarks, we are testing our supply chain, returns rates are much lower than we thought, although people have the option to return the products if they are not happy. And we are learning also a lot in terms of marketing so that we can adjust our programs when we go national, but overall it’s pretty good experience. As expected, and I said in my remarks in Milano because of less marketing freedoms and more difficult and it’s higher difficult to create awareness, we are a bit behind Nagoya in terms of absolute amount of iQOS unit sold still in thousand, but we have an apparently higher full conversion rate also because there are much more restrictions in Italy. One particularity of Italy is that there is an initial, I would say reluctance for people who have tried electronic cigarettes to try iQOS because they had a bad experience with electronic cigarettes, but the ones who finally try and buy, they are more committed because they see the difference. But this is more qualitative and anecdotal at this stage than quantitative. So again, good progress. We decided to go national and in few months, we will have something that is really quantifiable and of course we will communicate this to you.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That’s really helpful. And then I just have a question or I guess probably a two-part question on your margins. First, your margins in the fourth quarter deteriorated quite a bit, so could you drill down on the key drivers for this? And then in terms of '15, you mentioned your cost ex-RRP will increase 1%. So just trying to understand what you’re hoping to achieve or accomplish with these higher costs and investments? Clearly you are making strategic investments in your business. So how should we think about this in terms of the potential for accelerated growth in the future?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. I am referring to you the 1% refers to the entire base, okay. We should not forget that we have the benefit also this year of the manufacturing footprint improvement of last year, okay. We also benefit with for moderating leaf prices that will continue into the future and growth price also that has been a big cost item in 2012 and '13 are also kind of stabilizing as we had good crops. So from a manufacturing perspective, clearly we are on the low end of the cost. So that for the business, we pursue also efficiency improvement programs, but we never stop the investments that will grow the business further. And for this year clearly, we have some exciting programs on all the brands. We continue with the deployment of 2.0 Marlboro. We started with red. We continue with Marlboro Gold and the other variance of the brands, so that continues investment. And we also essentially revamped and created new marketing campaigns for all the other key brands in the portfolio that we are also deploying and investing besides them. But as I said in my remarks, clearly, that pays dividends. So be reassured that we don’t stop investing behind the growth of the business and I think, the market share performance has demonstrated that were the right thing to do. For the rest, as we said in -- and I said in previous intervention, our long-term objective is to always contain cost between 1% to 3% ex-RRPs. And depending on leaf prices, I think we can even at least, for the next two years remain at the lower end of this range. So I think we are pretty happier about that. And just to clarify on also RRPs, there is incremental investment this year compared to last year’s incremental investment and the variance is slightly above the range we had last year or the north we had last year. So it’s about 1 EPS point just the increment, okay.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. All right. Thank you. That was helpful. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe: Hi. Good afternoon.
André Calantzopoulos: Good afternoon.
Chris Growe: Hi. Just had two questions for you if I could please. The first one, I’m just curious by André your view on, I mean, you talked about 2014 definite macro-economic effect on the business. It would seem like that environment generally still in place in ’15? I guess, related that, I’m just curious, if you could give a general outlook for volume? And also just curious you’re seeing any mix degradation across the business, any trade down broadly that is rather than market by market, is that having an effect on the business in ’15?
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. It’s difficult, obviously, to appreciate to predict total industry volume this year. I would see and I will explain some of the caveat in the 2% to 3% range, okay. This is what I mentioned previously that mid-term, I think, would return to 1% to 2%. First of all, we have all this currency situation that it’s very difficult to predict what precise effect is going to have on the economies around the planet. Second thing, clearly, we had to revise our estimate for the Russian market given the particular situation there. We thought that 2015 would be the range 4% to 6% roughly. Now we think that it will be at 8% to 10%, of course, that’s an assumption. And the positive, however, can come from the Philippines, because when I say 2% to 3% that assumes that no cigarettes return to the legal market in the Philippine. Now, hopefully, given the development in the Philippines, we’ll see some more volume coming back to the legal market and that can change clearly the overall equation. So we may end up in the middle of that range I gave, but that’s the best I can do at this stage.
Chris Growe: Okay. That’s fair enough.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. Now, the overall economic outlook, we all know the fundamentals, okay. Oil prices will be lower, so that’s helps economy and consumer spending. But in some places we’re going to see inflation following devaluation. Not in many, because as we all know, its only one currency appreciating and all the others depreciating and remaining in relative parity to each other, so they -- when they trade with each other, we don’t have imported inflation. So Russia is the one that comes to mind first as we discuss previously. Overall, I don’t see an acceleration, I think, overall of down trading at all on a global basis. I think we said, we stay on the same trends as we were in 2014, although slightly better, okay. We know the specifics of Australia. We discussed it and so on. Obviously, there is a bit of geographic mix. But if we look at total market declines in 2014, there is no substantial difference between OECD and non-OCED especially, thanks to the recovery of the European Union. I mean, OECD decline roughly three point something percent and non-OECD 2.5% in 2015. So, I would say overall nothing worrisome at this stage.
Chris Growe: Okay. That’s helpful. If I could just ask one question, just for me to understand, just some perspective on the lack of share repurchase obviously, supporting the dividends and that’s very important to you. I want to understand like throughout 2015, would you add this sort of this -- sort of at the margin you’re close to a debt level that would push your rating down? Is there any consideration where you would allow for the debt rating to go down? I’m just thinking about acquisitions for example. So maybe not so much for share repurchase but from an acquisition standpoint, would you or the Board consider the debt rating -- and violating the debt rating if you will?
André Calantzopoulos: We always said and I maintain this. We will not lose our rating for share repurchase purposes. Now, if we have a strategic reason, that is a strategic acquisition or something then of course that can be considered. Okay. Absent that, we will do everything we can to maintain our A rating. Okay. And I think we have to be prudent on how we manage the situation given the currency volatility we are in. Having said that, I want to stress that we are committed to share repurchases. We’ll see how the situation unfolds. And as soon as we can resume them, we will. We’ll not change our approach to that. It is just a temporary situation that calls for caution given what happened with the currency. Okay.
Chris Growe: Sure. Well, that’s good perspective. Thank you for your time.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery: Good afternoon. So just -- I guess two things that we’ve touched on already. If it came down to it and you had to decide between the dividend and the debt rating, how do those fall relative to each other in terms of priority?
André Calantzopoulos: I think I tried to clarify this. First of all, it’s rather a speculative situation and I said that I don’t see scenarios under which we will reduce our dividends, unless we have third World War.
Michael Lavery: Okay. That’s helpful. So the dividend would come before -- if you had to choose between the two, the debt rating might suffer before the dividend certainly. That’s fair.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. But if you do the mathematics, that’s a consequential effect. So, yeah. 
Michael Lavery: Okay, André. Thank you. And then just looking at the EU, your guidance for the operating income growth there, does that include the savings from the Netherlands’ plant and how much -- can you quantify how much that is?
André Calantzopoulos: Well, that’s all baked. Yes, it includes obviously the savings from the footprint optimization and that’s included in the overall guidance and in the cost indications I gave.
Michael Lavery: So, how much does that add from just the plant closure?
André Calantzopoulos: A variety of reasons, I cannot disclose that number. I’m sorry.
Michael Lavery: Okay. No problem. And then just looking at Indonesia, certainly, the inflation from the fuel subsidy cuts late in the quarter had an impact on the category volumes there. But with oil prices pulling back, that’s reversed now. Can you give any sense of what -- even though it’s early in this year, have you seen the improvement in January or what does it look like so far as start to the year?
André Calantzopoulos: It’s very early to judge the effect. But that you said is correct. I mean, the subsidies were removed but oil prices are a bit low. We didn’t say anything in the market generally that shows any change in the dynamic in this direction but it is only one month. Okay.
Michael Lavery: So there is no other improvement yet but it’s just too early to really see.
André Calantzopoulos: Yeah. We didn’t see any effect in January. That’s all I can tell you.
Michael Lavery: Okay. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good afternoon. In terms of your outlook for pricing for 2015 please, with it being broadly in line with historical levels, can you talk a little bit about the compensation of that pricing contribution because historically, it’s been fairly well balanced over year across your geographies but clearly in 2014 it was decidedly weighted towards EEMA and Latin America? Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos: Yes. In 2015, it is very balanced.
Vivien Azer: Okay. And then the second ….
André Calantzopoulos: So it is actual that’s why we project and now we know the specificities of 2014, we had Italy that skewed clearly the European Union. And we also had the Philippines absorption that skewed Asia and these are the two fundamentals. Okay, now.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. That’s very clear. As a follow-up on the EPS growth outlook of 8% to 10% on -- impressive that you guys are maintaining that absent at the buyback, but as I think about the contribution then from not operating items of 200 basis point, clearly you get the residual benefit of $3.8 billion of share repurchases that you did this year but can you comment Jacek at all about your outlook either for tax or for interest expense?
Jacek Olczak: On the tax, we should stay broadly in that effective tax rate, which we had in 2014. So it looking 29, slightly below 29%. And on the interest expenses, you remember I hope that quite the portion of our debt portfolio you seen euros. And so obviously, it’s put a bit of the lower pressure or reduces the pressure coming from the interest to serve our bond portfolio. So there is some benefit on us coming due to the overall lower interest rate, lower interest rate environment and also for the composition of our debt portfolio due to the significant portion of the euro debt.
Vivien Azer: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg.
André Calantzopoulos: Hi, Erik.
Erik Bloomquist: Hi. Good afternoon. Hello. One of the markets that we haven’t really talked about today was Turkey and there we’ve seen a volume is improved a bit. So I was wondering if you can comment on the outlook for the Turkish market, is the down trading finished or does it look like it’s stable and does that then suggest that there is an opportunity for perhaps some profit growth and -- with the volume base remaining stable or have there been some regulatory moves there that suggest we may have another difficult year following a decent year in Turkey? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Well, volumes in Turkey are stable. Illicit trade is stable. Okay. Increased a little bit, which outlines that the underlying volume is even better. I don’t see any change at this stage. I mean excise taxes are in. There was moderate increase in the specific and of the minimum tax. So from a total market perspective, I don’t see any particular change in the trend. Now regarding the dynamics, clearly, there has been some down trading but shares have to -- seem to have stabilized now. And we did very well in the premium segment, particularly with parliament this type all the down trading. So I think we are there for a decent year in Turkey going forward.
Erik Bloomquist: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
Owen Bennett: Good afternoon, guys. And just a couple of questions. Firstly, I was just hoping you could give an update on the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 in terms of how is it performing with regards to retaining current Marlboro smokers and also I guess crucially is attracting competitive smokers. And also how many more markets are expected in 2015? And secondly, just coming back to Russia pricing, and we understand that you may have gotten a pricing benefit in 2014 from your stake in Megapolis? And could you confirm whether this is correct, and if so, is there likely to be some giveback from this benefit in 2015? Thanks very much.
Jacek Olczak: The rollout of Marlboro.
André Calantzopoulos: Okay. On Marlboro, I think we are very pleased with our rollout. We have 100% retention of existing smokers, which is I think remarkable. And we do see change both in profiles and other all attraction from competitive smokers and the share performance of the brand in the markets where we have rolled out is a clear testimony to the success of 2.0. And we will continue rolling it out. The plan is to be fully down with all the rollouts by early 2016, okay. We are ready in 26 markets and growing by the day. So which is through the planning and we are very happy with it. Now Megapolis is not in the pricing but an item that is below the OCI line, okay. I’m sorry, I’m asking the people that are more.
Owen Bennett: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos: Its income unconsolidated that’s where it is, okay.
Owen Bennett: Okay.
André Calantzopoulos: We have received clearly a dividend, so yes it will be somehow affected by the ruble, et cetera temporarily, but that’s currency clearly.
Owen Bennett: Okay. Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos: Thanks Owen.
Operator: And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing or additional remarks.
Nick Rolli: That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up question, you can contact the Investor Relations team. We’re currently here in New York. And our next presentation will be at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York or CAGNY Conference on Wednesday, February 18th. Thank you, again, and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question and answer session. In order to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touchtone phone at any time. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we’ll be talking about results for the third quarter of 2014 and comparing them to the same period in 2013 unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, dated tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Please note that reduced risk products, or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our volume and financial results in the current quarter came in slightly above our expectations. Our organic cigarette volume decreased by just 0.4% due to an improvement in industry volume trends and higher PMI market shares in the EU and EEMA regions which nearly offset relatively modest volume declines in the Asia and Latin America and Canada regions. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 4% while adjusted OCI was up by 4.3% on the same basis. This growth was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions, thanks in large part to higher pricing, most notably in Russia. It was partly offset by previously announced investments behind our brand and iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 10.4% to $1.59, driven primarily by continued strong profit growth across the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions.  For the first nine months of the year, we achieved growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of 11.9%. Let me remind you, however, that we will face a much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Ex-currency adjusted diluted EPS grew by 19.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the pattern of our expenses this year is weighted much more heavily to the remainder of the year. In addition, we will be making significant investments in the fourth quarter behind the pilot launches of our iQOS platform and Marlboro HeatSticks in Nagoya, Japan and Milan in Italy. We will also make additional investment in the continuation of the rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0 as well as the absorption of underlying costs attributable to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint.  As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are revising our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.81 compared with $5.26 in 2013, due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate movement. Since July, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the value of certain key currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in particular the Indonesian rupiah and the Russian ruble. Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates our guidance now includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.72 per share versus $0.61 in our previous guidance. In addition, there was one additional cent in the third quarter in after-tax asset impairment and exit cost related to the termination of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands, and it is anticipated that there will be a further one cent in the fourth quarter related to the closure of our factory in Australia. Our underlying business performance is slightly better that our previous expectations. While consumer downtrading and heavy discounting in Australia have persisted, there has been an improvement in the EU region and Indonesia and continued strong profit momentum in the EEMA and Latin American and Canada regions. Excluding the impact of currency and after-tax impairment and exit costs totaling $0.27 related to previously disclosed footprint optimization initiatives, our adjusted diluted EPS are projected to increase by approximately 6.5 to 7.5% compared to the $5.40 achieved in 2013. Our revised guidance results in a narrowing of the growth range around its midpoint. I will now discuss the recent developments in key regions and markets, starting with the EU region. The third quarter confirmed the improving cigarette industry volume trend with a decline of 3.4%, thereby bringing the year-to-date September decline rate also to 3.4%. This represents a significant moderation compared to the 7.9% decline in the same period last year. (Indiscernible) improvement to a slight decline in illicit rate, a slowdown in the growth of e-vapor products in several markets, and (indiscernible) switching to fine-cut product. The improved trend in cigarette industry volume is visible across all six of the largest EU region markets by volume, with a particularly strong improvement in the worst affected market in southern Europe. While we do expect to see some acceleration in the decline in the fourth quarter due to recent price increases, notably in Germany, and the impact of the more challenging industry volume comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2013, we are now forecasting a full-year decline of approximately 4%. Our market share performance in the EU region continues to be very strong with growth of 1.2 points in the third quarter to 39.7% and 1 point year-to-date September to 39.8%. The growth has been broadly based with share gains this year in all six of the largest EU region markets by volume. Our share growth reflects the strength of our key international brands, Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield. These brands now represent the top 3 industry brands in the region.  In the third quarter, Marlboro gained 0.2 share points to reach 19.1%, the growth momentum being reinforced by the successful rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0. L&M’s share was stable at 7% with a notable performance in Germany. Chesterfield continued its particularly strong performance, gaining 1.4 share points to reach a regional share of 5.8%. The share growth was driven by Italy, where it was price repositioned in February of this year, as well as by successful line extensions in Poland. The combination of more modest cigarette industry volume declines and share gains has resulted in an improved PMI volume performance. Were it not for the issues related to the excise tax structure in Italy, this would have translated into ex-currency adjusted OCI growth in the EU region year-to-date September. In addition, our profits are being impacted by costs related to the ending of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands and to the build-up of our commercial infrastructure in the U.K. We are cautiously optimistic that as of 2015, the EU region should contribute to PMI’s profit growth, provided that improved cigarette industry volume trends continue. I will now discuss some of our key markets in the Asia region, beginning with Japan. Year-to-date September, industry volume in Japan declined by 3.2%, which is in line with our forecast decline range of 3 to 3.5% for the full year. The third quarter provided further evidence of our success in stabilizing our market share. Excluding the impact of trade inventory movements, our market share has remained around 25.9% since the fourth quarter of 2013. The share stabilization has been driven primarily by Lark, which is performing well following the successful morphing of the Philip Morris brand in April, as well as the recent revamp of the Lark brand family. Our share has also benefited from the rollout of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign and the August launch of Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth-tasting, regular to menthol capsule product which achieved 0.6% market share in September. Going forward, we believe that our pipeline of new innovative products should further reinforce our competitive position in Japan.  In the Philippines, third quarter tax paid cigarette industry volume was down by 3.2%; however, as Mighty Corporation continues to significantly under-declare its sales volume for excise tax purposes, the trends in the tax paid market remain distorted. We estimate that Mighty is paying excise taxes on less than half of its total sales. Market research (indiscernible) smoking incidents and at daily consumption showed continued resilience. The Bureau of Internal Revenue issued its expected regulation on tax stamps. This requires manufacturers to affix tax stamps on all locally manufactured packs of cigarettes; however, there are still significant technical issues with the production of the stamps, resulting in a delay in implementation.  In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume trends are subject to quarterly fluctuations. This was evident in the third quarter when industry volume increased by an unexpectedly vigorous 4.9%, driven by growth in the machine-made kretek segment. On a 12-month moving basis, industry volume is up by 2.8%, and for the full year we expect industry volume to grow by around 2%.  While our market share remained below the previous year’s level, we continued to achieve positive sequential share momentum with 35.5% in the third quarter following shares of 34.6 and 34.9% in the first and second quarters respectively. This growth has been driven by our strong performance in the growing lighter tasting, machine-made kretek segment behind Sampoerna A, U Mild, and Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue. We have also seen a recent stabilization in the share of our key hand-rolled kretek brand, Dji Sam Soe, as competitive brands have crossed critical price points. Let me now turn to Russia where our business performance continues to be strong. In (indiscernible), we reached a market share of 27.4% and on a year-to-date August basis our share increased by 0.9 points to 27%. The strong performance was driven by (indiscernible) and Parliament, mid price L&M, and low price Bond Street and Next. 2014 has been characterized by significant retail price increases driven in large part by the sizeable excise tax increase that took place at the beginning of the year. Retail prices have increased by some 17% in the premium segment and 30% at the low end of the market. This has resulted in an estimated September year-to-date cigarette industry volume decline of 9.4%, and we expect a decline of 9 to 10% for the full year; however, we have been able to boost margins through higher prices. On September 20, the cabinet submitted draft amendments to the tax code, including proposed excise tax rates for the period of 2015 to 2017. This proposal was submitted to the Duma for further consideration and approval. The amendments are essentially in line with previous legislation and do not include features that we consider to be particularly disruptive. Should the amendment be signed into law by the president, as foreseen this November, the new excise tax rates would take effect on January 1, 2015. While cigarette industry volume has declined significantly this year in Russia, it has remained essentially stable in the rest of the EEMA region. This stability is attributable to Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. Our business is performing well. We grew our year-to-date September regional market share by 0.1 points to 25.1%. Combined with strong pricing, this led to an increase in original adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 20.8% year-to-date September. The business outlook remains very positive thanks to the strength of Marlboro and Parliament in many key markets. Marlboro has been one of the key drivers of our favorable global market share momentum. In the third quarter, the brand gained 0.3 share points in the Latin America and Canada region, and 0.2 share points in the EU and EEMA regions. Its share was stable overall in the Asia region. Parliament, our (indiscernible) premium proposition, has been a contributor not only to share growth but also to improved profits as its volume increased by 9.3% in the third quarter to 12.9 billion units. The brand gained share across a broad range of markets, including Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Pricing remained a key driver of our adjusted OCI growth during the third quarter. Our pricing variance reached $491 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. This has been boosted by our new business structure in Egypt, partially offset by Italy. During the third quarter, we increased prices in a number of markets across the region, most notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Spain. We are on track to achieve again this year our historical average of approximately 1.8 billion in annual pricing variance. Let me now take a moment to provide a brief update on our Reduced Risk product. As I speak, we are in the final stage of preparing for the pilot launches in Japan and Italy of our heat-not-burn iQOS product platform and Marlboro HeatSticks. These launches will be made without any reduced exposure or reduced risk claims. As already announced, the official launch of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan’s fourth largest city, will take place on November 4. iQOS kits and Marlboro HeatSticks will be available at over 1,000 retail outlets in Nagoya, including the world’s first iQOS flagship store located in a city center. The iQOS kit will have a recommended retail price of ¥6,980 or approximately $65, while Marlboro HeatSticks in regular and menthol variants will retail at ¥460 per pack or 20, or approximately $4.29, at price parity with Marlboro cigarettes. Our HeatSticks have been classified by the Ministry of Finance in Japan in a category that results in an effective excise tax rate that is lower than cigarettes. Our second pilot launch will take place in Milan in Italy later this year. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose any details at this time. In September, our board approved a 6.4% increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4 per share. As a result, this year we will exceed our target dividend payout ratio of 65%, reflecting our strong confidence in our business fundamentals and future prospects. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.7%. During the third quarter, we spent $750 million to repurchase a further 8.9 million shares at an average price of $84.54 per share. We continue to target total spending of $4 billion on share repurchases during 2014. Since the spring through the end of September this year, we have returned over $70 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In conclusion, third quarter and year-to-date results were slightly above our expectations. As mentioned, we will face a much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. We have revised our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate movement. On a currency neutral adjusted diluted basis, we have narrowed the growth range around the midpoint to approximately 6.5 to 7.5%. While consumer downtrading and heavy discounting have unfortunately persisted in Australia, we have been able to offset this through a better performance in the EU region and Indonesia, while the EEMA and Latin America regions have continued to perform very strongly. The iQOS pilot launches in Japan and Italy this quarter mark an important milestone for our Reduced Risk products portfolio. We are excited to bring this product to market and strongly believe that this could represent the first step in a positive paradigm shift for both PMI and the tobacco industry. Looking ahead to 2015 and 2016, we remain confident that our business fundamentals are improving and confirm our goal of returning to currency neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI annual growth within our mid to long-term annual target rate of 4 to 6% and 6 to 8% respectively, after taking into account the anticipated investment behind the commercial expansion of our Reduced Risk product. On this basis, we target a currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS annual growth rate of 8 to 10% for this period. Thank you. I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo: Hi Jacek. I guess I’m trying to understand a few moving parts. On one hand, your total shipment volume was better than expected and you took share, but on the other hand your operating margins were down 230 basis points, so I’d be curious to hear how much of the margin pressure you experienced in the quarter was from a negative mix shift in the portfolio versus the higher costs you’ve been experiencing. And then could you give us a sense of how downtrading pressures have been trending so far in Q4?
Jacek Olczak: There is some mix pressure, obviously, coming mainly from Asia, from Australia, but I think it’s more due to the increased investment, as previously anticipated or announced, in the second half of the year. We have increased the investment in Q3 and we will have more of the investment going into Q4 for the reasons which I mentioned in my remarks, so this is what stands behind the movement in operating margin.
Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo: Okay, and then I have a few questions on Asia, specifically Japan. Are you seeing any shift in your portfolio mix due to the tax increase, and then could you quantify for us the negative impact of inventory movements or maybe give us a sense of how much this impacted your volume and profits in the country in the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we could see a better performance of Lark partially following the successful morphing from Philip Morris into Lark, and also some marketing initiatives which we put behind the brand. Lark obviously is also slightly more—you know, lower price than the premium brands in the market. I think it’s a little bit too early to say what this pricing move—you know, unequal pricing moves over 20 and ¥10 have created in terms of a dynamic behind the brand, but yes, I think Lark is doing slightly better than Marlboro in this comparison. When it comes to that adjustment which we’re making in Japan, it’s essentially we’re trying to adjust the inventories to reflect the total market outlook and still year-on-year. I mean, our lower share, as you might notice, we stabilized our share on a sequential basis but versus last year we’re still down, and these adjustments are essentially to represent (indiscernible). So I think you have—just to give you a number, I think on the inventory you have about half a billion units on inventory adjustment in Q3.
Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo: Okay, that’s helpful. Then my last question is on the e-vapor slowdown in the EU that you mentioned. What are you seeing in terms of the key trends and pressures on this category, and then does this give you even more confidence in your iQOS platform?
Jacek Olczak: Well, the trends essentially are the same trends which I talked about, that we talked about at the investors’ day on the second quarter. The consumers aren’t moving into (indiscernible) system. I think we all know the reasons behind it – I mean, the first product launches in the e-cigarette category are not really satisfying the consumer, so the acceptance rates are falling down. That’s about the trend. Most of the markets, in essentially all of the markets, we see the same, so it’s just the continuation of the trend. Now does this give us more optimism behind iQOS? I think it was more than a year or two years ago when we said that the current technology behind the e-cigarette doesn’t (indiscernible) that well. We think that iQOS is by far a much better satisfying product. We have confirmed it in our tests before going to the test market. As you remember, the acceptance rate—I mean, consumers who fully switched from a conventional cigarette, combustible cigarettes to iQOS proposition were really very high – they were reaching 30%. I think we were encouraged by this result and hence we’re going to the test market. So I don’t think this change in the trends or continuation of this negative trend in e-cigarettes gives us more confidence behind the iQOS. Frankly speaking, we have that confidence, so we are a very high level of confidence when it comes to iQOS.
Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo :  And then maybe lessons learned on pricing, too, just in terms of the affordability of the e-vapor category relative to where you’re pricing iQOS and the HeatSticks. You’re pricing them, you mentioned, at parity I think with Marlboro, I believe you mentioned.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, this is how we positioned the product in Japan, although we are not disclosing the details for Milan, but you understand our philosophy – I mean, that has a benefit, therefore, I think that product deserves to be sold at a premium price, so this is—I think we’d state what we have said before, that that’s the positioning based on how much effort we have put into developing this product, despite the fact that we’re not claiming other benefits in Japan. But we are aware about also the science which we have put in validating the benefits of this product. I think it all comes together and makes this product deserving of being put in the premium segment, at the premium price.
Bonnie Herzog – Wells Fargo: All right, thank you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Hi Jacek. So first, just maybe on FX, and obviously the currency market continues to be very volatile, and if we just assume maybe prevailing rates, just trying to gauge the impact on 2015, really, and I get to number of something like a negative $0.35 or so. So can you just confirm that that’s kind of in the ballpark of where you see the impact in 2015 at current rates, especially when you take into consideration the effective hedge rates on the yen.
Jacek Olczak: I wouldn’t go into 2015 at this stage. You know that our practice was we always gave this—we talk about the impact of the currency at the time when we give the guidance for the year. One thing, which I’m not presumably disclosing anything new, if you look what is happening in the currency market over the last 24 hours, 48 hours away, it’s an extremely volatile market, so I think it’s another presumably reason when it’s better not to give any number or confirm any sort of range at this stage.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Just on the yen though, Jacek, I think the last time you talked about the effective hedge at 98 for this year, has there been any change to that number as we think about the year-over-year impact?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, there is a bit of the impact of the yen. The effective rate will be higher than 98. In the revised guidance for the currency at the spot rate which we gave today when we revised the impact by an additional negative $0.11, yen actually just (indiscernible) contribute $0.01. I mean, most of the impact which we get, which we have in this $0.11 additional is coming from Russian ruble and the rupiah, the Indonesian rupiah. So yen just adds an additional $0.01, and very much because last portion of our cash flow to revenues from Japan is already—was already hedged.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just in terms of what you’re seeing and the Russian market, just wondering if any of the recent volatility in the currency fluctuation is having any impact in terms of demand or the pricing, the competitive dynamics in that market. Your volume in the third quarter in Russia was up 0.8%, market share obviously was up, but was there any benefit in terms of any year-over-year inventory movement that boosted your shipment number as well?
Jacek Olczak: No, actually the volume, the shipment volume I think was down by 0.4. The shipment volume was not up. Market share was up, and this partially is why our shipment volume is better than overall market performance. It’s partially coming from the strong performance of our brands. The share advancements which we are realizing in Russia at the tune of the (indiscernible), so that’s significant. There is obviously some timing of the shipment to our distributors, but I think overall it’s the performance of both Parliament, which you know that’s very positive if you take into consideration the magnitude of the pricing which we have realized in the market, but also Bond Street, so it nicely—you know, I think the portfolio there is nicely complementary, and that stands behind the better share and hence the better shipment versus the total market.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: And any color on the recent trends given the recent volatility in that market?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, sorry – I missed this one. Not really. I mean, you see our outlook for the full year even, taking into consideration the implemented and announced price increases in Russia, it’s still that the market is going to decline in the range of 9 to 10%. If you would just calculate what is the resulting price elasticity, everyone would realize that Russia is a very normal for our category for a tobacco category elasticity range, so that (indiscernible) at this stage any headwinds coming from the currency, from inflation or other macros. Now, this is the situation as of today. We will have to obviously watch, and we do watch carefully how the situation may unfold into the next period, but as I said, I think our comfort on Russia is also coming through the well-laddered portfolio of brands, and I’ll repeat myself, starting with the premium Parliament in the premium, going through the value, mid-price brands, low price brands. So I think on that one, I think we should be able to hedge any potential headwinds if they were to materialize.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you very much, Judy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning. Thanks Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, and congratulations I guess, right?
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Yes – thank you, it’s exciting. So two questions from me. First, I wanted to follow up on the price mix question, specifically for Europe. I’d expected to see some sequential improvement in pricing realization within the region, given Germany, Portugal, Spain, but that didn’t seem to materialize during the quarter but is more at the regional level. Market share trends were very strong – maybe that’s positive, but just wondering if you’re seeing incremental downtrading overall within your portfolio or shifts within Marlboro to some of the lower priced variants that are weighing on overall pricing realization.
Jacek Olczak: I mean, the pricing – yes, it was very low pricing. The variants coming from the EU this quarter, it’s partially the timing when we took the price increase in Germany, and obviously there was a negative – which is in this number – coming from Italy. Just to remind, we are in the VAT absorption for the three quarters of this year, obviously, including the third quarter is going to be about behind us around the mid of the fourth quarter, and obviously there was a Chesterfield repositioning. If I would look in detail market by market in the EU region, I would see—I can see the positive pricing variance coming essentially from most of the countries, with the exception, as I mentioned, of Italy, so Italy is an overall drag, if you like, on the pricing variance in the region. Obviously downtrading – I think again I would have to go to Italy. I mean, Chesterfield, which is now—you know, recorded market share well above 10%, there is a bit of a decline of Marlboro to the tune of about a point. So yes, there is some downtrading, but this is also the reason why we have lowered the beginning of the price of Chesterfield in order to stop total market share erosion on our side.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: And the brand responded very well, so I think that part of the exercise went very well.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay. So really, the only thing that would change much sequentially in the fourth quarter would be the headwind from Italy becoming less severe.
Jacek Olczak: On the pricing variance, yes.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: On the pricing variance, because on the OCI, as I mentioned in my remarks, one of the tests markets which we’ll be conducting is in Italy, is in the European Union, and the second EU was on the forefront and is on the forefront of the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 architecture; hence, in our remarks I think I made this comment that despite the fact that the volumes and our shipment volume is performing very strongly and is great for this year and even greater for 2015, however this year our profitability will be impacted as we cannot convert it into the profitability growth due to Marlboro 2.0, iQOS and some underlying costs due to shutting down the cigarette manufacturing at our factory in Holland.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks. Secondly just on currency, specifically on hedging, given the persistence and the magnitude of the currency headwind, have you considered at all changing the internal philosophy toward how you manage FX risk, perhaps including more active hedging or, if not that, maybe encouraging local country managers to more actively offset transactional FX through pricing or discretionary reductions in operating costs?
Jacek Olczak: This would require a significant change to the risk profile, if you like, which we’d like to have. I mean, as is presumably known to the community, most of the impact of the currency on our results comes from the translation, and the range of 70 to 80% of the impact which we have on our translation is not on the transactions. So our philosophy obviously has an impact on our reported results, but I don’t think we should be moving closer to something which would add an element of speculation into—volatility into our performance.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Then just to confirm, historically we’ve thought of your hedging practices as isolated within sort of euro-yen and perhaps dollar-yen. Are there any others that you are actively hedging, just when we’re thinking about the disconnects between our currency model and—
Jacek Olczak: There are some hedges which we’re doing on the—associated with the leaf purchases in Turkey, but most of the hedges are around the yen and the balance sheet hedges on our positions on the euro.
Matthew Grainger – Morgan Stanley: Okay. All right, thank you again, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Hi Chris.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: I just had a question for you to start off on—just to understand the third quarter and maybe the fourth quarter, the phasing of costs that may be coming through. If I could just list what I was—when I’ve been watching this, obviously the Marlboro 2.0, obviously there are some costs related to that – I think that cuts across all regions – obviously the closure of Bergen op Zoom, maybe a little bit of Australia. And then I guess also related to that, the Reduced Risk products, is that heavier fourth quarter spending versus the third quarter, and do you have any color you can add around the phasing and maybe in general how much those costs are a burden in profit right now?
Jacek Olczak: Certainly, Chris, I will give you color; but I would start with the 2013 fourth quarter, because if you would look at our performance in 2013, you’ll realize that our phasing of the costs in the last year was much more skewed towards the first half of the year, or the first three quarters of the year. So adjusting apples to apples, I had $200 million positive cost variance in Q4 of 2013, so that’s my starting position going into Q4 of this year. It is now combined that the pattern of our spending on initiatives is much more skewed towards the second half, and in particular to the Q4 of this year, and that actually creates the swing on the cost Q4 on Q4 going in the range of 400, maybe 400-plus even in this comparison. (Indiscernible). Now, drivers of this additional—of this investment in the second half or in the Q4 of this year is, as I mentioned in the case of the EU before, is iQOS launch in Milan. There was some preparation cost already falling into Q3, but most of that will hit my Q4 results. Marlboro 2.0 would be the remainder part of the markets in the EU which would roll out the Marlboro new architecture in the Q4, and there was this underlying cost associated or related to the closure of the factory.  To give you magnitude, the underlying costs which we carried this year due to the restructuring both in Holland and in Australia is in the range of about—will hit my Q4 results in a range of about $40 million. So you start adding these numbers, you will see why we’re saying that the Q4 results—I mean, it will not be as great as Q3 or Q2 this year, and this is reflected in our guidance.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Sure. That was actually very good color. Thank you for all that detail. If I could ask a second question – in relation to your guidance for the year, which you’ve now kind of narrowed the guidance range for EPS, do you have the same assumption for Australia built into that guidance? Has that gotten any better or any worse than what you thought, even back from sort of the investor day back in June?
Jacek Olczak: No, it didn’t get any worse or didn’t get any better. As I said, unfortunately the heavy discounting and the competition in the low part of the market, as it intensified at the beginning of the year, it continues to be pertinent, and I think it’s maybe also to be more on a positive side, one of the competitors made an assumption that you can have volume growth in that market by being very aggressive on the price. You will not break the strategy until you switch off the volume growth of a given brand, so I think what we’re doing, part of our strategy despite the fact that it is obviously costly financially, I think it actually may lead to bringing some logic to the behavior in the market. So this is all in our guidance. I think versus the Q2, especially at the investors’ day, which I think prudence at that time had dictated that we had to recognize that there was this potential headwind coming from Australia, I think at that time we were waiting for more confirmation of positive trends coming from other geographies, which were nicely materializing in Q3. But as I said, I think it would be imprudent to bet on this development in Q2, and now we’re in a very comfortable position to say that this lower end of the range, of the guidance which we gave at that time, is no longer something which we should be worried about, and we can comfortably deliver in the midpoint of that range. The drivers, I think, are well known – EU had a spectacularly good improvement on the total market, and our market share continues to do very well. Indonesia is a very positive surprise – it’s coming. We knew that the market might be stronger, but I think last quarter Q3 has confirmed that the market is going in the right direction. Also, the growth momentum—you saw our OCI, adjusted OCI growth in EEMA and Latin America – I mean, they’re really coming very strongly. So this is very important for us, not only from a Q3 perspective but I would say even more important for us from a 2015 and beyond perspective, that the roadmap which we have laid down for this year, we step-by-step made progress and therefore we should return to the higher level of growth in 2015 and ’16.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that was very good – thank you. I agree, so thanks so much. Speak to you soon.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Bushnell from Exane BNP.
James Bushnell – Exane BNP:  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first is on the tax situation in Italy. I just wondered if you could give us your latest thoughts as to what might be happening and when. I think January ’15, we were hopeful that something might change. Then my second question is on plain packaging in Europe. When the first country passes legislation, whoever that might be, do you think you could give us a roadmap about what would happen, and would you be hopeful that a legal challenge to that could either delay or stop the implementation of plain packaging, or is it just a case of having to take a country to court and then having to do that while their going ahead with the measure? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Okay, I’ll start with Italy. The tax restructuring in Italy is following its normal legislative process. We expect the objective is that this should happen still this year, so it would be implemented as of January 1 next year. I mean, that’s the objective and we’ll see how it works, but as I said, the restructuring is being discussed and is following the normal Italian legislative process. When it comes to plain packaging, the second question which you raised, there’s nothing really new which has happened recently, because we were aware about Ireland, we were aware about U.K. Yes, there was a statement from the Ministry of Health in France that she would propose the legislation implementing, calling for implementation of plain packaging. To date to our knowledge, this is not a governmental position and no legislative initiatives have been made, at least to date, into this direction. Now, litigation which you have mentioned quite rightly, it’s obviously in our tool box of actions which we can take in order to protect the extremely valuable trademarks which we have. But there are also other elements which we are exploring before we reach into litigation. But yes, there is litigation which clearly is something which we will not be shy to use if this is what will be required by us. One thing which is important to note when we talk about the U.K. and Ireland, if I am not mistaken, there are nine countries today or member states in the EU which have raised their concerns to Ireland in particular, and I think there are two countries already which have raised their concerns to the U.K. vis-à-vis they announced or the indication of introducing the plain packaging in this country. It clearly demonstrates to you, or demonstrates to us that a number of member states in the EU itself are pretty much concerned whether this is the right policy to be implemented, both from the perspective of the principles of internal market – and let’s remember that the whole purpose of creating the EU and the legislative powers which were given in the form of directives, were to support the development of internal markets. Frankly speaking, plain packaging is not necessarily something which goes in this direction. So yes, to summarize this, plain packaging is an element in our tool box and we will not be shy to use that if this is what will be required.
James Bushnell – Exane BNP: Okay, thank you very much. If I could just follow up – and sorry to bring up currency again, but I noticed that the gap between your FX effect on your sales line versus your OCI line is widening, which presumably reflects a bit more transactional hit. I just wondered if you comment, is that still mostly the yen or does the Russian ruble come in there as well?
Jacek Olczak: No, mostly in our revised guidance, the largest impact was coming from the ruble, the rupiah. The yen, as I said earlier, was $0.01. We obviously had a positive Swiss franc on the cost side, which more than offset the negative coming from the euro.
James Bushnell – Exane BNP: Sorry – I meant in terms of the transactional FX exposure that you’ve seen in Q3. Is it mostly from the yen, or is there also an impact from the ruble where I believe your costs are predominantly not in rubles, whereas your revenues are?
Jacek Olczak: No, I think it was more from the ruble. I think it was more from the ruble on the transactional side.
James Bushnell – Exane BNP: Okay, great. Thank you very much for your help.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist from Berenberg. 
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg: Hi Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg: I was hoping you could discuss in a little more detail about the tax treatment of the HeatSticks in Japan, and then perhaps in Italy as well. I was wondering if you could give us some more perspective on the tax differential, what is it driven by – it is lower rate, is it taxed by—you know, what the basis for that is, and then the ability of that tax treatment to be extended into other countries in the various regions. Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Tax treatment in Japan results that the iQOS HeatSticks will pay a tax about 20% lower than the tax on cigarettes. It’s classified in a different tax category for the reasons that it is not a cigarette and this is not combustible, so there is another level to the tax category and the Ministry of Finance has decided to classify this product there. It’s also very much similar to what has happened with the competitive product in that market – I mean Ploom from JT, which also is classified in this tax category. I can’t tell you more about Italy, about the tax classification, but as we have said also during investors’ day, I think we have a pretty strong case that this product, for various reasons, should enjoy better taxation than the combustible, conventional cigarettes. Now, how this will materialize, we’ll have to see, but this is what we, in our engagement in the various markets, took the direction which we take.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg: Okay. With respect to—again, another foreign exchange-related question. Given that that has such a material impact on the balance sheet and the ability to buy back stock, is this really implying that in 2015, the amount of buyback available to Philip Morris will be much more at the low end of what you suggested, and does that therefore imply, given your confidence in hitting kind of an 8 to 10% constant currency EPS target, that the operational component of next year perhaps looks a bit stronger?
Jacek Olczak: We had said, I think, at the investors’ day that we’re looking at the range of 2 to $3 billion for next year, but obviously the final target, final amount will depend on two factors. One is obviously the acquisitions, and second is also importantly the development on the exchange rate, which obviously with our limited headroom to further leverage the balance sheet in order to support the single-A rating, that’s something which we have to and we are watching very carefully. When we give the target in February, the target will reflect the development or potential developments on both sides, so I don’t want to go into—you know, commit to any number for next year. As I said, we will announce it in February.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: In terms of South Korea and the potential for a proposed tax increase, can you speak to the likelihood of that actually passing?
Jacek Olczak: Hi Vivien. Well, I think there is a high likelihood that the tax increase will happen. What we don’t know at this stage is the magnitude of that increase, if it’s going to be in the range of apparently 1000, 1.5 or 2001, we’ll have to see. So this is what I can tell you at this stage, and clearly it is significant, a very significant tax increase, but we also have to remember, if my memory is not wrong, that we’re approaching the tenth anniversary of no tax increase in Korea. So I think we’ll have to take this magnitude also from the perspective of when was the last time Korea had adjusted the tax rates.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: That’s fair. Thank you. Your key competitor in that market has not always priced, I think, the way that everyone would have hoped. Is there any reason to think that they would be more constructive on pricing around the tax increase?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I wouldn’t like to go into speculation.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Fair enough.
Jacek Olczak: I mean, the investment community knows that the past performance is not necessarily the best driver of the guidance for future performance, so let’s stay with this. I don’t know. I can’t tell you.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Okay, fair. In terms of platform 2, can you just confirm that it remains on track and roughly one year behind platform 1?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, yes. Nothing’s changed there.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: So would we expect a test in the coming six months?
Jacek Olczak: No, we should expect the test in 2015 to end of 2015.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: But we say that the platform too is about one year—is a year behind. As per plan, it’s behind the platform 1.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: So not even a consumer test? Because in Japan and Italy, even though you’re going to city test in the fourth quarter, didn’t you go into do some consumer testing that you spoke about at CAGNY in February?
Jacek Olczak: Vivien, we’re talking about the two levels of consumer testing. One is the consumer testing in terms of the all over test, which obviously will be done—we will be doing first; and then there’s the consumer testing in terms of launching into the selected city or close to geography. So always, we’re going in the same—we will repeat the same sequence as we have done or as we are doing so far with iQOS platform 1.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Terrific.
Jacek Olczak: So the second part of 2015.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Understood. My last question is on the FDA submission that you’re working on jointly with Altria. Any progress or updates on that? Do you have a sense of when you might actually make a formal submission to the FDA on MRTP?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think it was subject to us concluding the clinical studies and closing the entire scientific package which is to support that submission, so the clinical studies as per plan, we will be completing them in the mid of next year, second quarter next year, and then the preparation for the pack of submissions can only really start afterwards.
Vivien Azer – Cowen & Company: Very clear. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA. 
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Just turning to Indonesia, you indicated that the guidance for the category for the year would be around a 2% growth rate, which implies around a 1% decline in the quarter for 4Q. I know that the comp gets about 2 points tougher, but that’s around a 6 point deceleration. Is there anything you think that’s looming that would drive that, or is that just a conservative number? How are you thinking about the category dynamics there?
Jacek Olczak: I think we are looking at little bit on a longer time span, not just the quarters. As I indicated in my remarks on the 12-month moving basis, the market is in a 2.4% decline. I think the 2% sounds to us—seems more realistic for the full year. Maybe it’s going to come a little bit better. I have to admit that Q3 came better than we expected, so that we recognize by changing a little bit—changing the outlook for the full year. The market may come better because there’s not much in headwinds which I can see in the market – actually, quite opposite because as long as nothing is dramatically changing in terms of drivers of the bit lower performance last year, i.e. fuel subsidies or removal of partial fuel subsidies. I think there was spikes in food inflation. I think that these things are slowing coming behind us, so maybe the market can even do better. But let’s see. I think 2% is about to be realistic, the realistic number as we see it at this stage.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Okay, that’s helpful. You had said that your July share was just over 35%, and you came in the full quarter at 35.5. Was that a sequential progression, so you would have finished the quarter maybe around 36%, and could you give any sense of how that’s continued into 4Q or for September?
Jacek Olczak: There was sequential growth of share in Indonesia, quarter-on-quarter and also within the month. This is very much driven by the fact that Dji Sam Soe competitors, main competitors of Dji Sam Soe have crossed the critical price point of Rp12,000 per pack, and as we expect at this moment that Dji Sam Soe will compete with the brands without this obstacle, if you like, of the psychological price point. We should observe the better performance, and Dji Sam Soe is coming actually now flat on the third quarter and year-on-year, so we stabilized the brand. Obviously our entry with extending the brand into machine-made kretek, both on full flavor and lighter variants, helped a lot, so this is very good.  So yes, we’re growing sequentially there, and I think we should expect this going through the year, although I think for still on a full-year basis we will be below our market share of the last year. But I think it’s a very nice starting point which we’re building already now into 2015.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: And what is the mix impact from that? Obviously you’ve lost the low-end brands and that would seem to be a benefit. Certainly the hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe pressure would offset some of that, but if that’s stabilizing, is your mix a positive benefit now or is that still pressured?
Jacek Olczak: There is. I don’t think it’s that much of—I mean, there is some mix pressure, but you have to remember that there’s a different tax level also behind the different price points and the different category of the product, so the margin differential is not necessarily fully translated. It can’t be fully translated just from the retail price perspective.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Okay, great – yeah, thank you. Then just on iQOS, you have the unit price that you mentioned. Does that have any flexibility in terms of the launch period, just for discounting or anything that—you know, obviously you want to get people to try this or get it in people’s hands. Certainly for a premium product, I’ve seen that pricing approach, but what’s the right way to think about adoption and how to make sure that’s not a prohibitive cost for people to think about up front?
Jacek Olczak: By the regulatory ramifications which we have in Japan, we cannot have a discount on the HeatSticks, on the Marlboro HeatSticks.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Oh no, sorry – I didn’t mean the HeatStick, I mean the iQOS unit itself.
Jacek Olczak: It is an introductory price, and the whole offering, the introductory offering to the consumer, which will be going for the iQOS heating device, tobacco heating device.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: So you do have room to put incentives on that?
Jacek Olczak: Sorry?
Michael Lavery – CLSA: You do have flexibility to how you price that in terms of just getting it adopted initially? I think you said it’s the ¥69.80, that’s the sort of list price, I guess, and you could work off of that to have an upfront discount or something?
Jacek Olczak: Absolutely correct. You’re reading this like you would be in Nagoya.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Okay, great. Thank you. Then just one last question on lower oil prices. I know certainly in Indonesia last year, we saw consumer sensitivity to inflation there. Obviously every country is different, but very broadly speaking with the big move in oil, do you feel like that’s potentially a net consumer benefit enough to impact any volume outlook? Obviously it hasn’t—it’s a recent move and it hasn’t stuck for a long time necessarily, but is that potentially a positive in terms of how you just look ahead for the next three, six, nine, 12 months?
Jacek Olczak: I think it is positive. I think we all would like to have oil lower, right, at lower prices, especially Indonesia where the market, its consumers are more sensitive. Yes – I mean, that is the right direction, hence as I said earlier that it might be that the volumes in Indonesia will do a bit better than the 2% for the full year. I mean, let’s see how this develops, but it’s positive, you’re absolutely right.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett from Nomura.
Owen Bennett – Nomura: Good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Owen Bennett – Nomura: Just one from me. I was just wondering the pricing benefit from the change in business structure in Egypt. I was wondering if you could quantify this, and can we expect this to drop off into next year when it laps?
Jacek Olczak: Well, the benefit is coming from in the past or in the year 2013, what we—the way we operated our structure in Egypt was that we’d been selling just the materials, the components, i.e. tobacco (indiscernible), et cetera. The manufacturing was taking place outside Philip Morris by the partners in Egypt. As of this year, we’re fully owning the entire approach, fully owning the entire process, and we recognize the full cost of manufacturing, so this is all materials plus the conversion, et cetera, but also correspondingly we recognize the full revenue, i.e. the price which we’re charging to the first customer. The impact of Egypt, of this accounting or reporting reflecting business structure, is in the range—at the top line at the revenue in a range of about $200 million. This is obviously the business organic growth which we are realizing this year, which is coming on top of this. But this is how much Egypt is pushing or increasing our revenue, but you also remember you have an offset in the cost base. So when it comes to OCI, the net benefit which we’re realizing due to the structure is not really inflating the numbers between the two years. But there is organic growth in Egypt.
Owen Bennett – Nomura: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one final question today. Your last question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman – Citi: Hello, thank you for taking the question. I hope I can ask a question about 2015 and ’16, because you mentioned this in your press release. In it, you say and reiterate that you to hope to achieve 6 to 8% OCI growth constant currency, but you also mention the costs of the expansion of Reduced Risk products. So the question is in the context of your entire OCI, is the commercial cost of the—the cost of commercializing Reduced Risk products material? I assume it is, and I assume that it’s going to be one or two percentage points, otherwise you wouldn’t have bothered mentioning it in your press release. That’s the question – thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Yes, (indiscernible). Yes, there is an increased cost of iQOS which is already included in our overall target for the next year. Obviously when we come in February, we will give the proper detailed guidance for the year, but from the very beginning we said that we’re targeting 6 to 8% adjusted OCI growth ex-currency in 2015 and ’16, and this number includes the cost, also obviously in the later part of this period, the revenue coming from iQOS. So this is all included there, and there will be quite an increase or a substantial increase of our spending behind iQOS next year, but this number is included in our target.
Adam Spielman – Citi: Okay, but just to confirm, it is a material amount that is included?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, but I will not disclose—
Adam Spielman – Citi: How material – I knew you wouldn’t do that, but that’s clear. Thank you very much. It’s helpful.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now turn the call back over to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you do have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team. We’re currently here in Switzerland. Thank you again, and have a wonderful day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, Sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 second quarter results. You may access the release on our Web site at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the second quarter 2014, and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today’s Webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Please note that reduced-risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use for products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As we expected, we achieved strong results in the second quarter, driven by a lower cigarette volume decline of 2.7% and a solid pricing variance of $494 million. As a result, net revenues, excluding currency, increased by 4.5%, and adjusted OCI was up by 9.5% on the same basis. Both the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions had a very strong quarter, with adjusted OCI growing by 28.8% and 27.1%, respectively, excluding currency. Furthermore, the EU Region achieved a 3.3% increase in adjusted OCI, excluding currency, despite the adverse pricing impact in Italy. The results in the Asia Region, meanwhile, continued to be impacted by challenges in specific markets, although we are making progress in dealing with them. Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 20% to $1.56 per share. This was driven by our strong business results and a relatively easy comparison with the same quarter last year. For the first half of the year, our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 12.4% to $2.91. However, we will face much more challenging comparisons during the second half of the year and in particular during the fourth quarter. In the second half, we will make investments behind the commercialization of reduced-risk products, roll out Marlboro Red 2.0 and incur some underlying costs related to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Overall, our spending this year is skewed towards the second half. As a result, we’re anticipating a lower EPS growth, excluding currency, for the second half of this year. As we announced at our Investor Day in June and reaffirmed today, our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at prevailing exchange rates, is in a range of $4.87 to $4.97, versus $5.26 in 2013. Our guidance continues to include approximately $0.61 per share of unfavorable currency, at prevailing exchange rates; an after-tax charge of $0.24 per share recorded as asset impairment and exit costs in the second quarter related to the discontinuation of cigarette production in the Netherlands in 2014; and the $0.01 per share charge recorded in the first quarter relating to the decision to end production in Australia. Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency and these restructuring charges, of approximately 6% to 8%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013. As stated in June, given the down-trading and heavy price discounting in Australia, in combination with plain packaging, we anticipate that this could result in our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS being at the lower end of this range. Let me now provide you with an update on key markets, starting with the challenges we face this year in a number of Asian markets and the progress we’re making in addressing them. In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 14.4% in the quarter as the trade de-stocked following the April 1st tax-driven price increases. Our shipment volume decreased by 16.4%, reflecting the overall market decline and our lower market share. On a June year-to-date basis, industry volume declined by 2.8%. As expected, our market share in Japan rebounded during the second quarter, reaching 26.4%, following our 25.5% share in the first quarter when the trade built up higher inventory levels of competitive products. Adjusting for trade inventory movements, we estimate our share in the quarter was 25.8%, indicating that the process of stabilizing our market share is under way, and we believe that our share should level out during the second half, a period during which we plan a number of new product launches, including Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth-tasting, regular-to-menthol capsule product. In Indonesia, we witnessed a rebound in cigarette industry volume, with a second-quarter increase of 4.9%, which brought the first half of the year to a 2% growth rate. We are currently maintaining our forecast for the full-year of market growth of up to 1%. Our market share increased sequentially from 34.6% in the first quarter to 34.9% in the second quarter, though it was below the last year’s level of 36.1%. While the unfavorable trends in the hand-rolled kretek segment continued to impact our overall share performance, the decline moderated, and we achieved strong share progression in the machine-made kretek segment. This was helped by the April launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue, which reached a quarterly share of 0.6%. We expect this sequential improvement to continue during the second half of this year. Total estimated tax-paid cigarette industry volume in the Philippines declined by 13.4% during the second quarter, while consumption levels remained resilient, as measured by adult smoking incidence and daily consumption. The drop in tax-paid industry volume reflects the fact that Mighty Corporation’s tax-paid volume was down by around 40%. In contrast, we estimate that its total sales volume, both tax-paid and non-tax-paid, increased by about 20%. PMI’s share of the tax-paid market increased to 85.9% during the second quarter, representing an increase of 3.4 share points, driven mainly by Marlboro and Fortune. The pressure on Mighty Corporation continues and we hope that the introduction of tax stickers, now expected in August, will reduce its ability to avoid paying excise taxes and VAT. Let me now move to Australia, where the combination of a certain commoditization of the market, induced by plain packaging, large excise tax increases, and heavy price discounting, particularly at the bottom of the market, has accelerated down-trading to lower price, lower margin brands, or even illicit products. The super-low price segment has grown from 6.3% in 2011 to 28.3% in the first half of this year, when the effective price gap between a premium brand, such as Marlboro, and a super-low price brand, such as Bond Street, widened to about AUD$1 per pack of 25 cigarettes, or about 36%. This compares to a gap of about 26% in 2011. Our market share averaged 37.7% in the period 2011 through 2013, but came under significant pressure from competitive discounting in the first quarter of 2014, when it dropped to 32.9%. We responded with increased investments in tactical price discounts for choice and Bond Street in order to regain our market position. As a result, in the second quarter, we increased our segment shares in the low and super-low price segments from 31.4% and 11.2% last year to 36.8% and 14.5%, respectively. However, the combination of increased price discounts and volume/mix deterioration due to the down-trading is impacting our profitability in Australia this year Let me now turn to the EEMA Region, starting with Russia where our strong and diverse brand portfolio is driving market share gains and enabling us to increase prices. On a May quarter-to-date basis, our market share increased by 0.9 share points to 26.8%, thanks to premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street. We estimate that cigarette industry volume declined by around 10% during the second quarter. This was driven by price increases averaging some 25% year-on-year, an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade and the weakening economy. As you know, we announced in May a further price increase of RUB$4 per pack across most of our portfolio. This should impact adult smokers later this month and, along with the implementation of the restrictions on public smoking that were introduced in June this year, is expected to result in a full-year decline of between 9% and 11% in cigarette industry volume. In Turkey, cigarette industry volume increased by an estimated 2.5% in the second quarter and was slightly up June year-to-date. A stable underlying trend is expected during the second half of the year, despite a mid-year upward adjustment in the specific and minimum excise tax of 5.1%. We increased the prices of our low and super-low price portfolio, Bond Street, Chesterfield, Lark and L&M, by TRY$0.50 per pack. Our May quarter-to-date market share was marginally lower at 44.6%. However, the premium brands’ share of our portfolio increased, driven by the 1.2 share points gained by Parliament, which reached a record market share of 10.8%. Let me now turn to the EU Region, where June cigarette industry volume was stronger than expected and included a favorable inventory variance. Cigarette industry volume declined by just 1.2% in the second quarter and by 3.4% in the first half, compared to a 9.3% decrease during the same period last year. The improvement in cigarette industry volume trends has taken place despite persistently high unemployment levels. We attribute the moderation to a slight decline in illicit trade, a slow-down in the growth of e-vapor products in many markets, relatively less out-switching to fine cut products, and some trade inventory movements. We should also remember that the comparison with 2013 was easier in the first half of this year and, in addition, we’ve recently implemented or announced price increases in Germany, Portugal and Spain. Consequently, we’re expecting the full-year decline in the EU Region to be approximately 5%, which is a more modest rate of decline than the one forecast in June and a marked improvement on the 7.4% decline that occurred during 2013. We continue to outperform the industry in the EU Region. Our Regional market share increased by 0.9 share points in the second quarter to 40.4%. We achieved share growth in five of the six largest markets in the Region and expect our positive momentum to continue throughout the year. Absent trade inventory movements, our market share would also have been up in Germany. Our strong share performance is based on the strength of our key international brands. Marlboro remained resilient with a 19.4% regional share, despite the continued weak macro-economic environment. L&M grew by 0.3 share points to 7.2%, driven by an outstanding performance in Germany and continued share gains in Poland. Chesterfield performed particularly well, gaining 1.4 share points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 5.8%. Its market share has grown very rapidly since we repositioned the brand in Italy and it has also benefited from geographic expansion. On a June year-to-date basis, our cigarette volume in the EU Region was essentially stable at 91.6 billion units. This was the key driver of the improvement in our adjusted OCI, excluding currency, during the first half of the year. Our pricing variance, on the other hand, was lower than in recent years, mainly driven by Italy, where we remain cautiously optimistic that the government will implement excise tax reform. In the second quarter, we increased our market share in Italy by the 2 share points to reach 55.3%, as Chesterfield, which was repositioned in February to the super-low price segment, achieved a 10% overall market share, up by 6.5 share points, although with lower unit margins, while Marlboro’s share declined 0.8 share points to 25%. On a global basis, pricing remained the key driver of our higher adjusted OCI during the second quarter. Our pricing variance reached $494 million in the quarter and $900 million in the first half, broadly in line with our annual historical average of $1.8 billion. Our strong second quarter pricing variance was led by Indonesia and Russia, but was partially offset by an unfavorable pricing variances in Italy and the Philippines. We achieved a 2.1 point improvement in PMI’s adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding currency, in the second quarter, driven by pricing and helped by the timing of costs. Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the second quarter of 2014 increased by 0.2 points to 37.3%. Marlboro is one of the key drivers of our favorable market share momentum. During the second quarter, Marlboro progressed to reach an international market share of 9.2%, excluding China. It gained share in three out of our four regions, with a particularly strong performance in the EEMA region. The decline in the Asia region was mainly attributable to Japan. We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.4%, which puts us at the upper end of the range of our peer groups. During the second quarter, we spent $1 billion to repurchase 11.6 million shares at an average price of $86.13 and continue to target spending of $4 billion during the full-year of 2014. In conclusion, the second quarter was financially a strong one, helped by a favorable comparison with last year and hindered by some ongoing challenges in the Asia region. The results in the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions were particularly strong, driven mainly by pricing, while better volume trends in the EU region enabled us to increase regional adjusted OCI, excluding currency. Our business fundamentals are solid, although the comparisons are expected to be more challenging during the next two quarters. We will make investments behind the commercialization of reduced-risk products, roll out Marlboro Red 2.0, incur some underlying costs related to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint, and, overall, our spending this year is skewed towards the second half. This is already reflected in our EPS guidance and we remain confident in our ability to achieve a growth rate in adjusted diluted EPS of 6% to 8%, excluding currency, for the full-year 2014. Thank you. I’ll now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: A couple of things. First of all, I realize you haven’t changed your outlook for the year, but the second quarter come in higher than the internal plan or was this what you more or less had envisioned?
Jacek Olczak: No, this came as per our plan. We knew and we have highlighted at the beginning of the year that we expect particularly strong quarter, partly driven by the comps, as you remember the growth rate in the second quarter of last year was 0.7% on EPS level ex-currency. So it was not really challenging comp which we’re facing, but also we knew that we will expect some continuous step-by-step improvements in the key markets where which we try to address this year. So you had the EU, Japan, Philippines, etcetera. So this all was baked in, so it came as expected.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly, two of your three major international competitors intend to make fairly sizeable investments in the U.S cigarette market to conventional cigarette market, and I’m just curious you obviously exited that market, but did their actions cause you to rethink at all the attraction and/or the risk of the U.S?
Jacek Olczak: Well, not really. I think we will make it very clear that the reasons are well-known, why we focus on an international market. We’re not looking in a conventional business at the U.S. I think our plans are very clear that, yes we do see U.S on the -- from the perspective of the reduced-risk products, but as the separate part of this strategy. So when it comes to the conventional cigarette, cigarette markets I don’t really see any impact in terms of our thinking of that transaction, which was I believe announced yesterday.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Thank you. Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi. Good morning, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: So a couple of questions. First, in the EU region, obviously you had called out the pricing variance being negatively impacted by the price reposition in Italy. So just wondering, number one, can you just quantify the Italy impact and whether the underlying -- the other market, the pricing variance has also slowed and then you’ve taken some pricing in some of the European markets, so would you expect pricing variance in the back half or EU to be much stronger?
Jacek Olczak: On Italy I think the Chesterfield repositioning obviously generated some negative pricing variance on the Italian market, but this is largely offset by the volume gains. So I think Italy is more of a question of the VAT absorption which we still have since the end of the last year and this is causing the negative pricing variance. And this is very much linked to the way to discuss or debate in Italy, the tax restructuring. Italy to quantify -- the total pricing variance for Italy would be in a range on the year-to-date basis, you’re talking in the range of about $100 million. But as I said, it’s more the higher component is the VAT absorption, just the repositioning of the Chesterfield, because you pick it up at the revenue level for the volume -- positive volume variance.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Right. Okay. And then, other markets where you’re taking -- have taken more pricing so, broadly speaking if you take total EU in the back half pricing variance would accelerate more meaningfully?
Jacek Olczak: Well, just to conclude in Italy, if you would add to the pricing variance on the EU the negative coming from Italy, the EU would have already a pretty decent pricing variance for the first half of the year, okay, because Italy really depressed the pricing variance for the entire region. And I think overall for the PMI, the pricing variance is about equally spread between half of the years -- of the year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Got it, okay. And then the second question is relating to the situation in Australia and wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of what actions you’ve actually taken already in that market and whether there more actions to come in the back half and just if you’re detecting any sort of competitive responses now that you’ve responded to the competitive behavior in that market.
Jacek Olczak: Well, what we did in Australia is as of the end of the first quarter essentially we will have increased some promotional spending -- price promotional spending behind mainly two brands, Choice and Bond Street, which are the brands, which are competing in a low-price segment. In other parts of the low price segment and they’re being challenged by the discount segment or the lower part of the segment. So that investment there and our actions around this when we try to regain the competitiveness when it comes to the price point versus the key competitive brands. This is a free pricing in Australia, so the situation is pretty dynamic, and you appreciate that I cannot comment on any future price moves, but this is a price discounting situation when the price is being set individually by the key account by trade channel, by territory etcetera. So I mean, that situations may change and may turn -- may change pretty rapidly. So we will have to see. I mean, I think our share reacted as expected. We would have gain the share, especially behind this brands in the second quarter. As you remember, we lost some share significantly, some share in the first quarter. So, so far that part of the strategy works. Now well let’s see how the situation will prevail. I think what is maybe important to say that you’ve some brands already in the market discounted in the low price segment there to the level that they essentially yield about zero margin, okay. So I think once it reach that point, I think a fair question to ask is, isn’t that the moment when the logic should start prevailing while you start to balancing your profit versus volume objective.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Right, okay. Got it. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: I just had two questions for you, if I could. The first would be, if you look at the EU, the first half benefiting from some inventory movements. How much of that reverses in the second half of the year? I guess, with the volumes being much stronger so far, do you have to see -- sort of a major inventory reductions occurring in the second half of the year?
Jacek Olczak: Small component, I think it was mainly in Germany, but you’re not talking about the very important component. So yes, there will be obviously some reversal in Q3. But I don’t think it would change our outlook when it comes for the full-year. Hence as you noticed, we have revised shortly after Investors Day while now having a full June data, we’ve revised our total industry outlook for the year to the 5%. So again, obviously that some inventory movements between the quarters.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just another question for you, if I could on Japan, which is that obviously the share of shipments was up in the quarter, but it also was distorted by inventory movements. I’m just curious like what’s -- is there a better metric or better measure for the ongoing share, if you will, in Japan this quarter 26.4%, is that sustainable or …?
Jacek Olczak: The way we’re tracking the performance, we look at retail off take at some key to change there, so -- but the share performance there is somehow reflecting the trend with sequential trends which we see on our adjusted churn. So we start -- we see the stabilization of the share over the last three quarters, maybe 0.1 down sequentially Q2 versus Q1, but it is all pointing to what we expected in the second half of the year, we should essentially have Japan share pressure behind this.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thanks for your time.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you very much.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities: My first question is on the Philippines. So despite progress being made with the tax underpayment issue by your main competitor, the market was still down quite a bit in the second quarter. Now how do you see this playing out for the rest of the year and when should we expect the market to stabilize? Then also do you think the tax stamps coming in? I think it sounds like in August now -- will fix or address the bulk of these problems?
Jacek Olczak: The market -- we have to be cautious when we talk about the total market size in Philippines, because we essentially have a better visibility on a tax paid market rather on a total market. Therefore, I think also in our slides we’re using the data on the consumption, the smoking incidence in a daily consumption, which gives a better feel what is happening for the total market covering both tax paid, non-tax paid. I think there was the distortion coming a little bit from what has happened in Q2 last year with the Mighty supplying the market and the Mighty level of supplying the market in the second quarter of this year. Hence you had a 14% decline. When it comes to second question, I think the tax stickers implementation is an important step in the whole portfolio of the steps which we wish the government should have already taken to address that issue. I don’t think tax stamps is the only element which is going to address that issue. I mean, as you know when we’re dealing with an under declaration, I mean you need to obviously demonstrate the same diligence and the vigilance when it comes to all the things that tax stickers etcetera. But we’re very pleased that this is coming to its fruition, to its realization, and I think it’s going to help in overall addressing the situation.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, that's helpful. Then I do have a second question on Russia. Could you give us a little more color on how Marlboro is performing in that country? And then in light of the price increases you took, could you talk about where price gaps are now? And are you seeing any changes in the consumer behaviors given the increases and then possibly from some of the smoking bans?
Jacek Olczak: Well, when it comes to the price gaps because Russia essentially is having price increases, the same absolute amount per pack across the price segment. So, it’s not much change over price gaps -- price gaps in absolute terms, but obviously the price gaps in the relative terms tend to close. When it comes to consumer reaction, the price increase which we announced in May, as I said in my remarks we’ll kick the market around this time early August. So we will have to wait a month or so to have the reading how consumers -- what is the reaction of consumers. I think we shouldn’t our outlook for the market, total market size for this year. I think there is a 9% to 11% range of decline for this year is valid which factored in the impact of the two price increases this year, and also in this forecast it’s factored in the impact from smoking restriction in public places.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thank you, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Bonnie.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Hello, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Good morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, following on in Russia. I was just wondering if you could confirm that you’re still seeing substantial up-trading, as it looks like Bond Street was actually taking a bit more share, say, relative to Parliament. And then related to that, I was wondering two things, if you're -- what you’re estimating is the effect from the greater smoking restrictions or is that going to be relatively modest? And how are you characterizing the risk of a greater tax increase than in the current rolling through your plan, say in next year or in 2016?
Jacek Olczak: Up-trading in Russia, and because you’re talking about the market which has a relatively high -- absolutely in the relative price gaps. So the up-trading is better -- you’ll see up-trading better when it comes to the two segments next to each other. And I think you’ll still see up-trading in the market. So it’s not straight up-trading from the lower price product going to the premium product, but in the segments next to each other I think you’ll see some uptick in the volume. Hence the performance of the Parliament and also performance in the -- of our brands. I mean usually our brands will tend to occupy the upper part of each respective segment. The smoking ban, I would say like there’s -- I mean we have experience in other markets from implementation of a similar regulations, similar restrictions. Yes, you’ll have some impact at the beginning, usually it comes to the moderation later on when consumer adjusts to the new consumption pattern or accommodate the fact there might be places or occasions when they cannot really smoke. As I said this is all factored in our 9% to 11% forecast for the total volume decline. And the key driver behind this 9% to 11% is that, price increases on the back of excise increases which we’re taking this year. So, most of this 9% to 11% is the elasticity driven impact on the total market rather than accounting from a smoking restriction. And the third part of your question, we have now the second year where Russia is dealing or the Russian government is approaching the taxation of the cigarette market through this three year plan. Every year the rates are getting reconfirmed around November I think in their legislative process, I mean do mind the Cabinet. Every year they reconfirm the next two years, and they bring a rate for the third year in that plan is a rolling over plan. So we’ll see how they reconfirm the rate this year. I mean, so far the government was very pragmatic in setting this rate, on one hand balancing -- they desire to increase the tax level, but on the other hand recognizing the unintended consequences namely the illicit trade which they wouldn’t like to have in that market, quite right. So, I mean so far, I don’t see anything which would change my opinion why the Russian Government should not act pragmatically this time. But let’s see, I mean we’ll have to wait until November.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Okay, thank you. And then just a short follow-on on Australia. Where do you see the low and super low price segments stabilizing as a percentage of the market? Are we looking at those continuing to rise over time or do you think that they will kind of reach a natural ceiling and then stabilize?
Jacek Olczak: Well, the prices in Australia overall the cigarette prices in Australia are pretty high. But I haven’t seen that in other markets of the comparable maturity when the lower, super low price segment will take it all. I mean there is always medium segment, there’s always a premium segment. Usually the markets may go into polarization, so it’s more the questions of the medium brand slowly being eroded by the low, super low price segment and the premium somehow holds its position. I mean, obviously in Australia we’ll have to take it for the lances of the plain packaging and some equity presumably erosion of the brands. But I don’t think it’s a 0-1 game. I don’t think the whole market is going to go through the discount segment.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas: Hi, thanks and good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas: I have, firstly, a question on Europe, please. Firstly, could you give a bit more detail on the price increase in Germany? I think previously you raised prices and then pulled one, so just how much is that and does it differ by brand at all? And also, what do you see as the outlook for pricing in Europe as we go through the rest of the year? Here, you have outlined that Italy is the drag, but what about elsewhere? Would we expect that to improve in H2?
Jacek Olczak: In Germany the price increase was on average €0.20 per pack. As you remember Germany has various stick counts for per pack sizes, the pack of 19’s and the larger packs, boxes. So per pack, individual SKU the price might be slightly different. But on average its €0.20 across the portfolio in Marlboro to the low priced -- lower priced L&M and Chesterfield. When it comes to pricing, in Europe again I think we should look a little bit at the pricing in Europe excluding Italy, because Italy is really dragging the price in Europe low. And I said earlier answer I think one of the questions that the pricing impact of Italy is in the range of about -- in the tune to $100 million for the first six months of this year, and that’s significant. You will add it back to the realized pricing and you’ll see that the pricing in Europe is not as being perceived by some that we’re falling a little bit behind. I mean in all other markets the pricing was taking -- a lot of pricing was taking at the beginning of the year usually around the tax rate increases that is especially the case in Central Europe, Poland. I said on the -- during the remarks today we recently took also the pricing in Portugal, in Spain. So, I think the pricing in Europe would have to take a little bit of different view on Italy and the rest, because the rest of Europe in my opinion is not looking as low as one could see.
James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas: Okay, thank you. And just to come back on the Germany price increase. Do I see now that that’s slightly different to your previous increase that was then pulled back in terms of price caps between different size packs or is it the same?
Jacek Olczak: No. I think -- no, I think it’s the same with the same principal. Okay, so sorry I don’t want to say its 100% the same because maybe there was some completely irrelevant fine tuning on one or two SKUs by the same principal, its €0.20 across the board on average.
James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas: Okay, thank you. And my second question was just on Korea. What from your perspective is the likelihood of a tax raise anytime soon? If it is an 80% rise in average prices which is one of the proposals that we’ve had, do you think that would still be good news after any short-term disruption?
Jacek Olczak: Well taking into considerations that no one almost remembers when Korea had raised the tax last time. I think this would be a good news, but we’ll have to see how it unfolds. I mean, we’ve heard in the past also some rumors or some initiatives even to raise the taxes in Korea and this has not materialized. So, I think myself, I’m more cautious about when Korea will have a tax increase. Well we’ll have to see.
James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Hello.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Just a few question’s on Indonesia. I'm curious with the 2% first half category growth what -- and with the easier comparisons in the back half, why you expect the deceleration to -- second half basically flat to give the 1% category growth. Is there some kind of headwind here you expect or consumer pressure or how do you see that unfolding?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean we see so at the beginning of the year, first half of the year some deceleration in the GDP growth. So we’re always looking at the macros in order to feel more comfortable with the total industry outlook. But I agree that 2% year-to-date growth rate for the market versus our forecast of 1%, one could say that there is a potential for an upside. And I would have to confront, there is a potential for an upside. I think I need one more quarter or at least one or two more months to reconfirm that Indonesia is moving to -- the total market is moving to the better growth rate. I mean its good news for us, but I think it was very clear in the remarks that despite the fact that the market is year-to-date 2% we still think for the 1% growth for the full-year.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Then just looking at your market share, you've got the 60 basis point decline in Dji Sam Soe and the 60 basis points share from Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue, so obviously that nets to zero. And you've got the increase over 1 point in U Mild, only slightly offset by Marlboro, but your total share is down over 1 point. So how do we reconcile that as Dji Sam Soe Magnum, the non-Blue down pretty significantly?
Jacek Olczak: No, Dji Sam Soe in the machine made both Dji Sam Soe Magnum and the Magnum Blue in the machine made segment it’s actually growing as expected very nicely. So, increasing our share in this, in the machine made part of the market. Dji Sam Soe in the hand-rolled version, the challenge is, under one hand this consumer is going to the machine made but the prime challenge which the brand faces this year is the price point, well as you see it’s above the round price point while the competitors are approaching, but its still technically slightly below that price point. So I think in Q3 we should see that sort of a headwind for the Dji Sam Soe to being removed. And one more comment if I may, when you look at the Marlboro share in Indonesia, this is all weighted to the total market, right by the white cigarettes market, a non-kretek market and a kretek market are not necessarily highly interlinked markets which in the one cigarette market. So, I mean you’ll have sometimes the fluctuations on a Marlboro share just because the total market growth which happened last quarter came obviously for the kretek as the main driver. So the rate of the kretek market will sometimes give you fluctuations on a Marlboro share.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: That's helpful, thanks. And then on the hand-rolled price points, have you seen a better balance in how the competition looks. I know some of those have crossed the same (indiscernible) mark, but it's a little scattered sort of regionally or by channels and things like that. So, is that looking like that's more consistent now across the competition?
Jacek Olczak: No, this is as we’ve predicted that there will be a -- there’s a time needed when in a pricing [ph] [stats] in the region by region etcetera, these brands or the SKUs will go in across this price point. So some have already reached, crossed, some are still hanging slightly below. I think the Q3, as we predicted initially is about the time when the Dji Sam Soe should have that price point pressure behind the (indiscernible) or in front.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, now that's great. And then just last question on Indonesia, as you’ve mentioned in the release how the optimizing production was -- contributed higher costs, but certainly it seems like if you're optimizing production that would be a better cost profile. So, is it right to assume those are one-time and how significant was that and is that behind you now?
Jacek Olczak: Well Indonesia is optimization or production is essentially to manage the capacity between hand-rolled capacity and the machine made capacity. So, it’s a little bit different that optimizations which we undertook in Australia and in Holland, in Bergen op Zoom. Yes, that’s it. So they’ll have some cost associated with managing the hand-rolled capacity not transforming the hand-rolled to July capacity into machine made capacity.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Well, I guess, I'm just trying to understand what that is. Do you have an ongoing cost, like do you just have idle factories of people making hand-rolled that aren't producing – I mean, what’s the cost that hit in this quarter, is it a one-time plant closure cost or is it something ongoing?
Jacek Olczak: Well these are the costs associated with the down siding. So they don’t really qualify into reporting adjustments therefore we have not carried out in our reconciliation from a reported to adjusted result, they sit in our underlying numbers. But the cost is essentially about what we need to unfortunately the results were the termination of the employment of hand-rollers and there are smaller and creating a capacity on the machine in the factories which are producing machine made cigarettes.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, now that’s helpful. So even if we keep it in the adjusted number, can you give any sense of what the magnitude is in terms of how to think about the comparison next year?
Jacek Olczak: No, but what we’ve done is, if you remember not in the case of Indonesia but if you remember in Q1 of this year we have said that our cost associated with the closure of the plant in Australia would be $0.03 out of $0.01 was recorded in Q1 which was reporting adjustment and the $0.02 which will pick up later on, but not as reporting adjustment. Now I will have a boss, which also I’m incurring some costs which do not qualify by U.S GAAP rules as the reporting adjustments. I will incur this cost this year in order to complete this project. So, in total if I take all the projects together in my underlying results, you’re talking about the $0.02 to $0.04 which I associated with the cost of a closure or adjusting the -- or factoring the footprint and the capacity optimization.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful.
Jacek Olczak: (Indiscernible) underlying. This is not part of the reporting adjustment.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Right, Okay. And then just on the Netherlands plant closure, that scales if I believe for September 1st, if that goes as planned some of that benefit would come in fourth quarter of this year, correct?
Jacek Olczak: Very small, I don’t think -- no, this will not be material, because you’ll need to take September 1, with the location of the production. You obviously having rent rates, in the meantime which we already produce etcetera. So this will not materially impact this. (Indiscernible) pick up the full impact of boss of a better (indiscernible) some restructuring next year 2015.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: So it would lag even if the plant is closed for three or four months later this year. There wouldn’t be a savings benefit really in 2014?
Jacek Olczak: No, but I will have as I mentioned before I will have also some cost associated with the closure of that plant which I mean my underlying results, the net of this project you will not see the material impact of that thing. Actually I will be more out weighted on the cost than the benefit which I may pick up for the literally few weeks of this year.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, now that’s helpful, thanks. And then, I know Australia has been covered a bit, but just one last question there if we can. Can you just help us understand some of the dynamics? It seemed like even with plain packaging coming in, this didn't -- there wasn’t any real issue over the first kind of 13 months during last year and when it started in December. And now certainly it looks like it's a different picture in 2014. What started all this? I mean what was kind of the trigger that made the issues for you become something you would call out and is it directly related to plain packaging, value brand erosion happening maybe more quickly than people might have thought or can you just explain some of those -- kind of what started all this?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean what started, when I start discounting was much earlier in the market in plain packaging. So, the market always was correct arising by some level of a discounting when people were essentially buying down the price for a consumer at the retail level. What we have observed that towards the end of the last year frankly speaking, there was an increased discounting activity by some of our competitors. So, when we look at our share erosions which I think was pretty visible in the first quarter I mean it was obvious decision that we had to react, stay competitive and not allow the shares to further decline. So yes, there is obviously the element of the plain packing in the whole thing, but I think we couldn’t just attribute the current situation entirely to plain packaging but plain packaging clearly but the fact that somebody took away your trademarks, erodes the equity of my brand. I mean, erodes the equity of my product. So there is an element of the thing, how much you would attribute to this, I mean it’s difficult to say at this stage. You cannot ignore it, but this is not the only element which was, which is happening there. This is all in the context of very significant tax increase which took historically in the last year and also will happen this year in the market, because last year September you had 12.5% extra tax increase – excise tax increase. We in September of this year we will have another 12.5% additional excise tax increase. I mean that obviously makes the end of year after, so it makes the significant price -- it drives to the significant price increases. And obviously as the market already had the cigarettes at the price of average of about $17 per the pack of 25 of the 25 cigarettes, you’ll have a natural sort of a tendency to go into the down-trading which can be further fueled if you active discounting, because you open the gap. Maybe if you look at the market and you realize that the price gaps are in the range of $6 to $8, I mean that’s the price level per pack in many other markets. And in Australia we have the price gaps of that margin issue, obviously because the underlying prices per pack are already pretty high. But $6 or $8 sort of the erosion in the mix is already pretty significant.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.
Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, good morning.
Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management: And just a quick one, I’m just wondering on the EEMA top-line performance, how much of this was driven by the change in Egypt business structure? How long will this benefit continue before it lapse or was it more a one-off influence in the quarter? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. There was an impact of that in Egypt obviously because of the business structure but there was an underlying growth in Egypt and the entire, very strong quarter for the region very much driven by the price came not only from Russia but came from North Africa, some other markets in Egypt. Egypt played the critical role, but this is in addition of us now reporting Egypt the difference due to the business structure change this year.
Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: In terms of the improvement in the EU, I appreciate fully that you are waiting to get the full June results before you have the confidence to raise your guidance for the region. I was curious if you could speak to the sequential trends through the quarter, and if there was any one or two key markets that really kind of drove the improved outlook relative to what you had offered at your Analyst Day?
Jacek Olczak: Just to clarify, we’re not giving guidance at the segment level Vivien, so we’re giving an outlook when it comes to total market, right?
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: Certainly, yes.
Jacek Olczak: But that’s -- no, I mean we’ll look at the June results. I mean the markets which we -- I mean all of the market essentially confirmed what we’ve seen over the last five, six, seven months depending on the market trends. If you look at the total market trend they are three markets which are today somehow lagging behind in terms of declined rate should be better i.e. lower than the entire region. One of this market is, France. So we have to watch it, but I don’t think its going to change dramatically total EU picture. And the two other markets they are relatively smaller market, is Greece and Hungary. So, I have three markets which I wish would follow the trend line of the rest of the region. But even in absence of this I think EU as we announced today in my remarks EU outlook for the full year is close it’s around 5% and its based on the sequential improvements which we saw.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: Excellent. Well, that’s certainly good news. Just a follow-up quickly on Indonesia, I appreciate why you’re holding your guidance I think that makes a lot of sense. I was curious whether embedded in that was an outlook for any change in the fuel subsidy, I know we’re still waiting to see how the presidential election unfolds as they count the ballots, but it does seem like that might be a reality in that market very late into ’14?
Jacek Olczak: To my recollections, there is not much I haven’t -- I don’t really recall there was discussions about any changes to the fuel subsidies recently until -- unless I’ve missed something, but I don’t think so. On the presidential elections, all fine and we will have to see how does it unfold and how what’s the new direction -- political direction there. Now I was much more -- we’re much more looking into the GDP development, the pricing development etcetera and based on this we’re trying to the best of our knowledge to estimate the market growth. But as I indicated a moment before, I do admit that with a 2% year-to-date our 1% outlook it maybe too cautious. We will have to see. I mean, at this market -- as you know is a market which has a lot of stick sales, the levels of the sales and the consumptions can pretty rapidly change in these places. So we will have to see.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: Yes, that makes sense. And lastly, maybe it is still too early, but I was wondering whether you wanted -- could offer any commentary as you go into your city tests on the iQOS, can you dimensionalize for us how you’re thinking about the pricing of the iQOS system relative to other competitive novel tobacco systems and their respective markets of Japan and Italy?
Jacek Olczak: You know me; I’m a great fan of iQOS. I’m using this product. I wish I could share this with you, but I can’t.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: Fair enough.
Jacek Olczak: One thing when we talk about the iQOS, which is also to explain a little bit our cost variance this year. And I know that I’m bridging from your questions to something else, but its important to remember that the two test markets on iQOS will happen in Q4 this year, okay. And this obviously will also contribute -- one of the contributing element when we will have a less favorable cost towards the end of the year versus the previous period -- previous year.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company: That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Hello. Thank you very much for taking the question.
Jacek Olczak: Hi. Good morning.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Good morning. It’s a question about Italy and the outlook for changes in the tax situation there. Now, I believe or I’ve seen that there was an announcement, I think in the last day or two, of what I believe is a very small increase in tax, but an increase nonetheless. And I was wondering, first of all, if you could just confirm that I’m right, that it’s pretty marginal. And secondly and perhaps more importantly to comment, if you can, about how you think and when you think there will be a substantial change in the tax situation in Italy? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: You’re absolutely right. There was a very small almost cosmetic sort of a change which resulted in I think a 0.1 -- I know it’s a 0.1 incident increase. The increase, the specific the minimum excise tax on cigarette by a €1 and the minimum excise tax on the fine cut products by €3. So this is -- there is some sort of a legacy coming from still last year and just Italy was pretty late in translating this into the tax rate. This has nothing to do with the tax restructuring which in our understanding is that the government is debating as we speak. So we will see how does it unfold. I mean, I think there are number of people who are recognizing that the tax structure which Italy has today is pretty archaic. I mean it doesn’t stand to the market requirements both on the government revenue side -- very much on the government revenue side, but also into overall market. So let’s see.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: When would you expect to have news on a substantial reform?
Jacek Olczak: Well, because it is Italy, the expectations with regards to time you have to be pretty flexible.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Okay. But this calendar year, I guess?
Jacek Olczak: As I said it’s Italy, so we will have to see.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Thanks for taking that. I was actually -- I had the same question as Adam. So I’m all sorted. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: So I will give the same answer, I guess.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Superb.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Nick for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, the investor relations team is currently in Switzerland. We’d be happy to talk to you. Thanks again. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, Sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the first quarter 2014, and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are PMI estimates based on the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenues exclude excise taxes, operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net. OCI growth rates are on an adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs. Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our business results in the first quarter are in line with the 2014 annual guidance that we shared with you in February. The quarter was impacted by a number of distortions that marked a much better performance at the net revenue and OCI level. Our business fundamentals remain solid and we are making progress in addressing the issues that we highlighted in February. Today we are increasing our reported diluted earnings per share guidance for 2014 at prevailing exchange rate to a range of $5.09 to $5.19, versus $5.26 in 2013. Our revised guidance includes $0.61 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rate, compared to the $0.71 previously disclosed and a $0.03 restructuring charge related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Australia. We have taken $0.01 of this charge this quarter to cover the cost of employee separation and expect to subsequently incur an estimated $0.02 of additional anticipated restructuring charges. Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency and this restructuring charge of approximately 6% to 8% compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.40 in 2013. During the first quarter, cigarette volume declined by 4.4% driven primarily by total industry volume contraction and unfavorable inventory movement. We estimate that absent this inventory distortions, our underlying volume was down by around 2%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency, declined by 1.6% and 3.1%, respectively. The lower revenues and OCI were attributable to Japan and the Philippines, both of which were also impacted by timing distortions. Net revenues and OCI, excluding these unfavorable distortions, as well as the impact of the change to PMI’s new business structure in Egypt, were essentially stable. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 4.7%, excluding currency. Pricing was the key driver of our solid performance and a key reason why profits were impacted by a difficult year-on-year comparison. Our pricing variance reached $406 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $531 million during the same period last year when we benefited from favorable pricing related to inventory movements in a number of markets, and in particular in the Philippines following the very large January 2013 excise tax increase. Since December of last year, we have taken price increases in a wide range of markets, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey and the U.K. We recently announced to the trade in Germany that we will take a 20 Euro cent per pack price increase in June, essentially across our entire cigarette portfolio. Let me now turn to an update on key regions and markets. In the EU Region, we witnessed a 5.6% decline in cigarette industry volume, in line with the decrease that occurred during the second half of last year. This confirms a moderation in the unfavorable trend, despite persistently high unemployment levels. We attribute this moderation to an apparent overall stabilization in illicit trade during 2013, a significant slow-down in the growth of e-vapor products in many markets and reduced down-trading to fine cut products. However, we should remember that the comparisons with 2013 are easier in the first half of this year. Consequently, we still forecast that cigarette industry volume may decline within a range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2014, though we expect it to be closer to 6% than 7%. We continue to outperform the industry in the EU Region. Our regional market share increased by 0.9 points in the first quarter to 38.9%. We achieved share growth in five out of the six largest markets in the region and expect our momentum to continue throughout the year. Our strong share performance is driven by the strength of our key international brands. Marlboro gained 0.4 points to reach a 19.1% regional share despite continued weak consumer purchasing power. L&M grew by 0.3 share points to 6.9% and Chesterfield performed particularly well, gaining 0.6 points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 4.9%. In the first quarter, cigarette industry volume in Italy remained very resilient with a decline of just 0.5%. This is attributable to a significant decline in the sales of e-vapor products, a stabilization of illicit trade and lower fine cut volumes. The key issue in Italy is the ineffective excise tax structure. The country has the lowest specific-to-total excise tax ratio in the EU at 7.5%. This has encouraged competitors to introduce or re-position brands to the super-low €4 per pack price segment and has resulted in an increase in the price gap to premium brands to €1 per pack, which is a much wider gap than in markets such as France and Germany. Consequently, the super-low segment grew from 0.5% in the first quarter of last year to 11.9% this year, driven predominantly by down-trading from the low and mid-price segments, as well as in-switching from e-vapor products. We successfully entered the super-low segment this year by repositioning Chesterfield, which has already grown by 1.5 points to reach a level of 5.1% in the first quarter, while Marlboro’s share remained resilient at 25.6%. In 2013, the State incurred a decrease in excise tax revenues for the first time in over a decade and the decline accelerated in the first quarter. We therefore hope that the government will soon address the issue of excise tax reform. Let me now move to the Asia Region. As foreseen, the Japanese government increased the consumption tax from 5% to 8% on April 1. The resulting pass-on at retail was about JPY14 per pack. We received approval to increase our average retail prices only in line with the tax increase. As previously mentioned, we expect a slight acceleration in the rate of decline in cigarette industry volume from last year’s level of 2% to between 3% and 3.5%, due to the impact of the consumption tax-driven price increases on the overall economy. During the first quarter of this year, however, cigarette industry volume increased by 9.6% in Japan, driven by trade and consumer purchases ahead of the April tax-driven price increases. Our volume during this period was 9.1% lower, principally due to the adverse timing of PMI shipments and a lower market share. Our reported market share declined by two points to 25.5% during the first quarter. However, this partly reflected the greater degree of trade inventory build-up by competition, which distorted market shares. Our estimated share of 25.9% on an adjusted basis was in line with our 2013 fourth quarter share. During the quarter, we rolled-out the “Be Marlboro” marketing campaign that has been an integral part of the brand’s success in European and other markets. The initial feedback has been very positive. We believe that this campaign, along with Marlboro’s resilience and our future new product initiatives, should enable us to stabilize our share and eventually generate sequential gains. Let me now move to the Philippines, where tax-paid cigarette industry volume increased by 25.9% during the first quarter. This was mainly due to a lower build-up of inventories by the trade at the end of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, due to a more moderate excise tax increase in January 2014. There are strong indications that Mighty Corporation continues to declare about half of its production volume for tax purposes. The company is coming under increasing scrutiny from the Bureau of Internal Revenue. We hope that the introduction of tax stamps in June will further reinforce these efforts. While the price of the Mighty brand has gone up at retail from PHP1 to PHP1.50 per stick, Marvels still retails at PHP1.25 per stick and currently wholesales at a price that does not cover the full taxes due. We have responded with Jackpot at the same stick price as Marvels and Champion matching Mighty, while maintaining the price of Fortune slightly below PHP2 per stick. We were able to reach a share of the super-low price segment of over 50% in the first quarter. Our overall market share of 83.7% was higher than both our 2013 full-year and fourth quarter shares, but lower than our share in the first quarter of 2013. Importantly, the total share of the super-low price segment has been declining recently. Going forward, the price increases that have occurred at the bottom of the market and our marketing efforts behind Marlboro and Fortune should enable us to further improve our market share and product mix trends. In Indonesia, during the first quarter of the year, cigarette industry volume declined by 1% and there was an acceleration of certain segment trends. The industry volume decline was driven by a sharp contraction of the low-price segment, which was down by 12.7%. This was attributable to the impact of Decree 131, the legislation that eliminated the preferential excise tax for so-called “sister companies” of large manufacturers, which resulted in significantly higher prices for a wide range of brands at the low end of the market. In addition, the reduction in fuel subsidies last year and food inflation significantly impacted low-income adult smokers. In the quarter, this particularly benefited the mid-price segment, where we have a strong position with U Mild, which gained 1.1 points to reach a share of 5.2%. Although inflation has increased and the overall economic situation has somewhat softened, GDP growth remains over 5%. This, together with the positive demographic trends and the overall stable political environment, leads us to forecast total market growth of up to 1% in Indonesia for the full-year. During the first quarter, our market share in Indonesia declined by 1.6 share points to 34.6%, reflecting unfavorable price points and the impact of segment trends. There was an acceleration in the decline in the hand-rolled, or “SKT” segment, which incurred a volume erosion of 16.1% in the quarter. The decline was particularly evident at the premium price end of the segment and this unfavorably impacted the volume and overall share of our Dji Sam Soe brand. While we have lost segment share in SKT due to an unfavorable price point for Dji Sam Soe and a widening in the brand’s price gap with competitive brands, PMI is performing well in the other taste segments. We will be investing more heavily this year to further boost the equity of brands, such as machine-made Sampoerna A, Dji Sam Soe Magnum. We therefore expect an improved market share performance during the second half of the year. I will now turn to Russia, where profit growth remains strong despite the impact of large tax-driven price increases. Cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 6.7% in the first quarter to 66.9 billion units though announced price increases of RUB6 to RUB9 per pack only started to impact adult smokers as of February 2014. For the full-year, we are forecasting an industry volume decline of between 9% and 11%, mainly reflecting the impact of higher prices and a foreseen increase in illicit trade, this despite the growing efforts of the authorities to stamp out counterfeit production and stop the import of contraband and illicit whites. Our brand performance in the first quarter was strong. Our market share of 26.7% through the end of February was up by 0.5 points versus a year earlier and up by 0.4 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our segment share was higher in the premium and low-price segments, notably behind the success of Parliament and Bond Street. Our profits in the quarter grew at a double-digit rate, excluding currency and this is before the contribution of our 20% shareholding in Megapolis, an investment that is bringing about gradual improvements in our market penetration as well as providing an attractive financial return. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and beyond in Russia. Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the first quarter of 2014 declined by 0.2 points to 36.5%, driven notably by a lower share in Indonesia and Japan, but largely offset by our strong performance in the EU Region. Marlboro has been a key driver of our good share performance. During the first quarter, Marlboro progressed to reach an international share of 9.2%. It gained share in three out of our four regions, with a particularly strong performance in the EU region. Its share decline in the Latin America and Canada region reflects consumer down-trading and distorted shipment patterns in Mexico, while the brand performed well in other markets in the region. We continue to be focused on costs and productivity to further drive the expansion of our profits. We have an annual cost savings and productivity target of $300 million this year. We have implemented a number of initiatives across our supply chain to achieve this objective. We are also continuing to optimize our global footprint and announced the closure at the end of this year of our manufacturing facility in Melbourne, Australia. Production will be consolidated in our factory in South Korea. We have entered into consultations with employee representatives in the Netherlands on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at our Bergen op Zoom facility. The proposal is subject to consultation with the Dutch Works Council and approval by the Philip Morris Holland Supervisory Board. Consultation with the European Works Council is also required. Subject to the final outcome of the consultations and fulfillment of certain other conditions, we would anticipate to implement the contemplated decision by October 2014. We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our target dividend pay-out ratio remains an attractive 65% and our dividend yield last Friday was 4.5%. During the first quarter, we spent $1.25 billion to repurchase 15.4 million shares at an average price of $81.12 and are targeting to spend $4 billion during the full-year. In conclusion, our guidance reflects a full-year growth rate of approximately 6% to 8% in an adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding currency and the restructuring charge. Our overall business is in good shape though the unfavorable volume mix remains a key challenge due to cigarette industry volume trends. Our performance in the EU region is improving with our leading brands all gaining market share. Furthermore, trends in the first quarter confirm the slight moderation in cigarette industry volume decline. We're starting to see signs of stabilization in our underlying share performance in Japan and the Philippines. The accelerated decline of the hand-rolled segment and unfavorable price point in Indonesia have impacted our overall market share, but we're performing well in the machine-made segment. We are growing share and profit in Russia and our business across the EEMA region is performing well. Our pricing remains the key driver of our performance. This is being complemented by cost savings and productivity programs. Finally, we're ramping up our organization ahead of our exciting city tests later this year and our first national commercial launch in 2015 of reduced-risk products. This is the term we use to refer to products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm. We will complete our eight clinical trials this year and are continuing our perception and behavioral studies. We're preparing the packaging and the labeling of the products and as previously stated, the increased investments this year will be around $100 million. Finally, we're moving forward with the constructions of a 30 billion unit HeatStick tobacco stick factory in Bologna, Italy, which will be completed by 2016. Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Jacek, just Japan. I'm trying to reconcile the 9% decline in your shipments in the second quarter and the inventory movement that we saw, the market share losses. Can you just bridge sort of that 9% decline for Japan in the quarter? And then as you think about then the upcoming quarter, do we then see some of that benefit? So you actually would see a positive shipment in Japan as you flow through the inventory movement the other way?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we have two things for Japan. One is, as we said, our in-market sales actually for the quarter was about 300 million units higher than the first quarter of last year. This was still a little bit lower participation in the trade purchases ahead of the price increases than our principal competitors and our share panel will be the lower on the reported basis and on a restated or adjusted basis, we think it was flat versus Q4 last year. Our shipment and this is how we recognize the revenue on the market, essentially the purchases by our distributors to Japan, so this is one step lower than the in-market sales and the shipments to the distributor were lower by about 1.3 billion units and this is where the distortions, which we have for Japan. When it comes to the next quarters, I mean although we see the market to go down for the full year in the range of 3% to 3.5%, the question is how much trade we'll need to be stock or unwind the higher purchases which have happened at the end of the last quarter. So, I don't think we should have that magnitude of the inventory adjustment and also obviously there is a function of how our shares is going to develop going forward. I mean so far we see the first two quarters sequentially when our share comes flat. I mean if that obviously would remain for the remaining part of the year, we would have a much less of the distortions on the shipment.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Okay. And just on that note, so the underlying market share performance, Jacek, you sound like you're seeing a little bit of stabilization there and maybe cautiously optimistic that things will improve as the year progresses. Can you just give us some color just in terms of what's driving that confidence at this point?
Jacek Olczak: We're encouraged -- as I said, on an adjusted basis, the share came flat versus Q4. So, this is the first sequential quarters which we have over the last good few quarters when we have not lost share. And Marlboro came relatively strong. L&M and Lark continues to be under pressure. There is a program in place to address the Lark performance. And I think also the Be Marlboro campaign, which we started to roll out in Japan in Q1 of this year will get the very positive response at the consumer level. So, we start the number of parameters or brand attributes which the campaign has helped us to address in the other regions, mainly the European region. We start seeing the same sort of an impact in Japan. Preparedly, when the campaign is rolled out, but this is even more encouraging. So, let's stay cautiously optimistic for the year, but this is still the long way for us to fully stabilize or to return to growth in the Japanese market.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Okay. And then secondly, just on Indonesia, just a market share movement there. You called out unfavorable price points. Can you just talk about what drove that unfavorable price point? And then how you're addressing that issue? And how would you characterize your performance in Indonesia in the context of some of the other markets like Japan or the Philippines where obviously you have had some market share challenges? Is this a little bit more one-off situation, or what do you think about the market share performance in Indonesia and how you think about that going forward?
Jacek Olczak: I think there are two factors which, first of all impacted the total industry, impacting the industry performance. One is some sort of a pressure coming still from the last year, the median removal partially of the fuel subsidies, some pressure on inflation, so it has an impact on the total market, especially on the lower price points. I mean this is what the consumers presumably are most impacted by that pressure from their disposable income. Second thing is the market had an underlying trend of the consumer switching from hand-rolled cigarettes to machine-made cigarettes. Obviously, we present in those segments, but our main brand, Dji Sam Soe, is the hand-made kretek cigarette. That brand sit at premium price point of the segment, actually, it is one of the most expensive brands in the market. The brands we started to sell after the price increases last year as of about mid of last year, the brand price per pack was about IDR12,000 for the pack of 12. So, we crossed at the retail level the stick price of IDR1,000. Other main competitors behind us in terms of the price gap. So, I think it's going to take some time until they will cross the market will cross that price point with another brand. I would expect some moderations in the share pressure in Indonesia in the second half of the year and we just have to be patient. We also are addressing the consumer taste preferences going for the machine -- from the hand-made cigarettes to machine-made by line extending Dji Sam Soe. So, we have two very well -- one very well performing variant and we are coming with the second variant, Dji Sam Soe Magnum, which is a filter kretek machine-made -- machine-made kretek cigarette. So, I think the share, -- I mean overall, I think we can get to the decent share performance, but we have to wait a little bit.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: First a broader question, Jacek. So this quarter local currency, OCI was down 3, EPS was up 5. How do you envision the balance of the year unfolding? Clearly the results need to be better than this to hit the full year target.
Jacek Olczak: The OCI, on an ex-currency basis for the full year should be -- should obviously have a positive growth
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Right.
Jacek Olczak: Otherwise it will be difficult to get to the 6% to 8% on the EPS level, ex-currency obviously.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And…
Jacek Olczak: You need to note into this thing that this distortion which we had on a shipment basis this year, I'm sorry in the first quarter, I mean at April 3rd, the pressure on the overall OCI growth. But as I said in my remarks, if I would exclude the distortions which we have had in the first quarter, my revenues and OCI would be flattish -- at least flattish for the quarter on ex-currency basis.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then second, Jacek, what are you seeing in the market in Russia now that the price increases are starting to come through at retail?
Jacek Olczak: It's very still early because the prices have started to appear at the retail level around second half of February. I think as in the past we were at the beginning of the price changes in Philip Morris, the competition I can see that the following. There is one competitor, which is slow, but they usually were slow. So I think we need still a few weeks to see the full impact on the market. The market was less than 7%, 6.7% diluted down for the quarter. We still hold the forecast for the full year for the full market to be in a decline rate of 9% to 11%. One thing which we have to watch that the current situation with the ruble having some pressure, GDP growth forecast for Russia is coming a little bit lower than the previous forecast. I mean the whole situation around that region is a little bit -- not extremely helpful, so we just have to see how this going to unfold during the year. But as our forecast for the market is at the 9% to 11% decline, we don't see actually that we should revise anything else in our estimate for the year -- for this year at this stage.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: I just have -- my first question a quick follow-on on Japan. Given the expected price increases in the market, how much do you think this will increase the total profit pool? And then do you envision capturing I guess more than your fair share over the next few years?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I can talk about this year, as you know, we have ended up and what I see generally the industry has ended up with price increase which essentially just passed on the VAT increase, so I don't see much of the profit pool enhancement in the market. If you deduct the estimated market decline for the year actually coming slightly negative rather than a positive that's for this year; and I think talking about the outer year would be a clear speculation because we also need to see what is the decision of the government with regards to the planned second step of the sales price increase from 8% to 10%.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay. That's fair. And then, my second question is on Marlboro. The volume performance was relatively weak during the quarter. So I guess in light of this, could you talk a little bit about Marlboro 2.0, the next generation brand, and how this might reaccelerate growth for total Marlboro? And then, possibly which markets Marlboro has the most opportunity or upside this year?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we post -- essentially post the test market in a few locations for the Marlboro 2.0 architecture. All tests, all three locations reported very encouraging results. I mean the perception of the Marlboro Red really start changing. This is what the brand needed. We think this is the right thing to do to reinvigorate Marlboro Red and somehow replicated I think a tremendous success which we have achieved with the Marlboro Gold a few years ago when we revamped Marlboro gold. So I think it's overall the move in the right directions. We will be rolling results sequentially in the number of markets. To actually give you a one single out one or group of markets where Marlboro have the best of the potential, if I am looking at the last couple of years Marlboro performance, frankly speaking, Marlboro has the potential in every geography. And I think the Marlboro performance in the Europe against all of this negative macroeconomic trend is just confirming that the brand can serve the very stormy waters irregardless of the situation. The brand is and I think is going to be then in a better shape than it used to be in the past. So I will not volunteer to single one market when a Marlboro would benefit. Obviously, we can talk about the Russia, but Marlboro Russia is more than just the Marlboro architecture, it's the product propositions and a couple of other factors.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay. That's helpful. And then, my final question is on your dividend. Given your negative EPS growth this year due primarily, of course, to the currency headwind, could you share with us how you're thinking about your dividend? And then, how comfortable or willing you are to let your payout ratio be above your target 65%?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we're currently above the current ratio -- sorry, the current payout ratio. Listen, the divined, as you know, is the decision of our Board, so I think we need to be patient and wait until the September Board and see what decision the Board will make. What I can say at this stage is that I think we have in every single year since we become independent; we've been rewarding shareholders irregardless of some headwinds which we had on our reported result. And I can't say anything more at this stage, but I think we had a track record of generously rewarding shareholders.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Morning, Chris.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. I just had two questions for you. I wanted to ask a little bit more detail on the EU. I just noticed -- and I don't recall seeing this of late -- but that the Marlboro brand was down in the quarter but you had growth in L&M, Chesterfield, the Philip Morris brand, more mid-tier type brands. Was there any change in, sort of the mix, if you will, the product mix in that market, anything that worried you about any kind of trading down in some markets?
Jacek Olczak: No. I think that L&M continues to perform well in all markets. Actually L&M total share and Marlboro share was pretty strong -- came strong in the many markets. You have -- and I think Marlboro actually for the quarter went up by the four times of a point if I'm not mistaken, okay in the segment, in the EU segment. Chesterfield had a bit of acceleration. I think Italy has contributed to that. We had some situation in Italy when the former euro price segment has doubled up was the end of the last year. I mean I have said it in my remarks the tax system in Italy is pretty inefficient. Actually I would characterize it as one of the most inefficient systems within the European Union region. We have entered the segment by repositioning Chesterfield. The brand picked up very nicely, so I think it also contributed to the overall performance of Chesterfield. And I think in other larger market volume-wise when the Chesterfield picked up very nicely, I think recently was Poland, but I don't think it's much of the mix. All brands across the price -- irregardless of the price segment positioning are delivering a very strong share growth.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you. And I just had a follow-up question for you on the Philippines as well. I guess just to be clear; there was another tax increase at the start of the year. So it seemed like across at least some of your volume, you are absorbing that today? Have you taken pricing may be on Marlboro, but not on Fortune or Jackpot, or one of the lower-priced brands?
Jacek Olczak: No. We have fact that we need to restore the competitiveness and put our grip on all key price points in the market, and this entailed that we have to absorb the tax. And then if Marlboro continues selling at the equivalent of the PHP1 per stick. Fortune, we're now trading I think at the retail at the slightly below the PHP2. And we have much the key brands of Mighty, our key competitor there with the Marlboro and it's always the Jackpot and Champion. And I think this is very much behind our market share performance, but the part of our strategy and we have made it very clear, I believe, as of November or so last year that we need to regain our competitiveness in the market. And one of the key elements of restoring the sort of a level playing field I think also in this market.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: I had a related question then which is, you're chasing some of this really low-end volume, very unprofitable, or maybe not at all profitable volume. Is there a view that you could then trade that consumer up in the future, or that you'll benefit if you hold onto that share as prices go higher? Is that the viewpoint, or is it better to manage for profitability given your already high share?
Jacek Olczak: That's exactly the plan.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay. Got you. Thanks so much for your time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Jon Leinster - UBS: A couple of questions. First of all, on the underlying volume growth down 2%, which inventory distortions are you including? Because it seemed to me the Philippines is probably the largest swing, is that not included in that sort of underlying 2% down?
Jacek Olczak: No. I think the major would come from Japan. And you will have some movement across the number of the markets. I think there was Russia slightly contributing in the things. Yeah, this would be the main one.
Jon Leinster - UBS: So it doesn't include the impact of the Philippines, which was a sort of positive sort of move?
Jacek Olczak: No.
Jon Leinster - UBS: No. Okay. And the big question on pricing, you mentioned obviously the inventory movements added a lot to pricing in the first quarter of 2013 and that's not going to recur. So could we assume therefore that pricing for 2014 in general, the overall mix, the variance, is likely to prove to be less than 2013?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think we had very a high pricing variance last year to some extent it’s driven also by the one-off in Bolivia and the Philippines, right? So, that thing will not repeat, if you like, this year. But if I compare apples-to-apples, frankly speaking the pricing variance this year we don’t see why this shouldn’t be in line with our historical average sort of annual pricing variance.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Right. Okay. And usually you make some comment about how much of the pricing you've already got through in terms of the market. Is that something you are prepared to comment on at the moment?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we have now made some advancement versus what we have announced in February. So we’re approaching much higher number, and frankly speaking there wasn’t – we have more advancement in terms of announced and realized pricing than we had in February.
Jon Leinster - UBS: And very quickly, lastly; is there any signs that the Italian government is actually moving on the tax system?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think the decline in the governmental tax revenues in the last year and a continuing for Q1 is something that I believe makes the government looking more closely, I mean, what have led to the situation. As I said, the system is inefficient. It’s very heavily – most heavily in the European Union scaled towards ad valorem component and many other markets also during the crisis. If you look at Spain to some extent, not fully, but France – I mean, that is typical of high ad valorem markets, they have recognized the weakness of the structure and the system and they have moved ahead. I believe, Italian government will -- is closely looking and they will reach the same conclusion that the more specific component is actually better system also from the revenue, the governmental revenues perspective.
Jon Leinster - UBS: But is there actually a proposal out there for any movement, or is that yet to come?
Jacek Olczak: I think there are some discussions.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Back to Indonesia, I just wanted to try to see if I could clarify a little bit or understand it better. My understanding is that Djarum Super and Gudang Garam International have also hit those same price points. I think it was late in the quarter so obviously it wouldn't have had much impact in these numbers, but just in terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, is the issue that there is a segment shift away from their brands and Dji Sam Soe because of the higher price point, or is it that those two are gaining from you and that you should be able to get some of that back, or how does that work?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think their price point has –is one of the key elements to play there. As I said, I mean, Dji Sam Soe now, I mean most of the packs sold in the market at 13,000 rupiah per pack of 12. So, I mean, clearly we are well above the 1 rupiah price point and retailers try to even round up that price to 1,500 if not more. While the Djarum and the GG, I think, if I not mistaking, the key brand competing with Dji Sam Soe now still have sums volumes below 12,000 and I would think about the half of the volumes – maybe slightly more than half of the volumes at the 12,000 per pack. So they are just now hitting the sum around price point. I think, the issue is the market when you have a pretty frequent sort of a pricing increase. So I think it’s just a matter of a time when the pressure on the Dji Sam Soe should ease going forward. This is from a price point perspective.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: So, just to make sure that I understand that, you are saying some of the competitive pricing is scattered like within the country so that some markets probably in bigger cities have the higher price points but for the competitive brands but it's not everywhere?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think it is due to the size and the structure of the trade of the country, you don't have the price increases which will hit the retail and consumers in one given point in a time. You have this – you announced the prices, you introduced the prices to the trade and you might at have in a given point, in any given point a coexistence of the prices – two or three different price points per pack and…
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Got you, okay.
Jacek Olczak: And as part of the rolling price increases, I mean, you rather work for the average price in the market at the retail level in order to upset the competitors. Now, I thing to add maybe that, you now, historically the Djarum brand and the GG brand, they were also trading or retailing below Dji Sam Soe, right. So there is maybe some element of the price cut, but I believe it is more the element of the one price point of the 12 per pack – 12,000 rupiah per pack, 1,000 per stick.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Well, and so in terms – I guess, it's almost two months now since they have announced those prices and to your point it may have flown through very widely. But have you seen any improvement in your trends on Dji Sam Soe into April so far?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we have been announcing the prices as well, so this is like sort of the moving curve situation, if you like. Right?
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Right. Okay.
Jacek Olczak: The market in a given one moment – in a given moment will cross the ones price point. We had a same situation with Dji Sam Soe when the Dji Sam Soe was crossing the 500 rupiah per stick. So it’s not that we have not upselled with Dji Sam Soe that the brand was nicely growing. We are the first ones to cross the round price point, at that time as I said, 500 rupiah per stick. I mean, we get there little bit of the share pressure and then we will recover. So I mean, let’s see how this is going to play this time.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: And can you give any sense of what you expect for the second half, or any part of the rest of the year just in terms of what your share position might look like given that it is obviously it came down but it was also down versus 4Q. Do you expect it to stabilize or do you think it might get worse before it picks up again?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think that we should expect some less of the share pressure moderation or flattening of the share actually towards the second half, or in the second half of this year. Here Philip Morris in Indonesia had a little bit of pressure on the share if you look at the Q3, Q4 last year. Okay. So we planned it grow at a much faster rate until about the mid of the last year than – okay, Dji Sam Soe again crossed this 12,000 price point, we started observing the pressure. I think we need to just let this period somehow lock.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Then in Japan you mentioned you have some programs in place, or starting, to become in place on Lark. Can you give a little color on what those are?
Jacek Olczak: I think we will have to stay a little bit of patient until everything is revealed in the market. So when we’re talking about the future programs, I can't actually tell you much more in detail than what in the market that they announced. But obviously there is the things which drives, so the element which drives the market, i.e. innovation, modernization of the product perception, et cetera, I mean, it’s something which is in the books.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, I know you mentioned the next-generation products. Is there any other details you can give us on those?
Jacek Olczak: Not at this stage. I think that the last week of June the Investors Day which we will have here for the investors community is the great opportunity for us to disclose more details, how and when and we’re going to go into the first market. But we are very excited about it.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: All right. That sounds great. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
Owen Bennett Nomura: Good morning, guys.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Owen Bennett Nomura: A couple of questions if I may. Firstly, I was just wondering if you could give some more details on what could be perceived as weaker pricing in EU. I mean, what is driving this? Is it the mix in Italy and is this likely to continue into the rest of the year? Secondly, could you please give some more color on the business building initiatives in Brazil? And what these entail exactly and also how your share development is looking in Brazil? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. I think the kind of pricing in Euro – I mean, it’s actually Italy, right, because Italy is lacking some prices, as I have said this earlier.
Owen Bennett - Nomura: Yes.
Jacek Olczak: That Italy has this significantly inefficient tax system. I mean I was somehow compounded by the fact that it increased the VAT. They have not -- there was no offset on follow on rate. So that puts the pressure on the pricing in the region. As I said, I mean, let's remain hopeful that the government sees what is the driver of the entire -- their revenue is also collection performance and how this going to be addressed. Meanwhile, we concentrated on holding a strong market share. Our share essentially came flat. Marlboro came flat. This is despite the fact that we see some down trading between the medium and the low segment for this full euro price segment. Chesterfield now is the significant player or key player actually in the full euro price segment, so I think we have some grip in the market. But that's essentially what is behind the pricing in euro, which I think I said that we have recently announced the price increase in Germany over €0.20 per pack, so I think this should also change the bigger picture going forward. And when it comes to Brazil, I don't know if you asked the question, I think the market in Brazil for the quarter I remember was about 2.6% down, I think the market was about $17.3 billion. And our market share nicely grew to about 15.7% or I think improved by the 1.4 points -- it was 1.4 points for the quarter I think was our share.
Owen Bennett - Nomura: Okay. And just on the business building initiatives, I'm just wondering what that is exactly? Is that significant, or…
Jacek Olczak: As we know we've very much strong focus at in the south of Brazil. And we had a plan of enlarging our presence there. And we are going from the south slowly to the north of Brazil. And this is also attracting volumes up. So step-by-step, I think we're making a very good progress in Brazil as we did however for the last couple of years.
Owen Bennett - Nomura: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Felberbaum of the Associated Press.
Michael Felberbaum - Associated Press: Hello, Jacek. I had a question on -- you had mentioned in the commentary for France, the growth of E-Vapor products and their impacts on combustible volumes. And I have wondered if you could provide any color on any overall trends you're seeing as far as the impact on volumes and the growth of E-Vapor products?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. I mean the color -- in terms of the color as always at the beginning of last year we observed 2013, we observed that sort of phenomena in Italy and not even a quarter later -- sorry four quarters later the product is actually, or the attractiveness of this product is fading out and there is no volume, no impact on the market. Based on my knowledge of that category I don't see why France shouldn't play the same way. I mean we know what are the negatives, if you like, of e-cigarettes cigarettes in terms of a satisfaction, meeting the consumers' expectations, etcetera. So we now see this in France. As I said, I saw that last year in Italy. I saw it sometime ago in Germany. I saw it sometime ago in Greece. I can start mentioning the market. And essentially the trend is very much being repeated across the country. So it goes for the rapid sort of a growth. It's a lot of -- it confirms that there was an interest. And I think for a good reason the consumer is looking to this alternative, but the product as it is today in the market is not delivering on the consumer expectations.
Michael Felberbaum - Associated Press: Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: We've reached the allotted time for questions-and-answers. I will now return the call to Nick Rolli for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Okay. Well, thank you very much for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you do have any follow-up questions, the Investor Relations team is available. We are currently in Switzerland and we'll be happy to take your follow-up questions. Thank you again, and have a nice day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2013 Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, Sir.
Nick Rolli: Thank you. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results and you may access the release on our web site at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, and comparing them to the same periods in 2012, unless otherwise stated. Our references to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenues exclude excise taxes, operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net. Our OCI growth rates are on an adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs. Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our web site. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join André for the question-and-answer period. André?
André Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As expected, we finished 2013 with a strong fourth quarter. While our cigarette volume declined by 1.9%, excluding the Philippines, our net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 2.5% and 12.7%, respectively, excluding currency. Most importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 19.4% on an ex-currency basis. Our results were strong across all four regions. Adjusted OCI, excluding currency, increased in the fourth quarter by 2.6% in the EU region, 22.5% in EEMA, 7.4% in Asia and by 34.9% in the Latin America and Canada region. On a full year basis, EEMA and Latin America and Canada grew adjusted OCI at a double-digit rate in 2013, excluding currency. For the full year 2013, our reported diluted EPS reached $5.26. This includes the $0.10 charge for the restructuring of our business in Egypt, which we announced last week, as well as $0.04 in charges that we had previously disclosed. Consequently, our adjusted diluted EPS was $5.40 in 2013. Excluding the unfavorable currency of $0.34 per share, this represents a growth rate of 10% compared to the previous year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22. Currencies, particularly in emerging markets continue to be extremely volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, we project $0.71 in unfavorable currency in our EPS guidance for 2014. Emerging markets account for nearly 60% of this total. The fact that we are currently hedged for approximately 60% of our forecast sales to Japan, with an effective rate of ¥ 95 to the $1, is included in this projection. Our results confirm that our business fundamentals are robust. However, as I outlined in November, we expect to continue to face specific challenges in 2014. Those affected our full year 2013 results. Furthermore, we intend to make significant investments in and increase expenditures behind our reduced-risk products in preparation for city pilot tests later this year and our first national launch in 2015, as well as additional investments behind our current portfolio. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at prevailing exchange rates is in a range of $5.02 to $5.12 versus $5.16 in 2013. Our 2014 guidance corresponds to a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 6% to 8%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013. Japan is projected to remain a challenging market for us in 2014. The government is increasing the consumption tax in April from 5% to 8%. The related retail price pass on is around ¥ 14 per pack. We have applied to the Minister of Finance for approval to increase the prices of our Marlboro, Lark and Philip Morris brands by ¥ 20 per pack and other brands by up to ¥ 10 per pack. Subject to approval by the Minister of Finance, the new prices are expected to take effect on April 3. The new prices are expected to result in a slight acceleration of the total market decline to around 3% to 3.5% in 2014, compared to the 2% decline of 2015. Our overall market share declined in 2013 from 27.7% to 26.7%, and to 25.9% in the fourth quarter. This was driven principally by the success of new competitive products in the menthol segment and was somewhat distorted by the pipelining of competitive product launches in the fourth quarter. Marlboro remains resilient and should be boosted by the rollout of the Don’t Be A Maybe, Be Marlboro campaign that has been successful in numerous markets in the European Union and other regions. We also have plans to introduce various new product offers under the Marlboro and Lark trademarks. Barring any unforeseen adverse competitive price reaction, we expect that these launches coupled with increased spending to support them should enable us to stabilize our market share during the year. However we do expect that our 2014 average share will be below the 2013 average. The second challenging market in Asia is the Philippines. We estimate the local manufacturer Mighty Corporation is producing about double the volume that it declares to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. This has prevented us from being able to operate on a level playing field and continues to result in a significant tax revenue loss for the government. The planned implementation of a system of fiscal stamps in the second quarter this year will hopefully help to address this issue. We are continuing to encourage the authorities to act decisively and welcome the decision of Congress to hold hearings on this matter as well as the decision of the Bureau of Customs to suspend the license of Mighty Corporation to operate a customs bonded warehouse. Since the end of November, we have seen the Mighty brand stick price gradually rise from PHP1 to PHP1.50, and the Marvels brand stick price rise to PHP1.25. This is a positive development. However, their Marvels brand is still selling at a wholesale price of PHP183 per carton, which is below the PHP191 required merely to cover the new excise tax and VAT enforced as of January this year. We do not know at this stage how Mighty Corporation intends to reflect the new tax levels. On the demand side, the good news is that, while tax paid industry volume was down by 15.6% to an estimated 86.3 billion units in 2013 Nielsen data indicates that there was only a minor decline in actual consumption. Adult smoking incidence and adult daily consumption remained at similar levels in the second half of 2013 to those that prevailed in 2012. In light of the significant tax driven price increases incurred by Marlboro and Fortune, total consumption was sustained by adult smoker down-trading to the then PHP 1 per stick price segment. This super-low price segment increased its share from 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 41.2% in the same period in 2013, mainly at the expense of our premium and mid-price brands. While we have enforced our segment participation, our overall market share in the fourth quarter declined by 14.9 points to 72.3%. Our ability to enhance our profitability through higher prices remains constrained by the flexibility that Mighty Corporation derives from its tax under declaration. In the meantime, the investments we are making to defend our business are shared with our partners. We continue to hold a clear leading share in the market - in a market where annual adult consumption is estimated at around 100 billion units and we have the brand portfolio and the national distribution to take advantage of the planned future tax equalization. We thus remain optimistic that once the current hurdles are overcome the Philippines will be a significant contributor to our profit growth in the region. While discussing Asian markets, let me provide an update on Indonesia, where total industry volume increased by 1.9% in 2013 to an estimated 380 billion units. The slower industry volume growth can be in large part attributed to the economic slowdown and the impact of higher fuel and food prices on lower income adult consumers. In fact, during 2013, the volume of premium and mid-priced cigarettes increased by 5.2% and 3.4%, respectively, while the volume of low-priced brands declined by 6.6%. In 2014, we expect industry volume growth to moderate to around 1% due to the weaker economy and expected significant price increases in the low price category following the introduction of a new regulation restricting the preferential tax treatment of so-called sister companies. In 2013, our market share grew by 0.5 points to 36.1%, driven by the strong performance of our lighter-tasting, machine-made kretek brands Sampoerna A and U Mild, as well as by Marlboro in the White segment. In the fourth quarter, their share growth was more than offset by a weaker performance of our hand-rolled kretek brands, Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna Kretek, due to the segment's decline and the fact that they both sell currently at disadvantageous price points compared to competitive brands. In 2014, we expect to benefit from the continued growth of the lighter-tasting machine made kretek segment, which increased by 1.9 points to 40.5% last year in which Sampoerna A and U Mild had a growing 46.4% segment share. In addition, we are gaining share in the full flavor machine-made kretek segment with Dji Sam Soe Magnum. Finally, we believe that the government's introduction in January of a regional tax of 10% should be manageable as it equates to a pass on of between 3% and 6%. Let me now turn to the European Union region. In the fourth quarter, cigarette industry volume in the region declined by 5.8%, at rate of decline similar to the third quarter, reflecting a tangible moderation compared to the trend we witnessed in the first half of 2013. Illicit trade appears to have stabilized, albeit at a high level. The expansion of the fine-cut category has slowed, given the compression of the tax and price differential with cigarettes. Finally, while still expanding in some markets, such as France, Spain and the U.K., the growth in demand for electronic cigarette in the region as a whole has decelerated. We therefore expect cigarette industry volume trends to show an improvement compared to the 7.5% decline in 2013, and are currently forecasting a decline in 2014, in a range of 6% to 7%. The improvement is taking place in an environment where excise tax increases have been reasonable and structural improvements continue to take place. One market of concern is Italy, where the predominantly ad valorem structure is encouraging the growth of a super-low €4 per pack price segment and eroding the tax revenue base of the government. We hope that the Italian government will rapidly address this issue and implement the necessary tax reform. Until this materializes, we will prudently balance the delicate price, volume and profit equation in Italy. In 2013, we increased our overall market share in the European Union region by 0.5 points to 38.5%. This was driven by the strength of our brand portfolio with Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris, all gaining share in the region. We expect this momentum to continue as our market share grew further to 38.6% in the fourth quarter. Our share gains are very broadly based. We increased our market share in each of the six largest cigarette markets by volume in the full year 2013. Our continued share momentum positions us well for 2014, and we expect to be able to again outperform the industry. I would also like to highlight our strong performance in the EEMA region, notably in Russia. Our strong pricing actions enabled us to continue to significantly expand our profitability in 2013, even though cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6%. Despite the slower implementation of new retail prices by some of our competitors, we recorded only a modest share decline of 0.3 points to 26.1%. This was achieved in particular by the continued outperformance of above premium price Parliament. In January of this year, the government implemented the next planned and largest excise tax increase resulting in an average pass on of RUB 8 a pack. In anticipation, we increased most of our maximum retail selling prices by RUB 9 per pack in December last year while prices will only go up at retail later this month. For the full year 2014, we expect to continue to expand our profitability at a high single-digit rate even though cigarette industry volume is expected to decline by between 9% and 11%, reflecting price elasticity, illicit trade and a weaker economy. Cigarette industry volume in Turkey was impacted by significant trade loading at the end of 2012 and by an increase in illicit trade in 2013. As a result, industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6% last year, while we estimate that the underlying decline was approximately 3.5%. Provided there is no further increase in illicit trade, we expect underlying cigarette industry volume to stabilize in 2014. Our share has remained resilient in the face of increased price competition in the low and super low price segments, with a decline of just 0.2 points to 45.5% in 2013. We successfully line extended Chesterfield into the super low price segment and continued to improve our mix. Thanks to the success of Parliament in the premium and Muratti in the mid-price segments. This January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum tax while maintaining the ad valorem rate unchanged. This resulted in a pass on of around TRY 0.28 per pack at the retail level. We increased the prices of our brands by around TRY 0.5 on average, thus boosting our unit margins. We achieved strong results across our Latin America and Canada region with share gains in Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Colombia and a stable 73.5% market share in Mexico. Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, we increased our share in 2013 by 0.5 points to 34.9%. Our market share grew or was stable in 23 of these markets further emphasizing that our underlying business remains strong. Marlboro has been a key driver of this excellent share momentum. In 2013, excluding China and the Philippines, Marlboro gained share in all four regions, with a particularly strong performance, not only in the EU region, but also in the Latin America and Canada region and across North Africa. Our strong market share momentum should enable us to improve our volume performance in 2014 and outperform the industry. In 2013, we estimate that global cigarette industry volume, excluding the U.S.A. and China, declined by 3%. This year, we are forecasting a decline in a range of 2% to 3%. Pricing was the key driver behind our income improvement, excluding currency in 2013. We achieved a pricing variance of $2.1 billion. This was above our historical average reflecting the timing of tax driven price increases and unusually large gains due to inventory movements, most notably in the Philippines. In 2014, we expect these gains to be lower. Consequently, the first quarter's EPS growth rate, excluding currency, is expected to be below our average for the year. Please note that as of today, we have implemented or announced almost 60% of the pricing that is built into our 2014 earnings per share guidance. While revenue growth remains the key driver of our business growth, we continue to be very focused on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted OCI margin, increased by 0.6 points in 2013, excluding currency, from 45.4% to 46%. This is in part attributable to the successful completion of cost savings and productivity improvement programs, which generated over $300 million in 2013. We target a further $300 million in annual productivity gains in 2014, which should moderate inflationary input cost increases. We have recently completed four business development projects that will be accretive to earnings in 2014. We repurchased the remaining 20% shareholding from our business partner in Mexico. We took a 49% participation in Arab Investors-TA, which is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of international brands of cigarettes in Algeria. We purchased a 20% shareholding in our Russian distributor, Megapolis. Finally, we have restructured our business in Egypt to enhance our growth and income potential in this 80 billion unit market. These business development projects are expected to have a net positive EPS impact of approximately $0.10 in 2014. In 2013, we increased our free cash flow, excluding unfavorable currency, by 11.8% to $9.4 billion. As foreseen, the growth rate exceeded that of net earnings, driven largely by a reduction in working capital. In 2014, we expect free cash flow to be unfavorably impacted by currency and a foreseen increase in working capital at the end of this year attributable to the timing of excise tax increases and related inventory movements. We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In September last year, we increased our dividend by a further 10.6%, bringing the cumulative increase since 2008 to 104.3%. Our target dividend payout ratio remains an attractive 65% and our dividend yield last Friday was 4.8% Last year, we spent $6 billion to repurchase 67.2 million shares. We also spent over $2 billion on the four business development opportunities that I described. As a result, given both the projected significant unfavorable currency impact on our reported results in 2014, and the fact that we are approaching the high end of the ratios supporting our credit rating, we are scaling back our target share repurchases in 2014, $4 billion. Please note that the rating agencies use different methodologies, some preferring to use gross rather than net debt measures and some weighting the company's cash position differently from other. As we emphasized last November, 2014 is going to be a pivotal year for reduced risk products, our greatest growth opportunity. Last month, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing facility near Bologna, Italy. That, along with a pilot plant in the same area, will provide an annual capacity of up to 30 billion units. The associated capital expenditures of up to €500 million are within the previously disclosed range of €500 to €600 million. This year, we will obtain the results of the clinical trials that we started in 2013. The data from these studies will be an essential part of our evidence package to substantiate the use of our Platform 1 product results in a biological impact profile close to that of cessation. During the first half of this year, we will continue with our perception and behavioral studies and finalize the packaging and labeling anticipation of planned city pilot tests in the second half of 2014 and our first national launch in 2015. In addition, we plan to enter the electronic cigarette market during the second half of 2014. As previously disclosed, we will increase our reduced risk product-related expenditures in R&D, operations and commercial activities by more than $100 million this year in order to meet this accelerated schedule. In conclusion, 2014 will be a very important year as we increase our investments behind both, our conventional and our reduced-risk products. The outlook for the Philippines and for the EU region as a whole is improving while Japan remains a significant challenge. We enter 2014 with robust fundamentals and good market share momentum behind our superior brand portfolio led by Marlboro. In addition, our profitability will benefit from the four business development projects that I outlined. However, currency volatility in emerging markets has increased significantly and we are only one month into the year. Our expectation is that we should be able, as of 2015, to meet our annual currency-neutral net revenues and adjusted OCI targets. Of course, the level of our share repurchases will depend on the impact of exchange rates, the interest rate environment and corporate tax reform here in the U.S. There are a number of important factors that underpin our belief, sequential improvements in the performance of challenging markets, in particular the Philippines, further structural improvements in excise tax systems, notably in the EU region; a superior brand portfolio, led by a reinvigorated Marlboro; strong pricing power based on our brands, an increased focus on cost controls and productivity gains and our commercialization of reduced risk products. Finally, our strong free cash flow will be used to reward our shareholders through general dividends and share repurchase programs. Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question and answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Hi, André. A couple of quick things, André. First, on the dividend. It's obviously a Board decision, but do you think there is a willingness this year to further take the payout ratio above the 65% target, so that there could be dividend growth?
André Calantzopoulos:  David, you said it yourself. It's the Board decision. However, the Board takes into consideration a number of factors, 65% target being one. Clearly, if you look at our history, we have a history of rewarding generously our shareholders even in turbulent times. That's what I can tell you.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Then, Andre, in the Philippines, you gave a lot of statistics and data, but could you explain? If you don't look necessarily at declared tax volume by your competitor, what really ultimately matters to you right is what's being reflected in the marketplace in terms of competitive pricing, and if you were to benchmark Mighty's price point versus Marlboro or Mighty's price point versus Fortune's, how much progress has there been made? How much more evident does it appear if there is competitively reflecting reality?
André Calantzopoulos:  David, clearly there is an improvement as I also said in my remarks. Clearly, we are seeing [the price] [ph] of the Mighty brand greater than 70% of the portfolio of Mighty Corporation going up to PHP1.50, although the price per carton does not yet reflect the second excise tax increase if we speak about reasonable economic returns. What has also happened is they left behind one of their brands called Marvel that represents 30% of the portfolio and roughly 6% to 7% of the market. Until this brand also goes to the right price point and price gap, clearly we are also obliged to maintain some presence in the segment. In summary, this is all about achieving the right price gaps as I have previously explained, but in general to fix the price gaps either you do it from the top or from the bottom, it appears that some progress is made to achieve this from the bottom. We need to wait until the new tax is reflected across the Mighty Corporation portfolio. Then as I said, there may be some upside in there. Now, they are still under declaring from what we understand based on mix and tax stamp [inaudible] a very large part, roughly half of their volume which helps them subsidize the lower price, but there is progress. There is increasing pressure on them. There are hearings in the Congress and also the fact that they lost their bonded warehouse, which we understand they were used to kind of declare that the products or the raw materials are for exports but essentially been used locally so that the pressure is mounted. We are kind of optimistic, but we'll know better as the year unfolds. Also to say, if we look at the outlook for next year, clearly, I think in terms of Philippines, probably we'll reach the bottom of the negative impact and we can only go better next year both in comparative and even in absolute terms.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe - Stifel:  Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask you first, André, in relation to the Philippines and having the government pressure in the company. Obviously, the price point still being too low, but can you give some information about the warehouse being shut down and taken the license away. Is that not forcing like in a more immediate movement by the company to raise prices at retail. That's not happening as quickly as you maybe thought it would?
André Calantzopoulos:  Difficult question to answer. Yes. The pressure should be there, because it's becoming extremely visible to the general public and the media, so we should expect some move but we need to see this move. That's all. Okay? Now, the other limitation on the Philippines that I explained in previous times is that over the long-term the tax system clearly is locked in our favor, because it closes the gaps top to bottom in a normal operating market and also allows us as the two tax tiers equalize to unleash a bit more pricing power of the mid-price brand because today the mid-price brands are down. By the way, the excise tax or the price of the different excise tax tiers is calculated which as you take the retail price you remove VAT and the excise tax and government ignores completely the retail margin which as we know is pretty hefty up to 20% and that's the price and that ex-factory price that determines the price tier which are classified and we have to be very careful on how much pricing we can take for Fortune for example not to jump in the upper tier. As the two tiers close over time, one or two years then you have much more pricing power from that perspective. Other development also that is positive in the Philippines, good at least, is that there will be pack stickers implemented towards the end of the first half of the year and we have to see how this impacts Mighty but definitely is another positive to us, so that's why longer term we are very optimistic about the Philippines, but still this year it has the impact I described on our profitability, it was about [inaudible].
Chris Growe - Stifel:  Okay. That's good color. Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up question for you on Japan. Understand that you are calling it still a significantly challenged market I think it was the term you used. It seems like they are going to get some pricing through that. I just want to be clear, is that going to be more than the tax increase? And if that is the case even if it declines a little bit more than the 2% underlying rate, wouldn’t that make for a better Japan in 2014, maybe that which you assume before?
André Calantzopoulos:  This is very early days in Japan. We have submitted our request to the Ministry of Finance, but it is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. If that holds and we hold it well, yes, it will give some positive pricing in Japan. However, we need to put this in the context of and that depends also what other competitors are doing of some additional potential impact on our share and also the fact that we may need to put some promotional, additional money to support that price level. Again, it's early days. It's subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance, but there is some small upside over there.
Chris Growe - Stifel:  Okay. Thank you very much for the answers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, everyone. André, we can appreciate the fact that you are willing to invest more into the business in 2014 to compete more effectively in some of your challenged markets. If I take a step back though, one of the drivers that's causing you to perhaps spend a little bit more is maybe the emergence of some of the newer competition, whether it's the local discount player like Mighty or JTI getting more aggressive in Japan or you've got the illicit trade that's picked up? I just want to get your perspective on why you think you are confident that the spending you are making in 2014 is really enough to put you in a position to compete more effectively to drive the company to grow in line with your long-term target in 2015 and beyond.
André Calantzopoulos:  Okay. First of all, the investment as we described is, one part is going behind our reduced risk product, okay? Clearly this is longer term as we were starting some volume in this product [in 2013] [ph], okay. Now, regarding the existing business, of course, there is need for investment in Japan and that is also to support our product introductions at the Marlboro campaign and other initiatives that I described. Some other markets where business needs are, we are ramping the investment. For example, Indonesia, okay? That's part of that normal business spending. Clearly, the investment in the Philippines is another type of investment. It's not a promotion or a marketing investment. It's more investing in our margins by holding the right price gaps and that's where the big investment is. As I explained this one, I believe this year clearly we see the bottom of the problem, and we can grow significantly out of this, just remaining flat year-to-year in the Philippines in terms of profitability it will increase by 1% of growth, [it just swings] [ph] 2 growth points, okay. I think also that for 2016 one element is our cost base in terms of manufacturing cost, will gradually improve. Already, if we see the growth of our manufacturing cost, it was 3.8% in 2013. It's going down to 3.2% this year and will further decrease next year and that's a positive addition. The conditions in Europe, I think, will slightly improve. We still have strong price base and we have a number of portfolio initiatives, including new initiatives on Marlboro I will describe in more detail in CAGNY. All that makes me fairly confident that after 2015, we can reach our revenue and operating companies' income target. And I don't even take into consideration Japan, which can certainly improve compared to the impact we have this year as we are lapping the year, where the actual product introductions happened in Japan and where Japan Tobacco got their fair share of excitement, which I remind everybody that were not existing before. Thank you.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just on the share buyback outlook for 2014, I can appreciate you're sort of looking at the rating agencies and the metrics that they looked at. We also looked at your stock price and valuation and it seems like really an opportune time if – certainly if the fundamentals are improving as we expect them to that it might be more of an opportune time to get more aggressive on the buyback. So, I just want to understand kind of your thinking process on the moderation in terms of the buyback. Is it really the currency issue? Are you willing to take on more U.S. dollar-denominated debt to kind of fund the buyback? What's sort of the thinking process there?
André Calantzopoulos:  Okay. I mean, currency clearly plays an important role here. Different agencies look at ratings in different ways as I said, ranging from total debt to EBITDA to net debt or adjusted net debt and one element in the adjusted net debt is that rating agencies start taking cash abroad at a discount, because, I mean, applying a theoretical, say corporate income tax rate, if that cost were to be repatriated in the U.S., so that reduces the capacity and you can do the math very easily yourself. The currency impact we just announced at prevailing rates, that is to stick for the year. It's at the cash flow levels, it's roughly $1.1 billion and at your EBITDA level is $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, so that takes a lot of share repurchase capacity out and as the year unfolds, we need to reevaluate the situation, so the other thing we need to note is we had $2 billion of business development projects that we just accomplished and frankly speaking, they're much more accretive to the shareholders than the share buybacks.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: The 2 billion, I'd say that's the $0.10 accretion that you called out in the…?
André Calantzopoulos:  It is net.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: It is the net? Okay.
André Calantzopoulos:  It is net of the impact it has on the lesser share repurchase.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Understood. Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Good afternoon, Gentlemen. Just sort of a bit of a follow on. Just to clarify again. Apologies for this one on the share repurchase. When you say getting towards the high end of your ratios for the credit rating agencies, do you mean that that by the end of 2014, you'll be towards planned and/or currently believe and therefore, in essence, you're flagging that perhaps in 2015 they'll have the cash returns or – will have to be more in line with cash flow and leverage held sort of more flat in 2015? Is that a reasonable assumption?
André Calantzopoulos:  Well, first of all, our current ratios are already at close to the upper end and had we continued with the $6 billion share buyback, we will have exceeded the ratios during the year if the currencies remain where they are today. Okay? This is one of the reasons, because what I would reiterate is that we want to absolutely maintain our rating. We had to moderate our share repurchase product. Now, looking at 2015 is a bit early days to say exactly what the target share buyback is going to be. I mean, I would like to see how the situation in the currencies unfolds during the year and then we'll take a decision later on. It's a bit very early to call it. I mean, clearly, we are [Inaudible] share buybacks, and the corridor in which we operate is, on one side, a credit rating upper limit and on the other side 100% cash outflow to the shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and we will always operate within that corridor in the future. That depends on currencies, interest rates, and longer term tax reforms in the U.S., I'm stating the obvious. Okay?
Jon Leinster - UBS: But you are going to maintain that credit rating?
André Calantzopoulos:  Yes.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Okay. Secondly, the Latin America or/and Canada region in the fourth quarter looks very strong profit performance in the fourth quarter. Is there anything, can you detail anything in particular that's behind that? Particular market or.
André Calantzopoulos:  It's a bit across the market, okay? It's also depending on the timing of price increases in Argentina as we know Argentina is an inflationary environment and we need approval from the Ministry of Finance all the time, the Minister of Economy. So, sometimes we have a delayed approval and that's partially what happened also in last quarter. We got the approval later, so we had to time differently the price increases.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Got it. Lastly, just on the EU, if you see EU volumes are down sort of 5.5 or thereabouts in the second half of 2013. Why do you expect to get somewhat worse in 2014 sort of six to seven?
André Calantzopoulos:  This is the best we can see to-date, okay. There is still some pricing that has to take place. The situation clearly looks slightly better last two quarters and I hope it's going to be confirmed in the first quarter 2014, okay? So, that's the forecast to the best of my knowledge to-date.
Jon Leinster - UBS: There's no change in terms of, there's no obvious signs that the governments particularly in Southern Europe are cracking down on illicit or something's changing in the market?
André Calantzopoulos:  We don't have the latest, latest figure of the global survey in the European Union. What I hear from the different markets, it seems to have stabilized. Clearly, it has improved in Italy. It's slightly up in France, but we see stability although the base remains high, so I think that if it doesn't get lost during the year and frankly, we don't have disruptive taxes in the European Union. Maybe we'll be slightly better, but today I cannot confirm that. I want a quarter more to be in a position to confirm.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg:  Hi. Good afternoon. Firstly, with respect to the foreign exchange headwind, could you break apart in that 13% or $0.71, how much is transactional and within that, how much is related directly to Japan. Then with respect to the transactional component at prevailing rates is it fair to think that that would disappear in 2015?
André Calantzopoulos:  Okay. Look, I can't give you the absolute precise number for the breakdown between translational and transactional. I think [Inaudible] 20%, but Jacek is here. He can give you a breakdown.
Jacek Olczak: No. You are right. André is right about last year. It's about 80% of our import was coming from translations and the remaining 20% was the transactional. With regards to the impact our $0.71 per share currency impact about 30% of the $0.71 versus the last year is coming from yen and 70% is essentially across all currencies and then there is a strong impact coming from Indonesian rupiah, ruble, Turkish lira and a number of other currencies.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg:  Okay. Thank you. Then with respect to the plain packaging, I was just wondering if you could comment on an article that appeared in The Scotsman suggesting that, PMI was suggesting if plain packaging was passed in Scotland, that country could be liable for GBP 500 million in compensation for the intellectual property. I was wondering what does that imply. Then if plain packaging goes forward in markets like Ireland and the U.K., can we gross up the amounts that might be expected based on the volumes there. Then just wondering what the status was of the WTO challenge and the BIT arbitration? Thank you.
André Calantzopoulos:  Okay. The article you are referring to, Erik, I have no idea. Frankly speaking, it is pure speculation, because I haven't seen or articulated any related number. Okay, first of all, we are far away from being in this situation, as you know, both into the U.K. and Ireland. It's just political talk for the time being and I don't see any new evidence has appeared in the horizon to justify even the U.K. reopening the issue. Now coming to the real concrete case, we have in front of us, which is Australia. Okay? If you look at the facts in Australia, is that plain packaging has no impact on prevalence or incidence after a year it is in the market, okay? I don't know where you can find stronger evidence about the impact, and, yes, we see a little bit of down trading, but we had foreseen this and that's part of what we explained in the BIT case. Regarding the cases, WTO is proceeding and the BIT case, if I'm not mistaking, a fresh hearing after submissions of written arguments from both parties is towards the end of February, actually this month, so we will see how this unfolds. As we always said, this is not a process that is going to take months. It's going to take still a year-and-a-half two years, okay?
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg:  Okay. Thank you. My last question then was with respect to illicit, and I was just wondering I appreciated the comments on illicit in Europe, but how would you characterize it globally for PMI's markets? Related to that, what are the prospects of recapturing illicit volume and what are the factors necessary for that? Thanks.
André Calantzopoulos:  Look, the only outburst of illicit is clearly the Philippines, okay? I think I have explained lengthily the situation. We are all aware of the problem, but that's illicit trend in a different form. That's a form we see increasingly in some places and that's probably the form that is the easiest finally to address, because it takes action from the government. A painful process in the Philippines, but that can be addressed. For the rest of the illicit trade, which is essentially illicit wide, we always said that the best way to address this is through the supply chain and especially asset in total and I think we are making very good progress in that area. Not yet done, but the progress, the awareness amongst the companies that produced in their efforts fairly confident and hopeful that by the end of the year we'll see tangible results. That’s one of the best ways to tackle illicit trade. I think that our prospects to reduce the illicit trade our objective is over the next one to two years to stabilize it and we are working with many governments as you know around the planet to achieve this and then gradually reduce it, but even stabilizing it is a great thing to achieve.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg:  Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Andre, I think this time last year you had already 75% of the pricing that you needed for your guidance. I think you just said that you are now at 60%. Can you give us the details why it's so much lower?
André Calantzopoulos:  Nothing particular that I can point to, okay? As we said last year, we had a bit more of inventory movement in the Philippines that was lower this year, because the tax increase was lesser. That’s one thing and the rest is pure timing. Indonesia is every year is the same. We start with the tax at the beginning of the year and gradually increase, so nothing particular to worry about.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: We shouldn’t read into that you are may be taking a more cautious approach to your pace of price increases.
André Calantzopoulos:  I think our pricing policy is very simple. We take a lot of factors into consideration, affordability price gaps, excise tax and our pricing is every year very strong. I think, I explained in my remarks there's slight differences compared to this year.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Okay, and then the other question I had in your conclusion of your prepared remarks. You pointed out that you expect to get back to your normal growth rate for revenue and operating income in 2015. You didn't mention EPS. Is there a reason for that?
André Calantzopoulos:  EPS depends on our share repurchases, okay? That's the bridge, and I explained what are the driving factors behind our decisions in share repurchases, so, in any given time we may be slightly above or slightly below that bridge. As I said, it is too early to call next year, okay?
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Understood. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  We've covered Philippines fairly well, but I just wanted to get one more question on that about the Marlboro flavor code launch in Mindanao. Have you seen that have a big impact there? Is it helping drive share? What's your thinking about how that's positioned and how it's working so far?
André Calantzopoulos:  Early days. The launch is both, tactical and strategic, so it's not meant yet to be expanded, so we will see how it reacts there, but that's kind of hedging also the price gaps in the Philippines.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  Thank you. That's helpful. In terms of margins or the cost structure, how different is it and what kind of impact does it add to the mix of your business?
André Calantzopoulos:  I can't answer by heart these margins. The margins are not very different, but this is a very small volume, okay? So, I don’t think that impacts our margins. Cut to skin in the Philippines, as I said by maintaining artificially low price for a period of time brands like Jackpot for example, where we have to subsidize to a large degree the excise tax and that’s much more impactful and it would correct this that will swing the profitability much more than Marlboro flavor code.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  Okay. Great. Thank you. Then just looking at Indonesia in its 3Q, when the inflation pressure on the consumer was the strongest and the category growth was the weakest, you gained share sequentially and year-over-year even despite having such a premium skew to your portfolio. Can you describe what changed in 4Q that would have gone down and what does it look like going forward? Is there some new competitive launches that are driving it or what are the big factors there?
André Calantzopoulos:  Well, I think the important thing is the performance as I said in my remarks of Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A, the two hand rolled kretek brands, but cost during the middle of the year, the price points and competitive brands in the same category, have not yet crossed that point. I don’t know exactly their pricing, but logic says that during the second half of this year, they should cross that point and should help our share. Okay? For the other brands in the portfolio are doing very well. And as I also said, we are increasing the marketing support of the brands, so I'm fairly optimistic about the share situation in Indonesia.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  But isn't likely to have pressure in 1H '14 driven from those two brands until the price points on competitors cross some of the same thresholds?
André Calantzopoulos:  I didn't hear the question?
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  You said that the competitors price points are likely to catch up crossing some of the same thresholds in the second half of this year, so is there likely still a lot of pressure in the first half? How do you see that playing out?
André Calantzopoulos:  I don't know how competitors are pricing. I cannot predict this obviously, but Indonesia in general, the tradition is, as I explained previously that, at the beginning of the year, your price is covering the excise tax increases and then you get net pricing during the year. You always have gradual pricing in Indonesia during the year, okay? As the year unfolds, we have our plan for pricing. I would expect, also given the excise tax and continued pressure from the clubs, other manufacturers are going to have a similar approach. So, yes, we will be probably under some pressure for the next few months, but overall we can see moderate share gains during the full year.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  Okay. That's helpful. Clove prices I know were in issue last year. There is not a whole lot of visibility on those, but it does look like they are down from the peak levels pretty nicely. How are you positioned there? Is that a tailwind in 2014?
André Calantzopoulos:  I wouldn’t say they lower in rupee terms. Clearly, the evaluation in dollar terms they have come a little bit down. Now, the purchase has happened in the market. We are quite I would say lucky this year that we had second year of a very decent cold, but if you look at the impact on us, we had a very big impact on our costs in 2012, '13 is going down and as we annualized the inventory replenishment the impact is going to be even lower in comparative terms next year, so we our other price stability and our price is going down.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  Okay. That's great. Thanks. Then just back to Japan pricing. Could you give a sense? I know you talked about how it looks like, the applications you've put in should give some net pricing. What's the split in the portfolio? Is my math about right that that would be around the 4-ish percent increase? If so, how much of that do you see maybe being at risk of trading down? If your applications are approved, what kind of net pricing do you think you might be realize?
André Calantzopoulos:  Yes. Day one, if you do the math, it's 4%. You are right, but then way also there Ministry of Finance is looking at areas, what the end result is going to be, including share, some down trading from that portfolio. As I said previously, there will be some share movement. As I also said, we will put some additional promotional money for a period of time. Overall if these prices are accepted, we will have some net positive.
Michael Lavery - CLSA:  Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citi: My first question has to do with Indonesia. I mean, I think it seems reasonable enough to expect that, that market will decelerate a little bit further into 2014, but can you offer a little bit more detail about kind of how you are thinking about the macro landscape in that market, just to give us comfort on that plus one, given kind of the challenges you had with guidance in that market last year. Specifically, are you expecting a reduction in the subsidy for fuel, because there's some chatter about that in the market.
André Calantzopoulos:  Okay. Look, the positives about Indonesia is it has positive demographics. Also, I think long-term account, it has a lot of potential and we have seen that there is up trading this year, last year and I expect up-trading to continue this year. We had some particular issues. The first one is, the disappearance of the low tax tier, but in a shortcut we call the sister companies. That has a 3 billion cigarette impact on us and we have discontinued these brands actually, but other competitors are much more affected. Clearly, it's either discontinue these brands or you take very substantial price increases, which I think is reasonable to assume it will have some impact on total market this year. Okay? This is one of the key factors why we have predicted its prediction 1% total market growth. The other one is the devaluation of currency is bringing inflation, and many of the goods in Indonesia including fuel are important, so we are seeing some inflation happening. That’s, again, unfortunately hit the low end consumers. If we see some deceleration is at the low price segment, and bigger the factor that I can describe today, but long-term as I explained, I think the country has tremendous potential.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Understood, so just to clarify, the embedded in your guidance is there no expectation for a change to fuel subsidies. It's just the inflation?
André Calantzopoulos:  To be honest with you, Vivien I don’t take the fuel subsidies actions, because I don’t know how to factor the mean, but try to bake in all this factors I described and that’s the best guest we have.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Okay. That's reasonable. Yes, complicated math to be sure. Turning to Russia really quickly, you called out price elasticity is one of the factors driving the 9% to 11%. I just wanted to clarify, is it just normal price elasticity or is it a change in price elasticity in Russia, that’s causing your outlook for downturn for industry volumes at the mid-point?
André Calantzopoulos:  I think, if I recall correctly, we took a slightly higher price elasticity given the magnitude of the increases. We need to look at the history of Russia, where with a tax plan which is very welcome, because it gives us predictability. We had three subsequent years of a substantial tax and price increases, so it's not only one year. Its three years. I think it's reasonable to assume some higher elasticity. Now, whether 9% to 11% is the final number we'll see as the quarters unfold, okay? I want to remind you two things. First, that this is the last year of large tax increases and we should be looking at a better tax environment, although continuously predictable as of 2015 and beyond. Secondly, despite this projected quite large volume decline, we also, as I said in my remarks, foresee a pretty substantially profitability growth in Russia due to margin improvement.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Understood. A follow-up on Russia. Embedded in that outlook are you seeing any negative impact to volumes from the implementation of wave one of the indoor smoking bans in that market?
André Calantzopoulos:  Marginally, it's always the case. We have put this in our guidance, obviously, okay? We also have, as I explained previously, this year the disappearance of kiosks. Although it's difficult to say that this will have an impact on total consumption, we have to see also what it really does in terms of impact on consumers, but always it's part of our estimate.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Wonderful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: Good afternoon, guys. André, question I guess going back to like the long-term targets in 2015 and I guess even beyond that. In November, you laid out the potential adult user base and margin potential for reduced risk product. When thinking about your growth targets for OCI, so I guess EPS will be impacted by FX, but is getting back to the target growth rate contingent upon the success of reduced risk product or is that incremental?
André Calantzopoulos:  If we look at 2015, clearly a contribution of reduced risk products is rather de minimis and we will be in investment mode, because of the expansion or introduction of reduced risk products for the next two, three years, okay? Reality is, for the time being the investment is going against our numbers, so at least once we come even and breakeven on this, the rest is incremental. For the time being, we are negative on reinvestment you appreciate that.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: You feel still comfortable about your targets in '15 and '16?
André Calantzopoulos:  Yes.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: Got it. I would leave it there, guys. Thanks.
Operator: That was our final question and I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, the Investor Relations team is currently in New York. As André reminded you, our next presentation will be at the CAGNY Conference on Tuesday, February 18th. Thank you, again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Philip Morris International fourth quarter 2013 full year earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2013 and comparing them to the same period in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies’ income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of this presentation, which is also posted on our website. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As anticipated, we achieved improved financial results in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year, despite the persistent severe macro-economic challenges and their extraordinary impact on industry volume, adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 10.9% in the quarter. A key driver of our performance has been the strength of our brand portfolio, despite its strong premium skew in a weak economy. We have strong market share momentum in the majority of our main markets with the key exception of Japan and the Philippines, where the issues are known. In the quarter, our market share increased in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions, while the international share of Marlboro, excluding China and the Philippines increased to 9.3%. Our quarterly share in Asia was impacted by the timing of our shipments in Pakistan, as well as the share losses in the Philippines. On a year-to-date September basis, our international share, excluding China and the Philippines is stable at 26.7%. The second key driver has been pricing. During the third quarter, we achieved a pricing variance of $488 million, bringing our total pricing variance for 2013 to over $1.5 billion. This compares favorably to the $1.3 billion achieved during the same period in 2012 and significantly more than offset the $900 million in unfavorable volume mix. In addition to the substantial amount of pricing taken at the beginning of the year we have increased prices in a number of markets since May. These include Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Spain and Ukraine. Strong pricing coupled with the timing of certain cost items enabled us to increase our adjusted OCI margin ex-currency between the first half and the third quarter of this year from 45.2% to 47.5% behind a strong expansion in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada region. We anticipate a strong fourth quarter. The adjustment to our reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance today reflects the impact of changes in exchange rate and estimated fourth quarter charge for restructuring and the cautious outlook regarding certain markets.  In July, we forecast a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.43 to $5.53. Today’s guidance includes an additional $0.02 in unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates for a total of $0.33 per share for the full year. This also includes approximately $0.03 per share for a fourth quarter charge related to the restructuring program that we announced at the end of last month and the $0.01 charge related to the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012, which we reported in the first quarter of 2013. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is now $5.35 to $5.40. Excluding currency and the aforementioned charges, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012.  Let me now review a number of our key geographies starting with the EU region. While unemployment continued to rise throughout 2012 in the 28 EU member states, it has remained stable this year at an average rate of 10.9%. However, unemployment has continued to increase notably in France and Italy. Despite a continued weak macroeconomic environment, the rate of decline in cigarette industry volume has gradually moderated throughout the year. After a decline of 10.6% and 8% respectively in the first and second quarters, cigarette industry volume in the EU region declined by 5.4% in the third quarter, helped by the reduction in the excise tax differential between the cigarette and fine cut in several Southern European countries and stabilization in the prevalence of illicit trade albeit at a high level.  For the full year, we are still expecting total cigarette industry volume to be down between 7% and 8% while fine cut industry volume should be up slightly. Going forward, we expect market declines to remain above historical level until European government successfully tackled the issue of unemployment and the illicit trade and consumer sentiment and purchasing power improved. Our business fundamentals remained strong across the EU region. We have gained share so far this year in all of the six largest cigarette markets in the region, namely France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. In addition, we have successfully leveraged our cigarette brand in the fine cut category, gaining one share point year to date September on a regional basis to reach 14.4%. While our OCI, excluding currency remained below last year level through September, it increased by 5.4% in the third quarter and we expect an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. Our four key brands Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris continued to perform well. They all gained cigarette market share in the EU region in the third quarter. During the quarter, the share of Marlboro was higher notably in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain; a remarkable result in view of the economy while L&M was the fastest growing brand in the region as a whole in terms of market share.  I will complete my overview of the EU region with an update on the status of the Tobacco Product Directive. The European parliament debated the proposal last week and accepted several amendments. The parliament notably agrees to a 65% health warning rather than the proposed 75%; that flavored cigarettes, including menthol variants, should be prohibited after a transition period of five years following the transposition of the TPD; that slim cigarettes should continue to be allowed and that e-cigarettes would not be treated as medical devices but rather be more strictly regulated under the TPD with higher nicotine thresholds than originally foreseen. We welcome these marginal improvements but regret that the European Parliament voted to ban an entire segment of the legal market, despite the inevitable increase in illicit trade that this will fuel. They have failed to provide a comprehensive framework for reduced harm products and have continued to include oversized health warnings without any apparent concern for property rights that the EU Charter protects and restrictions on pack formats. Finally, the proposal still contains an unworkable and discriminatory anti-illicit trade solution, which adds complexity to the legitimate supply chain without addressing the core problem. The next step is for the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to reach a final consensus. While the timing remains uncertain, the TPD is expected to be adopted before the end of this year or during the first quarter of 2014. There will then be a period of 18 to 24 months for the Directive to be transposed into national legislation at the Member State level, so that it may become effective across the EU by the end of 2015. Let me now turn to the two key EEMA markets, starting with Russia. We implemented an additional price increase of 4 rubles per pack during the June-July period on most of our brands, thus enhancing unit margins. Due to the higher prices, a deteriorating economic environment and the implementation in June of workplace smoking restrictions, there was an acceleration in the rate of cigarette industry volume decline in the third quarter to an estimated 9%, mainly impacting the super-low segment. For the full-year, we expect industry volume to be down by about 7% to 8%. Our market share performance continues to be resilient, in spite of competitors again lagging our price increases this year. Our August year-to-date market share was 26.1%, down by 0.1 share point, with Parliament in particular performing very well in the above premium price segment. Despite the lower volume, our strong pricing enabled us to increase our profitability ex-currency at a double-digit rate in the third quarter. In September, the Russian Duma approved the excise tax rates on cigarettes for the period 2014 through 2016. In line with expectations, the ad-valorem rate will increase from 8.0% to 8.5% next January, while the specific excise tax will increase from 550 to 800 rubles per thousand cigarettes. The pass-on for Marlboro would be around eight rubles per pack or approximately 11%. The increase in the specific excise tax is 45% in 2014, while the increases in 2015 and 2016 are slated to be 20% to 25%. In Turkey, cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 5% in the third quarter. Illicit trade declined only marginally from the second quarter. For the full year, we are forecasting an industry volume decline of around 7% to 8%. Our business fundamentals remain strong with sequential volume improvements. Our market share was up by 0.1 point in the quarter through August to 46.1%, with further gains from premium Parliament and at mid-price Muratti. Both Lark and L&M suffered some share erosion at the 6.50 Lira per pack price, due to the rapid emergence of a 6 Lira and below per pack segment. This was partly offset by our successful launch of Chesterfield at 6 Lira. The brand achieved a 1.2% market share in August, just three months after its introduction. Finally Asia, where I will start with the Philippines. Tax-paid industry volume in the third quarter declined at a rate of 6.7% to 23 billion units and this in line with the second-quarter trend and a significant improvement over the first quarter decline rate of nearly 40%. However, Nielsen consumer uptake adult smoking incidence and adult daily consumption data indicate that cigarette consumption is essentially stable while down-trading has been significant. The difference can be explained by the huge under-declaration by our main local competitor. While it increases its tax declared volume from an average of 500 million units per month in the first quarter to 1.1 billion units in the second quarter and 1.4 billion units in August, we estimate that this represented less than half of the volume it showed during this period. The retail price of its main brand Mighty has remained as one peso per cigarette. This is an economically unsustainable level when paying full taxes. We continue to work with the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs in our government authorities to address this issue. During the third quarter, we started to reduce our pricing support behind fortune and especially our lowest price brand. As a result, our monthly volume declined and our share of the tax paid market drop from 82.5% in the second quarter to 77.2% in the third quarter. We will continue to statistically balance the volume and profitability equation, but until the authorities address the issue decisively, the Philippines will remain a significant challenge.  Let me now turn to Japan where cigarette industry volume was down by just over 1% in the third quarter and remains on track to decline by about 2% for the full year. We have Tokyo objectives in Japan to reinforce our leadership in the growing menthol segment and to improve our performance in the larger non-menthol segment. To address the latter, we launch a new smoother tasting Marlboro (inaudible) September. This was to widen the feel of the brand to mainstream non-menthol adult smokers and improve Marlboro’s relatively small 6.2% share of this segment. We still accounted for 73.7% of the total market (inaudible) September. Our market share decreased by one point in the third quarter to 26.5% reflecting the impact of competitor’s launches in the second quarter on Marlboro’s menthol segment share and continued our switching from the more traditional (inaudible) and Philip Morris non-menthol volume. Marlboro’s market share of 12.2% was however in line with the previous quarter held by the launch of Marlboro clear. This new (inaudible) strengthened our pipeline of consumer relevant innovative offers should enable us to gradually stabilize our market share in Japan. Our optimizes is backed by the gradual reduction in the quarter-to-quarter share decline during the year and positive preliminary adult consumer update data for September. Earlier this month, the Japanese government confirmed its intentions to raise the consumption tax from 5% to 8% in next April. The percent for Marlboro would be about ¥14 per pack. But keep in mind that any price increase in Japan requires approval from the Ministry of Finance. Let me now turn to Indonesia where the economic slowdown and the increase in the cost of basic foods and fuel impacted the cigarette industry which grew by just 0.03% during the third quarter. As a result, we are now expecting full year industry volume growth to be about 2%. The pressure on consumer purchasing power has be most acute around the lower income strata resulting in 7.6% quarterly decline in cigarette volume in the low price segment while the premium at this price segments were PMI index grew by 3.5% and 1.4% respectively. This development (inaudible) growing adult consumer preference for machine (inaudible) has enabled us to continue to grow share. Sampoerna A and U Mild gained 0.6 points and 0.9 points respectively in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has strong momentum. It gained 0.5 point to reach a quarterly share of 5.4%. Meanwhile (inaudible) has lost share since it became the first major brand to move about the (inaudible) price point ahead of competitive brands. We have continued to increase prices on a regular basis and it has now fully offset the impact of the January export tax increase as well as higher clove cost. Effective October 1, the government enacted an amended regulation that addresses the loophole whereby large manufacturers could spread their production volume across sister companies and benefit from lower excise tax rates. This will affect around 2% of our volume, while the impact will be much more significant for several of our competitors. We await the government’s decision as to whether the regular annual excise tax increase will be eliminated in 2014 or at least moderated to take into account the anticipated imposition of a new regional tax of 10%. Let me also say a few words about the exciting business development projects that we have recently completed. The purchase of the remaining 20% interest in our Mexican affiliate for $703 million closed in the third quarter. This is a profitable 34 billion unit cigarette market, in which we achieved a 72.8% market share through September this year. Marlboro had a 51.7% share over the same period, one of the highest in the world. The acquisition is projected to be marginally accretive as of the fourth quarter this year. The second deal that closed during the third quarter was the acquisition of a 49% stake in Arab Investors-TA for $625 million. Algeria is a profitable $30 billion unit cigarette market, in which we achieved an estimated 40% share this year through September, driven by Marlboro. This investment significantly enhances our prospects in this important North African market. The agreement also opens the door to additional business opportunities in certain other North African and Middle Eastern markets, such as Egypt. The acquisition is projected to be accretive as of 2014. Our free cash flow was up by 45.5%, excluding currency, in the third quarter due mainly to a reduction in working capital and higher net earnings. In September this year, our Board approved a 10.6% increase in our quarterly dividend, which now stands at $3.76 per share on an annualized basis. It has more than doubled since the $1.84 rate at the time of the spin. Our target dividend payout ratio remains 65%. This reflects our strong confidence in our business fundamentals and future prospects. Our dividend yield is currently around 4.4%. We spent a further $1.5 billion on share repurchases in the third quarter and expect a similar level of expenditures in the fourth quarter. By year end, we will have spent about half of the $18 billion three-year program that was authorized by the Board in August 2012. Since the spin through this September, we have repurchased 539 million shares, representing approximately 26% of our shares outstanding at that time at an average price of $60.02 per share. During this time, we have been able to sustain our very solid balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our single-A credit rating. In conclusion, our business fundamentals are solid and our commitment to reward our shareholders remains steadfast. Despite persistently difficult macroeconomic conditions, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we anticipate a strong fourth quarter. We have updated our guidance to reflect prevailing exchange rates and the fourth quarter restructuring charge, as well as a cautious outlook regarding certain markets. Our 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance is $5.35 to $5.40 and represents a full year growth rate of approximately 10%, excluding currency and charges, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22. Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So, Jacek, I guess first question is, is just looking at the Asia region and I think at the corporate level the pricing variance was very strong, but within Asia, I think, sequentially the pricing variance actually decelerated. So, I’m wondering if you can just give us some perspective of how much pricing you've taken in Indonesia, what was the timing of that and then how much of that was offset by the Philippines lowering other price and how we should think about that in the fourth the quarter? Is this something that we'll continue to drive down to fourth quarter or is it the timing of the Indonesia pricing such that pricing actually accelerates in the fourth quarter and does that help your margins in Asia?
Jacek Olczak: It might just (inaudible) could give you some color. I mean, Asia, if I exclude Philippines, Asia margin for the quarter essentially would be flat so the Philippines is driving the margin performance in Asia in the quarter. Pricing wise, I mean, Indonesia is going as per planned, as you know we have a regular pretty often I should say as the price increases there. And as we said on the second quarter call around this time of the year, we should offset the pressure from offset the impact excise tax and clock prices.  So Indonesia now is in a positive territory when it comes to margin improved that should remain like this for the remaining fourth quarter. One thing which we have to remember which we don't have in Asia is that lack of pricing in Japan, right. So that is something which just appears from time to time. 
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just following up in Indonesia can you just give us your thoughts on the likelihood of the new website tax going in Indonesia next year and then just in light of the magnitude of the potential excise tax can increase if all of that goes through next year, how you are thinking about kind of the volume outlook as we go into 2014 and your ability to pats on the pricing in Indonesia. 
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean, pricing Indonesia remain strong for this and in the previous year, so despite the tax increases and also the price on the input cost, but I mean, I don't see today anything on a horizon which were to put that question mark on our ability to price in Indonesia. So pricing remains strong in Indonesia. What we know at this stage is that there will be local tax of 10% increase to the current rate under the question is our national government will like to put something on the top of that and (inaudible). I think at this stage, I think it's more of a speculation. I'm we'll know for sure what is the tax for Indonesia by the end of November, that is on a pricing in Indonesia.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: I mean, last question (inaudible) just looking at the volume decline obviously in EEMA and Ukraine, first just in terms of the outlook for those market, you've kind of given the rest of this year, but is this illicit trade situation really a problem that you think will continue to impact as we get into 2014 and then I think there are some charter about the government potential looking at reversing excise tax increases or were there plans to reverse the excise tax increases, unless we are given the illicit trade ramp up, so I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that prospect?
Jacek Olczak: Hi (inaudible) there is more of these show really situated in Ukraine than in Russia. In Russia, we started of serving some incidents, I think of about 3% as of second quarter in Russia. I think it stays about the level that actually is better reason for Prime Minister being interviewed in which we think that might be the issue to looking to the tax rate, growth of the tax rate in the three year plan. For a time being, what we know is that the tax will be the specific component and a little bit of that will go up in January next year; this will create a pass on or for the pass on the (inaudible). And then if you follow the three year plan, the remaining three year the platform should be 5 and 8, so 5 in 2015 and 8 in 2016. So for me it might be pretty much a speculation today, but I think they are more refers to the tax increase in the last year of the three year plan and on the third year of the plan. We are also watching, I think it's a very welcome by art, I mean, Russian government started watching how their prices is compared to the surrounding conflicts, which we know also plays the factor in any incentive, if you like really sits straight. So now as long as a Russian government on alert and they try to think proactively, I mean we very much welcome this development.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Couple of questions. First of all, Jacek, what’s the prospect that in trying to manage the business in what’s clearly a difficult macro and difficult volume environment that you feel that in retrospect, six months from now, nine months from now, that you haven’t done sufficient -- either sufficient marketing in certain of the markets or that maybe that you in retrospect will push pricing a bit too hard?
Jacek Olczak: No. My spent behind the brands is, I mean, for the total year, my spent will be above the last year’s level. I mean, we -- I know that we have some comps -- various competitions this year, I mean, quarters-on-quarters, but over -- for the full year, we will actually invest more than the last year. And as you will see also from our brand portfolio perspective, I mean if the brands wouldn’t grow market share we would -- if they would be lacking any investment. So I think we are doing right job is the deployment in the commercial organization, the number of innovations which we are bringing behind the Marlboro and all other brands, I think that -- the brand portfolio in terms of the equity, the help of the brands I think might be a strongest year we ever had since the spin of how the portfolio performs. Now you mentioned the macros which we had, there are macros in a country. They are not macros on a global basis. So we need to start looking into this a little bit more selectively because, yes, there was a bit of acceleration in Russia for the wrong reasons. Yes, we have a big challenge in -- major challenge in Philippines, but we also have a markets frankly speaking where the total industrial volumes are growing and there is uptrading. So I would be very careful, how we talk about the thing, the macro does not necessarily mean global.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Second question, Jacek, presumably your budgeting is not done for next year, you don’t know all of the excise tax increases that you would necessarily face and I am not asking for a specific prediction? But broadly speaking what’s your confidence level today looking out to next year that the company can deliver financial results that are consistent with the mid-to long-term plans that you have?
Jacek Olczak: Well, it is pretty challenging this year as many have noticed and we still have, in our guidance today, we said that we are going to deliver approximate 10% growth. So and we have the number. We had a number of challenges this year. Some of them may fade out, some of this may continue next year. I think, when I feel strong, when I feel confident is, the number of quarters which we demonstrated the dollar brands are very strong, including Marlboro despite the adverse microeconomic in some countries, especially European Union. Pricing power, I mean, you have seen our pricing power for the first three quarters of this year is $1.5 billion, I mean, that is very strong and that remains and I don’t see anything on the horizon, which could challenge this one. I think a tax structure is applying into our hand and frankly speaking, at this stage we are not aware, we don’t feel that there was any attempt to have a disruptive tax increase in the near future. So, there are a number of factors which plays into our hand. Total markets are priced driven by various factors in some geographies may continue through the 2014. I mean this we’ll have to see. I mean you notice that EU is getting sequentially better and better, but I don’t see under like data which would give me more opportunities. I am referring to unemployment, because employment is spread like pancakes since January this year, although the industry volumes development is encouraged. But, I think, I need another quarter or so, and then we will be more confident to say more firmly how do we expect our performance for ‘14 and beyond.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Hi. Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer - Citi: I wanted to touch on price elasticities globally given some of the buy downs that you have seen across some of your major market and Indonesia really comes to mind. I am curious, I appreciate that inflation is becoming a bigger and bigger issue, but have you noticed the deterioration in your price elasticity as well?
Jacek Olczak: No. I think on a global basis, where the elasticities are between minus 0.3 to minus 0.5. This is -- and in some countries you will see the higher elasticities but they are driven by the fact that the consumers disposable income is on the negative side, right. So in the real terms, our price increases may trigger the higher elasticity. I think Italy, Spain and a couple of the Southern European countries, they presume (inaudible) in a heightened elasticity levels just because there was an erosion on the disposable income. Indonesia, as you referred to, I don’t think we have the (inaudible) would be fairly in the range which I gave at the beginning.
Vivien Azer - Citi: So for Indonesia, I mean it’s the third guide down in terms of your outlook for volume growth in that market in roughly four months. So in your mind then it’s strictly that inflation has just gotten that much worse that quickly?
Jacek Olczak: (Inaudible) have a different (inaudible) inflation and the food inflation and I think the food inflation impacts more in relative terms, some of the consumer growth, therefore, we see the volumes in the lower part of the market actually declining and the volumes in the premium segment going up to make the total market growing. I think you will have a different elasticity defined on the -- again on a disposable income of consumer. I think the underlying grade for Indonesia, the growth rate for Indonesia for the summer December in the range of … maybe about 2%. I mean this (inaudible) from the demographic and some positive GDP per capital -- develop.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good morning Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning. So I just have a couple of questions for you. I wonder as first of all to Philippines, it sounds like there has been some sequential improvement in tax collection there. You gave some number on that which is great. And so if you have any color on that and basically what's going on in the market? My following question for that would be the tax increase goes -- there’s a tax increase in the Philippines next year as well. It’s more heavily focused on the low end. If they’re going to see something like that to help move those low end prices up, was there enough that government can do in this (inaudible) to get more tax collection among these low price brands?
Jacek Olczak:  Yes. That’s true that there was an increase in sequential tax collection. But you know the vision in Philippines is not about the colleting more taxes, but collecting the right amount of taxes. If somebody is paying more, but they’re still under declaring, frankly speaking of a little hedge, so the same sort of a tax evasion or cheating or whatever is the appropriate word for the situation. Now there is a tax increase next year. I think partially also why we are now moving with the prices up is to (inaudible) in the lower prices at the bottom of the market and waiting for the government to take the actions there, the government was immune by the fact that I was paying the taxes on a lower price portfolio. One of my competitors was not paying. So I think partially as going with the prices, they’re bringing the government into the play because somebody is going to also suffer by not collecting the taxes. So we see how those (inaudible). I mean Philippines remains challenging. But situations might change in Philippines. The government is really decisive and its Law Enforcement Act, enforcement authorities are decisive. They can fix the problem in a month. But we have to wait for this month.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And I had just one more question for you, just sort of a broad question. You had a set of investments in several key markets that started last year. You’ve now wrapped a lot of those investments. I guess as we see softer volumes, is that indication that the investments weren’t enough that you need to invest some more? I’m just trying to look ahead and think about what you can do to help spend some of the declines in volume, is it something you can do from an investment standpoint more about the total market decline?
Jacek Olczak: No, I see the softening of my market share as the market shares decline. I think it would be an indicator for me that I am underinvested with regards to that support. My investment, marketing sales investment et cetera, I mean in cannot mitigate the impact of the total market decline especially that in some countries I am competing with illicit products. I mean that’s not a function of the marketing investment (inaudible). As I said with the earlier question, this year we’re going to spend more than last year (inaudible) in the quarters. But the market share advancement of all of our brands, most of our brands including Marlboro in a number of the geographies, I mean it’s the best testimony that we’re doing the right thing and we’re supporting the brands in the right way.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay, thank you for your answer Jacek.
Jacek Olczak:  Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: I guess I’m still trying to understand how realistic your 10% EPS guidance is, given what this implies for volume growth in Q4. In other words, I think your volume growth needs to be positive in the quarter with pretty strong pricing to get close to your revised 10% EPS guidance. So how realistic is that for you to generate positive volume growth and then, I guess what gives you the confidence that this is achievable?
Jacek Olczak: Well, my total volume outlook for this year -- the total PMI’s volume outlook for this year is about in a range which we will have now for the nine months. So I think it is about 3%, ex-Philipines there is about our volume outlook. Pricing will continue as you’ll see quarter after quarter, we’re delivering strong pricing. There were some prices which were into some places, we’ll implement the pricing in the third quarter. So that will have a full benefit in the forth quarter plus as we said that the earlier -- at the Q2 call, we’ll have some better comps on the cost side. So I feel very confident that we will deliver the forth quarter. Although we’re fully aware that the fourth quarter growth rate will be significantly higher than what we had demonstrated in the third quarter. But this is all going as per plan as you remember I have started from the beginning of the year was that we’ll have a low start over the year and in the second part of the year, third and the forth quarter, this is where we expect to deliver the growth of this whole year.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: So everything’s falling in mind relative to your expectation?
Jacek Olczak: Yes.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay. And I guess just my final question, I think is, the EU Directive decided not to ban e-cigs as medicine. So I’m curious, how does this change your thinking on the category and your timing for entering, if at all?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean, we -- you know about our plan, right that we said that we are working on three platforms and we’ve showed that we aim to 216, 217 for this whole commercialization. I think we stay on track with this one. I mean the directive -- what we’re missing in the directive is a little bit more time spend -- just later and trying to figure out what the frame work legislation should be for us meeting new product being e-cigarettes or others, new generation products that modified to risk tobacco product into the market. The lot of focus was to spend on some other elements which I don’t think addressing really public health council which directive was suppose to authorize that the whole novel product territories are not fully addressed. But, yes, I mean if a good development that the e-cigarettes will be in the tobacco product directive rather than under the farmer’s legislation, we will see. Also the other reasons I can’t talk where we would enter the market and how we could accelerate our entrance to the market, but we are very excited about this category working on our plan on -- we’re making a progress in accordance with the critical part delivering the clinical status. We are searching the consumers and organizing our -- building our capacity to be on time of -- everything goes okay maybe ahead of time with the products in the market.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Morning gentlemen. I’ve got a few questions actually. According to me, the market volume guidance was 2% for the full year seems to imply as to 3% to 4% in the last quarter, I mean, is there any reasons, the industry volume should improve quite rapidly in the forth quarter after relatively weak third quarter? And secondly, the Italy was quite a major -- market volumes down 4% in the third quarter. So quite a significant improvement than what we’ve seen in the past. Is there some particular fact behind that and do you expect that to be sustained with recent sort of that increases. Is that -- is that likely to deteriorate again?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. I may start with Italy. I may Italy -- yes it has had some improvements in the decline rate of the total industry volumes. I think what we have said also in Italy is a little bit of less of illicit product and I think it also partially might have contributed to the better results in the quarter. We will have to see what -- how that thing, how the lower incident of illicit product versus the beginning of the year, as you remember, I think they had spike to 11%. This lower illicit incidents, I don’t know how long it’s going to stay. So that may support the volumes. I mean as the VAT increase, I mean, it's an average sort of government trying to impose some extra taxes and are hoping for the better consumption. So that's a little bit not very welcome, but let's see how does it unfolds in Italy.  In Indonesia, I think there are some seasonality also behind the quarters and I think this is what drive us to believe that we will have a Indonesia will deliver on above the 2% for the full year and are little bit calls for the better or stronger volume performance in the fourth quarter of this year.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Thank. Then, we just going back to the Philippines, you are low with prices; I'm just going to get the timeline right. So you are low with prices in Q2 and then what that's appeared in Q3, did you actually sort of increased them again?
Jacek Olczak: We lowered prices, actually we start lowering the prices at the end of Q1. We were in full fledge in the Q2 and I think towards the end of the Q3, we started moving the prices up.
Jon Leinster - UBS: So certainly in the end of Q3 you started raising them. So in spite with the price reductions really didn't help at all in terms of market share. 
Jacek Olczak: There was a down trading. 
Jon Leinster - UBS: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: I saw that German course have spent the use of it (inaudible) campaign in Germany, how does it impact your business?
Jacek Olczak: They've banned some execution aspect of that campaign. But now considering you know that's available to our (inaudible) it's how we're going to go forward because we are pretty confident that we have not violated in local legislation. I don't think -- you know that the other forms of the market going to support to brand which we can continue delivering there because they are just questioning some aspect of that campaign. So I don't think we'll have a -- we should have any negative input of a suspension of this executional element of this company.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Any concerns that other European cords will pick the same line of argument?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean, Germany is one of the few if not the only one country in the year which still allows you to bill board right, so they were questioning the bill board and so I think (inaudible) commercial in was with the other European countries the campaign is being delivered to consumers more for the one to one and other means. So no I don't think have any repercussion in the remaining European countries.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: And then I've also seen reports out of Australia, the convenience stores are now reporting an increase in illicit trade after the standard packaging and all that went into effect at the beginning of the year, are you seeing the same thing?
Jacek Olczak: We are seeing the same thing. I don't have the hard data, but the early information which we received from our obsolete in Australia indicates that there was about illicit traded about doubled versus what it used to be before the implementation of (inaudible) on illicit trade, but I'm not extremely surprised by this, because we taught that the play impact may facilitate the illicit trade and fortunately this is happening.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Do you think that the fact that, the data is now starting to come out and make the legal challenge easier?
Jacek Olczak: Well, sorry the data will -- I think on the illicit trade will come out soon, once it's started out to confirm. I mean, this speculation -- I mean we've -- when it comes to our claim under the VAT, VAT in Hong Kong, I mean, that we are progressing there as per the calendar, but yes I mean, there is enough element which we have been raising with the government before the playing packaging is not addressing consumption frankly speaking, it will not get the total volume developments in Australia. You don't see any declines in total volumes as you have the appear of the, heightened appearance of illicit trade and I think also you might say that you see some acceleration in the down trading. This is all as we were saying this will be the impact of a playing packing. 
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks. (Inaudible)
Jacek Olczak: Okay
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Hello. Just back on the Indonesia for a second. Obviously the inflationary pressures are some of what’s slowing category growth, but it also was the easiest comp of the year in the third quarter? What did it look like sequentially, was there improvement coming out of the quarter, I guess I want to understand a little better where the strength would come in 4Q, because that was one of the toughest comps last year as well?
Jacek Olczak: Well, usually, I think, the first quarter in the Asia was the strong quarter, that is what I was referring that there is some seasonality impact et cetera which you have in Indonesia. So, therefore, yes, we expect the stronger quarter this year. As I said earlier, I don’t think that the growth rate of the industry in the third quarter is underlying growth rate of the industry, right. I think the underlying growth rate is a closer to 2%, about 2%]. So, yes, you will have the fluctuations between a quarter.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: No. I understand that, I guess, but the two things I am trying to get out is, if there’s seasonality, but it’s -- a stronger growth rate in the fourth quarter, does that give more and more exaggerated every year? And then just back to the third quarter, can -- do you have any visibility on what the progression was throughout the quarter, was it same down in July and then flat in August, and up whatever percent in September that you can see the consumers adjusting to the inflation pressure that some of that momentum should continue into 4Q?
Jacek Olczak: Well, consumer are adjusting to that inflation pressures, I would just say earlier, I mean, you have a different rate, sorry, different impact by consumer income classes, okay. So if you have a second, I think it was second spike in a food inflation this year, one was at the beginning of the year, one was in the third quarter, well this has an impact on the consumption levels in the lower price classes, presumably more on the daily consumptions of smoking incidence, but this is what we have serve. So there will be adjustments in this -- in the consumer pattern. So that’s of -- that is on the volume side, this will happen.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. And then just on Japan for a moment, you reminded us that the Ministry of Finance needs to approve the price increases, which is of course true? Are you worried about getting that approve at all or you -- was that just stating that term kind of highlight the procedures involved?
Jacek Olczak: The role in Japan that if you want to change the prices, you have to seek the approval of the Minister of Finance, so that’s going to stay, also some Prime Minister and others have publicly, I think, before when the discussion was about the sales tax that talking about the fact that it wouldn’t like necessary to spike inflations while having the sales tax increase. So we will have to see. We have not filed for the tax -- for the, excuse me, for the price registration in Japan and there is still a time before the sales tax is implemented.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. Thanks. And then, I just want to make sure I have one clarification earlier in the call but as you said you expect profitability improvement in 4Q, was that versus 3Q '13 or versus 4Q ’12?
Jacek Olczak: I was referring to the growth rate of the EPS ex-currency in the fourth quarter over fourth quarter.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. And then just lastly following upon e-cigarettes, I understand you have your next-generation products that you’re developing and the EU TPD doesn’t really directly involve I think I don’t believe? But just in terms of e-cigarettes and then having what’s impact maybe little bit more of a Regulatory Green Light? At what point do you consider that a threat enough if those keep growing that you would want maybe getting involved in something on earlier timeline than your NPGs with, something like in e-cigarette, is there a launch you would consider, obviously you’ve got the U.S. market where the big three are getting involved and Lorillard is coming to the U.K.? Do you think that’s a place that you want to play or you intend to just wait for the next-generation products that you have coming?
Jacek Olczak: I’d said we are very closely watching the developments in the category. I think between the reasons why we said earlier that we’re working on the three platforms and one of the platform is essentially in the territory of e-cigarette, is that we believe there will be a reason there will be a market for all three platforms. Now the question still remains and if you look at the performance of e-cigarette category, a lot of attention is more on the marketing side side and to our knowledge, that the tension is on the product side. I think what is extremely important is in our (inaudible) strategy is to get to the product right. So I don’t think -- I’ve said it on a number of occasions, it’s not that you need to be first to the market, you need to go to the market with the right product.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Hello. I was hoping you could comment on Russia in particular and why the premium shipment volume was down so severely in the third quarter (inaudible) were down 17%. That seems a bit odd with what's been relatively stable to rising trend for the mid to higher price segments. So I was wondering if something had been going on there that would explain that as an aberration or is that something that we should be considering as something that could have some continuing effects?
Jacek Olczak: The difference between our shipments to the distributor versus what is happening in the market, so the companies would (inaudible) these issues. Now if you look at the total market size in Russia maybe to give you a more color on this one, I mean the market was down about 7.9% if I remember correctly, for the quarter. If you look at the composition of the decline about, up to 17% of the decline came from the low price segment, but the value went about -- the value (inaudible) in a premium segment, they declined by a little bit by less than 3.5%. That’s 3.3%. So you could see that, the (inaudible) segments in Russia are doing relatively well. This price impacted the (inaudible) price increases and the lower segments have the more ease under more pressure. But again I think it has been the same explanation to the use for Indonesia. I mean a different consumer growth that impacted differently by the price increases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: Hey, good morning, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: I just had a question regarding Japan in terms of the pricing that you would consider taking; have you thought about I guess which brand may get which level of pricing? I think you mentioned that it’s ¥14 per pack. But I think you want to probably increase it in ¥10 increments. How much -- is there a focus on maybe your price gaps versus (inaudible) and which brands will get what level of pricing?
Jacek Olczak: (Inaudible) we have decided our pricing strategy and I think it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment further on this at this time.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: Okay. And then just regarding the illicit trade that you’re seeing in certain countries like -- Turkey you said, it’s still pretty bad, maybe you’ve got a little better sequentially. Ukraine and Russia are still also pretty bad. Does it have to get worse maybe before the government really steps in there and it actually starts to get better?
Jacek Olczak:  No, actually I mentioned earlier (inaudible) referring also to some incidents, higher incidents of illicit product, tobacco illicit products and I think alcohol and that the government is considering now the option how to tackle the problem at the early stages is very welcomed. I wish many other governments would act so promptly when the problem is small rather than let the problem to grow to the almost, in some places difficult to manage the levels. Ukraine is a little bit of a different story. Ukraine is also the story of the counterfeit products, not only illicit product. So every country has its own sort of the background in that. Turkey, sequential there was a slight improvement. We know from the part of the Turkish government, was highly very decisive and acted very promptly to address the issue which they can repeat more of the same. So let’s wait.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: Okay, thanks for that and just my last question. Is it possible to get some insight in terms of what the FX impact would be overflowing to fiscal ’14? I think you’re (inaudible) some yen hedges as well as, can you give me -- give us some magnitude of what you see in fiscal ’14?
Jacek Olczak: 
 --: Our issue is when we will revise the forecast now -- guidance now is essentially not because of yen is very much because of developing currency -- developing countries currencies. So I think Indonesian rupiah was the biggest driver of our revised currency guidance -- variance guidance.
Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America: All right, guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of David Hayes with Nomura.
David Hayes - Nomura: All right, gentlemen. Hi. Just in terms of coming back to the underlying EPS cuts since the second quarter. You’ve obviously called out Russia is little bit worse since then, Indonesia as well, Turkey looks a little bit better, EU about the same. I just wonder whether there is anything else outside of those markets, it was driving that slightly low underlying EPS outlook that we haven’t spoken out. And then I guess related to that in terms of the Russian side of things. You mentioned in the second quarter stage despite the volumes down more than you expected, you still saw profitability, you said explicitly the profitability will be up year-on-year, on the slide it wasn’t there this time. I just wonder you can confirm that you still see profitability in Russia itself being up for the full year? Thanks very much.
Jacek Olczak: Yeah. Yeah. I mean we see the profitability in Russia being very strong year-on-year as we demonstrated in this quarter. In terms of the countries or the market reach, we referring now at the guidance. I think, yeah, it’s Philippines which is on the list. In the Japan share of market since we had, okay, sequentially, we’re still seeing stabilization in Japan, but yeah we lost that one share point, one full share point on a quarter. The Indonesia total market is softer in terms of the growth rate that we initially thought for the full year, so we’ll have to acknowledge that one. That’s about it. I think the main drivers.
David Hayes - Nomura: Okay. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: Thank you for taking my questions, Jacek. First, I wanted to ask about…
Jacek Olczak: My pleasure.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: … in light of your recent success in Thailand and postponing the placement of those big health warnings on packages. What’s your -- what’s PM’s outlook for regulatory efforts in emerging markets? Which markets do you see your biggest threats on that front?
Jacek Olczak: Frankly speaking, it is not much that we cover more news on the regulatory front because, yes, I mean, the TPD, the regulatory developments which we’ll have to wait, there’s still a few months until we see what is the final conclusion on this one. And yes, I mean here and there you might have some regulatory initiatives but nothing actually on the horizon which would not allow me to sleep at this stage.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: Okay. And if I may ask one last quick question, a bit of an oddball, given the rise in the popularity of electronic cigarettes hear in the U.S., what’s the policy for PM in terms of employees in your New York office consuming e-cigs. Is that always been allowed to something you’re allowing now given the popularity, what are you guys doing with that?
Jacek Olczak: Well, our New York office is a non-smoking office. This is for the convention of cigarettes. I know myself that presumably you will see me on number of occasions and I’m smoking my NGP. I think we would have to -- it's much more to that element of how disturbing you’re actually for others around you. It’s more of the matter of a heart disease than defining in the policy.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. Now, I’d like to turn the floor back over to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the investor relations team here in Switzerland. Again thank you for joining us and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2013 and comparing them to the same period in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes or to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies’ income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the back of this presentation, which is also posted on our website. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As previously foreseen, we had the challenging second quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS was up slightly, excluding currency. Cigarette volume declined by 3.9% due principally to lower industry volume in the EU region, Russia, Turkey, and the Philippines as well as inventory movement in Japan and Russia. Pricing remained strong, and we have solid share gains, particularly in the EU region. However, this was not sufficient to offset that impact of unfavorable volume mix, additional investment, notably in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Russia and higher clove and tobacco cost in Indonesia. Our business fundamentals remain solid and we are confident in our ability to achieve the ex-currency guidance that we established in February and the (inaudible) funds in May. However the evolution of tax paid triggered at industry volume will remain a key valuable and our main challenge for the remainder of the year notably due to the growth of illicit trade. We anticipate better results during the second half of the year and in particular a strong fourth quarter. This is based on the expectation that our volume declined to moderate other small-scale (ph) have adjusted higher prices implemented earlier this year. Our strong commodity share performance in the EU region will continue, margins will improve thanks to recent price increases and we will have favorably due to the respect of the timing of investment in infrastructure and marketing. Since April we have weakness, a sharp decline in the value of some currencies relating to commodities and emerging markets, as the Australian Dollar, Indonesia Rupiah, Mexican Peso, Russian Ruble and Turkish Lira. Accordingly at prevailing exchange rate our guidance now includes a full year unfavorable currency in part of proximity $0.31 per share as of $0.19 in our previous guidance. I will revise the reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is that for $5.43 to $5.53 compared to $5.17 in 2012. The change already reflects into currency impact. Excluding currency this continues to represent a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% compared to other adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012. This is inline with our mid to long term currency neutral annual adjusted diluted EPS growth targets. Let me now discuss our second quarter results in more detail. Our cigarette volume was down by 2.6% excluding the Philippines; this reflects 3 million (inaudible). First cigarette industry volume in the EU region continued to decline, second industry volume in Russia was impacted by the livestock driven price increases that were implemented at the beginning of this year as well as weakening economy. Third, our second quarter volume reflected a difficult comparison due to the inventory replenishment in Japan in Q2 of 2012 as well as the lower market share. However, there were some favorable development. First the decline in our volume in the EU region of 5.9% was significantly less than the 7.1% decline that occurred in the first quarter. Second, we again achieved volume growth in the Asia region excluding the Philippines and finally the volume growth continues to be strong in the Middle-East and North Africa. Pricing continued to be the key driver of our income performance, the sales growth set the impact upon favorable volume mix on that revenues excluding currency. However adjusted OCI declined by 3.4% excluding currency. This was due to unfavorable volume mix, higher product cost notably in Indonesia where higher clove and tobacco cost have to-date only been partially passed on. Investment in business infrastructure and marketing in Russia since the second half of last year and additional spending in the Philippines in the second quarter of this year to seek to achieve more sustainable price gaps. Our ability to take pricing remain solid including in the EU region. During the second quarter we achieved a favorable pricing variance of 479 million bringing our June year-to-date total variance to over 1 billion. In May we increased retail prices in Germany by EUR0.20 per pack across our portfolio. In June we announced a favorable (ph) price increase in Russia for (inaudible) across most of our key brands. We have also increased prices recently in Belgium, Canada, Egypt, France, Greece, Indonesia, Spain, Switzerland and Ukraine. This price increases will help us achieve another strong pricing variance during the second half of the year. Let me now review a number of our key geographies starting with the EU region. We have seen some signals that politicians recognized the further spending cut to try to reign in budget deficit and not going to help Europe telling to coordinate. However, few conclusive measures have been taking so far to stem the continued rising unemployment which reach a seasonally adjusted rate of 12.2% that you made this year this is compared to 11.3% a year ago. In the second quarter regional cigarette industry volume was down by 8% and the regional fine cut industry volume declined by 0.8%. During the quarter, we witnessed continued adult consumer down-trading to lower priced products, including illicit cigarettes. Due to the continued deterioration in the economic situation and the resulting growth in illicit product, we are now forecasting a decline of cigarette industry volume in the EU region of 7% to 8% for the full year 2013 compared to our previous forecast of around 6.5%. While industry volume declined slightly faster than previously foreseen, we were able to achieve a better than expected market share. Consequently, our cigarette volume declined by 5.9% and our fine cut volume grew by 12.3% during the second quarter. On a regional basis, our cigarette market share increased by 0.7 points in the second quarter to 39.3%. The gain was driven in particular by Marlboro, which grew by 0.5 points to 19.4% with L&M, Chesterfield, and the Philip Morris brand also performing well. In the fine cut category, we gained 1.2 share points to reach the original share of 14.9% as we continue to successfully extend our cigarette portfolio into this category. Let me focus on the three of the key markets in the EU region, mainly Germany, Italy, and Spain. Cigarette industry volume in Germany declined by 7% in the second quarter and fine cut industry volume decreased by 0.7% following slight increases in March. However, it should be highlighted that the underlying decline in cigarette industry volume was 2.8%, after the elimination of estimated trade inventory fluctuation. Our cigarette share grew by 1.2 points in the quarter to 37.6% driven mainly by the strong performance of Marlboro, which achieved its fifth consecutive quarterly year-on-year share increase. The economic downturn in Italy continues with unemployment increasing from 11.9% in February to 12.2% in May. Italy on cigarette industry volume declined by 7.2% in the second quarter and a fine cut industry volume was down by 10.5% impacted by the reduction in the price cuts between fine cut products and cigarettes that followed the large fine cut tax increases mid last year. The underlying fundamentals of our business in Italy remained strong. Our cigarette market share grew by a further 0.4 points in the quarter to 53.3%, thanks to the continued momentum of Marlboro and the success of the Philip Morris Selection in the international low-priced segment. We also gained share in the fine cut category with an increase of 7.9 points in the second quarter to 37.9% following the successful introduction of Marlboro fine cut. We were encouraged by the decision of the Italian government to postpone to October, the 1 point increase in VAT that was due to be implemented in July. We believe that such a measure would reduce consumer spending and hope that it will be further postponed or cancelled. At the end of last month, the Spanish government modified the excise tax on tobacco products in order to enhance the predictability and stability of excise tax revenues, which had been undermined by adult cigarette smokers down trading to lower tax alternatives. The specific excise tax on cigarettes was increased while the ad-valorem rate was reduced. At the same time, the royalty of excise tax burden on fine cut was increased. The resulting reduction in the price gap between cigarette and fine cut should help address the recent market in (inaudible) whereby cigarette industry volume declined by 12% in the first half of the year, while fine cut industry volume increased by 26.4%. Our cigarette market share was up by 2.3 points in the quarter to 31.9% as Marlboro, Chesterfield, and L&M all grew. Let me now turn to the EEMA market starting with Russia. In Russia, we estimate that cigarette industry volume declined by about 6.4% during the second quarter as adult smokers reacted to tax-driven price increases of RUB6 to RUB7 equivalent to 9% for above premium to 22% for super low-priced brands and to a weaker economy. Our volume declined by 11.4% during the same period as our distributor reversed its first quarter inventory buildup. Through the end of May, our quarterly market share remained resilient and was just 0.2 points lower at 25.9% despite the late price increases by several competitors following the January tax increase. Parliament, L&M and Bond Street continued to gain share which is more than offset by the declining of Chesterfield. We expect higher profitability for the full year 2013 than last year due to our pricing strategy that we’re forecasting the cigarette industry volume will decline 6% to 7% on a full year basis. In Turkey there was a resurgence of illicit trade during the second quarter when it reached over 20% of total consumption due to the governments focus on other priorities. As a result cigarette industry volume decline by an estimated 11%. It is difficult to forecast the full year performance due to the uncertainty surrounding future trend in illicit trade. However, unless the government acts quickly to stabilize the issue cigarette industry volume could be down by 8th March at 7% to 9%. The premium on mid-price segment continue to perform well. Our mix in growth driven by the strong momentum of Parliament and Muratti. However the low price segment which includes Lark and L&M prices 6.5 Lira per pack was impacted by the expansion of the super low 6 Lira per pack segment. This led to a slight erosion of our overall markets during the second quarter to May on 0.5 points to 44.8%. We have addressed this issue through the relaunch of Chesterfield at 6 Lira per pack. In Asia we’re continuing to strengthen our business despite the disruptive tax increase in the Philippines. Our cigarette volume grew by 1.5% excluding the Philippines with Indonesia the key contributor. In Japan cigarette industry volume decreased by 2% during the second quarter and we continue to forecast the similar decline for the full year. However, due mainly to the inventory replenishment that have occurred in Q2 of 2012 our volume was 10.2% lower than this year. During the second quarter we witnessed continued intense competitive activities and the successful launch by Japan Tobacco of its first Mevius cut (inaudible). Our market short decline by 0.9 points to 26.9% driven by lower shares for Lark, the Philip Morris Brand and primarily the momentum Menthol (ph) variance of Marlboro. We expect our market choice to remain under pressure in the second half of the year so we believe that we will make progress overtime thanks to the continued resilience of Marlboro and a strong pipeline of innovative new products. Indonesian industry volume grew by 3.5% in the second quarter while we outperform the industry through the volume expansion of 6%, for the full year we now expect an industry growth rate of approximately 4% which were below the exception of the growth rate of the last two years is consistent with the historical average for the market. Our market share grew by 0.9 points to total 6.1% driven by Sampoerna A, U Mild and the Marlboro partly offset by the decline of (inaudible) which moved above the favorable 1000 rupiah per cigarette a steep price point. Premium Sampoerna A is a clear leader and growing but increasingly price competitive (inaudible) and machine made process (ph) segment. U-Mild is the leading unique price brand in the segment while Marlboro continued to strengthen it's position in the white cigarette segment where it develops a segment share of 7% to 6% during the second quarter. The final market that I will talk is the Philippines, the decline in the tax based industry volume moderated significantly during the second quarter where volume down by 7% despite the continued high prevalence of local non-tax paid cigarette that are not included in the data. We increased our investments behind Fortune and lower price brands to seek to achieve more sustainable price cuts. However despite the very large tax increase our local competitors Mighty and Marvel brand have remained at last year’s attractive price point at 1 peso per cig. This gives the competitor a clear price advantage in the market where fixed sales (ph) account for about 70% of the volume. We want the limited improvements in tax enforcement wide spread availability of non-tax based domestic cigarettes remain a critical issue. This is driving a greater level of down trading and originally foreseen and that has impacted our volume, our mix, and our market share, which declined to 82.9% in the quarter. We are continuing to work with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to achieve a level playing field. Our volume increased from 13.5 billion units in the first quarter to 19.1 billion units in the second quarter. For the full year 2013, we forecasted our volume will be down around 20% to 25%, but that the decline in consumption should be significantly less. In conclusion, we remain confident that we will deliver solid financial results in 2013, industry volumes remains a key challenge. However, we expect to continue to achieve solid market share as well as higher prices. There is no change to our guidance attributable to business results. Our revised 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance reflecting prevailing exchange rate is $5.43 to $5.53. Our guidance continues to represent the full year growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22. We anticipate strong free cash flow growth excluding currency in 2013 and remained steadfast in our commitment to reward our shareholders through attractive dividends and substantial share repurchase programs. Our dividend yield last Friday was 3.8% and our target dividend payout ratio remained 65%. During the second quarter, we spent $1.5 billion in share repurchases and have now repurchased close to 25% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin. Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Hi, Olczak.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Good morning. I guess my first question is in terms of the quarter where did it fall relative to your expectations and shipping since your volume in overall business has to improve quite substantially to hit even the low end of your 10% to 12% currency neutral EPS growth, what gives you the confidence that you can hit these targets and then what are the key drivers of this?
Jacek Olczak: Well, to start with the quarter, second quarter, I mean nothing frankly speaking came in the second quarter as a surprise to us. I mean, we knew that we will have an inventory adjustment in Japan, and maybe at this stage, I can give you a little bit more details over the margin instead of that adjustment, if our shipment was down in Japan by about 10% if you take the market decline down, it’s about 8%. So, on shipments, you are talking well around the 1 billion of the adjustments or around the 1 billion of adjustments. You know that Japan is a pretty profitable market to us as the volumes are expensive. And in Asia, we also knew that we are going to scale up the investment behind the defending the price points in Philippines for just these two countries to market, put the drag on the results, but as expected I mean we knew it. As a surprise, I think came a bit weak start in June in Japan and I think the sudden resurgence of the illicit trade in Turkey. I mean, it is where the things were at the beginning of the quarter, where we have been heading in our market. When it comes to second half of the year, as you have seen, we had a very strong pricing in the first half of the year, $1 billion, I mean, it clearly gives us and the pricing is – pricing environment supported by the tax environment, I mean, (it wasn’t) pretty comfortable about delivering a strong pricing in the second half of the year. Second thing is there is just the timing of the annualization of our investment from last year to this year. If you look at our total cost variance, which you will have on the cost of goods sold and the total cost of the company, essentially the negative variance, which we have for the first half of the year that is for the year. So, in second half of the year, we should be essentially closing flat versus 2012. So, as I said, we have a strong pricing. The tax environment is reasonable. The cost comps is going to be definitely easier for the second half of the year, and needless to say, that the business performance measured by the performance of our brands in essentially most of the geographies, I mean we’re doing pretty well. So this gives us the confidence that we can deliver the results for the full year.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay that was really helpful I appreciate that and you mentioned pricing has been strong and you expect that to continue in the second half. I’m trying to understand you know how your volume could be impacted for the second half and the full year. You suggested last quarter that your volume growth ex-Philippines would be positive this year. I would like to, if you think that’s still possible given again how weak the volume has been last quarter and this quarter and then certainly especially given some Marlboro volumes.
Jacek Olczak: Sequentially we see the improvement in the volumes in most of the geography, so when we were revising the guidance, the outlook for the full year it's much more critical than I said some of this improvement are not as growth as maybe initially that we expected but there are improvements so clearly the volumes of our quarter three and quarter four I mean it's going to work a little bit better but clearly the total market volumes I mean for us is a key challenge for the year. I think major what will help you if you look at how we see ourselves, how we’re going to do the quarters, Q3 and Q4 and you know that it is our practice not to give there a specific guidance for the quarter. I was expecting the EPS level for the quarter free to be somewhat comparable to what we had in the quarter one and then we will have all alignment of the revenue and the cost qualms are fully materializing at the backend of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Just to be clear on that last point, you think you’re going to have an absolute level of earnings per share in the third quarter that’s comparable to what you earned in the first quarter of this year?
Jacek Olczak: Well I said you know that our practice and this is what I said to Bonnie, our practice is not to be very specific in guidance on the cost that we break. I was just trying to give the outsight community a little bit of color on what will be the pricing of the growth. On ex-currency basis more EPS in Q3 growth rate should be comparable maybe slightly above where they have been in Q1 so clearly you see that…
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Comparable growth rate not a comparable level of earnings, just to be clear.
Jacek Olczak: Yes that’s correct.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Jacek can you help us understand sort of the magnitude of the change in the enforcement of the non-duty paid volumes in the Philippines, in other words if it's started and the level of enforcement was at zero and a 100 is sort of standard and optimal where are we as we’re going through month-by-month.
Jacek Olczak: Well the 100 the last year, I have to I think start from the last year. I think the last year the under declaration from that particular competitor we estimate was in the range of 80% of the entire volume. We brought it down while the government somehow brought it down to say about 20%-25% under declaration but just the magnitude of the tax burden which is at the new rate is that you still can sell the product profitability even at 75% of the volume and under declare 25%. So the issue is now and that is for is presumably that particular competitor still sitting on a 1 peso price point which you know if you pay the full cost economically it's completely not doable. So the question is now will the government continue or will there be not willingness on the government side to make sure that 100% of the volumes are being declared is my case and some other competitors in the market. So that’s the magnitude, so yes there is an improvement we’re about to reach this tipping point in Philippines but we have not reached the tipping point and there is sort of a relaxation if you like on a tax collection, tax administration from the government and we might be going back to square one.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: As it does improve the hope and expectation would be you would in effect buy down Fortune at a lower rate correct? And improve the profitability in the market?
Jacek Olczak: Yes and this is what I refer to with our increased spend in Q1, it's going to continue next year behind Fortune is buying down the price at resale so this is sales allowances (ph) and other forms of supporting the brand to bring closer to the ideal price of say 1.50, 1.60 and the same time we have reintroduced two brands at the 1 peso (inaudible) which clearly put the pressure on our financials you can imagine. What we are doing is this, our strategy was two-pronged strategy bring down the price, don’t lose the volumes, and in the meantime, work with the government, so they bring up the bottom of the market, but making sure the government pays taxes. Now, we have been delivering pretty well on our part, but I have to admit it is financially expensive strategy, but we also have to make sure that the government delivers on the second part of the strategy. There are still capital working things, otherwise, we were kind of integrated.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then last quarter Jacek on cash flow, you reiterated again, you expect a strong increase in free cash flow for the year, it was down in the first quarter versus the year ago first quarter, you mentioned on the last conference call that had to do with the phasing of the repatriation of profits to the United States and the related tax issue paid, but it’s down again even on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter, what, why?
Jacek Olczak: There is nothing structural is that the timing of our income, foreign income tax payments in our attribute, and we just headed in the second quarter. I think as of quarter three, quarter four you will see that these things will level out. So, what we initially said is still valid that we expect the free cash flow to grow faster than earnings for this year.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And actually Jacek, one last thing do you feel the growth of illicit trade that you mentioned in the number of markets, do you think is that getting to a point where it’s perhaps inhibiting or will inhibit your future capacity to take pricing?
Jacek Olczak: Not really, I mean as you could see, I mean we had a very strong pricing first half of the year. We expect the strong pricing second half of the year. So, it’s not there. So, I think what is more behind the illicit trade is not just the pricing, which we are taking, but the whole macro situation, okay. I mean, the pricing without an erosion of the consumer purchasing power is the one impact, and the pricing value have erosion of the consumer purchasing power is the other impact. And I think deal is exactly that sort of situation that the pricing is pretty moderate as is the tax environment, so that’s good on that type. But if you have continuous growth of unemployment, various austerity measures, etcetera, I mean it has (put the event) on the consumer spending. Lastly, frankly speaking, also like this, you have a reduction of the increases of many utilities in Russia are well above inflation, well above the rate of the increases last year, because utilities in Russia went up by about 10% in the first half of the year, last year, it was only 5%. Pricing, yes, it is pretty high pricing, but we had to pass on the price and not just be improve our margins. So, therefore, we see a little bit of the softness on the market, but it is not the pricing, it is much more the macro – the unemployment and other governmental measures to improve their state deficit.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Hi, Judy. Good morning.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Just a couple of questions from my end. First, just I am looking at your Asia margins and clearly you had a pretty significant decline in Q2, and I know that there are sort of big buckets of the drivers of the margin decline you had the negative geographic mix with Japan being down 10%. You have the Indonesia margin pressure from higher cost, and then you got the Philippines step up in the investments, but I wanted to just see if you can actually quantify sort of thinking about these big buckets, can you quantify the drivers of the margin decline in Asia?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think you pointed them all, I mean is Japan, which is more one-off in the quarter. And I expect that the margin instead of an adjustment in inventories you are talking in the range of 1 billion, billion times the margins which we heard in the Japan, that’s clearly (put the event) on the performance of the region and the spending in Philippines, okay. So, it’s working on putting the pressure on the cost. Now, Indonesia is still – about this time, Indonesia is in the situations when we fully passed on the tax plus also we had a lap on the clove prices and the leaf prices, so that pressure is being released from Indonesia. Japan as I said was the one-off. Okay, Philippines going to continue. All in all actually I think Asia is going to have, we will expect Asia to have a nice growth of the margin, strong growth of the margin actually in the second half of the year and all the regions of PMI and we expect for the full year that the operating margin for entire PMI will be up versus last year. So we expect the margin growth on the total PMI and as I said the second half of the year you should see the improvement in our regions.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So when you think about Japan and then outside of Japan in Asia so is Japan margins down also because you’re spending more given the competitive pressure and outside of Japan is the Philippines really the only region where you’re seeing just at the country level the margins being down year-over-year.
Jacek Olczak: No I think it's more for the shipment discussion which I said in Japan, there was, we continue spending in Japan launching our product so there is top order but this is more due to the so one off the inventories and Philippines which is a support of the Fortune and our lower price breaks to counter price points. So these are two items reach essentially drag the margins in the second quarter of Asia region.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and just on Japan so it sounds like you’re not expecting much of a market share improvement in the back half of the year even though you have a bit of a spending in that market. Can you just talk about sort of what you’re seeing competitively, it sounds like really the intense competitive situation continued in the second quarter? Do you think that just from a new product perspective you don’t have enough to really deal with some of the competitive pressure? I’m just curious why you think the market share doesn’t necessarily get better in the back half.
Jacek Olczak: Well I mean JT continues with the promotional spending than the new product offering, I think especially the regarding of our share for June I most attribute this also to the successful I’ve to admit that initially free product volumes, actual product volumes from our Mevius. As you know Marlboro, Philip Morris and Marlboro was the leading of best (ph) part of the menthol segment in Japan was been very successful so we get a lot of share in the past mild also, Mild Seven at that time was one of the big brands which was not participating so you know the whole competition is a little bit of contained about the (inaudible) of the market which is the menthol and we have our nice share there. We actually over represent in that segment. I think if we’re going to continue we will be under pressure with share but we also still have the capital of initial activity in our sleeves for the second half of the year. Last we have very good performance from the brand which we launched in the first couple of years so there won't be a pressure on the share but you lose share, you can gain share. So let remain optimistic.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and lastly just in Russia I think you called out some of the competitors were lagging in terms of the pricing in that armlet. I mean JTI took pricing recently. So is your view sort of from a pricing perspective at least the competitive situation has become a little bit more rational in that, it's really just more about the volume situation and are consumer starting to react to the pricing increase in a more modest way now that you have sort of had the six months of pricing in place with the tax increase in place?
Jacek Olczak: Well the consumer if you look at the smoking incidents and rarely maybe is rarely reacted (ph) but we don’t see much of the movement if at all but as I said maybe it's too early to read the end part of this price increase. Remember that Russia was taking the price since year-over-year and at the year twice the year the prices used to go up in Russia. This year is different because the size of the package increase was larger so obviously the price increase is much more is larger as well. I think if I look at my portfolio that I came with just 0.2 losses knowing that my brand lost the price gap of a 6 rubles to 7 rubles because this was the price increase on the beginning of the year versus competitors and then I feel very strong about the portfolio and actually I start seeing a good pay off of the investment which we had in Russia this year and continuing this year because as I demonstrated as trend of the portfolio the quote (ph) is temporary but they defend to show this part despite the advantages of pricing. Now you have the logging (ph) in some other markets as well so I don’t think is something which a systematic, it happens to somebody that the focus on something else. For us it has been a very clear, Russia is getting into maturity. I mean the volumes are very exciting but we’re much more excited about the grow in the top-line and grow in the bottom-line and I think for us the focus on Russia is generate the value of the market rather than contemplate too much a bit of the volume on market share losses.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Gentlemen, yes, just apologies, but going back to sort of Bonnie’s question with regards to the good guidance, I think clearly no change to the EPS guidance except currency, but volumes here is basically quite substantially worse than probably initially thought? I mean, can I just push you, is there any sort of number you would give full year ex the Philippines is and presumably the swing factor in the second half is mentioned that pricing and costs, so that mean the second quarter increase in costs in the Philippines and Indonesia sort of are dropping out again? I mean, was the price moves on ‘14 in the Philippines is temporary item or is that going to be a permanent reduction?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I said on the total cost in answering one of the questions before is that on the total costs for the company, the variance, which you have ex-currency on the first half of the year, then it’s essentially for the full year. And then I will have much better cost comparisons in the second half of the year. Pricing, 1 billion, I would say, will qualify there is a strong pricing and we don’t see any sort of headwinds at this stage to our pricing. I think we are going to continue with a strong pricing going forward. You will have heard we have announced prices recently also in the Germany, France, number of other locations, so this obviously is going to help the year. And volume, volume and total market volumes is not our performance is our market share is pretty strong and we grow in terms of our market share in a number of places. I think the single biggest challenge which we have this year is the total market size, and this I have to admit them, where if you know the number of the factors which plays that is one which makes a little bit forecasting more difficult that might be in other years, but this is the year when we have significant challenges on the total market.
Jon Leinster - UBS: But it is (inaudible) that will be the response the company has been to ramp pricing probably more than they expected in the second half to offset that volume, the market volume declines?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. We always were focused on growing the revenue and the bottom line. So, as I think we don’t have any major switch in our – change in our strategy.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Just totally separate subject, the famous e-cigarettes is the strategy of the great remained as it was in July 2011 with a sort of very much focused on heat not burn products rather than e-cigarettes or is that something which is flexible depending on the way the market develops?
Jacek Olczak: No, we are pretty flexible, because we said we are working on three platforms, I mean, two platforms which are very strong heat versus burn and the third platform, which is potentially one could say that for e-cigarette. So, we are making progress on all three, and we are also watching what are the developments in the market? So, I think our three platforms assessing what we see today in a market that should be able to address all opportunities which may exist in that market.
Jon Leinster - UBS: But I mean given the way in which the markets develop would you be emphasizing more the e-cigarette now rather than heat not burn or is that not really changed, because originally I think the first – couple of the first two platforms that you fully bring to market, were heat not burn?
Jacek Olczak: I think e-cigarettes as they are today, I don’t think the situation has changed much as to our assessment as some time ago. I mean, you need to have a product, which is palatable to the consumer. A product has to be liked by the consumer. I don’t think e-cigarettes that they are delivering on that front. Heat versus burn clearly addresses both the element of the reduction and delivers on the taste expectations of consumers. So, I think heat versus burn in our opinion is closer to this ideal sort of a product which you should have in the market. E-cigarette, as I said the prices earlier (inaudible) of the category development of the more focus than investment is needed in order to bring the palatability again of this product into some level of acceptance by consumers. I mean, we see the e-cigarette in some markets is essentially in some markets not in all EU but there is a (inaudible) so it confirms that there was some needs of the consumers but we also have to remember that the early days of cigarettes in the environment when there was talks. So what I see in some countries is much more phenomenon of the pricing rather than a phenomenon of the hard reduction or price. I mean people are compromising because they get a discomfort so the cigarette going into 40%, 50% or 70% rate. It's nothing substantial I don’t think we could call it a substantial at this stage but it's the early days of the category. So we continue working on our free (ph) platforms and we’re making a progress as per plan and I think when we will be ready we will go to market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: Just looking at your business in Indonesia, the volume growth in the first half was about 2% if it's 4% for the year I will say that’s a pretty sharp acceleration that you would expect and I know that it can’t get easier but you’ve also got some potential consumer headwinds with higher fuel prices and those can pass through to other products and then some big competitive launches. So what do you see driving an acceleration in category growth there?
Jacek Olczak: Well we expect 4% but no one can say that you know I think a quarter ago would have been more closer to the 6% of the growth so we lower a little of expectations for the market, 4% is the historical average growth of that market if I take out the last very exceptional the last two years which were very exceptional. I think the fewer subsidies I mean the part of that thing was mitigated by the government by returning some subsidies in other forms to the lower income people. I think the opening of the year was a bit slower, 1% I think what the growth rate of the market in the first quarter was presumably more impacted by some spikes in the food crisis in Indonesia. So I think it's pretty doable and it's actually somehow reflects the pricing of the seasonality that like pacing of the development in the market. I think 4% for the market should be doable for the total market. Our volumes in our market share is pretty strong not as strong growth as the last year because we’re leaving some attractive price points behind us but still for the first half year and the second quarter first quarter we had a nice share advancement. So I think we can expect some share growth, moderate share growth going forward in the year.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: And then at the category level is it the easier comps that are the big driver for the acceleration in the second half or is there anything else to that?
Jacek Olczak: No I think the market is slowly going through it's historical growth rate, it's just the pricing of the quarter, it's okay.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: And the just package opinion for what you expect that’s factored into your guidance, would you need to regain share there to be on track for what you expect reflected in our guidance or do you have it where you just need to hold or I realize that pacing in this past quarter had an impact. Is your expectation that that’s going to swing back or you not necessarily need that to happen?
Jacek Olczak: We put into our guidance, we included in our guidance for understanding that share in Japan is going to be under pressure. I won't give you the number but it's the exact share we targeting for the year but we do recognize that there was a pressure on the share on the market share in Japan. As I said we still have a few initiatives to be launched in the market, let’s see how the whole thing unfolds I mean in the Q3, we presumably will have either better position to say and what is the realistic expectation for the full year.
Michael Lavery – CLSA: And I realize it's just early in the quarter you know just a little over couple of weeks but in Japan say specifically or any major markets have you seen trends so far that look like an acceleration or specifically in Japan has there been from a consumer retail share trends that look more promising that suggest you will see the shipments share regain some count?
Jacek Olczak: No, no, but as I said earlier, I mean, the biggest challenge which we have this year is there is the total market, and you know total market needs a little bit of time to estimate properly, I mean, not on the weekly basis. So, we are pretty confident on our chart. As I said, we are pretty confident about the pricing, but we will have to see how this unfolds in the remaining two quarters of the year relative to the total market sizes. So, this is what it is, but nothing at the beginning of this month, which would focus from a perspective that our guidance or outlook for the second half of the year would change versus let me (jump enough).
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Hi. Just had two questions for you. I want to ask a little bit more about your events just understand through the quarter, this is a better volume performance than I expected actually. It seems like you had sequentially better given you had a pretty soft April. So, the expectation we have increased your estimate for the decline for the division for the year. Do you expect conditions to worsen in the second half of the year or remain about the same? I guess what I saw in the quarter was an improvement throughout the quarter?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, that means you had total industry was if I remember 10% down in the Q1, is 8% down, so you have a blended 9.2, 9.3 for the first half of the year. So, yes, even with our revised outlook for the full year, we do assume that there will be some improvements going forward. It’s a little bit of accounts, but yes, sequentially we see that the volumes. We had exceptional low quarter first quarter. Okay, so that this is already in the book, so you can’t change it as well. But, yes, there was some sequential improvements in the quarter, but obviously if you look at our shipments, it’s much better than the market, because EU has delivered fabulous market share performance first quarter and the second quarter and is very much on the back of Marlboro. So, you remember, at least in the past I said, the EU is definitely much more total market than a mix problem for us, but that is part of the positive news about the EU performance this year.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay. And just one follow-up question for you, which is on the investments that you have made of last year in Russia or in Indonesia, those kind of markets or even behind the Marlboro brand overall, we will be lapping a lot of those in the second half of the year. Do you expect that those investments then are going to remain at the same level or did they start to come down on a year-over-year basis? Is that a benefit in the second half or it’s just lots of a drag as to what’s said?
Jacek Olczak: No, this is what I am saying, the second half of this year is going to be more comparable to the second half of last year that (variance) is going to be flat. So, yes, on the full 12-month basis this year, you will see that we have increased year-on-year. However, the pricing of the thing was that we started to accelerate it, increase the investment in the second half, third, fourth quarter in some places of last year, and that if I am lapping this now in the second half of this year.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay. And as you quantified the degree of investments you have made over the last year, let’s say, of what your increase was overall say in sort of marketing distribution in those kind of areas?
Jacek Olczak: Chris, I could, and I know the number, but I am afraid, so many people is now on the call, then I cannot reveal it.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Understood, I thought I’d try. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Hi, good morning.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning.
Vivien Azer - Citi: My first question have to do with Indonesia, your guidance for 4% volume growth has come down pretty sharply in just a little over a month. So, what gives you comfort that, that 4% is the right number to the extent that you see continued food inflations in that market?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I mean that we got the reading now of the second quarter. So, yes, I mean the second quarter came nicely and the volumes grew by, total industry volumes grew by 3.5. So, once you have the two quarters, it’s a little bit easier to forecast the full year. So, this is due to – I think there was some impact in the first quarter of the food inflation. There is some flooding in some regions, territories in Indonesia, I think all that together, I mean, they might put the market on a bit of slower opening of this year. So, the quarter sequentially now should be better, but I think will to be more realistic we should rather put an estimate of the total market into the range of 4% rather than stayed with the previous one. And we, frankly speaking, 4% is a very solid, nice growth rate for this market and we’re okay with this.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Sure. In the EU you previously stated that you would hope to hold your local currency EBIT flat with your prior volume assumption. So can you give an update on that outlook for local currency EBIT growth in the EU?
Jacek Olczak: Well EU again I mean they improve sequentially the total industry improved in the Q2. I would say might be initial that we thought the improvement is going to be more than just 8% decline and I think once you have 10% and 8% in the pocket already in actuals then you have to again you’re in tense situations that you better can predict what forecast for the full year is going to be. There is not much improvement on the contraband, I mean we don’t have a the full reading for the EU where the illicit trade span however run it off through the market and beneath the market so many markets indicate that the contraband the illicit trade continues to grow it's not easy. So France I think is one of the recent examples in the illicit trade despite that continues to grow. So all in all I think to be more realistic will size it to revise the outlook for the industry. Maybe it's come back (ph) I don’t know. Our biggest challenge would be, the biggest challenge we have this year is the total size of the industry, not our business performance is, not our ability to the deliver strong pricing is not our ability to manage the cost, the investment et cetera is essentially the total industry volumes.
Vivien Azer - Citi: Far enough and my last question has to be with e-cigarette as well. Do you have an estimate on what impact the e-cigarettes could have had for the total EU or maybe specifically for some of the markets where it's integrating (ph) you just called plans where you have seen a sequential acceleration and the market declines on the substantially easier comp and as I understand that is one of the bigger e-cigarette markets in the region.
Jacek Olczak: I wouldn’t give a number I mean we’re looking at this carefully because as you know one of our platform is cigarette so it's not that we’re not closely looking at this category, it's difficult to estimate. You have this sometimes this information, some travel to Italy, to Rome and have seen his friends and the cigarette you go 100 kilometers outside the Rome but no one has heard about e-cigarette. So we have to look at this unlike the total sort of the information is a little bit of a conscious. I don’t eco-consciousness (ph). I don’t think today is the size of the market of these cigarette is in the range higher than a 1% and presumably that might be on the high side. I don’t have a number I mean it's a pure speculation you would have to I think we need more time to really assess that, I don’t think it's comparable to what you have for example in the U.S. But yes we understand, they are resulted (ph) in London once you go to other towns outside London not necessary is the case. I mean I had seen in Greece and there is just another alternative to smoking that significant at lower price than this stuff came and the market disappeared, whatever the market at the beginning. So this is barely stages of the category in Europe. As I said we’re very closing watching this thing and looking where is the right moment, when this market can create opportunity for us but I wouldn’t volunteer today to turn a solid number with regards to the impact of the e-cigarettes, the size of e-cigarettes in Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Is this the most challenging environment that you’ve operated in since the spin-off or is it too much of pessimistic interpretation of your results?
Jacek Olczak: It is solid, the whole year is challenging. There is different challenge from here, I mean than the retrospect we presumably. We’re much more focused, we keep eye on the ball, quarter two is quarter two, we reported quarter two. I’m glad it's over, we focus on a quarter three, quarter four 2014-15, so at the retrospect we will just treat it as a quarter. We’re not managing the business of the quarterly basis but for us it's much more how we’re confident about the full year, what is front of us for the 2014-15 et cetera, 16-17 I mean we have a lot of exciting things in front of us so I wouldn’t, I understand the interest around the quarter, but wouldn’t be overexcited about the quarter.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: So, you wouldn’t say that the overall pricing environment is any worse than what you have seen in the last five or six years?
Jacek Olczak: It’s challenging environment. I mean that this year, the challenge is the total market sizes, I mean there are some other areas you had other challenges, I mean the business was not performing well, if you go back to the spring time, I mean, we today are much more confident, much, much more confident in our ability to grow market share, to grow Marlboro, to be innovative as such, well I mean, I wouldn’t think, I don’t think we were that stronger, had such strong feelings about the best part of our business in the 2008 or 2009. Okay, so listen business is business I mean you always have some challenges, no point.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Fair enough. We don’t want you to get forward right. I have a question out for you, Jacek, is can you give us an update on the impact of claim packaging in Australia?
Jacek Olczak: Well, if you look from the total market perspective and the market share, the market was slightly down that it is the mature market. So, I don’t think there is what can really give you more of the impact was the impact of the claim package. There is some acceleration of the down trading. This is attributable to claim pack. We will have to see, but there is some down trading, but also market is pretty expensive market in terms of the level of the prices. Prices went up. We have seen the down trading before the claim pack. Can claim pack meet long-term accelerator trading? Yes, there is a risk. We always put you open about it, and I wouldn’t conclude that sort of a statement just based on one quarter, I mean, its ability. In Australia, it’s developing nicely strong.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Right. And any changes to the illicit trade in Australia that you can see?
Jacek Olczak: No, no, no.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Okay. Alright, that’s all I had for you. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg: Hi, good morning Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Good morning Erik.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg: I would like to circle back to Russia and just firstly the reason for the decrease in the outlook for Russian volume it sounded like from your previous comments, that’s really due to a change in the macro environment and the effect that’s having on consumer disposable income. I was hoping you could help clarify that? And then secondly, I was wondering if there is a sense that the Russian government with this greater decline in volumes now will be taking that into account as they look at tax rates going forward at the end of the year?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think when it comes to the market as what we see as we have a slowdown in the economy. So, Russia has still the quarters. We are talking in the quarters of GDP growth, but the growth dynamic is different than it used to be in the past. So, there is a slowdown in the economy. There is a clearly less governmental spending, which presumably also goes back into the overall stage of side of the economy. There was clearly a low range dynamic. I mean, the ranges are growing up in Russia, but not at the rates but last year or year before. And for the first half of the year, I think the utilities prices, prices for utilities water, gas, fuel, etcetera went up I think in the range of about 10%. I think Russia is in the inflation of about 7%, 7% to 8%, so clearly above inflation and above the range of the growth, which we observed last year, because first half last year, utilities were up by about 5%. So, there is something around the consumer purchasing the power of disposable income, which we are confronted with. Now, Russia is, good thing about Russia is we have a good cost structure. We have a visibility of the taxation for the next three years. Next year, there is still in front of us quite a sizable cost increase, which we would like to pass – to pass on to consumers. I mean, it’s slightly above this year, because the impact of this year of the pure tax was about RUB5 if I am not mistaken, and we have in front of us about RUB8 of the tax increase, just tax increase for the market. So, I don’t think the government will change this one. In the outer years of the long-term tax plan, the government may take the different view from the indexation, but anyway in the plan, there is a moderation because 2015 to ‘16 that is what we understand the taxes should go at the lower rate and this year and the next year. One thing which we have to watch for last year because this other experience from other places and I called the government also will helpfully look at the illicit trade okay because this is what the such a situation may open the door to illicit trade but I hope the Russian government and the Russian administration will defend strongly their market share.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg: Okay. Thank you and then my last question was with respect to the evolution of the TPDs as you see it at this stage given the various entities have kind had a first go at it and then related to that is what looks to be the risk plain packaging in Ireland given the UK’s decision to abandon that policy. Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: Well logically Ireland should follow the same thing thinking as (inaudible) less rate for the evident and down then (inaudible) make sure that the legislation you propose is come from the evidence scientific perspective. The process in Ireland has not started we have just heard that they have an intention to look into plain packaging, other than I can say. On the TPD, I will paint the whole debate about the Tobacco Product Directive will have the parliamentary sessions of the Parliament around mid of September now depends how the outcome of or how the directive is going to be for at the end of the parliament versus what the council have decided and they will go to the reconciliation process, I think they will know the final shape of the directive before year end maybe early next year, around the year around and have heard about the two years for transposition into Member State Law will have to see what transition period the Member States will give in the domestic market and the domestic jurisdiction, so specifically to same analogy, say you have the number of committees in the parliament, the opinions are highly divided, it's not that there is a unanimous support for the ban of (inaudible) or menthol et cetera but I don’t know it's difficult to speculate at which the directives from now where it's going to be finished.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori with Credit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Credit Suisse: I just have one quick question in the context of the proposed EU TPD changes, also if you could talk a little bit of Poland the 20% is meant for nearly 30% is (inaudible). Would you expect to switch to other cigarettes if and when the ban is in place or more likely that you will see a surge in nearly substantial volumes from Eastern Europe. Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: I think for that is too important to address the illicit trade. I mean I think some consumers you know can go and find a similar product in the early cig market already today and this was one of the arguments which we’re bringing to the EU office at the Member State that first of all there is no scientific ways to ban any of this product, it's a pure discrimination in the market without any scientific base. It is difficult to argue that the (inaudible) are more harmful or less harmful that the regular cigarette. Yes it's an illicit trade, some consumers it's a speculation but some consumers will go back to regular cigarette and in some countries in Europe consumers also know how to menthol cigarette themselves so I don’t know in which direction it's going to go, (inaudible) designed the policy if this space like it is it's will not be proven will deliver on the stated objective but yes it's well created this portion in the market. So let’s see how that will unfold.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: We’re two quarters into the year is there any change in the contribution from pricing variance for the full year versus expectations when we started the year?
Jacek Olczak: No the pricing variance the billion I just indicate that we’re looking for the various pricing variance for the full year so no.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Okay great and then in the release you comment on lower industry volume and I understand that’s reflecting excise tax increase as trade inventory movement, illicit trade et cetera but is there any fundamental change and consumption patterns in any markets that is contributing to that lower volume for total industry?
Jacek Olczak: No, it’s presumably that we are very excited that the biggest challenge this year we have on the total industry volume. I think the price increase which is taking place that is not something significantly higher than in the previous years, the average is etcetera. I think what we confronted is that in some geographies, we confronted with the slowdowns of economy, the difficult market etcetera. So, whatever you have an erosion in the disposable income, that has an impact. The illicit trade obviously started playing more important low, this is a challenge, which we have illicit trade in the form of a typical contraband crossing the borders, but also in some places like Philippines are the very low law enforcement, which resulted as you know some people don’t pay their taxes which they should pay, and then other phenomenon which we are confronted with. But in terms of consumption part of smoking incident, if you look at the mature market, yes, there was a natural rate of decline, but nothing which you would today attribute that, this is the year when people that the incidents go down faster of the daily consumption rates decline, in fact that actually in many countries, they get out (inaudible) etcetera. The smoking incident in many countries stays flat and the daily consumption stays flat of the total tobacco products.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: That is great. That helps. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
David Hayes - Nomura: Good morning, good afternoon gentlemen. Just in terms of looking up on a comment you made earlier about the price lags by some competitors you mentioned Russia and then some other markets, you had seen that I guess two questions on that. One is, is that something you feel in terms of that price lagging, is it bit of a growing trend? And then secondly is there any markets apart from the Philippines, which you code out, where you have actually reversed pricing – haven’t taken pricing during the year? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: The price lagging it happens every year in different places, okay. I think it’s sometimes is amount, sometimes is a capital market, and the Russia was a little bit on the longer side, so that’s clearly is something which put the pressure, but finally prices were implemented. I mean, it’s more of the tactics rather than I think the sort of a strategy. And second question no, it’s just Philippines when we had the very specific situations when we had to react with the pricing.
David Hayes - Nomura: Okay, thanks. So, just looking on e-cigarettes and kind of have some of these comments earlier, I mean my understanding or my understanding at least is that your plan is to come into e-cigarettes through next generation products commercially 2016 through ‘17? Is that still the right understanding or are you saying that if the market develops further you are positioning yourselves to coming with other products ahead of that chronological approach that you talked about in the past?
Jacek Olczak: To be precise, look I have said in the 2016-17, it was focused on the two platforms, the first two platforms, and this is where we were going to start constructing the factory this year etcetera, but we are working essentially at the same time on the three platforms in the different stages of development, but even the platform, third platform, which is close to – can be treated as e-cigarette is also on our agenda.
David Hayes - Nomura: Okay. So, you could come to market with something commercially in that area earlier than 2016 potentially?
Jacek Olczak: When we will go to the market, we will announce when we will go to market.
David Hayes - Nomura: Okay. And then my final question is to clarify, I guess, just in terms of the guidance and some of the trends that people highlighted, I guess, you talked about the fact that these markets, Indonesia, Russia, EU, Turkey, obviously the volumes have lowered since the beginning of the year in terms of outlook, but then you just made the point that pricing wise, you have not changed your outlook since the beginning of the year in terms of the pricing you expected to take through the year. So, I am just still trying to equate why the guidance is so unchanged, what the moving part offsets that volume declines that you have seen in a number of key markets that you have mentioned today?
Jacek Olczak: Well, listen, I mean it’s the guidance, because we were taking into consideration all elements which we knew at that time. I mean, there are pricing at the beginning of the year if I am not mistaken. We have about 75% of the pricing realized. So, we know what we are going to have in the pricing. There were some prices also change more recently, so I am a little bit earlier for different reasons and their timing of the target increases plus change et cetera. So in the whole guidance the blend is whole number of facts.
David Hayes - Nomura: But I guess there is also maybe a little bit less expenditure plan for the beginning of the year or more cost savings potentially is that any area where the 300 million could actually be higher to help delivery.
Jacek Olczak: The cost savings in terms of productivity to plan of the $300 million, I mean we’re delivering on schedule so we had it already in our guidance and no there was a comp we knew that we will have a comp in the second half of the year much better than the first half of the year and the fact we’re (inaudible).
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner.
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: The two quick questions, one involves the pension liabilities in light of the rise of the long term interest rate, you’re fully higher, the fund status might lead some restatement upwards or down to the liability and I’m curious if that’s, second in Spain what steps can you take, it sounded like the cigarette volume declined 12% and the (inaudible) were up 26 I think you said that’s quite staggering your depiction, any under a way to reverse those trends?
Jacek Olczak: Well one thing price is we show (inaudible) all our pension funds are well funded I mean well above the statutory limits so if I have read your questions properly we don’t expect any prices on the front when it comes to Spain, yes I mean actually with the government going into finally reorganize that there was a too much of the (inaudible) taxation overall and there is manufacture of cigarette is very helpful. So now in few quarters we should see very hopefully some improvement. I think we have seen it in Italy when the government taxes all your fine cut products, a little bit more you could see all within out that you have some reverse of the trend which is obviously helpful for our cigarette manufactured cigarette category.
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: In Italy the number has seem to indicate that, what is the level of market share for all your own in Spain at this time?
Jacek Olczak: I think it's in the range of 12% if I’m not mistaken.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: I wanted to ask are you surprised by the volatility and the movement in the currencies and are there new steps or additional steps that you’re taking because of this.
Jacek Olczak: Well I think I’m surprised as everyone is surprised because the whole market there is development and as you know we gave announcement (inaudible) Central Bank and are reacting to the same. I mean you see our announcement, the outlook for the currency is revised by mainly because of the Russian Ruble, Mexican Peso trillion dollar et cetera and actually on the Japanese Yen and on the Euro we’re at it work pretty well hedged at the beginning of the year, there were some opportunities during the year because the currency was a little bit volatility and we use this opportunity so we feel much more confident about the yen, now the euro in progress but the rest of the currency is yes there is a volatility in the market.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: May I ask you one last question on electronic cigarettes, can you give a little color on I guess how they fall short to the taste and the feel of the consumer and would you go as far as saying that the popularity that the demand for e-cigarettes may actually falter over time? They may not become as big as some project?
Jacek Olczak: Well in Europe and myself visualize, testing the product, the product is not a product which is very close to the conventional cigarette and I think the consumers are looking for something which is at least similar. So the product has it's own deficiencies but it's a new category so everyone is working on how to improve it. I mean year from now the situation might be different but I don’t think that the product is performing well on the taste fact, okay, it's pretty tasteless in (inaudible) as well as question of a good manufacturing practices. You know the product is not regulated, so I don’t think the consumer have a (inaudible) for what they buy and it's really something which they would like to use and as I said earlier I think today is marginal for moment of the price than it is and when the price comes to play you know consumers are really sometimes to compromise a lot. Will it last long is I don’t know, it's remained to be seen.
Operator: Thank you and now I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Well thank you very much. That concludes our call. I apologize for going over a little bit but we did want to make sure that we took all the calls over the queue. If you do have any follow-up questions you can contact the Investor Relations team. We’re here in Switzerland, the numbers are posted on the materials. Again thank you all for joining us. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the first quarter of 2013 and comparing them to the same periods in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes or to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the back of this presentation which is also posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We had a relatively sound start to the year when one considers the difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter last year. Our business fundamentals continue to be solid and we have good momentum in key markets and segments. In February, we provided a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.68 to $5.78. We see no reason to change our guidance today due to business factors. However, we have witnessed increased currency volatility and in particular a weakening of the Euro and the Yen due to the economic crisis in Europe and changes in economic policy in Japan. Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates, we now forecast a full-year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.19 per share rather than the $0.06 cents included in our previous guidance. Our revised reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is therefore $5.55 to $5.65, compared to $5.17 in 2012. This reflects a growth rate excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012. This is matching the growth rate that we announced in February. This is fully in line with our mid to long-term currency neutral annual growth target highlighting the continued strength of our underlying business model and the robustness of our growth algorithm. Let me now take you through our first-quarter results and provide you with our outlook for some of our key markets. Organic volume in the first quarter was down by 2.1%, excluding the Philippines. This reflects three main factors. First, we had a difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter last year when organic volume grew by 5.3% year-on-year. This was helped by the leap-year. Second, there was a reversal of trade inventory build-ups that took place in several markets during the fourth quarter of 2012 ahead of expected tax and price increases, notably impacted Turkey. Third, cigarette markets in the EU region continue to be influenced by the economic crisis and high unemployment levels. I would nevertheless like to highlight the fact that, excluding the Philippines, we achieved organic volume growth this quarter in the Asia and EEMA regions, and continue to expect organic volume growth on a global basis for the full-year of 2013. The decline in our volume and the overall difficult comparisons with the prior year impacted our financial results in the first quarter of this year. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up by 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. Despite this, our adjusted diluted EPS performance excluding currency was solid with growth of 8.8%. Pricing continues to be the key driver of our income performance. Our pricing variance in the first quarter reached $531 million, significantly higher than that achieved during the same quarter last year Since October, we have notably increased prices in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, and the U.K. In addition, last week we announced new prices in Germany. The favorable pricing environment is backed by the strength of our brand portfolio and supported by an excise tax environment, which with the exception of the Philippines, has been rational and characterized by structural improvements. Our market share growth momentum continued in the first quarter with gains in three of our four regions and the Asia region essentially stable, excluding the Philippines. Marlboro volume, excluding the Philippines, was down by 2.2% in the first quarter, driven by cigarette industry volume declines in the EU. Nevertheless, Marlboro market share increased or was essentially stable in all four regions, excluding the Philippines. Marlboro achieved notable share gains of 0.7 and 0.8 points respectively in the EU and the Latin America and Canada regions during the quarter. Our above-premium Parliament continues to show great momentum with a volume increase in the quarter of 5.4%, this despite the trade inventory reversal in Turkey. Parliament continued to gain share in its key markets of Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, while making further inroads in the Middle East. L&M volume increased by 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, driven by its positive momentum in the EEMA Region and a resilient share performance in the EU Region. Three markets stand out, namely Egypt, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and I would be also pleased by L&M’s renewed growth in Russia. Let me now review what is happening in key geographies. Let's start with the EU. The situation in the EU has attracted considerable attention given the region’s high level of profitability and the depth and duration of the economic crisis. Consumer products companies have been suffering as average unemployment levels reached double digits and continue to grow. The key driver of our 10.1% decline in cigarette volume in the EU Region during the first quarter was the decrease in industry volume of 10.5%, with a notably steep decline in southern European markets. This decline was exacerbated by unfavorable trade inventory movements and fewer selling days. Let me also remind you that the first quarter was the strongest for cigarette industry volume in the region last year. While overall tobacco consumption levels remain fairly stable, there continues to be down-trading to cheaper fine cut proposition and to illicit trade. Fine cut industry volume increased by 2.1% in the first quarter, while the latest EU-wide study indicates that the level of illicit trade has climbed to 11.1% from 10.4% a year earlier. Taking the distortions of the first quarter into consideration and based on our analysis of current expectations for the remaining three quarters, we continue to forecast that cigarette industry volume for the full-year 2013 in the EU Region should decline broadly in line with that of last year. We are encouraged by our market share gains in the EU Region. Our share was up by 0.7 points to 38.1%, though I should mention that this was partially flattered by the impact of competitive trade inventory movement. We gained share in our five most important EU cigarette markets, namely Italy, Poland, France, Germany and Spain. We also gained share in some of the smaller markets, such as Finland, the Netherlands, and Hungary, while market share declined notably in Greece, the Baltics, Denmark, and Portugal. Our four key brands continued to perform well highlighting our strong business fundamentals. However, our volume was hampered by the prevailing very weak economic conditions. Marlboro’s regional share increased in the first quarter by 0.7 points to 18.7% as the brand performed well in its five largest markets. L&M’s share was stable at 6.6%. Chesterfield’s share was up by 0.2 points to 3.7%, driven by markets such as Austria, Portugal, and Spain, as well as geographic expansion. Finally, the Philip Morris brand gained 0.3 points to reach 1.9%, thanks to its continued growth momentum in France and the success of Philip Morris Selection in Italy. While the overall growth of the fine cut category slowed down in the first quarter, we again outperformed the competition with an in-market sales volume increase of 7.6%. We are continuing to successfully roll out fine cut variants of our leading cigarette brands, Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield, into new markets. As a result, we increased our category share by 0.7 points to 14.1% and captured 48% of the additional industry volume. Let me now focus on two of the most important markets in the EU Region, namely Italy and Germany. The economic downturn in Italy has been severe with a decrease in real GDP of 2% last year and an increase in unemployment from 10.1% in February 2012 to 11.6% a year later. This has resulted in a decline in consumer purchasing power, which, we believe, was the main driver of the 9.5% decrease in cigarette industry volume in the first quarter of this year. The second important factor has been an increase in illicit trade, the incidence of which doubled year-on-year. The fine cut category, meanwhile, no longer grew following the reduction in the excise tax and price differential with cigarettes that took place in the middle of last year. We believe that the rate of decline of cigarette industry volume in Italy should moderate during the remainder of the year. However, this is contingent upon the elimination of the previously planned July VAT increase. The underlying fundamentals of our business in Italy remain strong. Our cigarette market share grew by 0.6 points in the quarter to 53.2%, as the continued momentum of Marlboro and the success of Philip Morris Selection in the international low-price segment more than offset the decline of Merit and Diana. We are also continuing to gain share in the fine cut category, with an increase of 3.3 points in the first quarter to 30.5%, thanks notably to the successful recent launch of Marlboro fine cut. German market was distorted in the first quarter by the leap year effect, trade inventory movements, and an increase in border sales. While cigarette industry volume was 6.6% lower in the quarter, we estimate that the underlying decline was a more moderate 2.8%. During this period, fine cut industry volume increased by 1.2%. The German economy continues to be resilient with low unemployment, and this has translated into more robust overall tobacco market trends including a recovery in the premium cigarette segment. Our business is in a good shape with our cigarette market share slightly higher at 36.1%. Marlboro grew by 1.5 points in the quarter to 22.3% and achieved its highest cigarette share since the fourth quarter of 2009. This confirms the positive response to our new Marlboro initiatives. While L&M’s cigarette share declined by 0.7 points to 10.5%, this reflected timing as the brand’s share is sequentially stable. Importantly, we have consolidated our leading position among Young Adult Smokers, with a 20% share for L&M and a 17% share for Marlboro. Last week, we announced to the trade an increase in our cigarette retail prices of essentially €0.20 per 19 cigarettes across our total portfolio. This should come into effect at retail in May. I will now turn to Asia, where we are continuing to strengthen our business. Our organic volume grew by 2.8%, excluding the Philippines during the first quarter. Indonesia was a key contributor. Our cigarette volume increased by 4.9% in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2013. We again achieved a strong share performance with a gain of 1.4 points to 36.3%. As anticipated, the rate of growth has moderated as certain brands are being impacted by the crossing of key price thresholds in line with our strategy of regular price increases. Our share gains were driven by the continued strong performance of premium Sampoerna A, which was up by 0.8 points, and by mid-price U Mild, which was up by 1.2 points. Marlboro meanwhile expanded its share of the white non-kretek segment by 4 points to 75%. Industry volume was up only slightly during the quarter, after a 13.9% surge in the same period last year. For the full year, we are forecasting a growth rate of around 5% to 6%, in line with the current 12-month moving average. The resilience of the Indonesian economy continued improvements in consumer purchasing power and the growth of the adult population underpin the continued industry volume expansion. In Japan, cigarette industry volume decreased by 3.2% during the first quarter and we forecast an underlying decline of around 2% for the full year in line with recent trends in adult smoking incidence. Our shipment volume increased by 6.9%, reflecting favorable distributor inventory movements. Intense competitive product and marketing activities, notably around Japan Tobacco's morphing of Mild Seven into Mevius, impacted the Lark and Philip Morris brands. As a result, PMI reached a first quarter market share of 27.5%, 0.2 points below that of the last quarter of 2012.  Marlboro meanwhile maintained its share. We believe that the recent launch of Lark Ice Mint 5mg and 1mg, a natural mint 100mm product, and the planned launch in May of Marlboro W-Burst 5, a double capsule menthol innovation, should enable us to resume a more positive share trend. In the Philippines, the disproportionate tax increase that took place in January has, as expected, caused significant market disruption. In January, we increased our recommended retail prices of key brands by 60% to 70%. However, the price of individual cigarettes, set by the trade, which account for about 70% of total retail sales, increased by a larger amount in numerous outlets. In the first quarter, our volume declined by 42.5% reflecting the consumer reaction to the higher prices, the prior-year trade inventory build-up and the impact of the new prices on the trade’s working capital requirements. Cigarette industry shipments are estimated, based on Bureau of Internal Revenue data, to have been down by 39%. However, Nielsen consumer off-take and our market research data indicate that cigarette consumption was down significantly less. The difference reflects the aforementioned trade inventory movements and in particular a surge in illicit trade. In March, we saw a sequential improvement in volume and provided the government is successful in its efforts to improve excise tax administration, we still believe that industry volume should decline by about 20% to 25% for the full-year 2013. We expect some share erosion due to aggressive competitor pricing at the bottom end of the market. Let me now turn to the EEMA Region, where we achieved a 1.4% volume growth in the first quarter of the year. This strong result was driven by share gains in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North, Africa and favorable distributor inventory movements in Russia, partly offset by the anticipated reversal of the December trade inventory build-up in Turkey. In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by about 5.5%. This was due to recent tax-driven price increases of RUB 6 to RUB 7 a pack, which corresponded to between 9% for Parliament to 22% increase for Optima. In line with previous years, we expect this decline to moderate once adult consumers adjust to the higher prices. We estimate that the total market will be down by around 3% on a full-year basis. Our volume increase of 1.8% in the first quarter reflected the timing of shipments to our distributor. Our market share during the first two months of the year was stable at 26.2% with gains from above-premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street and Next offset by declines from mid-price Chesterfield and super-low price Optima. Turkey is an example of a market where a strong underlying performance was distorted by specific dynamics in the first quarter of this year. There were significant increases in trade inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2012 that were reversed following tax-driven price increases at the beginning of 2013. As a result, while cigarette industry volume declined by 11.6% year-on-year, the underlying market showed a slightly positive trend thanks to lower levels of illicit trade. On a full-year basis, we forecast that underlying industry volume should be relatively stable. Our volume was down by 17.4% in the quarter as we were disproportionately impacted by the trade inventory movements. Our market share in the first two months of the year was up slightly to 44.7% as premium Parliament and mid-price Muratti continued their growth momentum, while Lark and L&M lost ground to competitive brands that were priced lower at the bottom end of the market. In conclusion, we expect to deliver strong results again in a very challenging year. We remain confident that, despite another difficult year ahead in the EU Region, we should be able to generate organic cigarette volume growth on a global basis, excluding the Philippines. We expect this year to again achieve the financial targets of our mid to long-term currency neutral annual growth algorithm. Our new reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance, includes the latest currency rate and is $5.55 to $5.65. This reflects a full-year growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22. I should point out that we foresee our growth will be skewed towards the second half of the year We anticipate strong free cash flow growth, excluding currency, in 2013. We remain committed to rewarding our shareholders through attractive dividends and substantial share repurchase programs. We will continue to judiciously invest to reinforce the long-term prospects of our business. In the first quarter, we spent another $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Since March 2008, we have returned a total of over $50 billion to our shareholders and repurchased 24% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin. Thank you. And, I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
Chris Ferrara - Bank of America: Thank you. So, it sounds like you are broadly reiterating industry volume projections for the year in most places like the EU and like Indonesia. Despite what was a pretty poor volume quarter, so I guess the question is, was Q1 volume worse than you had expected or was it pretty much in line with what you thought it was going to be?
Jacek Olczak: Well, taking into consideration, you remember in February we said that we had about 75% of the pricing already implemented or announced for the year, which was pretty high compared to other first quarters in the years before. I think it was rather expected that usually after the price increases, there is this initial sort of dip in the market, and then the markets are coming to some sort of recovery. So, this was not unexpected, but you also remember, I mean, in the first quarter for PMI in total, but also specifically for EU, first quarter of 2012 was a pretty strong quarter. We've been almost growing at the 6% PMI, and EU had just a decline of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2012. So, no, I don't think we had any surprise in the performance in the first quarter.
Chris Ferrara - Bank of America: Thanks. I guess what I am trying to get to is whether -- how you feel about the 10 to 12 on a constant currency, and whether Q1 represents just a little bit more of an obstacle relative to getting to that number, but you just still had the flexibility to get there, or whether there really is no change and you still feel like you are in the same place within that guidance range of 10 to 12 that you were before?
Jacek Olczak: No. I mean, we are very confident about the guidance. As you noticed, we are revising the guidance -- the February guidance only for the currency. So, I think the business fundamentals are very strong. The brand’s portfolio performance, essentially all of our main markets are pretty solid. We had some distortions in the quarter, which I have been mentioning in my remarks. The only thing, which I would like to add is that, I mean, we clearly are looking in the second half of the year to be somehow stronger than the first half of the year. For a number of reasons, we have in our annualization of some increased spending behind mainly marketing and sales from the last year, which is going to have an impact on us , especially in the first half of the year. There are still some inventory distortions which will continue through the second quarter of this year, but all in all, I mean we feel pretty confident about the guidance. I mean, all the risks, which we knew are there, I mean EU volumes, EU pressure on the volume, also Philippines, the initial impact are included or baked in our guidance. And as I said, I mean, we are pretty confident on a 10% to 12% growth for this year.
Chris Ferrara - Bank of America: Great. Thank you very much.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citi Investment Research: I am curious as we think about Italy, I recognize your guidance reflects no VAT increase. Can you speak to the probability of no VAT increase occurring and conversely if you do see an increase, how would that impact potentially your guidance for EU volumes?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I will maybe start with the second part of your question. I think we are still at this stage despite the 10% decline of the reported volumes in EU for the first quarter. We still think, broadly the rate of decline for the full year will be in a range of that which we had last year, so 6.3%, if I remember correct. The underlying volume decline in the EU Region for the first quarter, we estimate will come in the range of 8% if I eliminate some distortions which were in the quarter. Italy is essentially the only market or the main market, which we will have on the watch list in EU as we still don’t have a clarity what's going to happen with the announced VAT increase. If we follow the politicians' announcement, no one regardless of the party they belong to, would like to have the VAT increase. However, in order for that wish to materialize, they have to form the government, and they have to change some legislation. So, we will have to watch how the situation unfolds in Italy. But I think with the exception of the VAT increase in Italy, I think that EU still can be broadly with the rate of decline that’s comparable to last year.
Vivien Azer - Citi Investment Research: Fair enough. As a follow-up to that, can you comment, perhaps, on your outlook for operating income growth in the EU? I think you have said in the past, you could hold your EBIT flat but considering the significant trade down that you are seeing in the market, I wonder whether that needs to be adjusted downward at all?
Jacek Olczak: Well, it is very much dependent, again, on the total volume development in the EU. If news from Italy is positive, I think we can maintain all the profitability. If Italy talks will happen, then it depends on the pricing [attractions] (ph), that might have some impact on the profitability in the EU. But assuming my forecast, our estimate for the total EU volumes to be broadly in line of the rate of decline of the last year would hold, I think we can maintain the profitability.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: On the EU, with weaker volumes, not just for you but obviously for the competitors, are you seeing any change or an increase in competitive intensity, companies going more for share than they might have a year ago or is it fairly stable?
Jacek Olczak: No. whatsoever. I mean, we had that pricing in quite a number of markets at the very beginning of January or towards the end of the last year. So, on the pricing side, I haven’t observed anything. No, I don’t think there is any risk of that nature.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then in the Philippines, you mentioned to get to 20% to 25% declines in volume for the year. You need the government to crackdown on the non-duty paid dynamic. But that’s been a historical factor in the market. Is there any evidence that with prices up and the illicit volumes growing that the government is taking that any more seriously than it has in the past?
Jacek Olczak: I think there was that problem, historically. You are absolutely right. Historically, we had some problems with some non-duty paid domestic product. However, that thing essentially exploded since new tax kicked in and we increased the prices. As I said, if we look at the consumption trends, I mean our estimate of the consumption trend in the Philippines at the moment as we speak, so this is still relatively early after the new prices hit the market. I would argue that the consumption decline is in the lower range of 20% to 25% decline which we foresee for the market for the full-year. The smoking incidents stays relatively flat at 50%, actually flat at 50%. As we do observe some decline in the daily consumption, you know the daily consumption market is very much driven by stick purchases, about 70% of the volume goes on the stick purchase, and we see the daily consumption drop from 13 to 12 sticks per day. So, you add these numbers together, you are actually in the lower range of 20% to 25% decline. We see our shipments volume and the industry volumes as estimated by the Bureau of Internal Revenues and we have a huge gap to reconcile.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Jacek Olczak: We see the volumes in the market, so they are clearly coming from the illicit sources.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just lastly, Jacek on cash flow, you reiterated the objective of having a growth year-on-year, currency-neutral and free cash flow, but it's down quite substantially in the first quarter. I think that's the second consecutive first quarter with a substantial decline in cash flow. Can you just speak to what happened in the discrete first-quarter cash flow? Why is it down and then you know what is going to be different in the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Jacek Olczak: I think the developments on the finished goods, receivables and the tax payables, excise tax payables connected with corresponding volumes, build up inventories, they actually improved. We had one-off items you like, which was the timing of the payment of the withholding stocks on the profit which were to the U.S., which happen to take place in the first quarter of this year. If I take that that item out actually my free cash flow would be up, so we're still confident that the free cash flow for the full year can grow actually at the higher rate than our revenues.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: So debt repayment cash outflow was later in the year last year last year and it was in the first quarter this year?
Jacek Olczak: Happens to be. It will take place in the first quarter of this year.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions in Asia, so first just in terms of your margin performance there, clearly you had the impact of the Philippines volume there, but you had pretty strong volume in Japan as a result of the inventory movement, but the margins were still down. So, can you just help us understand the margin performance in Asia in Q1?
Jacek Olczak: I think it is mostly driven by Indonesia, the cost pressure the closed prices the raw material which we are using very manufacturing significantly increased over the last period, so we had the pressure of that and pricing in Indonesia has a tendency to be build over the year rather than just at the beginning of the year, so usually we had a slower start. I mean, you have a cost pressure coming from Indonesia and at the beginning we cannot offset it fully by the price and I think this should disappear during the year and actually Asia should be able to improve the margins for the full-year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then in Japan, I think you called out share was down a little bit, called out the increased promotional activities from your competitor. So, can you just elaborate sort of the nature of those promotional activities? How much do you think that that's in part driven by the currency movement that's giving and JT more of the cost advantage in that market and do you think that that will continue to put a little bit more competitive pressure in your business and how you are sort of responding to that?
Jacek Olczak: Difficult for me to comment how JT's allocating their resources, but clearly the marketing promotional spend both, in terms of the new product introductions and the promotional support of existing products in the market from JT in first quarter was massive. And to that extent, yes, we lost some share on the Lark and Philip Morris. However on a positive note, I haven't seen the Marlboro losing adult in a share. So, frankly speaking, I would read it as a positive on Marlboro that despite is a very high spend from a JT remain the market share of Marlboro, but I have to admit that Lark and put into lark and Philip Morris yet they contributed to summarize in the overall share. We have launched two Lark brands towards the end of the quarter, so we don't see them in the quarter to innovative custom product behind the Lark and we also announced launch of the new Marlboro, highly innovative the first two capsule product, which will hit the market somewhere May-June. Our ambition is still to grow the share in Japan, but as I said, we are confronted with the most expense from the JT.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just lastly, in Australia just following the implementation of plain packaging, what kind of consumption performance or trends are you seeing? And then what is happening in terms of your actual volume?
Jacek Olczak: Okay, in Australia, we are roughly four months since the introduction of plain packaging. At this early stage, the Australian market has not yet shown any significant changes in consumer purchasing behavior. The volumes in the quarter were stable and this compared actually, with the 4% decline which tool place in the first quarter of last year. This stable volume, I believe, reflect the impact of disruptions in connection with the transition to the plain packaging last December, and there were some evidence with deflation, et cetera when manufacturers had to replace the old parts with the new parts. Frankly speaking, based on the first quarter data, it would appear that consumer down trading might have accelerated slightly but this trend, however, has been a part of the Australian market for several years where the consumers are showing a bit more sensitivity to the rate of tax and the price increases. As you remember, in February this year, there was a price increase, I think, of around 4% in the market. So if take all of these things together, in short, I think at this moment, the impact of plain packaging itself is not yet evident in the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: I just wanted to ask a little bit about price (inaudible). Maybe if you could give us some color on whether or not down trading pressures are increasing for your non-OECP markets. What's going on broadly with some of your price cuts and then your outlook for this as the year progresses?
Jacek Olczak: No, frankly speaking, I don’t see that much of a pressure on the down trading. It will have to take the EU out of the equation although as you have noticed, (inaudible) continues quarter-on-quarter growth in the EU, even in Germany, recently. We see that the there the actually the premium segment is slightly growing. It is a phenomenon which we have not seen for a long time. Outside EU, there are different forms of up trading. You see the premium segment growing in a number of markets. Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam, big or small market. Russia, more up trading is happening from the low price segment to the new price segment. I think the premium segment in Russia is flat as we more or less have seen it over the year. So, no, I don’t think it is that that much of the risks to us and worries which will come from the down trading. As you have seen in the Marlboro and Parliament, I should mention, they are growing across all geographies.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay, that’s good. Then in terms of Japan, could you touch on what you think the likelihood for price increase, ahead of the consumption tax increase and April 2014 is (inaudible), what sort of necessary steps and timing of getting this to happen in the country?
Jacek Olczak: Japan, still is a market where there is sort of price control in to light. This would require the consent of Ministry of Finance and as you know, we are not the market leader on this market. So not necessarily we are calling the shot there. So there also we have to see whatever the tax announcement of the tax, the sale price increases at the beginning of the next year will happen because we also hear some news that maybe government want to change the policy. Nothing concrete but we will have to see that unfolds.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay, and then just my final question would be on NGP and just maybe an update on some of the progress again compared with your clinical trials and then recently the ATU has talked about their less harmful cigarettes and then their strategy to transfer their technology to their existing cigarettes. So I guess not necessarily new lines but I would like it if you could talk about your approach with your NGP and then how you plan on rolling that out and how you will address that either with your brand franchise or new lines and further pros and cons of these strategies?
Jacek Olczak: Well, we are progressing as per planned. With the clinical, the regulator engagement, and also with being ready to finally start building our manufacturing capability. As you remember we have a three platforms of NGPs which we are working on potentially simultaneously. I believe all of them altogether should address all consumers' needs which are in the market.  Our fundamentals of common denominator, behind the [platforms] is we are not going for the selective reduction of a small constituent, we just want to bring the level the old constituents down, so we focus on the reduction of changing the process from the combustions for heating etcetera, so that is our approach and we feel pretty confident about it.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Just quickly Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, Canada region both seem to have surprisingly strong price mix, particularly given the sort of geography of where the volume growth is being in South Africa. Can you explain why that is?
Jacek Olczak: Potentially the of North Africa, so Egypt, other locations as well. We are also benefiting from some disruptions, which we had on our supply chain, especially at the beginning of the last year. As you remember, there were some disturbances connected with springs affects us, but once we brought the stability to our supply chain, our brands are in a full distribution, I mean they clearly reaping benefits of this. I think in Latin America, price increase which we taken in Brazil. I think there was pricing in the Mexico at the beginning of the year, pricing in Argentina. I think in the first quarter, I think all together this contributes to the stronger pricing contribution coming from this and also the volumes as I mentioned North Africa especially.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Just with regards if you ignore the Philippines and look at the sort of various trade inventory movements that have occurred in the first quarter, because obviously there's positives in Japan, Russia and negatives in Turkey and Ukraine. I mean, excluding the Philippines is that being a net benefit to sales line or negative?
Jacek Olczak: No. I think, it's positive from Japan and positive in Russia and there's essentially two places where we had positive. I think still the negatives would offset this so that had a drag on quarter rather than a benefit, if you like, in a quarter.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Your pricing, in the quarter was very strong. I mean, at that rate do you think you would be able to exceed this to 1.8 billion from last year in cost variance?
Jacek Olczak: For obvious reasons, I cannot comment about the future pricing, but yes I mean as the quarter indicates indicate that the pricing is strong and is obviously supported also by the pretty pragmatic if I [say] so tax regimes. I mean, again excluding the Philippines, which we discuss separately. So, you know it's a good pricing environment and that would have a stronger pricing volume.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of country related questions for you, Jacek. The first one is in relation to the Philippines. I just was curious about two factors. One would be that you are seeing some low price competition, and I guess I was curious is Fortune not going to lower prices or get more promotional work to read that. Then related to that, Marlboro did relatively well, so I am just curious as to price gaps and it was very early there, but the price gaps are at all allowing for some better performance of premium brands.
Jacek Olczak: Well, as we said, unfortunate thing about the Philippines Stock Exchange is the magnitude of the change in a short period of time, the magnitude of an increase. However, immigration of the reductions to [TOs] on a full specific system they do support it, the narrow the price gaps narrow. So, clearly Marlboro going forward should benefit from closer of the gaps in a relative terms. When it comes to the lower price competition, I think we have to remember about one thing. Philippines is a big pricing market, okay? So, dollars can cut the prices on their own in the outlet. There are about 1 million outlets in Philippines out of which we have about a quarter, roughly about a quarter, so what our self have to go and manage the right the right price per stick, which is important in that market and price per pack and bring the price down to the recommended level. That’s clearly something which we are doing in the first quarter. I think its going to continue very heavily in the second quarter. That obviously requires some extra spending. But, I think, once we bring the prices to the recommended level, we should be in a good situation. I also should mention that the sequential evolution in the volumes, if anything, when we started the year, I think the first week of the year, our shipments were down by about 50%, very quickly will move to the 40%, then the 30% decline. Actually, if I look at, essentially the last few days, we almost had a 20% something decline. So we know that the total market goes in the right direction which I have to manage the price and address or help the government or hope that the government will improve the tax collection from all market participants.
Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay, that’s very helpful. The other question I have for you is in relation to Russia. Marlboro had a bit of a softer performance. I was curious if that was somehow related to inventory movements a year ago. I know that inventory overall was a benefit to Russia. Then, just to understand the investments you made in that market. I know Marlboro has been a really key focus for you. any comments on that or any relation to the weaker performance this quarter?
Jacek Olczak: Okay, investment in Russia is behind Marlboro but also behind the Parliament, L&M and a number of other brands. We, in general, still think the much stronger, much robust infrastructure, sales, marketing infrastructure, as much as the Marlboro in which we are investing. Obviously, Marlboro is our focus, as you know, it’s the only brand which internally we have a much higher expectation for the performance. There is a significant price increase. So I will have to wait a little bit how the prices, or how the situation tabulate in the market. I would argue that Marlboro, essentially, for the last few quarters in Russia is flat. We obviously shoot higher. But for the time being, it is flat. Marlboro, over the past two years, took RUB 5 higher price increases than the rest of the market, because in the meantime we are trying to reposition the Marlboro really to the premium segment. So if I take all the large price increases in Russia and Marlboro adding on the top of this RUB 5, and I had a brand stable for the last few quarters, I think it is actually a good thing about the rest. However, we still have to wait until the Marlboro markets is going to grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: I want to ask a question on Indonesia first. Just to understand how you think about the competitive threat, if any, from the Gudang Garam Mild that just launched a couple of weeks ago. Obviously, it is just new in the market but they are doing TV commercials, they have got a little bit of a price discount to A Mild. Is that something that you might stand to defend against or do you see that, Mild has been obviously a lot of share gains. Dow do you think about that as an addition to the competitive equation?
Jacek Olczak: Well, as you remember, last year, we grew the share hold by almost by three point. With this quarter, we open with almost 1.5 point share advancement. Obviously our share continues to grow. A have to admit that the last year, our share growth was somehow supported by the more attractive price points for a number of our key brand. Some of this, as we take in continuously the pricing and increasing the pricing in Indonesia, some of this attractive price point, we are going to lose. But we are still looking into the share growth in Indonesian. We are launching our product. We are expanding our product as well. So I don’t its any sort of track that you will be able to see at this stage coming from, frankly speaking, in a competitive right now.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay, that’s helpful. Then, I know you have touched on this a little bit but can you give us some from color on the pacing. You said the second half would be stronger but the 2Q and 3Q are your easiest comparisons and so can you just highlight some more of the reasons that 2Q wouldn’t also be a strong or what will help 4Q that the second half would be stronger just what some of the drivers are that shape how the year plays out?
Jacek Olczak: Okay, I think the reason why I said that we think second half of this year to be stronger than the first half, there are a few reasons. One is, we have a new annualization. We have  annualization of the increased spending we started already in the first half of 2012. This was mainly Russia, but also some Asian market. It's also in the timing of our launches which we had the in first half of the last year versus the first half of this year. Secondly, as I mentioned that we have to increase our spending in Philippines towards the end of the first quarter and I think is going to continued through the second quarter towards the situation which we have with compliance with the recommended prices at the retail level and also to address some competitive pressures there. Also, if you remember we already in February that the three-quarters of 75% of our pricing was already been pretty heavily year. So, yes I mean some of these volumes will have to recover and that recovery in some places may continue through the Q2. Then obviously is also the shipment patterns which were having some market with some distortions may continue, will continue actually for the Q2. So, as I said we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half of this year.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: That's helpful. Then just my last question, you've talked before about opportunity that it could be the regain even sort of your fair share of illicit trade or just the stem that growth even, but it seems to be still more of a threat than an opportunity. What could make that tide turn? I know you've put money into Poland things, but how far off is that from having any impact? When should we see that actually start to become something that is heading the other way instead of gaining share?
Jacek Olczak: This is a process. Okay? It's going to take time. I mentioned Turkey in my remarks is one of the markets where despite the prices increases etcetera, tax increase and the price increases, government doing a lot of right things on illicit trade, and we see that through volume coming to the industry. I mean despite the tax and the price increase in Turkey we still think that the volumes for the full year helped by the recovery of illicit trade is going to be flat, so we can see that. I think also that recently I think this week in EU is going to be another serious wakeup call to the number of the states in EU, because letting the contraband growing from a 10-plus percent last year to 11-plus percent this year in the middle of this crisis, I mean it doesn't necessarily tells the good thing about the number of the law enforcement authorities in the many of the EU countries, but this is going to take time. I admit it. We are working with Interpol, we are working on tightening the supply chain. There is cooperation among the industry members, the legitimate industry members, but more has to be done.
Michael Lavery - CLSA: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Good morning. I think you alluded to it already, but in markets like Italy and the EU you have a down trading market yet the premium brands that you have there are gaining market share. Can you give us a little bit more background how the dynamics there work?
Jacek Olczak: Well, first of all there is a number of the brand support activities, which were deploying behind Marlboro, okay? The whole commercial organization, commercial approach which we have already announced at the time on Investors Day last year here, and we start yielding results. Second, in most of the countries the tax regimes are actually more and more supporting or not allowing for the too much of the down trading. I mean the price gaps despite the fact that they are price increases tends to narrow, so you know they have the minimum taxes, very high minimum taxes, or just the specific structure. I think this all together has clearly brand like Marlboro, but I think Marlboro quarter-after-quarter in terms of a EEMA's equity etcetera is getting into better and better shape.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies: Okay. Then in Japan for the last three quarters, your market share has been drifting down again after the post tsunami gains. What's your outlook? At what point you can actually maintain your year-over-year market shares in Japan?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I still think that we can make a share advancement in Japan. I mean, the quarterly 27.5%. I mean, that's not what we would expect, so I think the. There are still three quarters to go. We have a pipeline of our products and the programs there in place, but as I said earlier, answering one of the previous questions, there is a massive support from JT behind the Mevius in terms of the product promotion. The other manufacturers are already pretty active with launching their product. It's a competitive environment. I look at this also positively that despite that there is a massive spending and activity coming from a competition or competitor, Marlboro actually is extremely resilient. I mean, that said, that's very important for us. We will have to address the situations with Lark, Philip Morris going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Just a brief question on the United Kingdom and the outlook for plain packaging in there. I thought the comment on the Australia were helpful. But what do you see in terms of the risk of the U.K. government moving forward on plain packaging and how do you see such a move does occur affecting the approaches if other governments within the EU that have expressed interest, such as the Irish most recently?
Jacek Olczak: Well, not much strategies on the U.K. actually because the government still have not revealed what is the conclusion of the public consultation in pack assessment, et cetera. So we are waiting for the decision of the government in which directions they really want to go. At the same time as you know there is still a tobacco product directive which is in the making, There are still pretty important steps to go over the tobacco product directive. We will then have a much better visibility, really how many markets are key and if you like I am willing to introduce the plain packaging in many markets over there. As you know the plain packaging in European Union also at the member states level has the number of legal challenges for its implementation. So we will have to see. And as I said, so far it's early, but so far especially on the smoking, on consumption of cigarette in Australia, you don't really see, as expected, frankly speaking, any impact coming from the plain packaging, despite what was promised at the beginning. So as evidenced, I have got the feeling its not being built in Australia. I mean there is still no evidence.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori of Credit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Credit Suisse: Jacek, could you talk a bit about your other two big markets in the EU, France and Spain? Particularly in France, you reported market volumes down 8.6%, but in the last call you flag a decline of 3.4% in January. So is it fair to say that cigarette volumes are getting worse? Then in Spain I think you reported cigarette market volume down 15%. So, I was just wondering about the shape of the quarter and the underlying decline in this market?
Jacek Olczak: I think that France is still, towards the end of the last year we had a price increase in France. So market is still in the recovery. Although I have to admit that macros in the France are not the most encouraging, right. The employment, the GDP, et cetera are not necessarily going in the right direction. Spain also had the beginning of the year price increase, but early in January. I think there was a $0.15 price increase in Spain. So we will have to wait presumably a few months to see how the situation develops there. But as I said this is all both France and Spain as we see today are all in my forecast or estimate of the total market decline for the EU to be broadly in a range of last year. Italy, I will repeat it as well, I mean it’s the only country. The main country which I have on the watch list with regards to the VAT development.
Rogerio Fujimori - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then secondly, you mentioned that we should expect some trade inventory distortions in the second quarter. Could you just elaborate on that to help us with our models please? Thank you.
Jacek Olczak: I think it would be mainly in Asia and mainly still in Japan. I think the last quarter when we rebuild our inventories to the safety level what we require to what we regard as a safety level for the Japanese markets to place in the Q2, if you remember properly of last year. So clearly I will be missing this one this year.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, the investor relations team here in Switzerland. The phone numbers are available on the press release. Again, thank you very much for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Philip Morris International first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2012 Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 and comparing them to the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit, and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures which are posted on our website. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Louis Camilleri, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer who will join Louis for the question-and-answer period. Louis?
Louis Camilleri: Thank you, Nick and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. As expected, we finished 2012 on a very strong note with fourth quarter organic cigarette volume growth of 2.9%; net revenues and adjusted Operating Companies Income or OCI both excluding currency and acquisitions increasing by 6.4% and 12.3% respectively; and adjusted diluted earnings per share growing by 16.4% excluding currency. Our strong volume performance was partially flattered by some favorable inventory movements, which we estimate added some 60 basis points to our 2.9% growth rate. Cigarette volume for the full year reached 927 billion units, an increase of 1.3% on an organic basis. The solid performance reflects the breadth of our geographic coverage, our excellent balance between emerging and developed markets, and our superior brand portfolio. The key volume drivers were the EEMA and Asia regions, where we realized organic volume growth of 4.6% and 4.2% respectively, which more than offset a 13.5 billion unit or 6.4% volume erosion in the European Union region, reflecting a decline in cigarette industry volume due to continued economic woes particularly in Southern European markets. In 2012, we achieved strong market share performances across all four regions with gains of close to 1 share point in the Asia, EEMA, and Latin America and Canada regions, and an essentially unchanged share in the European Union region despite significant competitive trade loading in Germany at the end of the years. As a result our global market share excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.5 percentage points to a record 28.8% in 2012. Our global volume and share performance should be solid in 2013 and we anticipate organic volume growth of up to 1% excluding the Philippines. Continued strong pricing across all four regions was the key driver of our revenue and OCI growth. Generating a favorable variance of $1.8 billion in 2012.We incurred a slightly unfavorable volume mix variance, with positive volumes, stable brand mix and an unfavorable geographic mix. Indeed absent the Japan hurdle, our volume mix variance would have been positive which we view as a significant achievement. In addition we increased our investments in the business notably in Germany, Indonesia and Russia focusing in particular on our key brands in market field forces and infrastructures.In 2012 net revenues grew by 5.6% excluding currency and acquisitions, on the same basis adjusted operating companies income increased by over $1.1 billion or 8.1%. These growth rates were at the high end of our mid to long term currency neutral annual growth targets of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8% respectively.Our strong business results and our substantial share repurchase programs, enable us to increase our adjusted diluted earnings per share to a level of $5.22 in 2012 representing a growth rate of 11.7% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.23 per share. We entered 2013 with strong business fundamentals and excellence trends and we’re optimistic on the prospects of our business. With the recent exception of the Japanese Yen exchange rates have generally stabilized compared to 2012 and we’re forecasting a currency headwind of approximately $0.06 per share in 2013 at prevailing rates. We must recognize however that currency rates remain volatile. Our reported diluted earnings per share guidance of prevailing exchange rates is in a range of $5.68 to $5.78 versus $5.17 in 2012.This corresponds to a growth rate excluding currency of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22 in 2012. Thus we again expect to meet our mid-to-long term currency neutral annual EPS growth target in 2013. This would be the six consecutive years of achieving this target. This guidance factors in the expected impact of the disruptively large excise tax increase that took place at the beginning of this year in the Philippines. The new law increase the excise tax on premium price Marlboro and low price Fortune from 12 to 25 pesos and from 2.72 to 12 pesos per pack respectively.In a response we have increased the recommended retail price per pack of Marlboro from 32 to 51 pesos and that of Fortune from 15 to 25.5 pesos. It will take several months before we can accurately gauge the actual impact of such pricing on total industry volume and on potential consumer down trading.The volume impact however is expected to be considerable in a range of 20% to 25%. We nevertheless anticipate that the impact on our earnings will be marginal given our pricing actions. I would like to say a few words about one of the key regulatory challenges that we’re facing, the European Union’s proposed new tobacco products directives or TPD.Let me emphasize at this stage, it is a proposal, the content of which still has to be approved by both the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. During this review process, it maybe amended and the final outcome remains uncertain. Once the consensus is reached by both the Council and the Parliament, the TPD has to be transposed into local laws by each member state. The European Commission has indicated that it expects that it will take through 2014 to reach an agreement and the full implementation will only incur in 2015 or even 2016.The proposed TPD does not mandate plain packaging as was feared, but it does contain a number of proposals that we believe have no credible scientific basis and would be counterproductive. These relate both to products and their packaging. It calls notably for a ban on menthol and slimmer cigarettes and the introduction of 75% graphic health warnings. Menthol and slimmer cigarettes accounted for approximately 10% of European Union cigarette industry volume in 2012 though in markets such as Poland accounted for about one-third of consumption. We believe that such measures would inevitably lead to both an increase in illicit trade and a reduction in government revenues with no benefit to public health. Rest assured that we will do everything in our power to ensure that reason prevails and that the obvious unintended consequences of the current draft do not materialize.As mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve organic cigarette volume growth, excluding the Philippines in 2013. Strong volume growth in the EEMA regions and the other Asian markets is forecast to more than offset continued volume declines in the European Union region, where no significant overall improvement is foreseen until the current high levels of unemployment are meaningfully reduced. Our key premium brands Marlboro and Parliament are performing strongly, as volume and share are expanding across a wide range of geographies. Our overall brand portfolio is in excellent shape with a strong complementary presence in profitable mid and low priced segments.The global excise tax environment remains reasonable with the obvious exception of the Philippines and the pricing environment continues to be favorable. Pricing will again be the key growth driver of our earnings. Some 75% of our anticipated pricing variance in 2013 upon which our guidance is predicated has already been implemented or announced. The Asia, EEMA, and Latin America and Canada regions are forecast to generate strong OCI growth again this year, while we expect to be able to maintain our current high level of profitability in the European Union region, excluding currency.Our brands are performing very well with 8 of our top 10 brands increasing volume in 2012, excluding the Japan hurdle. Arguably, our greatest achievement in 2012 was the continued growth of Marlboro with its architecture firmly in place complemented by the new campaign and the continued rollout of an array of consumer relevant line extensions across the Flavor, Gold, and Fresh lines, Marlboro continued to expand its share on a global basis to reach 9.3%, excluding China and the U.S.For the first time, since the 2008 spin Marlboro grew share in all four regions underscoring its enhanced brand equity, continued relevance, and renewed vitality. Above premium price, Parliament achieved double-digit volume growth last year to reach a total of 43.4 billion units. This excellent result was driven by its superb performance in Turkey, in Russia, and across Eastern Europe as well as in Middle East. Parliament has a refined luxury image and has benefited from packaging upgrade and the launch of the industry’s first ever re recessed filter capsule product in Korea. We’re also very pleased with the renewed strength of L&M in 2012. Volume grew by 4% to 93.7 billion units.This growth was driven by increased availability in Egypt. The long awaited turn around in Russia, a strong performance across the bakkens, shared gains in Thailand and a higher volume in Turkey. In the European Union region, L&M continued to grow share in this five most important markets, namely Slovakia, Poland, Belgium, Germany and (inaudible). However this was offset by a shared decline in markets in the Southern part of the Europe largely compensated by share gains on Chesterfields. On a regional basis, L&M share was stable at 6.6% last year.Our leading position and our strong share growth momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Based on an expanded Nielsen coverage, we have updated our market data on Indonesia. In 2012 we estimate that the total cigarette industry volume increased by 8.2% to 303 billion units driven by favorable demographics and a strong economy. We expect continued strong industry volume growth in a range of 5% to 6% going forward.Our volume search by 17.5% last year and we expanded our market share from 32.8% to 35.6% a gain of 2.8 share points. Our strong premium skewed portfolio led by some Sampoerna A and our superior national distribution was reinforced by favorable retail price points.I would also like to highlight our strong performance in two email markets, our volume in Russia increased by 3.8% last year while total industry volume declined an estimated 1.3% over the same period driven by higher prices. In 2012, we gained 0.5 percentage share points, thanks to the strength of our broadly based portfolio and investments in marketing and sales. The key drivers of our market share growth were above premium parliaments, mid-priced L&M and low price Bond Street and Next. Importantly, we improved our position in the growing slimmer diameter segment.Last autumn the Russian parliament approved excised tax increases for 2013 in-line with it's previously published plans. Subsequently we registered new retail prices with increases of 6 to 7 rubles per pack across our portfolio. In Turkey, total cigarette industry volume grew by 8.8% last year to 99 billion units driven by a reduction in a listed trade, trade loading in the fourth quarter of 2012 ahead of a full seen excise tax and price increase. A weak fourth quarter 2011 growth in the adult population and the strong economic environment. Our volume increased by 12.7% last year and we expanded our market share by a further 0.9 points to 45.7%.At the same time we improved our mix behind the growth of premium parliaments and mid-priced (inaudible). In January we increased our retail prices by 1 Turkish Lira per pack and responded to the excise tax increase that was announced by the government. The new excise tax regime now includes a specific element for the very first time. In contrast the business environment in the Southern part of Europe remains very challenging as illustrated by Italy where unemployment reached 11.1% in November 2012, 1.7 above the prior year level.In 2012, Italy’s cigarette industry volumes declined by 7.9% as adult smokers impacted by a reduction in purchasing power switched to lower taxed fine cut products and to illicit trade, which grew by some 40% and 80% respectively. However, during the year, the government reduced the tax differential between fine cut and cigarettes. Consequently, the growth of the fine cut category slowed to less than 2% in the fourth quarter when cigarette volume declined by a more moderate 4%.Despite this challenging environment, our brands performed strongly in Italy. Marlboro grew its cigarette market share by 0.6 points to 23.1%. The growth accelerated in the fourth quarter when its share increased 1.3 points to 23.5%. We successfully launched Philip Morris Selection in the growing international low-priced segment at the beginning of 2012. It achieved a 0.5% share for the full year and 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Finally, Chesterfield in addition to holding its own in the cigarette category obtained a 23.5% share of the fine cut category.While revenue growth remains the key to success in our business, we continue to be very focused on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted Operating Companies Income margin increased in 2012 from 44.1% to 45.2%, excluding currency. This improvement reflects not only higher pricing, but also limited cost increases, our success in surpassing our $300 million one year productivity target and our continued efforts to optimize our manufacturing footprint. This year, we are targeting a further $300 million in productivity savings to help offset expected moderate increases in lease and direct materials as well as higher clove costs. While our business continued to generate growing amounts of cash from higher earnings, our free cash flow of $8.4 billion in 2012 was down $1.1 billion or 11.6%, excluding currency. This decline was attributable to higher working capital requirements of $1.7 billion as well as a $220 million increase in capital expenditures.The working capital increase was primarily driven by Indonesia, where our business growth led to higher tobacco leaf and finished goods inventories and where we took advantage of a larger, but admittedly significantly more expensive clove crop to build stocks for future business growth. In addition, we needed to replenish our global tobacco leaf stocks following our unexpectedly large cigarette sales in Japan in 2011. The increase in capital expenditures is attributable in particular to production capacity increases in the Asia and EEMA regions.We anticipate a strong increase in our currency neutral free cash flow in 2013 though we do plan further increases in capital expenditures related notably to additional capacity in Indonesia and to the establishment of next generation products manufacturing capacity. In addition, as has been the case historically, forestalling related inventory requirements can fluctuate significantly and are difficult to forecast accurately. However in 2013, we project that our cash flow growth will exceed that of our earnings growth.As you can see on this chart since the 2008 spend, we have transformed the higher proportion of our growing net revenues into free cash flow than any of our consumer products in tobacco industry peers. In September last year, we increased our dividend by a further 10.4% bringing the cumulative increase since 2008 to 84.8%. We initiated a new three-year $18 billion share repurchase program in August of 2012. Last year, in total, we spent $6.5 billion to repurchase 74.9 million shares.We remain committed to a balanced program of returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we target share repurchases of 6 billion in 2013. In conclusion, we expect to deliver strong results again in 2013? A diluted earnings per share guidance is $5.68 to $5.78, this corresponds to a 10% to 12% growth rate excluding currency, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22. This is fully in-line with our mid-to-long term currency neutral, annual EPS growth targets which we have achieved or surpassed every year of our existence as an independent public company.The excise tax and regulatory environment we believe are manageable. The pricing environment remains favorable and we have already achieved 75% of the pricing that is baked into our 2013 guidance. We forecast organic volume growth this year excluding the Philippines. We have strong growth momentum, Marlboro gained share in all four regions, parliament achieved double digit volume growth and our business in the Asia and the EMO regions is in great shape. The EU region remains fragile but we certainly do not anticipate a deterioration thus is the overall consumption trends we observed in 2012.We forecast strong free cash flow growth excluding currency this year and we remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through attracted dividends and substantial share repurchase programs.Since March 2008, we have returned the total of nearly $50 billion to our shareholders and repurchased 23.2% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spend. Thank you for your attention. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources.

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek.
Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our business are solid despite the difficult comparisons in the third quarter that we have previously discussed. We expect to achieve our annual organic volume growth target of 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth in line with our mid- to long-term constant currency annual growth target for the full year 2012. Today, we narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.12 to $5.18 compared to $4.85 in 2011. This guidance includes unfavorable currency of $0.23, a tax charge of $0.05 related to the closing of the U.S. federal income tax audit for the years 2004 to 2006 and $0.02 of asset impairment and exit costs. Excluding the impact of currency, the aforementioned tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011. Let me remind you that if we exclude the $0.10 hurdle due to Japan in 2011, the growth rate would be even higher at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our revised guidance also reflects the increased investments in marketing, sales and distribution, particularly in the Asia and EEMA regions. Turning to our third quarter results. We posted our strongest-ever quarterly results this time last year with organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4% and adjusted diluted EPS up 33% on a currency-neutral basis. As expected, therefore, our third quarter results this year suffered from these very tough comparisons with organic cigarette volume down 1.3% and adjusted diluted EPS up only 5.8% on a currency-neutral basis. Through the end of September this year, we have achieved strong results with organic cigarette volume up by 0.7%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, our net revenues and adjusted OCI have increased by 5.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS has grown on a currency-neutral basis by 10.9%. Let me now move to the European Union where economic conditions continue to be very difficult. Unemployment continues to rise in the southern European countries, most notably Spain. Consequently, tax-paid cigarette volumes were down at a double-digit rate in the quarter in Greece, Spain and Italy, while in contrast, the decline in Germany was a much more moderate 2%. For the EU region as a whole, the decline was 7.5%, an improved trend compared to the second quarter, and down 6.5% through the first 9 months of the year. For the full year 2012, we still expect that cigarette industry volume will decline by about 6%. A key component in the decline of the duty-paid cigarette market in Southern Europe has been adult smokers switching to lower-taxed fine cut products and to illicit cigarettes. This can be illustrated by Italy where the duty-paid cigarette industry volume declined by 10.1% during the third quarter, while fine cut grew by 41%. In addition, the incidence of nondomestic illicit trade for 2012 in Italy is expected to reach approximately 9%, up from an estimated 6.5% in 2011. Our business performed very well in this difficult environment. Marlboro gained 0.8 points in the quarter to reach a cigarette market share of 23.5%. This was sufficient, along with the 0.4 share points gained by Philip Morris Selection, to more than offset the share decline of our traditional local brand, Diana. Overall, PMI's market share rose by 0.2 points to 53.2%. We are now also the leader in the fine cut category and doubled our share to 27.2% behind Chesterfield and the launch of Diana. In Germany, where unemployment remains low, cigarette industry volume declined just 2% in the third quarter, while sales of fine cut products increased by 2.3%. These robust trends took place despite tax-driven retail price increases earlier this year and were due in part to a reduction in border sales. Marlboro continued to gain share in the cigarette category in the third quarter, up 0.2 points to 21%. With L&M essentially stable at 10.2%, our overall cigarette market share was in line with 2011. In the EU region as a whole, economic conditions will remain difficult until the issue of unemployment is tackled. In the third quarter, our cigarette shipments declined by 8.1% or 4.6 billion units, driven by the 7.5% decrease in the industry volume. Our fine cut volume in contrast increased by 15.2%. The drop in our cigarette volume can be in large part attributed to an increase in illicit trade, particularly in southern European countries where total tobacco smoking incidence levels have remained relatively stable. We are very pleased by the performance of Marlboro in the quarter. In an obviously difficult environment for premium brands, Marlboro was able to expand its market share by 0.4 points to 18.4%. Marlboro's share grew not only in Germany and Italy but also in markets such as Belgium, Greece and across Central Europe, notably Poland. L&M remained resilient despite a 0.2 share points decline to 6.5%, attributable to adult smokers up-trading to Marlboro in Greece and Poland. Chesterfield gained 0.3 points to reach 3.5%, reinforcing our overall position in the low-price segment. Overall, our cigarette market share remained stable at 38.1%, while we further expanded our position in fine cut, adding 0.6 points to reach a category share of 13.4%. Across the EU region, our pricing remained strong, the latest increase having taken place this month in France. However, the positive pricing variance was insufficient to offset the volume decline. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency, were consequently down by 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. This also reflects the continued investments behind our brands and field sales force. In the first 9 months of the year, adjusted OCI on the same basis has decreased by just 0.9%, and we remain confident that we should be able to achieve an increase in profitability, excluding currency, in the EU region for the full year 2012. Our results in the Asia region were impacted by the difficult volume comparisons in Japan and Korea, where our shipments grew by 47.1% and 22.4%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2011. We also faced challenging comparisons in Indonesia, where we achieved a 22.5% volume increase in the third quarter of last year. Nevertheless, our volume this quarter in Indonesia grew by a further 13% as we continued to increase our share in this growing market. Adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by 1.2% in the Asia region during the quarter, this despite the unfavorable geographic mix. Improved profitability in Indonesia and higher pricing across the region more than offset the impact of lower volumes in Japan and Korea. Importantly, our market share in Korea has sequentially improved from the second to third quarter of this year and is at a higher margin following our price increase in February 2012. Industry volume in Japan declined by 7.7% in the quarter compared to a very distorted third quarter last year when distributor and trade inventories had been replenished to ensure adequate stock levels following the event in Japan. Nevertheless, we still expect stable industry volume for the full year 2012. PMI's market share of 27.5% in the third quarter reflects a continued positive trend for Marlboro, which increased its quarterly share sequential in 2012 to 12.5%. On a September year-to-date basis, PMI's market share of 27.8% remains nearly 3 share points higher than the level before the events unfolded in Japan last year. However, we have witnessed unusually high levels of competitive product introductions, which have put pressure on our traditional brands, Lark and Philip Morris. We continue to develop our innovation pipeline and expect Marlboro's positive momentum to continue. For the full year, we are now expecting our market share to be slightly below our 2011 exit share of approximately 28%. Our leading position and our strong share momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Market growth is expected to continue, driven by favorable demographics. In addition, improving consumer purchasing power is helping to drive up-trading, with the premium segment reaching a share of 27.4% in the third quarter compared to 24.9% a year ago. In the third quarter, we witnessed a decline in the low-price segment, where retail selling prices have increased at a faster rate than in other price segments. As a result, combined with the anticipated enforcement of Decree 191 by the end of November, which will eliminate a tax loophole, we expect industry volume to grow in the range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2012. Our volume increased by a further 13% in the third quarter, and market share grew by 3.3 points to 34.9%, with a particularly strong performance from premium-price Sampoerna A in the Kretek category and Marlboro in the white cigarette category. Let me conclude the Asia region with an update on plain packaging. As you know, the Australian High Court ruled in August that the plain packaging legislation does not violate the Australian Constitution and on October 5 issued its reason. In reaching a conclusion, 6 of the 7 High Court judges recognized that plain packaging deprives tobacco companies of valuable intellectual property. The conclusions of the High Court are significant for other governments considering plain packaging, as they demonstrate that plain packaging is a deprivation of property, something that we expect would raise serious questions about the legality of plain packaging legislation in other jurisdictions. The ruling turned on the specific, if not unique, nature of the Australian Constitution, which provides broad powers to the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws but contains few protections for basic rights. Australian law is violated only if the government, as the taker of property, receives a proprietary benefit from that property. Despite the fact that the property was taken, the Court found that the government did not acquire the property because it did not receive such a proprietary benefit. By contrast, the law in Europe and other countries is different. For example, in contrast to the Australian Constitution, the Constitutions of the EU Member States generally contain strong protections for fundamental rights and place limits on the powers of central governments. A finding that manufacturers have been deprived of property would, in our view, amount to a violation of a number of EU and Member State laws. Due to the scope of this specific case, the Australian High Court did not rule on whether plain packaging will reduce smoking prevalence or whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations. The High Court ruling confirms that other ongoing international legal cases are strong and that the Australian government is at serious risk of having to pay substantial compensation in these cases or bring its plain packaging measures into conformity with international treaties or both. Three countries have already initiated proceedings against Australia before the World Trade Organization on the ground that the plain packaging legislation is contrary to Australia's obligations as a WTO member. Philip Morris Asia is suing the Australian government for multiple breaches of its bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. Decisions in these cases are expected within 2 to 3 years. In broad terms, these cases will examine a number of issues, including whether there is any valid evidence that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates; whether there are effective, less restrictive alternatives that Australia could have implemented instead; whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations; and whether the Australian government will need to pay compensation to Philip Morris Asia. We believe that the international legal cases are strong, and there is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and resolved. Let me now move to the Latin America and Canada regions, which had solid share momentum in the third quarter. Although volume was down, we increased our share in the key markets of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Marlboro was particularly strong across the region, with share up in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 10.5% in the third quarter. The EEMA region was our strongest performance -- performer in the quarter, this despite a challenging comparison. Volume grew by 3% with continued strong business momentum in Russia and Turkey, as well as an improving market climate in Egypt. Higher volumes, a favorable mix and pricing in Russia and many other markets resulted in a growth in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 17.3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our volume mix has been favorable in the EEMA region. Russia was a key driver of our strong EEMA region performance, both in terms of volume and pricing. In July, we implemented a tax-driven RUB 3 per pack price increase. Along with lower revised estimates for industry volume in the first half of the year and higher prices in the market, industry volume is now expected to show a slight decline for the full year 2012. Our volume in contrast increased by 4.5% in the quarter, thanks to our good share momentum, as well as some favorable inventory adjustments. Our Nielsen market share on a quarter and year-to-date basis through the end of August was 0.7 and 0.6 points higher at 26.5% and 26.2%, respectively. Parliament, Bond Street and Next have remained the key drivers of our stronger share performance. We are also pleased that L&M's turnaround is gaining momentum, with a 0.2 share point gain in the first 2 months of the quarter. In Russia, the government approved amendments to the tax code at the end of September, including excise tax rates for the period 2013 to 2015. The government has reconfirmed the excise tax rates for cigarettes in 2013 and 2014 and extended the tax code to 2015, with an indexation of the specific excise tax set at 20%. The Duma will now review the code by mid-November, and we expect a final vote by year end. On a year-to-date September basis, Marlboro grew share in all 4 regions, benefiting from a robust pipeline of innovative products. Marlboro's share increased notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and Poland. On a worldwide basis, excluding China and the U.S.A., the brand's share increased to 9.3%. While we are pleased by Marlboro's strong performance, we are even more delighted by Parliament in the above premium segment. Parliament volume increased by 10.7% in the third quarter and by 9.4% so far this year. The brand has gained share year-to-date in 4 of its most important markets and is making inroads in newer markets. In Turkey, Parliament achieved a market share of 8.7%, representing a gain of 0.8 points August year-to-date. We continued to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our September year-to-date share reached 37%. This is 0.4 points above our full year 2011 share and 1.5 points above our full year 2010 share. The pricing environment continues to be favorable. This is highlighted by the $505 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter and the $1.3 billion year-to-date. The combination of strong pricing, limited input cost increases and productivity savings has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margin. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 46.2%, a gain of 0.7 points in the first 9 months of the year. On a September year-to-date basis, our free cash flow reached $7.1 billion. Compared to the previous year, free cash flow, excluding currency, was down $1.7 billion or 18.6%. The decrease was driven by higher working capital requirements, mainly related to finished goods forestalling and the planned replenishment of tobacco leaf and clove inventories. For the full year 2012, we expect that our free cash flow, excluding currency, will be down slightly and will not adversely impact our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our confidence in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to continue to generate significant cash flow is reflected in the 10.4% increase in our dividend that was announced last month. Since the March 2008 spin-off, we have raised the dividend 5x, increasing the annualized dividend by almost 85% over the period. We spent $1.5 billion to repurchase a further 16.7 million shares in the third quarter. Since the spin-off, we have now used almost $26 billion to repurchase nearly 467 million shares at an average price of $55.49. We continue to target spending of $6 billion this year. In conclusion, the third quarter of 2012 was, as expected, a difficult quarter in terms of comparisons with last year's record third quarter. Looking at our performance year-to-date through September, we remain confident that for the full year 2012, we should be able to deliver on our 1% organic volume annual growth target, driven by strong performances in the Asia and EEMA regions. We narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance to $5.12 to $5.18. Excluding the impact of currency, a tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%. Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver superior returns to our shareholders evidenced by the fifth consecutive increase in our dividend since the spin and our $6 billion target for share repurchases this year. Thank you, and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Jacek, so first, just in terms of guidance, I guess there's a lot of confusion just in terms of your guidance update. So if we look at the reported guidance now, $5.12 to $5.18, and compare that versus your prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.20, at the midpoint, it doesn't look like it's changed a whole lot, but you basically have taken the underlying guidance up, currency is a little bit more favorable. So can you just bridge the guidance kind of from $5.10 to $5.20 to $5.12 to $5.18, both underlying, in currency and et cetera?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. Yes, I think I'll start with our previous guidance, which was $5.10 to $5.20. And if you remember at that time, this guidance included the $0.27 of unfavorable currency versus the 2011. Our new guidance assumes the $0.23 of unfavorable currency, again versus 2011. So we have a gain of $0.04 on the currency. Also, in our previous guidance, we did not have the impact of the tax charge of the $0.05 related to the closing of the U.S. tax of this and the $0.01 for the asset impairment and exit costs. So it gives me a $0.06 or gives us a $0.06 of adjustment, if you like. So if I have a $0.05 adjusted for better currency or $0.04, adjusted for the tax charge negative $0.06, I am at the -- we were at the $5.08 to $5.18, which we narrowed upward, if you like, to the $5.12, $5.18. And this should imply a growth rate on x currency basis of approximately, as we said, 11% to 12% versus the adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in the previous year. And I think it's clear -- it should be clear now.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So when you think about 2013 and you think about your long-term growth target of 10% to 12% growth, would you be targeting to grow off of the $5.12 to $5.18 or the $5.18 to $5.24?
Jacek Olczak: One, for this year, would be $5.18 to $5.24. Actually, you should say $5.19 to $5.25, just not to further complicate the issue. We have the $0.01 of adjustment in the first 2 quarters of the year and the $0.01 extra of the adjustment for the [indiscernible] in the third quarter. So to be perfectly accurate, I should say it's $5.19 to $5.25.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Which is the base that you would target the 10% to 12% off for next year?
Jacek Olczak: That's right. That's correct.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of EU, Jacek, so it sounds like you're expecting some recovery in fourth quarter just versus what you've been seeing year-to-date. So can you just walk us through kind of why you're thinking that you do get some nice bounceback in fourth quarter to kind of get to that full year down 6% for EU?
Jacek Olczak: I think it's partially due to the comps which we expect for the Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. We've had a very bad or very low quarter driven by some timing of the pricing tax changes in the last year. So we expect this to ease the pressure for this year. And also, we see how the end of the quarter 3, which was very low, sorry, quarter 2, which was very low for the EU, and then how quarter 3 we closed. I think this gives us the confidence that we should be in a range of 6%, even, I would say, marginally, the volumes for the total market in EU may go a little bit below 6% or let's say 6% [indiscernible].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: My first question is on Japan. As you discussed, you've put a lot of new products in the market. So could you talk about how you're balancing this innovation while maintaining strength with some of your core brands in the country? And also, could you give us more color on the competitive pressures and how you see this playing out next year, such in light of Japan Tobacco's plans to change their Mild Seven brand name?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. As we said or I said in our remarks, we're very pleased with the performance of Marlboro, which not only is obviously about the level, which it had before the special situations in Japan. But also, sequentially, the quarter this year, [ph] Marlboro has a higher share. Our focus since the beginning of the year was essentially primary on Marlboro. So 4 out of 5 of the big year initiatives which we have deployed into the market were behind Marlboro, 2 behind Marlboro Ice Blast and 2 behind Marlboro Edge. The most growing or the most dynamic segment today in Japan is around menthol, super slim propositions and sometimes with the capsules -- with the menthol capsules. And this is exactly what we're pushing behind Marlboro. JT, because this I was referring mainly as the competitor deploying quite a large amount of new initiatives in the market, seems that they took a little bit of a different approach because this was broadly on the entire portfolio. So clearly, there are some brands which are more on the traditional spectrum of the consumers, and hence, the losses which we incurred in the quarter of this year are more on our traditional brands which is Lark. So Marlboro is in a very good shape. I think the innovations behind Marlboro [indiscernible] this year and what we have in the pipeline for the next year, I think we are in good shape. It's more of the fact that the focus of JT and the deploying number of innovations there and our share is a little bit below the 28% exit share. Now with regards to [indiscernible] and the Mild Seven, it's difficult for me to comment a competitor's move. It is clearly a very bold and a bright move and create some challenges presumably for JT and create, I would argue, some opportunities for others. So let's see how this thing is going to unfold in the market.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then I have another question, and it would be on Russia. How are you guys going to manage the scenario where there likely will be increased regulations, smoking bans and then taxes? What are your expectations for consumption in the market and consumer behavior, if these proposals are enacted? And then could you give us just a little bit more color on the progress you're making with Marlboro in Russia?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. So on our tax in Russia, I think, first, we're very pleased that the Russian government continues with this 3-year tax outlook. I mean, we always -- I think it is good from a government perspective when they heard the news and also from the industry that large perspective to have a 3-year tax visibility, adding the 2015, clarifying what rates they would like to have, is very helpful. Now that's clearly -- there will be a substantial target increase in the 2013, '14 and '15, but something which we planned or you could say we anticipated. So I think at the end of the day, it's going to turn manageable on the tax side. On the regulatory side, I'll discuss just for us also to understand, it still needs to be approved by Duma. This is not the final thing, but this is what we know at this point in time. In terms of the regulatory, okay, they have 3 issues or the 3 subjects which they want to cover for the regulatory to understand today the cabinet approved, and they moved it now to Duma for Duma debate. There's a smoking ban for the [indiscernible] sector, the [indiscernible], which I think they target in 2015 as implementation. So it's not 2013 or 2014, it's '15. And the workplaces ban, which is 2013, i.e., next year. Then you have some restrictions on sales in the outlets below the 50 square meters. So that clearly will have some impact on our volume allocations between a trade channel and the experience from other markets is that this -- it makes it a little bit more [indiscernible] for consumers to walk a few extra 100 meters to the next shop but doesn't impact the smoking rate of consumption, as is potentially the smoking ban because if I go to the more mature market where most of the countries in the planet who have in the work who have a smoking ban, you have an impact of a 1% to 2% at the beginning of the implementation, and then the market moderated, sometimes even comes back to the previous level. So I think it is overall pretty manageable situation, but we need to assume that Russia is moving into the total market performance when you're serving a more mature country. So maybe 1%, maybe 2% part of the total industry decline.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, Jacek, could you help me understand the magnitude of the negative effect you had in the Asian division from the year-ago increase in trade inventories?
Jacek Olczak: I think you're referring mostly to Japan.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, in Japan.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. The Japan situation was like this. We had -- what we announced at the end of the year, we had a hurdle or what we call the hurdle in Japan, the 6.3 billion units of the equivalent, what we said, the $0.10 on EPS. And this was related to the hurdle which we had in the second quarter, mainly in the second quarter of last year, okay, due to the higher end market sales and the higher market share. What we have been confronted with in the third quarter of last year is that, obviously, following the high sales in the second quarter, we ended up with extremely low inventories of trade level. And we have to replenish this inventory to the safety level, and that's essentially when the distortions come through. And if you would do the quantification of this thing, I think that the adjustment would be the range of, say, about the 1 trillion units, okay, of Philip Morris. So you're talking about the distortions which we have to pay, i.e., we have to replenish inventories to the safety level.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, Jacek, in the EU, I mean, you obviously have -- had run that division. What's the midterm outlook for Philip Morris in the EU? Do you think it's reasonable that for the foreseeable future, that you can maintain local currency operating income? Do you think that, that's an ambitious objective? Or do you think despite the economic situation of the unemployment levels and so forth, you can continue to eke out a little bit of growth over time?
Jacek Olczak: Okay, listen, we managed to maintain, if not actually we expect that we even can slightly grow the profitability on a net currency basis this year. So yes, it is ambitious. Obviously, there was a huge effort. You see how what we believe was Marlboro and how it nicely [indiscernible] OTP segment. So obviously, we're trying to manage and mitigate the impact of the crisis. Now until you see the improvement on unemployment side very much in the south of Europe because this right here is performance of the entire EU, and I hardly can see how the situations can improve. But we are currently in a crisis, I'm talking Philip Morris, and we'll manage the situations pretty well. So unless there are any shocking type of excise increases, which we don't see today at all, I think the situation is very challenging and we all know it, but I think it's manageable.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Two other quick things, Jacek. The resignation of the EU health minister, do you think that's going to have any effect on the outcome or the timing of the pending update of the tobacco products directive?
Jacek Olczak: Listen, already, EU should be today after the interservice consultation, okay? There was some delays before the departure of Mr. Dalli. I mean, we have learned about this new development, the sudden departure. Listen, we just hope that EU Commission will have a transparent evidence-based process while reviewing this directive, but at this stage, we do not know how the departure of Mr. Dalli will impact the timing of the strategic review. This is a development of the last couple of days.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, Jacek, on working capital, is the build -- or the use of cash flow for inventories and so forth this year, is that a one-off phenomenon? Is that going to be a negligible number next year? Or will there be a working capital build next year in all likelihood as well, but it will be considerably less than this year? Or do you envision a similar level of incremental use of cash for working capital next year?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. There are 3 elements which are the 3 key drivers behind the working capital development this year. One is the [indiscernible] inventory, right, and that is a variable which depends on the timing and the level of the tax price changes. So that will remain but I can't give you the marketing figures because this we don't know, frankly speaking. The 2 others is the inventory of leaf, level of inventory of leaf and inventory of clove. And here, the situation is a little bit different because we had a very high level of sales also driven by Japan last year, and now the inventory has to be adjusted, okay, because we finished the inventories in 2011 at a little bit lower level because we used that leaf in our cigarettes which we sold last year. We continue with the high volume this year, and you see that we're shooting still at a 1% organic volume growth target. So we'll continue [indiscernible] inventory, which is a good thing because I'm using this to support myself. Clove is a little bit different thing because there is a cyclical clove, and this year, I have a very high clove at a much more attractive prices than the previous year. So I have no choice, actually, we're going to be doing what everyone should do, we have to buy clove once it is in the big supply, at the right prices, okay? So clove presumably may ease a little bit next year, but the rest, we'll have to see.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: If I could follow up on the question on the European Union Tobacco Products Directive. Is there any clearer sense, I understand the timing issue, but in terms of what we should be expecting as major initiatives embedded within that? And then secondly, on the Philippines, I noted the market share losses and the citation that, that was driven by Champion and Hope. I wonder if you could talk about what happened there, and then secondarily, the prospects for the tax law change given the changes in the Senate and the various options going on there.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. Erik, on the TPD, as I answered the previous question, I mean, it's hard to say today what the outcome in terms of the timing is going to be. We have not much of a visibility, what is in a draft directive. As I said, the interservice consultation should have already been at the end, and it has not started yet. So clearly, the idea of the proposal attracts the local attentions, and therefore, the draft proposal is not issued yet. So we have to just be patient and wait for this one. Moving to Philippines, yes, we had to think about the 2 points of the market share loss in the quarter in Philippines that's driven by the low price or bottom of the market. We had some pressure from, I think, one of the competitors. You know that there are some distortions due to the fact that some competitors are touching the prices, which is difficult to reconcile if somebody would pay the full excise. But I think there was a bit of a tax loophole or that sort of a nature problem. We have adjusted in some regions, I think, the price of Champion. So we're defending our position. But other than that, we're doing okay. I mean, Marlboro was up, Fortune was up. So I think that's the only problem which we have. With regards to the tax, I think the Senate just now or next week goes into recess. I don't think the Senate has yet issued or concluded with their bill, depends on how much the Senate will be different to the House of Representatives bill. They will have a bicameral conference committee when they will reconcile the differences. I think we'll wait until the end of November to have a tax visibility for Philippines.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then with respect to the Swedish match JV, I understand that the JV is now in Israel. Could you comment on what that market offers in terms of additional understanding of consumers and what the prospects are also in St. Petersburg?
Jacek Olczak: Okay. So we have, I think, a further market with the joint venture where we're testing the product. We're trying to understand what is the right way of marketing that product to drive down to consumers. The whole behavioral part of this, et cetera. I think it's a mid-, long-term project. So I wouldn't go into the specifics of each individual product. It's a step-by-step learning culture from all this category.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fell of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I'm just wondering if you could delve a little bit more into Italy. I'm sorry, the line wasn't that good. But first of all, did you say that illicit trade had picked up from about 6.5% to 9%? Was that the correct figure?
Jacek Olczak: Was that correct figure.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So we've got a 2% or 3% legal market decline stemming from that. What sort of shift out of factory-made cigarettes, would that fine cut growth have caused?
Jacek Olczak: Well, the fine cut growth, we said, by about 40% -- about the 40%. I think about half of the volume decline in Italy would be due to the price elasticity, and the half would be somehow almost equally distributed between the fine cut and illicit trade. We will have to zoom in into the geography in Italy because there was a lot of growth on the contraband in the south of Italy. The accounts now which last year had a contraband below 10%, and this year, they have 50%. I mean, obviously, I can throw you the names of Naples and Palermo. That is what is happening there. And also -- yes, but that's about, I think would be 1/3 of the first distribution of the losses, if you like, in income. About half is what we developed specifically, and the remaining cause in equal parts would be about illicit trade and the fine cut.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And can you just give us a rough idea of what the annual increase in prices has been in Italy third quarter versus third quarter last year?
Jacek Olczak: I would have to go -- okay, this year, I think we had March EUR 0.10, EUR 0.10 per pack, and this last year, you had September EUR 0.20 and July EUR 0.10. So I think year-on-year basis [indiscernible] to finish at the end of this quarter, you had a 4% price increase on a year-to-date basis.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And what's a pack of Marlboro now in Italy? About EUR 6?
Jacek Olczak: Yes.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. Okay. I can work that out later on.
Jacek Olczak: EUR 5.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: EUR 5. Okay. And then -- I mean, in terms of the rough breakdown of those effects illicit in OTP, are we talking something pretty similar in Spain, basically?
Jacek Olczak: Yes. It's a different stage of the market because Spain is longer in the crisis, but again, you have a growth over illicit trade, I think, comparable development and the growth of the fine cut.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Jacek, can you elaborate a little bit on your views about slowdown of economies in Asia, in particular, and what impact that could have on market volume growth on up-trading versus down-trading on your ability to take pricing?
Jacek Olczak: Yes, okay. I mean, I think the biggest slowdown is what I remediate in China. So for the time being, that impacts us directly. But you take -- and as you look into Indonesia, okay, there's a slowdown. I mean, they still expect the economy to grow 6%, 6.5%, highest, I think, consumer confidence, moderate inflation. So Indonesia, which is a big market for us, I don't think we have any sort of the headwinds there. Philippines, okay, we have this open tax issue, but other than that, I think the underlying economy is not doing that bad. As I said, I mean, I don't want to downplay what we read, but I think it's much more coming from China. And China, as I said, for the time being, does not have that much of an impact on us.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And you don't see any risk that China could spill over into other Asian emerging markets as well?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I'm -- I see the forecast today. As I said, the big large market for us, Philippines, Indonesia. Okay, Japan is a different story. But even in Japan this year, following the distortions, et cetera, we estimate about a [indiscernible] market. I think we should do okay. In Indonesia, we think the market is going to grow in the range 6% to 7%. I think earlier this year, we talked about the 8%. Actually, if I look at the composition of the mix in the market, because there is a lot of up-trading, I think the value of the market grows better with a 6% to 7% volume and growth assumption that was 8%, which we had previous. So not today. I mean, today, I don't think...
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in Japan, it seems like Japan Tobacco has been, for lack of a better word, out-innovating you for 2 or 3 quarters now. Do you expect JT -- at what point do you expect JT to slow down their innovations? Or at what point would you have to step up your innovations for the market?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I don't think -- I wouldn't say that they're over-innovative. I mean, I think there is not that they have an innovation in terms of the benefit of offer to their smoker which is better than ours. I wouldn't say it like this. It is just the number of the launches which they did in the last 3 quarters, not on the quality, more on the quantity. I think -- listen, I'm not in the shoes of JT. I can't comment on this, and they will stop launching more products.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: But right now, you don't see any need for you to change your innovation approach in Japan?
Jacek Olczak: No. I mean, we still have -- we've just launched this week, I believe, Virginia Slims, so we know we're moving through other brands where we have a pipeline. A pipeline of initiatives is also preferred. But I think each of these initiatives has to be launched properly into the market, and we need the time to work it with the consumer. [indiscernible] crucial period of time, in the long run, it is not Philip Morris [indiscernible].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just had a couple of questions for you, if I could, and they're mostly just follow-ups. I want to ask you a quick follow-up on Japan which is, what's the underlying decline rate you expect for that market this year? If you said that, I missed that. I'm sorry.
Jacek Olczak: No, for this year, I think we estimate the market to be flat versus last year. So I think with our estimate, the market should close at about 195 billion, 196 billion units.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So therefore, the decline this quarter was not unique or different from what you expected.
Jacek Olczak: No, because you had, as I said, I think there was this replenishment of inventories, which I quantified for us to be about 1 billion, and I think on the total market, the estimate would be in the range of 3 billion, the third quarter last year. So I think if you factor this in, you will come to the -- more of the normal situation.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I want to ask about Russia. There was a comment about some inventory movements this quarter. And then -- so just -- is there a way to quantify how much maybe that helped your shipments in the quarter? And then related to that, I know you've had a better share there. It's coming from brands other than Marlboro. And I know you have some new products behind Marlboro. So just curious if you could comment on that and just kind of the state of Marlboro in Russia.
Jacek Olczak: Okay. I think the impact on the shipment was, I said, coming from inventories, but we also have a very strong share growth in Russia, okay? And this is behind all brands, not at this stage by Marlboro. Now Marlboro, we have launched ClearTaste, I mean, the extensions of Marlboro family into the ClearTaste. But I think on Marlboro, maybe I should put it like this. Marlboro is, for us, a midterm journey. We have 3 issues which we have to continue addressing with regards to the Marlboro underperformance versus our standards in Russia, one is the premiumness of Marlboro, which we're trying to correct with pricing Marlboro higher than it used to be. So the last 2 price increases, Marlboro actually took a bit more of the price increase that was the increase in the market. Second thing is Marlboro has an issue of harsh perception, and this is what we're addressing as we speak with the launch of the Marlboro ClearTaste. And the third one is the more modernity side of Marlboro, and we continue this with our marketing programs in place. I think we're making good progress, but in order to claim that we have a sustainable growth of Marlboro in Russia, I think we need to be a little bit patient. And we are patient.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I have one final question for you, and that's just, in relation to the EU region, it's going to be your third year of roughly 5% to 6% declines in volume. And I guess it's difficult to predict the state of Southern Europe and some of those countries. Looking ahead, whether it be 1 year -- or 1 to 3 years, is the -- obviously, the risk in those markets where you've had this increase in illicit trade, such that you could continue to see those kind of declines in the EU region overall. I guess my question is just related to the illicit trade, if that's becoming a -- obviously, a larger and larger issue in some of these markets.
Jacek Olczak: Well, listen, I mean, every single government is getting focused or has the right focus now on the illicit trade. These guys were living with the consequences of, in some countries, high tax increases in the past and also the sudden erosion of the consumer purchasing power because all these austerity measures dented what the consumer has in their pocket. I think I said in the remarks, if I look in Germany, when we see the market's doing very well, I mean, quarter 3 was pretty strong and we're still looking for the full good year of total industry volumes in Germany, I think that's partially because the illicit trade comes back at least to some extent to the legal market. So I think what we confronted today in the south of Europe, one day, this volume, at least to some extent, will come back to the fast-paced volumes, to the industry volume. But as I said, I mean, unless you see the improvement on the unemployment side, I don't think we should be betting on any sudden improvement in Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori of Crédit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could you just let us know if there was any news in Turkey with regards to the excise tax reform?
Jacek Olczak: No. Well, the only news which we had is that, I think, the government has already increased taxes on alcohol, cigarette and some other categories. So frankly speaking, I would expect announcement of a tax increase or tax change in Turkey somewhere before the year end or at the very beginning of the next year. You know that the government have received the authorization from the Parliament to amend this specific component. This will be first time historically when Turkey would have a statutory component, but we need still see the announcement of the government.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And the one question about France. Could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the outlook? I appreciate that Marlboro has been obviously impacted by crossing the EUR 6 per pack price, but any thoughts on the market would be appreciated.
Jacek Olczak: Well, the market, I think, for the quarter was down about -- a little bit less than 5%, 4.5% [indiscernible] 6%. Year-to-date, I think the market is about 4.2% down. We now have the price increase of the EUR 0.40 for Marlboro went from a EUR 6.20 to EUR 6.60. But the low-priced cigarettes went from the EUR 5.70 to EUR 6. But somehow this psychological price point barrier is removed, but other prices are higher in the market. So I think Marlboro had more of the pressure being round about the EUR 6. This is somehow removed. But the whole prices are higher in the market, so we see how we deal with those. I feel about some austerity measures in France taking place and so on. So I think we need to see how that market realizes and what impact it will have.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's good. And just one final question about Ukraine. I understand there was some trade inventory movements in the quarter, but I was just wondering if trading conditions in Ukraine sequentially have changed relative to the first half.
Jacek Olczak: I think there were some distortions due to the Q3 2011 in Ukraine. So the market was looking, I think, 10% lower in Q3 this year, but I think it was very much driven by some distortions in the Q3 2011. I think on a year-to-date basis, presumably, I did a better number for Ukraine, 3.5%. And I think we estimate that the full year will be in a range of about 3%, full year total industry volumes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to circle back to the Philippines. While I recognize it's still early in terms of the legislation that's coming out of the Senate and the House in terms of the excise taxes, I was curious if you could at least comment on the price elasticities in that market and how they compare to other emerging markets.
Unknown Executive: Price elasticity.
Jacek Olczak: Well, the market, total market, I mean, this year, I think we estimate the full year total market will actually cost 100 billion units. I think we estimate like 101 billion units. So this would represent fairly close to the 3% growth of the market. I mean, there is a price increase we took in the market. Today, I mean, the elasticities will be in a range which you've seen are replacements. If you ask me the question, how we see that same towards the tax implementation, then I need to know what is the tax which final will be implemented there. So there's a little bit of a speculation at this stage. So I don't know if we're answering the question. This year, I think the market will grow in the range of up to 3%. This is our estimate.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of the EU, given the outsized growth that you saw in other tobacco products, while those are definitely lower margin, I was curious, at least directionally, what your organic profit growth would have looked like on just a cigarette basis.
Jacek Olczak: Because we're entering the fine cut, because consumers have preferences for usage of cigarette brand. I mean, there has been [indiscernible] very rapid share advancements in this category. The fine cut has a lower unit profitability than a cigarette, but it is also a [indiscernible] tax structure. The government -- some government are looking into restructuring of the tax and the fine cut, et cetera. So, I mean, it's an important element. It's becoming an important element not in terms of our profitability but overall [indiscernible] service which we're delivering to the customers. This is how we look at that thing. Part of this volume, I also think, will one day come back to the manufacture of cigarettes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess can you talk a little bit about EEMA pricing? Obviously, pricing was good, but margins really took a jump. I understand you took the price increase in Russia, but is there anything else in there that would have driven pricing and margin up that significantly? And can, I guess -- could you talk a little bit about the sustainability of these margins? Because I think they're the highest on a quarterly basis anyway we've seen in a while.
Jacek Olczak: I think we've had some pricing in Ukraine as well. So it's not just the Russia, which drives the -- Turkey, so it's not just Russia and EEMA which drives the price. And sustainability of the [indiscernible], yes, I think, as in general, we say that the pricing environment is manageable, favorable and we have seen how much we had a pricing variance year-to-date on a global basis, and I think that thing's going to continue.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And I guess one quick thing on the EU, right? I mean, I think you've been clear that without unemployment getting fixed, that market continues to decline. And I guess can you just talk about the ability to continue time-after-time to generate that 1% volume growth for the total company with an EU drag of 6%? I mean, can you just put a little color around your ability to keep doing that?
Jacek Olczak: Well, I think that this year's going to be the perfect testimony that this is achievable because we have a year when we predict the total industry volumes to go down by 6%. And despite even the difficult comps in Asia, we say that the PMI can deliver 1% organic volume growth target. I think the engine in EEMA and Asia are working at the full throttle. They can cover up for the challenging environment which we unfortunately have in Europe. I feel pretty okay about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Avery of CLSA.
Michael Avery: I just wanted to touch on illicit trade. I know you've outlined the size of that opportunity in a lot of markets, but it seems like it rarely goes down. It did in Turkey this quarter. What were some of the drivers there? Is there any color you can give on what would have helped that?
Jacek Olczak: Well, as far as the government focus, and it's not just the Ministry of Finance, the Customs authorities, but there's, as I understand, a number of ministries and the state agencies which finally sat together and decided to do something about it. And to their credit, they did a phenomenal job. I think the situations or the tensions in the Turkey/Syria border also helping a little bit, okay? There was obviously more intensity of the border controls, et cetera, so that's other key driver. I think the government which seems to be committed to address the issue of the contraband on the Syria border.
Michael Avery: Okay. And then back to Russia, I know we've covered a lot of stuff here. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you were saying. If the tax increase is approved by the Duma as it stands now and as it's written, are you saying that, that would be manageable? Or would you characterize that as a disruptive tax increase? Or just at least looking from this year to next, what's the magnitude of that, in your opinion?
Jacek Olczak: Well, the magnitude of this thing in terms if it stays as it's proposed by the government now, then next year, this will translate into the platform [indiscernible] platform of, I think, RUB 6. And thereafter about RUB 9. If you take the pricing in Russia, and you take the inflation, it is an increase, it is not a minor increase. As I said, I think, a substantial but manageable. But this is not a [indiscernible] increase.
Michael Avery: And so the positive is obviously that it's laid out over a multi-year progression and you'd have the predictability. But how big of a risk do you see for next year if that goes through as proposed now?
Jacek Olczak: Well, this is a second year in a row when we have a 3-year tax visibility. So I think we did more government, not only Russia, going for that sort of an approach. I have Germany, I have other places where they want to see their 3, 4, 5 years tax outlook set that way, and that clearly demonstrates the results are a benefit for the government.
Michael Avery: Okay. And then one last question, a little different. I know at the Analyst Day, you laid out a lot of great stuff about the next-generation products, but clearly, it takes a little bit of time to commercialize those and get the approvals that you're looking for. Given the success of e-cigarettes in the U.S., would you consider doing -- putting those in the market anywhere? I know you were clear about how the nicotine delivery is nowhere near as comparable. But to the extent that there seems to be a consumer acceptance at least in the market here, would that change how you think about doing that as maybe sort of an interim step?
Jacek Olczak: No. Listen, our strategy is very clear on this one. We want to commercialize this product, but with a claim. So I need the regulatory approval to allow me to say what the product which we have, one of the 3 platforms which we're working on, can provide in terms of a benefit to a consumer. So we don't want to make a shortcut on this one. I launched the product which we have but without that being able to make the claim. I think that's very important.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to ask you about pricing which year-to-date has been a strong contributor to results. And how should we think about the pricing lever for fiscal '13?
Jacek Olczak: One I am afraid I can't share it with you. But, historically, if you look at since the spin -- since the spinoff, I mean, our pricing variance was in the range of $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion, and I think we don't see that much of a headwind. So pricing stays in target, and it will remain very important component of our growth model.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Perfect. And then if we think about marketing spending and brand support, are there any changes in that strategy either by market or by brand as you look out the next couple of months? Anything you can comment on?
Jacek Olczak: No. We continue spending. Listen, we have a great growth volume and a share momentum last year, this year and also behind the Marlboro and of our premium Parliament, and I think it's very wise to continue that spending. So we're going to continue, even in tough environment like EU or other places.
Operator: I would now like to return the call to management for any closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR team, Investor Relations team, here in Lausanne. Thank you again, and have a nice day.
Operator: That does conclude the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to the [ph] volume excluding acquisitions, and net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We again achieved strong underlying business results in the second quarter, with actual results impacted by both unfavorable currency movements and the hurdle we faced in Japan due to our extraordinarily results there during the second quarter last year. Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was down 1.2% to 238.3 billion units. However, excluding the Japan hurdle of 6.3 billion units, organic cigarette volume was up 1.4%. In addition, our organic volume of other tobacco products increased by 11.8% in the quarter. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Without the Japan hurdle, our growth rates would have been in line with our annual mid- to long-term currency-neutral targets of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.36 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of last year and were up by 9%, excluding the currency. If one also takes into consideration the previously disclosed Japan hurdle of $0.10 at an EPS level, then adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, was up by a very strong 17.7% in the second quarter. Our results for the first half of the year were excellent. Organic cigarette volume was up 1.8%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 6.5% and 8.3%, respectively. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 13.3%, excluding currency. These results confirm our expectation of solid organic cigarette volume growth in 2012. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and leadership in both emerging and developed markets. Our volume is growing strongly in many markets in both the Asia and EEMA regions, offsetting weaker volume trends in the EU region due to the deterioration of the economic situation and weaker consumer confidence. Consequently, we expect to continue to grow currency-neutral profitability at a rapid pace, with sustained strong pricing and a favorable product mix only partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix. Exchange rates, however, continue to be volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, the forecast currency headwind this year is slightly higher than the $0.25 per share that we predicted in June. However, our underlying business is very strong, and this is expected to offset the additional unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 per share. We are therefore today reaffirming our reported diluted 2012 EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20 compared to $4.85 in 2011. On a currency-neutral basis, our guidance implies a forecast growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this despite the Japan hurdle and weak industry volume in Europe. Let me remind you that our mid- to long-term currency-neutral annual growth target for adjusted diluted EPS is also 10% to 12%. As we indicated during our Investor Day last month, cigarette industry volumes in the EU region were unusually depressed in the second quarter. The overall decline was 9.7%, with significant reductions not only in markets such as Greece and Spain, but also in Italy and Poland, with even Germany suffering a 5.1% drop. The decline was driven by a reduction in daily consumption, while smoking incidence has remained relatively stable. For the first half of the year, cigarette industry volume in the EU region was down 5.8%. This confirms that the second quarter decline was unusually severe as adult smokers adjusted to the renewed recessionary environment and there were some unfavorable timing issues. Our current expectations for the second half of the year is that the decline rate for cigarette industry volume in the EU region should be similar to that experienced during the first half of the year. The average unemployment rate across the European Union increased by 0.7 points between June 2011 and May 2012, with significantly more pronounced increases in Greece, Spain and Italy. Only Germany showed a meaningful [indiscernible] . As a result of the deteriorating job markets, the average unemployment level in the EU stood at 10.3% in May, with Spain and Greece double this level. France and Italy are just below the EU average, while Germany and the Netherlands continue to have relatively low levels of unemployment. We have always highlighted unemployment levels and trends as key indicators for industry volume. We therefore do not expect a return to the normal underlying decline rate of 2% to 3% in the EU region until the issue is addressed in a meaningful way. We have achieved a resilient market share performance in the second quarter, with 38.5% overall in the EU region, 0.2 points below the previous year's level. On a half year basis, our share of 37.9% was down 0.4 points. We are very encouraged by the performance of Marlboro in this difficult economic environment. In the second quarter, Marlboro's share in the region grew by 0.3 points to 18.4%, and it was up slightly on a 6-month basis. Marlboro gained share in the quarter notably in Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Poland. L&M continued to grow share in such markets as Finland, Germany, Poland and Slovakia, but this was not enough to offset declines in the quarter in Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Chesterfield is performing very well and is being successfully established as a strong second leg for us in the low-price segment in the EU region. We are rapidly gaining share in the growing fine cut category. Industry volumes increased by nearly 8% in both the second quarter and the first half as adult smokers down-traded to less expensive options. Our share of the fine cut category rose by 1.4 points in the quarter and by 1.7 points in the first half to 14.1% and 14%, respectively. The market situation in Italy deserves specific attention. Cigarette industry volume in Italy declined by 10.5% in the second quarter and by 8.5% in the first half of 2012. The most important single factor has been a reduction in consumer purchasing power, aggravated by the payment of increased property taxes in June and the increase in cigarette prices over the last 12 months. This unfavorable development in the cigarette industry is not a unique phenomenon as a wide range of consumer products have been affected by the economic slowdown. Impacting specifically the cigarette industry, there has also been down-trading to the fine cut category and an increase in illicit trade, particularly the so-called illicit whites, with brands such as Jin Ling and Classic. Despite recent price increases, the fine cut category grew by 74.6% in the quarter, though it still represents a relatively modest 6.5% of total tobacco industry volume. In terms of market share, Marlboro is performing strongly. It gained 0.3 points to reach a 23% share in the quarter, despite the continued pressure on the Premium segment. However, our overall cigarette market share declined in both the quarter and the first half, as the strong performance of Marlboro and the launch of Philip Morris Selection in the low-price segment were unable to offset the decline of our local heritage brand Diana. In contrast, our share in fine cut grew by 24.5 points in the quarter to a record level of 31%, firmly establishing us as the category leader in Italy. In Germany, cigarette industry volume declined in the quarter by 5.1%. This was attributable to the impact of the recent price increases, a decline in consumer confidence in spite of low unemployment rates, a difficult comparison with the second quarter last year that was up 4.6% and some timing issues. We believe that the first half year decline of 1.3% is a better reflection of the underlying trend. PMI continued to strong perform strongly with further share gains in the second quarter. Our share in cigarettes was up 0.3 points to 36.4%, and our share in fine cut grew by 1.2 points to 16%. We are very pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which gained 0.3 points in the cigarette category and 1.2 points in the fine cut category, while L&M continued to grow share in the cigarette category and Chesterfield gained in both the cigarette and in the fine cut categories. As a consequence of the industry volume declines, our second quarter results were soft in the EU region. Cigarette volume was down 9.4%, only partially offset by a strong 18.2% growth in OTP volumes. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were down 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively. We were largely able to offset the lower volumes with higher prices. Excluding currency and acquisitions, June year-to-date net revenues increased by 2%, and adjusted OCI was just above the prior-year level on the same basis. In contrast, we had another very strong quarter in the EEMA region, and our results year-to-date June were equally excellent. In the quarter, organic volume grew by 4.9%, while net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 12.7% and 22.9%, respectively. While pricing at $114 million continued to be a significant contributor to the growth in EEMA's OCI, it was almost matched in the quarter by our $104 million volume/mix variance. This is in fact the fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume/mix in the region. This was driven by the strength of our brand portfolio, with a particularly encouraging performance of our premium brands, with volume up 7.4% in the second quarter. Overall, 9 of our top 10 brands in that EEMA region grew volume in the quarter, with just Chesterfield down. Marlboro had a strong quarter, with a volume gain of over 1 billion units or 5%, driven mainly by North Africa, Saudi Arabia and Serbia. The performance of Parliament was truly outstanding, with volume up 1.1 billion units or 16.3%, driven mainly by Eastern Europe and Turkey. On a market basis, our strong results were led by Russia, so let me provide you with further details on this important market. Though we do not have definitive data yet, we believe that the Russian cigarette market grew slightly during the first half of the year. We attribute this to an improvement in the economy and a return of foreign workers as the construction industry has started to pick up again. As a result of recent price increases in cigarettes, foreseen hikes in utility prices and the slightly slower expected economic growth in the second half of the year, we forecast that full-year industry cigarette volume should reach a level similar to last year's. We are outpacing industry volume. During the second quarter, our volume increased at a much faster rate of 8.7% and was 5% higher in the first half. Two very important positive aspects of the Russian market were uptrading by adult smokers in spite of significant price increases and our ability to gain market share, thanks to the strength and breadth of our brand portfolio. For the quarter through the end of May, our market share was 0.7 points higher at 26.1%, thanks to the strong performance of Parliament, L&M, Bond Street and Next. We took a further price increase of RUB 3 per pack across our portfolio in July. We launched Marlboro ClearTaste in Russia in June. This is a much smoother-tasting line of products, which addresses adult smoker product preference. We started the launch in key cities and have already achieved outstanding distribution at point of sale. Initial consumer feedback and trial data are positive. It will of course take several months before we can draw any firm conclusions. Our performance in the Asia region was again very strong in the second quarter. This was however masked by the aforementioned hurdle in Japan. Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was up 7.4%, excluding the Japan hurdle, driven primarily by Indonesia, though down 0.7% on a reported basis. Likewise, excluding the Japan hurdle, adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, would have shown a strong increase, but it was down 2.6% including the full comparison for Japan. Industry volume in Japan increased by nearly 10% in the second quarter compared to the distorted period last year. For 2012, we are now forecasting a stable total market, though the underlying trend remains a moderate decline of 1% to 2% a year going forward. During the first half of this year, Japan Tobacco accelerated its program of new launches, and this has had some impact on our market share, which reached 27.8% in the second quarter. This was 0.2 points lower than the previous quarter but still substantially above the pre-earthquake share levels. Lark Hybrid 100s maintained an 0.4% market share, and we launched Marlboro Black Menthol Edge 8 and Marlboro Menthol Edge 1 during the second quarter. Our latest launch this month is Marlboro Ice Blast in 5-milligram and 1-milligram variants, 8-milligram variant having achieved a 1.3% market share during the second quarter. With these efforts and additional new launches in the pipeline, we are confident that we should be able to stabilize our market position going forward. On the fiscal front, the Japanese government obtained Parliamentary approval for a two-step increase in consumption tax from 5% today to 8% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. While prices remain government-controlled, the last tax increases resulted in margin-enhancing price increases. Volumes continued to grow in the second quarter in Indonesia, albeit as expected at a slower rate than in the first quarter. Industry volume grew by 6.9% in the second quarter, while PMI volume increased by 17.8%. Supported by a strong economy, adult smokers have been uptrading to the Premium segment, which has grown by 2 points in the first 6 months this year. PMI has the strongest and broadest portfolio in the Indonesian market, along with an unmatched national distribution network and highly qualified and motivated employees. Our market share grew by 3.1 points in the quarter to 33.5% as Sampoerna A remained the fastest-growing brand in terms of share gains, with an increase of 1.2 points to 13.1%, and we continued to benefit from rounded price points. Going forward, we forecast a market growth of around 8% for the full year and look for further PMI share growth, though at a slower pace than in the first half of this year. Pricing continues to be the most important single driver of PMI's profitability. The pricing variance was $463 million in the quarter, giving a half year pricing variance of $832 million. This year, we have increased prices notably in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Ukraine. Our volume/mix variance was obviously negative in the quarter due to the Japan hurdle. However, as you can see on the chart, excluding the hurdle, 8 of our top 10 brands grew volume in the first half of the year and the other 2 were essentially stable. In volume terms, Marlboro achieved the largest growth, while in percentage terms, Fortune, Sampoerna A, Parliament and Lark all recorded double-digit growth. We are continuing to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our June 3-month moving average share of 36.9% is above both our 12-month moving share and the 2011 results and 1.4 share points above the 2010 share level. Free cash flow declined in the second quarter by $703 million to $3.2 billion. Unfavorable currency movements were responsible for over half this decrease. In addition, we built up finished goods stock in Brazil and Russia, and working capital consequently increased by $388 million. This will be reversed during the third quarter when this inventory is sold. During the second quarter, we spent a further $1.5 billion to repurchase 17.8 million shares. In June, the board approved a new 3-year $18 billion share repurchase program, which will start in August when funds from the previous program will have been fully utilized ahead of schedule. Our target remains to spend $6 billion on share repurchases this year. Since the spin [ph] through the end of June this year, we spent $24.4 billion to repurchase 449.9 million shares, representing 21.3% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin [ph] at an average price of $54.21. In conclusion, the second quarter of 2012 was, as expected, a very strong one in terms of underlying business momentum, but a challenging one in terms of reported results due to the Japan hurdle and unfavorable currency movements. As we foresaw during our June Investor Day, EEMA and Asia region results were very strong in the second quarter, enabling us to offset unusually weak cigarette industry volume in the EU region. The breadth of our geographic footprint, the continued strong pricing environment based on our superior brand portfolio and productivity gains enabled us to grow both net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted diluted EPS, ex currency, increased by 9% in the second quarter. If the $0.10 hurdle related to Japan were excluded, the increase in adjusted diluted EPS, ex currency, was a very substantial 17.7%, confirming the overall strength of our business. We have reaffirmed today our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20. Compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency. Thank you. I'll be happy to answer your questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Two things I wanted to ask you. First, in the EU, do you think that you can maintain on a local currency basis the overall profitability of the business for the foreseeable future if volume declines persist at these above trend rates, maybe not the rate in the second quarter but at higher than historical rates of decline?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I'd say for this year -- I mean, for the second half we expect a similar decline, but at the same time, we continue to be cautiously optimistic to achieve low single-digit OCI growth, excluding currency, nevertheless. In the EU region, in years before where we had similar decline rates, we had similar results. Yes, we see continued market declines there, but there are also, talking for this year, also several positives in there. In Italy, there was still the potential VAT increase looming in September that has been called off, postponed to next year but who knows what happens until September of 2013. But it's not going to happen this year. In Spain, the VAT increase of 3% on all goods is being compensated for cigarettes by ad valorem decrease. That's good news, too, of course. And in France, some sort of price increase is going to come in the remainder of the year, and despite this economic trouble in the entire region, the Marlboro share is actually up. So overall, yes, I think we can do that, we can still achieve low single-digit OCI growth also in the EU region.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then second question, Hermann. Can you just update us all on the status of the potential excise tax increase in the Philippines and the potential for fairly substantial duty increase potentially in the GCC countries?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. Philippines first. The situation there is that the House of Representatives has passed a bill with pretty substantial disruptive excise increases for 2013. Thereafter, even in that bill, the positive is that it takes a multiyear approach, but that is for now the House of Representatives. The legislative processes is by far not being closed. After the summer recess, first the Senate is expected to weigh in on the question. Then should there be disagreement between Senate and House of Representatives, then it goes into the so-called bicameral committee. So what I'm telling you here is there is more discussions to come in the third and in the fourth quarter. Then on GCC, while there is a discussion going on, that discussion we have had many years also -- for many years also in the past, it's still an open question. I really don't have an update to that one. We'll see in the remainder of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the Philippines. Thanks for the update on the tax situation, which is helpful, but could you provide just a little more color on the current market dynamics just in terms of the market declining there, what's going on and how you expect this to evolve as the year unfolds and into next year?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, okay. First of all, I mean, let me start then with the economy. I see that the economic outlook in the Philippines, which is actually brilliant, I mean, the GDP, the last number I saw, I believe that was the quarter 1 number, up 6.4%, with an inflation, I think it has been May, a little less than 3%. Remittances of Filipinos working abroad, up substantially in 1 month. That's about an amount of $1.7 billion coming to the country. Therefore, I mean, in terms of consumer environment, that's actually pretty good. That translates now in the total market that for the full year, we would expect a slight growth. So I would say the full year market, about 100 billion cigarettes. Last year was 97.5 billion roughly. So a slight increase therefore in the total market despite the price increases that was there. In terms of shares, yes, share, we lost a bit of share, and we lost that share essentially to some local company there, which, let me put it this way, sells at surprisingly low prices.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Hermann, just a second question on your Be Marlboro campaign. Could you give us just further details on the rollout and then maybe a little more color on just some key markets where this campaign has been having a positive impact on Marlboro?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, first of all, it is, of course where it started it's in the German market, where it has been doing tremendously well, continues to do tremendously well. I mean, it is -- as you know, it is the continuation at the end of the day and the translation into modern values of what was the Marlboro campaign, the cowboy campaign stood for. So it's receiving excellent feedback, continues to receive excellent consumer feedback in the German market. In adaptations, you will find it in more and more markets around the world. It's not always going to be exactly the same what you see in Germany, but it's the same idea, the same philosophy behind. And we will roll it out from there. It has started in some Latin American markets, and it will go further. It is the new worldwide campaign.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First, in Japan, so the consumption tax proposals that you've talked about in Japan, other than the consumption tax increases, are there any discussions of national or regional tax increases that are being discussed at this point?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well not regional, what will come later in the year is, of course, a discussion on the excise tax outlook. Typically, as the budgetary year of the government goes from 1st of April to the end of March, there, as you, of course, [indiscernible] These discussions will start in December, with a decision kind of by year-end. At this point in time, I really couldn't predict the outcome there, but it is obvious and clear that we will be advocating for a multiyear excise tax plan, which would be beneficial for both the government in their quest to maximize revenues and could also be profitable for us at the same time.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Is there anything to glean from the fact that they did approve the other consumption tax increase?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes, I would say it is a positive there, it is a first step to developing an entire refinancing plan, if you like, for all the funds needed to cope with the cost of the natural disaster of last year. So in that context, the discussions take place. Consumption tax was, of course, the key element in there. Excise tax, I believe, is going to be a normal discussion. It will not be dominated by that question on the consumption tax. To put that a bit into the context, that's something that is going to be manageable for us. It always depends of course what you assume to be the price level when the consumption tax kicks in at that time, April 2014 and October 2015. But kind of the first increase means a rollover of about JPY 15, and the second one means a rollover of about JPY 10 per pack. That's manageable, of course.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. Okay. And you've talked about the market in Japan, the market consumption decline this year being now more stable. Can you just talk about why at least this year the market seems to be doing better than expected?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, at the first quarter call, I think I still expected 1% to 2% decline there. It's of course -- to be honest, it's a hard market to read with all the distortions from last year into this year. We had a prolonged period where incidence -- smoking incidence had stayed stable. It has come down a little bit the last 2 months but not much. So that's why I think that the underlying, really, is probably a 1% to 2% decline going forward. Now I'm talking next years and thereafter. That's of course [indiscernible] pricing. I'm talking about the underlying trend. But this year, when we take it all together, the obvious estimate is now [ph] that it should be about flat.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of your guidance, so if you look at first half, your adjusted earnings up 13.3%, excluding currency, even with the hurdle that you faced in second quarter from Japan. It sounds like, just based on your guidance, maybe a little bit of a slowdown in the back half. I'm just wondering if there are any other factors that sort of makes you think that the earnings growth could slow down in the back half. Are you thinking just in terms of Europe potentially a bit more conservative stance? I'm just wondering if there's anything to think about in the back half.
Hermann G. Waldemer: No, I mean, there is nothing on the underlying business trends there. It is simply some -- often a question of comparisons. If I take the Japan hurdle out, then organic volume in the first half has been going 3.3%. I mean, I can't expect 3.3% for the full year, I think nobody does, although we are optimistic to achieve our mid- to long-term organic volume growth target of 1% despite the hurdle in Japan. To give you one example of tough comps, if you go to the EEMA region, then the first half volume results compared to declining trends in the first half of 2011, whilst the second half of the year will compare to already an overall growth rate of 2.4% in the second half of 2011 last year in that region. So it's a bit of comps, but underlying our business is in very good shape. And Europe has, of course, been factored in into our full year guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kieley with Deutsche Bank.
Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just going back to Europe and Southern Europe specifically, could you just talk about if the volume trend in those countries has changed much compared to what you indicated at the Investor Day? And what gives you confidence that the volume in Southern Europe will have been most weakest this quarter and then stabilize more in the second half?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. Well, it seems they have not really changed much compared to the Investor Day projections. The quarter has come out slightly worse than what we already had highlighted there. I mean, in terms of market sizes, then the best will be we go to the biggest markets there. Germany, which has been down in the second quarter by 5.2%, is down on a year-to-date basis 1.3%. I would say in Germany, expect about 1.5% for the full year. So the 5% are not representative at all in that sense. Italy is a complicated market these days. I mean, I had it in my prepared remarks, austerity measures and consumer confidence going down, doesn't make it easier. However, I would say for the full market for Italy, I would expect something like 7.5%, maybe 8% decline. The first quarter was down 6%, the second quarter was down 10.5%. 7.5% [ph] to 8% could be a full year number there in Italy. Spain, I think the forecast that we had of something in the range of 10% for the full year outlook is still a reasonable assumption. It is, of course, was very important that the VAT increase has been offset by reduced ad valorem rates. Therefore, in that context, I think the minus 10% for Spain is still a realistic number. If I add in then France, there I would say take out the technical factors and stuff. Something like 3% is probably a realistic assumption for France.
Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then the other question I had is just your commentary in the guidance, the language about the anticipated business improvement in Asia and EEMA regions. Does that mean -- I mean, it sounds like that's mainly -- you're seeing better macro trends in Russia, your growth in Indonesia. Are there any other specific positives that you are calling out in those 2 regions?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, we just raised our prices by RUB 3 in Russia in July. That plays into that one as well. But other than that, yes, I mean, the overall environment is really good. The economic environment is kind of the antipode of what we see in the EU region. And with the right portfolios, the right brands, we are benefiting from those trends in those parts of the world.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Hermann, I want to ask you 2 questions, if I could. The first was a bit of a follow-on to Japan, and it sounds like you're now expecting sort of share stabilization there for the year. And really just more a question about why. Do you have less new productivity or are you seeing a little bit more competitive activity, of course, out of Japan Tobacco? Maybe it's a combination of factors, but I just want to get a little more perspective on your expectation for share in Japan.
Hermann G. Waldemer: We had a very slight loss here. I mean, we came down from 28% to 27.8%. That's a slight loss. We are competitive people. We don't like that. But one also has to acknowledge that competitors are not asleep on the switch either. We have had a very successful launch with Marlboro Black Menthol, as you remember. JT has come out now also with a successful highly mentholated product that they pushed into the market, that has had some share consequence on us, but that's the second quarter. As I said, we are already out there in July. Our sales with new launches with 5-milligram and 1-milligram versions of Marlboro Ice Blast. The 8-milligram version is the one that has 1.3% share, which is after such a not-so-long period in the market a fantastic share. But competition will go on, and we're never afraid of competition. But we take also the other [indiscernible] Serious, that's all there is.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: It sounds like it's not a change though. And so your new product introductions are plans for, say, the second half of the year though. Correct?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No, we have still more in the pipeline for the second half of the year, of course.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I just want to be clear on that. And then I just had a question for you, a follow-up on the EU. Obviously, we had obviously a difficult quarter this quarter, an expectation for that to improve a bit from where we were this quarter. And I want to be clear. In the second quarter, were there any -- was there any negative effect on volumes from inventory distortions or movements that made this quarter look a little worse than what the underlying results would have shown?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I mean, Germany has been comparing to the second quarter in 2011. That was up by 4.6%, and it happens to be that Easter is in the first quarter and in the second quarter from 1 year to the next. That's just very, very technical there. So yes, there were some inventory movements in there. And typically, at quarter ends, you sometimes see intense activity of some competitors with the trades, which we don't do.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori with Crédit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Hermann, you flagged the problem of illicit trade in Italy. Has the problem of illicit trade in Spain got worse in Q2?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Illicit trade in Spain should be about 10%, 12%. I would assume there, so it's increased -- it's on the increase there as well.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. My second question, Hermann, is whether you could give us some color on the phasing of marketing spend this year. Should we expect any change to the usual skew towards second half and Q4 in particular?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No, I wouldn't expect a change in general trends there. It's really -- it's kind of a lot of activities going to the second quarter before the summer break, and then you have -- it's picking up towards year-end. That's a very normal pattern which has not changed over the years. I don't see a change now either.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And my last question is just any early reading on volume trends in Brazil, both the tax-driven price increase and the minimum price.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Sorry, volume trends in Brazil, you said?
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's correct.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Brazil. Okay. Well, in Brazil, you of course have now had -- the pricing is implemented, the tax increase was made first. All the prices are there. We do see an adherence of local manufacturers to the new minimum price of BRL 3 there, but as the minimum price is still relatively low, I think the real effect will only come with the already scheduled and foreseen minimum price increases over the years. We don't see, however, really, an improvement on the illicit product flowing in from Paraguay into Brazil.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Hermann, I would have expected L&M to do a little bit better in the EU, given that there's probably down-trading going on. What am I missing there?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, sometimes you can't have it all. Marlboro is doing better. I think the 2 are a bit linked now. But seriously, that's -- L&M did nothing wrong. The brand is going well. In Germany, the growth has -- it's still growing, but it has slowed down a little bit. But that's fine with me it's recuperated with Marlboro. And then when you go over to Spain, well, in Spain, the declines there in Spain are actually linked to brands that absorb part of the minimum tax today there. I'm talking about brands that fell at less than EUR 3.55. This is today the kick-in with minimum tax. That kick-in actually is going to EUR 3.77 of September 1. So I look forward to that date.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in Japan, at what point do you think the innovation disadvantage that you have relative to JT right now? At what point will that start to fade?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I would say that I just admitted that they have had a real hit with the highly mentholated product that has come out under Mild Seven. We have [indiscernible] had a series of very good ones, too. We will keep on working on our new launches, and being competitive in the market. A onetime hit does not change this plan.
Thilo Wrede - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then last question I have for you. With illicit trade picking up again in Canada, is that a cautionary tale that may be a sustainable fighting of illicit trade is much harder than some short-term successes might imply?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Honestly, to the contrary, although you might further elaborate thereafter, to the contrary, I have big hopes that illicit trade will come further down in Canada because the province of Ontario has declared that they are essentially copying the measures that the province of Québec had implemented, was it now 2 years ago, which have brought quite a bit of volume back into the legal tax-paying market. So as the enforcements in Ontario kicks in and the total illicit trade in Ontario is estimated to be about 4 billion cigarettes, so quite a bit of that could come through and the legal market could benefit from that. So honestly, I would expect the opposite going forward in Canada.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My first question has to do with the launch of the new Marlboro line in Russia. You guys posted volume growth on the Marlboro brand in that market for the first time in a number of quarters, and I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how much of that growth was from the selling of the new products versus any kind of underlying benefit to organic volumes for Marlboro.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. In the second quarter on Marlboro ClearTaste, there is, of course -- and now we talk shipment numbers. We don't talk Nielsen numbers, we talk shipment numbers. It's still, of course, a pipelining effect, bringing the product to the distributor, and from there, into wholesale and retail trade. The volume, total volume increase in the EEMA region in the quarter was 3.8 billion cigarettes. Out of that, roughly 10% has been Marlboro ClearTaste. So yes, it's there. It's some pipelining effect, but it's just 10% of the overall growth.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood. My next question again on EEMA has to do with Turkey. At your Analyst Day, you highlighted some early successes in reductions in the illicit trade, and it sounds like that was, again, a benefit onto the Turkish market in the quarter. Given the acceleration you've seen there -- I think 4.5% roughly year-to-date volume growth for the industry -- do you have a sense of how much volume is coming back into that market?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes, our latest estimate is that illicit trade has come down by about 3 percentage points, national average from 20% actually to 17%. That's our latest estimate, these are of course by definition always estimates. So the 4% growth that you quoted, that's actually a good estimate for the full year. So I would expect the total market to be in the range of 95 billion cigarettes.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Wonderful. And my last question has to do with Spain. And I hate to split hairs here, Hermann, but if I think about your outlook for the full year of 10% in line with year-to-date and I look at the comps that you face, I think it implies some kind of improvement in the back half of the year because 1 half of '11, the market was down 19%, and then you finished the year, down 17%. So is it the VAT change or is there something else that gets you on the margin incrementally more positive that despite a tougher comp, you can maintain the trend?
Hermann G. Waldemer: [indiscernible] There's a multitude of factors at play here. There were the price increases that we have seen, several ones that you remember. There is now -- there hasn't been a price increase now for a while, and the VAT threat has been avoided. Then in terms of comparisons, it was also a question of how much volume is in retail trades. But at the end of the day, that's the best estimate we have coming out of the Spanish market. Can it be 11%? Can it be 12%? It could, but we talk something around 10% for the full year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: I'd like to ask about the plain packaging, and I'm wondering if there's a difference in the WTO challenge, having the Dominican Republic file a complaint. Does this mean that there's more momentum in the formal adjudication panel? And then secondly, is there any read through from that to what may happen in the U.K. with the consultation underway and then perhaps with the results some time toward the end of this year, beginning of next year?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, on plain packaging, you have actually mentioned 2 of the 3 developments in that area. The WTO claim of the DR that has now officially filed a request for consultation with Australia, actually, I believe yesterday or the day before yesterday. That adds another country and it adds more doubt and pressure into the procedure. We continue to be optimistic that more countries will actually follow that example, so that put simply more weight into the WTO claims between those governments. On the U.K., the extension of the consultation period by another month now to mid-August because that was supposed to end mid-July, is simply driven that a lot of people have made submissions and continue to make submissions to the government. I take it as a sign that the government is serious about their evaluation efforts in that process. And if that is all happening on a rational basis -- and I continue to think that this is the case, then I would also expect that the U.K. government comes to the same rational conclusion as they came 2.5 years ago not to implement. The third new element, the new one is actually under the bilateral investment treaty claim that Philip Morris has. The first procedural hearing is actually now scheduled for July 30 in Singapore.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: And then coming back to the Turkish market, could you update us on the outlook for any tax increases at the end of this year, beginning of next year? Are they thinking about raising the ad valorem again or is that somewhat off the table?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. Remember, when we were here at the first quarter call, there we had had the press statement of the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister that they will address the excise tax structure. That has happened. The Council of Ministers has authorized specific tax to be implemented to an amount of up to 20% of the minimum excise tax. The timing and the actual percentage and amounts, that's still to be defined, but I would expect it still this year. So I think that is a positive development and a sign of rationality in the whole process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could just help me with the Marlboro brand franchise. We saw volume flow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and we saw good share of growth continuing in Q2. But how should I think about that franchise in the second half, the impact of market pricing innovation? Can you just help me think about volume and share progression as the year unfolds?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, first of all, I mean, really, I mean, not even the quarter [indiscernible] year-to-date. Yes, for Asia, I have to pick the hurdle out. But excluding the hurdle in Asia, Marlboro is up 0.24 to 6.2%. That's all year-to-date June numbers. In the EU, it's up 0.3 to 18.4. In EEMA, it's up 0.1 to 6.9, despite still measured by Nielsen declines in Russia. Latin America, up 0.4 to 14.2. So yes, it's growing. It's also growing in terms of shipments. So even year-to-date, excluding -- including the hurdle, it's up 1.7. Excluding the hurdle, it's up 2.9. And if I then move over to really to the big markets, where it's really substantially up, then you have there -- first of all, I would think of Mexico. It's growing -- I mean, the quarter, 1.2 percentage points to 53.2. I mean, the brand is in terrific shape there. It's growing by 0.9% in Poland. In Poland, you see a phenomenon that the top 10 brands really capture more and more of the market volume, and you see a consolidation into fewer brands. That's clear uptrading [ph] potential for us and for a Marlboro [indiscernible] element there. Germany, we talked about earlier on the call. Italy, it's growing despite recessionary environment. And 0.3 percentage point to 4.5 in Indonesia, given the size of the Indonesian market, it's quite some volume. Then you go to those markets where Marlboro is actually down, and there are very specific reasons in there, understandable reasons, which are not there to be forever. Korea, it's down 0.9 to 7.7, while that is clearly driven by our price increases that we implemented and we compare still to the periods that we had price advantage versus international competitors and were at par with the Korean competitors. In France, it's down 0.8 in the quarter to 25.2, very simply driven by the fact that Marlboro is the only big brand who is retailing at above EUR 6. There are a lot of brands retail below EUR 6. As I mentioned earlier, there's a price increase coming up in France. And in Spain, the decline -- in such a recessionary environment, what else could we expect? But take it all together, driven by the innovation, driven by new campaigns, driven by better execution on the marketing and sales level, a new commercial approach, Marlboro is doing well. Pockets of weakness like Russia exist, and we work on those. I'm very positive on Marlboro overall.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: So tracking where you all would expect for the year? Is that fair?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Could you say again? I could not hear.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Is it tracking in line with expectations for the year, Marlboro, overall for the first half?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Absolutely. Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Hermann, just one last clarification on the EU. Not to beat this thing to death, but it does sound like you're indicating broadly across the segment that I guess the first half volume numbers may be a better indicator of what the go forward looks like than are the Q2 numbers, right? Even though it looks like things have continued to worsen, especially from a macro perspective, and the number was a little worse than you even thought a month ago. So I guess can you, I guess, give a little bit more color on what the inventory/timing piece of the EU is that will cause Q3 and Q4 to get better than Q2? I'm just trying to understand why we'd think that, that first half number is a better indicator than the more recent Q2 number.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I mean, there is many markets in there. And as I said earlier, Germany is just -- I think it's the most flagrant example there. I mean, you had Q2 down by 5.2, whereas year-to-date, it's down by 1.3. And our full-year estimate for the German market is down 1.5. So you have this technical reason in the second quarter where in Q2 2011, you compare to an up of 4.6%. These are comps. Let's not get hung up too much really on quarters. Year-to-date trends are the more reliable indicator. I'm not talking it rosy here. Yes, EU region is not easy, but there is no reason to believe that the EU region is now going to be down 10% for the rest of the year. It's not going to be down 10% for the year, it's going to be down in the range of where the year-to-date is, which is anything around 6.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Avery with CLSA.
Michael Avery: One quick question. You had said your estimate for the increase in leaf costs was around 2% for 2012. Has that changed at all with the drought in the U.S.? Is there upward pressure on that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. I mean, what we see there really is about 2%, 2.5%. 2.5%, I think, is the most realistic number of the kilo prices going up. The drought in the U.S., I mean, this is a worldwide business. One individual geography does not change total trends. So maybe marginally but not substantially.
Michael Avery: Okay, that's helpful. And then you had cited Thailand and Vietnam as a couple of the drivers for growth in Asia. Those are obviously relatively small markets for you, but can you give a little color on what's going on there? Were they up quite a lot to be worth mentioning? What sort of growth that you're seeing there?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Vietnam, remember, we have kind of restructured a bit our business set up there last year, which has given us a better influence on marketing and sales of our products. We are actually from a very low place, almost doubling volumes in that market, but admittedly from a low base. We concentrate on the 5 or 6 big cities. The best example that highlights the future growth potential is actually that in the city of Hanoi, we now have a market share of about 15%. So there's plenty of possibility going forward. Thailand is a bit more a volatile environment where we are up against a well-protected Thai monopoly. But we have good trends there, but it's a bit more complicated there, I would say.
Michael Avery: Well, that's helpful. And lastly, just in Indonesia, obviously, the volume growth there is very strong. What kind of pricing gain did you see in the quarter?
Hermann G. Waldemer: In Indonesia, the way we implement pricing in Indonesia is actually that we increased several times over the year. That can be anything between 5 to 8x on average per year. Our trading price is into the wholesale trade. So it's not like in many other places where you have whatever an excise increase and the morning thereafter all the prices changes. So Indonesia has constant pricing throughout the year.
Michael Avery: So that just continued like normally [indiscernible]?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. There's nothing particular there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Two, if I can. Just coming back to this, the guidance not changing. Obviously, as you made the point, the EU was a little bit worse since we saw you in June. The currency obviously got a little bit worse as well. Could you just be a little bit more specific about which markets have got better over the last, I guess, 4 to 6 weeks that leave you confident that you're still in that range? Or was there a little bit of comfort baked into the previous guidance and you're just not through that level yet? And then secondly, just following up on the Indonesian point. Clearly, that's been a huge successful year both in terms of the market but your market share performance. Are you seeing anything from competitors in terms of trying to arrest that market share momentum that you seeing? Or would you be confident that, that will continue, given what you're doing there through the second half in terms of market share?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Let me start with Indonesia. As I said [indiscernible] before, I mean, we don't -- nobody can expect continued share growth in the range of 3 percentage points all the way along. We have said that this is going to slow down a bit. But that being said, I'm just convinced that we have the best company there, we have the best brands, we have great management, we have great employees, we have great distribution. We're just doing extremely well. And overall, the pricing environment is rational, the government, yes, is increasing excise taxes every year but has not done that for years in a disruptive manner. So the elements are all there for a very positive performance to continue in the Indonesian market. And then for your first question on the overall guidance, I mean, let me answer that way. We are all very pleased to see that our Asian growth engine is now complemented by very strong performance also in Eastern Europe.
David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. Is that Russia? I mean, it sounds like the presentation in the release that maybe Russian trends were stepping up a little bit in the last and then I guess your performance there with the investment behind Marlboro. Is that one of the key markets to your point that's kind of got better than you were hoping for over the last couple of months?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Russia, by its sheer size, of course, is the most important market in the EEMA region. But there is also Turkey, there is also Ukraine, there is Kazakhstan, there is North Africa, there is the GCC countries, which are also very prosperous countries with growing population and growing purchasing power. So there are many places in that region. Of course Russia is the most important but there are many others.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Lamark with Federated Investors.
Karen Lamark: Just wanted to go back to the EU and ask you to comment on how you see the balance of volume and pricing in light of apparent increase in price elasticity and the illicit trade. And really, what I'm trying to get at is whether or not these conditions and competitive dynamics might warrant a change in thinking about pricing, particularly if macro pressures seem, as they do, seem likely to persist.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Honestly, I don't think so because when it comes to pricing, then the first thing you need to think about is excise tax, and governments all across Europe have been rational. I think there can't be a more convincing example of the very recent one in Spain that disruptive measures do not maximize excise revenues, but regular moderate steps maximize excise revenues. That is, at the same time, the best not only for the governments, but also the best for industry competitors like ours. So I do not see a change in the rational environment. You have seen a continuation of that rational environment. If you look back over the last 2 years, the European crisis is already going on for a little longer and then the last 6 months. And I see no sign why that all of a sudden would turn and change into an unreasonable environment. I can't see that.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner.
Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: My 2 quick questions. Can you spend a second talking about the role of Lark in Japan? It seems like the brand that's most impacted by the Japan hurdle and tell us about the strength of Lark and the innovation applied to Lark in Japan. And then the second question was just to look for an update, any kind of narrative on the next generation of products that you tipped [ph] us to recently and whether there's been anything newsworthy.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, on Lark in Japan, let me put it this way. Lark is more of a traditional brand, more of a Japanese brand, as funny as that might sound. And that's why it's probably a little bit more vulnerable than a truly international brand like Marlboro is. That's why successful launches of competitors, as the one I was quoting, probably is putting more of a dent into a Lark than it eventually could put into a Marlboro. That being said, it has been a big growth driver last year. So everything has 2 sides. So we did have a lot of additional smokers into Lark during the special situation, the crisis of last year. In terms of NGPs, there's really nothing new to report compared to our presentations that we had at our Investor Day, really, only a month ago.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I'd like to close with some personal remarks here. It was an exciting journey over the last 5 years, which started with preparing the spinoff, the spinoff itself, and then life as an independent company. Quoted at the stock exchange has been a wonderful period of my life. It was a great pleasure for me to work with you all. And more importantly, to get to know you, the analysts following our company and many of our investors. Let me thank you for your confidence and trust over these years. I will certainly remain a shareholder of PMI because it's simply a superb company, and I hope to get a chance to see you again in the future. Thank you, and all the best to all of you.
Nicholas Rolli: Hermann, thank you very much, and let me add my personal congratulations and best wishes to you. Certainly, on behalf of the Investor Relations team, we appreciated everything you did for us, your support, your commitment, your wisdom, your friendship, and we wish you nothing but the best in your retirement. So congratulations and thank you. And with that, we'll thank you all for joining the call as well. And that concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the PMI Investor Relations team in Lausanne. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International's management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the first quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.  It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, our Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We once again achieved excellent results in the first quarter of this year. Our organic cigarette volume increased by 5.3%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 10.9%. Adjusted OCI, also excluding currency and acquisition, increased by 14.2%. And our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, rose by 19.8%. Our strong business momentum continues, and this should enable us to perform well during the remainder of 2012, notwithstanding the previously disclosed difficult comparisons versus 2011 that we will face in the second quarter relating to the exceptional circumstances in the Japanese market during the post-tsunami crisis. Consequently, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve the business results that we predicted when we issued our reported 2012 EPS guidance last February. However, since that time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against a number of currencies. As a result, we are facing a slightly stronger currency headwind and are now forecasting an impact of $0.15 in unfavorable currency this year based on prevailing exchange rates compared to the $0.10 previously disclosed in February. As a result, for exchange rate reasons only, we are revising our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2012 by $0.05 to a range of $5.20 to $5.30. It should be stressed that compared to our 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88, we are maintaining our forecast growth in the reported diluted EPS for 2012 of approximately 10% to 12% on a currency-neutral basis. Our forecast growth is fully in line with our long-term growth target for adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency. One of the key elements favorably impacting our business is the reasonable excise tax environment. While there have been increases, most recently in Spain, we have not seen any disruptively large changes in any key markets this year. On the structural side, we continue to witness further improvements via a gradual increase in the specific proportion of excise taxes. Many governments now recognize that higher specific elements reinforce the predictability of government tobacco excise tax revenues. Pricing continues to be the most important single driver of our profitability. The pricing variance was $369 million in the quarter. The increased prices, notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines and Russia, and continued to benefit from the annualization of higher prices from last year. We also generated a positive volume mix variance of $224 million at the OCI level as we grew volume and benefited from consumer up-trading in a wide range of non-OECD markets.  The 5.3% quarterly organic cigarette volume growth is our best performance since the March 2008 spin. While boosted by the leap year and an undemanding comparison to the prior year, the improvement was notable for its wide geographic spread. The Asia region led the way with a 12.4% increase. The growth in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions was around 3%. And the moderate decline in the EU region of 1.5% was the best performance in many years. In fact, volume increased in the first quarter in 13 of our top 15 largest markets by volume.  This performance reflects the breadth of our superior brand portfolio. In the first quarter, every one of our top 10 brands by volume grew. The small growth, notably adding 3.6 billion units compared to the first quarter of 2011.  We are thus able to continue our strong market share growth momentum. Our market share in our top 30 OCI markets was estimated at 37.3% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 36.6% for the full year 2011 and 35.5% in 2010. Asia is our principal growth engine. The region as a whole is benefiting from a solid economic environment, a growing adult population in many markets and increasing consumer purchasing power. Our organic cigarette volume grew by 12.4%, led by Indonesia. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 16.3% and 23.7%, respectively.  Total industry volume in Indonesia grew at a double-digit pace in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we forecast an increase in the range of 6% to 8%. Meanwhile, our shipment volume grew by 24.9% in the quarter, making Indonesia the single largest market for PMI by shipment size. Our market share was 3.5% higher at 33.4%. This tremendous result was achieved through the excellent momentum behind our leading machine-made, premium lower tar nicotine brand, Sampoerna A, and the strength of our overall portfolio, which also includes premium Marlboro, mid-price U Mild and low-price brands. Our premium portfolio added over 3 billion units and accounted for over 60% of our market share gain in the quarter.  The underlying trend in Japanese industry volume has continued to improve. We are forecasting a moderate underlying market decline of approximately 2% in 2012 as smoking incidence has remained stable since the middle of last year. Our first quarter market share was 28%, well above the previous year at 25.6% and just slightly below the fourth quarter 2011 level. Our share was impacted by trade purchases of new JT products in March when it dropped to 27.3%. So far, we have had just one new launch this year, Lark Hybrid 100 millimeter, which achieved a satisfactory 4.4% market share in March. Both Marlboro and Lark remain strong, and we have a full pipeline of new consumer innovative variants that we plan to launch in the coming months. In Korea, we implemented in mid-February a price increase of KRW 200 per pack to KRW 2,700 on Marlboro, Parliament and Lark, which accounted for over 80% of our volume in 2011, while making some necessary practical price adjustments to Virginia Slims. The preliminary indications are that as expected, we have given back a large part of the share gains from the previous temporary price advantage in return for a significant margin improvement. Our endeavors to secure a reasonable long-term reform of excise taxation has been delayed by the parliamentary elections that took place early this month, but we will renew our efforts now that they are over. Our results in the EEMA region were very strong in the quarter. Organic cigarette volume grew by 3.4%, driven in particular by Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and only partly offset by a reduction in sales in Egypt due to a surge in illicit trade. Our mix was favorable as adult smokers traded up to premium and mid-price brands. We increased prices in the quarter, most notably in Russia. And pricing was also a key driver of our higher profitability. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI were 12.6% and 18% higher, respectively, while we continued increase our investments behind Marlboro and other key brands. The strength of the economy has enabled the Turkish market to rapidly absorb the impact of the tax-driven price increases that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. Our volume increased by nearly 10% in the first quarter of this year as our portfolio continued to perform strongly. And our year-to-date February Nielsen share grew by 0.7 point to 44.6%. Our mix has also improved behind premium Parliament and mid-price Muratti.  In Russia, recent price increases have not prevented adult smokers' appetite for up-trading. Our above-premium brand, Parliament, continues to perform very strongly and gained a further 0.3 point to reach a record 3.2% Nielsen share year-to-date February. Along with the strong performance of low-price Bond Street and Next Slims, this has enabled us to grow our overall Nielsen share through the end of February from 25.5% last year to 26.2%. We remain optimistic that we can further strengthen our position in Russia as the preliminary results of our new marketing programs and additional investments behind the Marlboro and other key brands are showing early signs of promise.  In the EU region, total industry volume was down a modest 1.3% despite weak economic conditions, notably in Greece and Spain. Both L&M and Chesterfield continue to gain share in the region. Their market shares were up 0.3 and 0.4 point, respectively, to a combined 9.8%. L&M is growing in particular in Germany, Poland and Slovakia, while Chesterfield is performing particularly well in Austria, Portugal and Spain. Marlboro's performance remains resilient though its market share was down in the region as a whole by 0.3 point to 17.5%. Marlboro gained share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary and Portugal, while its share loss in Germany was attributable to a temporary price disadvantage. Higher prices, notably in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. enabled us to return to solid profit growth in the region. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were 5.3% and 3.7% higher, respectively, excluding currency. During the quarter, we continued to invest behind the new Marlboro campaign and consumer element innovative line extensions, such as Marlboro Beyond. Unemployment continues to increase in Spain with no short-term expectation for any improvement. This is putting further pressure on the total market volume for cigarettes. During the first quarter, PMI's market share declined slightly to 30.2% despite an improved performance for Chesterfield. As part of their measures to reduce the budget deficit, the Spanish government recently increased excise taxes on cigarettes, along with a restructuring that increased the relative importance of the specific element. In response, we raised our prices by EUR 0.25 per pack across our portfolio despite the government's failure to increase the minimum excise tax. In Italy, cigarette industry volume declined by 6.1% in the first quarter, partly offset by strong growth in the fine cut market which remains relatively small at around 6% of total tobacco consumption. The key drivers of this decline are higher prices that have boosted industry margins and government revenues and more difficult economic conditions. While unemployment still remains below 10% in Italy, consumer purchasing power is under pressure. There has therefore been some customer down-trading from premium and mid-price cigarettes to low-price international cigarette brands and fine cut. This led to an erosion of 0.9 point in our cigarette market share to 52.6% in the first quarter. To address these trends, we launched Chesterfield fine cut in the second quarter of 2011. This move has reinforced the brand as it has steadily increased its share of the total tobacco market and enabled us to achieve market leadership in fine cut in the first quarter of this year with a 28.3% share. Our latest initiative was the launch during the first quarter of this year of Philip Morris Selection in the growing international low-price cigarette category, where we are underrepresented. Along with the higher prices, these strategies should enable us to maintain our profitability in this important market going forward.  The economies in the northern part of Europe show more favorable trends as illustrated by Germany. Cigarette industry volume was up 3.1% in the first quarter as the economy remained robust and contraband was reduced. The German authority recently closed down 2 important smuggling rings, whose annual supply was estimated at some 400 million cigarettes. Marlboro was the first key brand to be sold in Germany at higher prices following the January tax increase and thus suffered a market share decline in the first quarter of 0.8 point to 20.4%. Nearly all competitive brands are now selling at new prices, so we expect an improved Marlboro performance going forward. Our optimism is backed by the promising results from the initial phases of the new Marlboro "Don't Be A Maybe" campaign. Marlboro's share amongst young adult smokers, minimum 18 to 24 years old, increased by 5 points in the first quarter to become the leading brand in this adult age group, along with L&M with a 20% smokers share for each of the 2 brands.  PMI achieved an overall increase of 0.2 point in its cigarette market share in the first quarter at 35.9%. This was driven by the continued strong performance of L&M. The brand grew a further 1.2 share points in the quarter to 11.2%. As this remains well below its young adult smokers share, we expect to be able to continue to expand L&M share in the German market going forward. We also successfully increased our quarterly share in the fine cut market, with a gain of 0.9 point to 15.8%. This was driven by our 2 key cigarette brands, Marlboro and L&M.  The Latin America and Canada region was a solid contributor, again, in the quarter. Organic cigarette volume grew by 2.9%, thanks to share and market growth in Argentina and favorable timing and trade inventory movements in Mexico. We increased our share in Colombia and Mexico, where Marlboro continued to perform well, with gains of 1.5 and 4 points, respectively. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 4%. On a global basis, the illicit trade in cigarettes is estimated at some 600 billion units. While at times a risk, it also offers PMI a very significant volume and profitability opportunity. The potential benefits of cooperation underpin our joint efforts with many authorities across the world. Canada, Germany and Romania are recent examples of successful reductions in contraband. In this context, we welcome measures being proposed by the provincial government in Ontario to reinforce its laws against illicit trade. Based on similar measures, the Québec government has stated that it increased its provincial tobacco tax revenues by more than $200 million over the last 2 years. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 23% excluding currency. Net earnings increased by $245 million, or 12.3%, confirming that the business fundamentals are in excellent shape. This was, however, more than offset by $742 million increase in our working capital and other requirements due mainly to the timing of receivables in the quarter and industry forestalling in the EU region, a phenomenon that should be fully reversed as the year unfolds. Let me remind you that forestalling occurs when manufacturers build up inventory in excess of normal supply chain requirement ahead of an excise tax increase. This competitive phenomenon becomes an issue whenever the payment of the excise taxes occurs prior to the depletion of the finished goods inventory. We are therefore working with governments to introduce and, when necessary, reinforce anti-forestalling measures. This would reduce our working capital requirements and provide governments with higher tax revenues without undue delay. In addition, capital expenditures are higher this year. We are investing in productivity-enhancing factory modernization, equipment for innovative new products, the consolidation of our operations in the Philippines, the expansion of our capacity in Indonesia and other projects. At the same time, we are on track to deliver on our $300 million pretax productivity target in 2012.  During the first quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 18.1 million shares at an average price of $83.07. Our target remains to spend $6 billion on share repurchases this year. Since the spin through the end of March this year, we repurchased a total of 432.1 million shares at an average price of $52.88. Our annualized dividend of $3.08 per share generated an attractive yield of 3.5% at the market close last Friday. Since 2008, we have increased our dividend rate by 67.4% under our policy that targets a 65% dividend payout ratio. We continue to generate superior shareholder returns compared to our tobacco peers, our wider consumer product peers group and the broader market.  In conclusion, the first quarter of 2012 has been another excellent one for PMI. Organic volume was very strong, and we benefited from consumer up-trading in non-OECD markets. All our key brands are performing well, led by Marlboro and Parliament. We are fully on track to deliver again in 2012 against our currency-neutral, long-term target of 10% to 12% adjusted diluted EPS growth. In the first quarter, we once more outperformed our tobacco and broader consumer product peers in terms of shareholder returns. We remain very confident about our outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond, notwithstanding the difficult comparison we will face in the second quarter due to Japan.  Thank you for your continued interest in our company and its excellent growth prospects. I'm now happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So just in terms of your guidance for the full year, notwithstanding the currency guidance change but just underlying x currency guidance, just because you had a pretty strong first quarter, it kind of implies that the rest of the year would show some slowdown in terms of the year-over-year. So other than the comparison issue, how are you thinking about the balance of the year? Are there anything just at the margin, whether at the macro level or competitive level, that's giving you some caution here? Or is it just really too early in the year and you just want to see how the year unfolds?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I think the most important point is really your last point. We are early in the year. Yes, we are facing a difficult comp in Q2. But the underlying business, as I said also in the prepared remarks, is in very good shape. We're very happy. There is no -- really no change in the business prospects that we had expected when we gave our initial guidance on the business side in February. It's just early in the year. There is always upside in life. There is also risks in business. That's why our guidance also is a guidance that spans $0.10.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then secondly in Japan, so it sounds like in March, the shipment share ticked down a little bit. Do you have the consumer offtake share for March? I'm just trying to understand how effective some of these competitive activities and the load then is translating at the consumer level.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes, I think -- I mean, if you look at really the shipment shares in January at 28.3, February at 28.5 and then March, 27.3, it is pretty obvious that it's influenced by competitive trade load. The fact, simply, is that we only have had so far one launch this year, the Lark Hybrid One 100s. In the same period, JT had 3 launches. Our pipeline is also there. This is going to come in the next months. So I think we are in a very good position. The market dynamics are back to normal. Again, the novelty impact is always there in Japan. You were asking for offtake shares. They are very, very slightly below 30%. So that's a very, very small decline to what we had seen the 2 months before. Also, that one, I would say, is driven by the novelty and the trial of new products that have come to the market.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then finally in Europe, you called out the volume performance obviously down 1.5%. You had somewhat of an easy comp, but just in terms of the decline being more modest in that market, if you can just maybe more recently, some of the increased -- again, renewed concerns about the macros and the consumer sentiment there, how do you think about your ability to continue to see improvement in Western Europe?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I think there are -- Europe is, of course, a mixed picture, as we all know. And if you just take the 2 extremes, if you like, on the growth and on the more difficult side, the German cigarette market has been growing 3.1% in the first quarter versus previous year. Whereas in Spain, while there was some growth, but there is really just, due to very, very undemanding comps in the first quarter of last year, that really the retailers have brought down their inventories quite a bit. The Spanish economy continues to be very difficult. Unemployment continues to increase. So I, again, would expect the Spanish market for the full year still to be down at least 10% again. So let's not be misled by the first quarter. There is quite a mixed picture, but if we really kind of step back for a moment and look at really what has happened more on a macro basis in terms of volume trends, then I would say, yes, the so-called more mature markets, the decline rates have really moderated if you compare that to, say, 3 years ago. At the same time, in a number of emerging markets, the growth rates actually have accelerated compared to 3 years ago. And that, of course, taken together, combined with our great portfolio and our momentum also in terms of market share, provides us with potential opportunities for further volume growth and for good performance that's more from a macro picture.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I know you normally don't talk about specifics about discrete quarters, Hermann, but given the unusual dynamics you faced in Q2 both with Japan and currency, is it realistic to expect EPS to be down in the second quarter? That's certainly my forecast at this point.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, David, we have never made really or given quarterly guidance. I won't do it now as well either. I mean, the 2 points really to keep in mind here are that the hurdle due to Japan is about $0.10, EPS cents. So the calculation there really is the market in Q2 in Japan was about 45 billion cigarettes, our market share was 42, our retention share is about 28. That makes a difference of 14. Multiplied on the market size is a volume hurdle of about 6.3. You take the margin, you take the cost, you deduct the tax, you divide by the number of shares, and that brings you to about the $0.10. So that I can confirm or reconfirm. We have said that before. And other than that, I would really revert you back to the full year guidance because that's what really counts and our continued conviction that business fundamentals are doing well. We are doing extremely well. Things are good. Things are in order, and they keep on going as we had expected from the very beginning of this year.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then 2 other things, Hermann. I think in your prepared remarks, you indicated an expectation for Japanese cigarette consumption to be down about 2%. Did I hear that correctly for the year?
Hermann G. Waldemer: That is correct, yes.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Why do you think it's getting better? Because even prior to the excise tax increase, that market's rate of decline was substantially higher and arguably getting worse, going from 3%, 4%, 5% to 6%.
Hermann G. Waldemer: That's correct. And as I said in the question before also, I mean, it's not only Japan -- that trend of moderating decline rates in the so-called mature markets is a Japanese sentiment, it's also a European sentiment. It's really hard to pinpoint that down to what it is. The fact really is, in Japan now, completely back to Japan, that actually, the smoking rate has been stable. Smoking incidence has been stable since at least middle of last year.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, with this continued growth in volumes in Indonesia, are there any issues on your capacity or the availability of cloves?
Hermann G. Waldemer: We are increasing capacity. That's part of the reason why CapEx is going up. Of course, we are adjusting our capacity to the needs there. On cloves, that's a cyclical harvest actually. Typically, you have a strong harvest in one year. You have a weaker harvest in the other year. 2011 was a weak year in terms of overall clove harvest. The indications for this year are good. It should be a strong harvest. And of course, that would lead to replenishment of the clove stocks that we would then, of course, perform.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog on Wells Fargo Securities.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to start with a question on pricing. You mentioned you're clearly benefiting from price realization. So how realistic is it for this continue at these levels? And do you attribute this to your innovation effort, price management or more due to the health of the consumer? And then I'd just like to understand how aggressive you've been with your managing your GAAP?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I would say managing price gaps has a lot to do with managing price structures and price -- tax structures, excuse me, not price structures, tax structures. And we have seen improvement in tax structures in many, many places. I give you a couple of recent examples. France increased the specific component at the end of last year. Spain, just right now, the excise tax increase there had at the same time are rebalancing from -- at the lower end to specific tax. They missed out on the minimum tax in Spain. Let's hope that it's going to be corrected going forward. Only at the beginning of this week, actually, in a press conference of the Deputy Prime Minister in Turkey and the Finance Minister in Turkey, they also announced that they will look at the structure of excise tax there without increasing overall tax burden and that will implement a specific element into the overall structure. Details, timing, all that remains to be seen. But that's, again, an important step forward. Again, also this week, a public announcement of President Putin in Russia that yes, there will be regular excise tax increases in Russia, but there shouldn't be any excessive excise tax increases there either. So a lot of improvement. Brazil earlier, where they began to do away with those many tax tiers that clearly were a disadvantage for Marlboro. So there is improvement in a lot of places and that helps. And then as well helps you and, as a consequence, helps us to put in the correct and the right price gaps.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then, Hermann, on volume, your volume growth was strong and then balanced across your region. And then drilling down into Asia, there is -- it sounds like a lot of the robust industry volume growth. I'd like to understand what's driving this growth other than, is it the growing population, GDP growth? Is it the consumer behavior, increased smoking incidence? I just kind of want to hear a little bit from you more color on this. And then understanding the underlying dynamics and then how sustainable this industry volume growth in Asia will be over the next 5 years?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes, I mean, if the origin is of course what you said, it is the overall economies. And many of those economies, take Indonesia as an example, have really excellent macroeconomic indicators. So Indonesia GDP growth is forecast at 6.5%. Consumer confidence is really high, inflation expectations of 5%, i.e., there is -- there are real wage increases there, so improved affordability. A growing adult population is, of course, another factor that plays in there. And when it all comes together and you have the right brands to compete in such a market, this is how you generate your volume growth, your market share growth overall. I mean, Indonesia, to stay with that example, has been growing a bit more than 12% in the first quarter. I don't expect that to happen for the full year, but I still expect a strong growth of about 6% to 8%. That factors in that in that market, eventually, the existing subsidies for fuel prices will be reduced. That's going to take out a little bit of the purchasing power. That's the reason why I would expect the 6% to 8%. But a 6% to 8% is, of course, again very strong growth. And in the Indonesian market, just to compare, it will now be well above 300 billion, i.e., at the size of the U.S. market or even slightly bigger.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then just a final question on your forecast for volume for the year, given the strength, I think you had talked about flattish growth for 2012 in terms of volume. Is it realistic to assume that you're going to see faster, maybe low single digit volume growth this year?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I would say, including the Japanese hurdle, I would continue to expect stable volume, eventually slight growth. If you would exclude the Japan hurdle, the 6.3 billion that I was quoting earlier, then we definitely expect strong organic growth. That wouldn't be that far away, actually, from the 1% target.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just a question for you, if I could follow up on Bonnie's question right there about volume, I wonder, again, given the strength that you're seeing in your business, but broadly across the world and improving economies, Indonesia [ph], how do you see the overall tobacco market, from a volume standpoint, growing this year? Is it also down a little bit still this year? Or you've seen a better performance there overall?
Hermann G. Waldemer: The closing number is hard to predict, but I would say there are really many places in the world where relatively speaking, if you take the last 3 years' horizon, that our situation is actually improving. So what I mentioned earlier, really on more moderate decline in the mature markets and stronger growth in the emerging markets, there I can see it. At the same time, there are a number of markets where the potential or the actual up-trading has come back, that would be Russia. Russia is not going to be a growing market. I would expect again, say, about 2% decline this year, just like the 2 years before. But here, you have the up-trading element in there. So the combination of all those factors provides the basis for a continued growing and successful business for us.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I want to ask you about 2 markets, the first one being Japan, just a quick question there. Do you expect that -- I think this comment was made on last quarter's call, that your constant currency profit would grow in Japan this year. Would that be a reasonable assumption?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, this is certainly what we are targeting and this should be about in that range, yes.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. And then just the second question, as it relates to Russia, you, obviously, had a good performance in Parliament, a little softer market share performance for Marlboro, and a lot of your growth came in the lower end with Bond Street and Next. Is that -- are you still -- are you seeing a trade-down effect? Obviously, you had one premium brand doing well and one -- and some lower-end brands doing well. But I just want to get a better sense of that market and then kind of how the consumers fare in there. And there is a trade-down factor in Russia is what I'm getting at there.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, the really declining volume -- segment is the low-price filter and non-filter segment. So there is up-trading in the market overall. Then don't forget that there was another price increase in the market. So if you like, people had to up-trade in any case because prices were going up. Then if you look through the portfolio, actually, Parliament, our above-premium brand, is growing tremendously, a record market share of 3.2%. That's really excellent. Yes, Marlboro in the quarter is still down 0.2% to a 2% share. Marlboro is on a low basis in Russia, as we all know. Well, that you also have to see in the context that we actually increased the price for Marlboro by RUB 5 to RUB 60, a price positioning measure we took there, which is just part of our overall efforts in that market. marketing sales price positioning product. Everything goes together how we want to bring back Marlboro in the growth track in the market. So don't pay too much importance to the 0.2% in the month. We are working on the equity of Marlboro and that, obviously, doesn't show from one quarter to the next. That's a longer-term investment, which we are willing to go.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rogerio Fujimori of Credit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just one quick question about trading inventory movements. So you refer to a few movements in -- unfavorable in Russia, favorable in Ukraine. So I was just wondering if there's anything else we should bear in mind when we think about Q2.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, in terms of trade inventory movements or in, if you like, what I called undemanding comparisons in the first quarter, that would, of course, be Japan. That would be Mexico at the other end of the world. But otherwise, nothing in that sense unusual. There will always be trade inventory movements from one quarter to the next. That's pretty obvious, but nothing spectacular that I could see there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Leinster of UBS.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions. First of all, I think on the EU side, you mentioned quite rapid declines in Portugal and Greece in volume terms. Is that something you can quantify? Are those seriously declining markets or not that important?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, for the individual market, Greece is of course -- the decline and the deterioration that we have seen in that market, it is important. If you apply then on the PMI scale in terms of comparisons, then of course, quarter-on-quarter there, last year to this year, Greece is not important. I mean, it's simply the situation in a Greece or in a Spain in our market reflects the very serious underlying problems of those 2 economies.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So I mean, in rough terms, in terms of Portugal and Greece, what have they knocked off in terms of volumes?
Hermann G. Waldemer: The total market size is -- in Greece in the first quarter, now you test my memory. It must be not too much. So Greece, about 1.2 billion. It's in the range of 20% to 25% down in Greece. I mean, it really reflects what you see in the economy there, which is why I cautioned earlier on Spain, if you just look at the market this quarter, that would be misleading. It's just comparing to a first quarter of 2011 where retail -- where tobacco leaves have really bought down their inventories dramatically and where you had the first quarter where the full-fledged public smoking ban also came into effect. So Q1 Spain this year compares to a very weak Q1 Spain last year, which is why I said, I expect another at least 10% decline in Spain for the full year. And the 10% decline expectation is probably realistic for Portugal as well.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Secondly, on the -- I mean, clearly, the volume growth in Indonesia is, well, almost unprecedented. But I mean, is there no comeback from the government in terms of rapid tax increases? Is there no sort of health -- sort of debate in Indonesia as to whether or not taxes should rise significant to offset the volumes?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, excise taxes have gone up also in Indonesia in the range of 7% to 8%, which compares to an inflation expectation of 5%. It's not that there are no excise increases in this part of the world. There are. It's just the overall economy. The environment is simply a growth environment, a strong growth environment. And it's kind of at the other extreme of the scale. When we were just talking Spain -- well, when we talk Indonesia, we talk about everything on the other side there.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Lastly, in Korea, obviously, you put the prices up in February and the impact seems to be a 5% drop in market shares. Are you surprised by the speed of reaction of the consumer in Korea and the sort of your loss of the market share quite so quickly? And do you know if that's gone to other premium brands? Or has that caused the market to trade down? Have they switched to cheap brands?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. Essentially, I mean, the beneficiary in terms of share was, of course, the company that has not raised the prices. The only company that has not raised prices, KT&G. That was combined by a fairly bizarre consumer campaign on their side, highlighting the difference between the foreigners and the Koreans, and that was the impact. But that stuff, at the end of the day, is an impact. At the moment, we are back now to a more normal situation going forward. And the underlying trend that the Korean consumer prefers international products over Korean products, that has not changed because of those events.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right, so I say, so the market's basically just traded down on the back of that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: It really is.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Fell of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First of all, on Latin America, slightly subdued underlying EBIT growth of 4%, considering revenues were up 5%. I'm just wondering if you could talk us through that a bit. I think the statement referred to organization -- or reorganization in Venezuela and Colombia, is that a short-term thing? Or is that going to have an impact later in the year? And then secondly, could you just update us on where we are with the various challenges to plain packaging in Australia in particular? I'm wondering when we might get a result from the hearing that's just closed.
Hermann G. Waldemer: So Latin America first. Well, yes, we have -- we are in the process of closing the costly plant that we have in Venezuela. That's correct. Then some organizational adjustments and stuff that we had also in Columbia -- salary impact there. And we are in the process of discussing our plans in Mexico with the employees' representatives. So that's really what's going on there. On the cost side, this is ongoing management of our business. This is nothing an underlying cost increase that will be there now or forever. Moving over to the plain packaging situation, yes, the hearings in Australia in front of the High Court have been finalized to date. The court has reserved the matter for judgment. So I would expect a decision from the High Court in Australia in the first quarter. But as you rightly say, this is not the only legal avenue. There are 3 legal avenues and 3 proceedings out there, the second one being the claim that Philip Morris has under that bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia. There, the situation is that the first 2 judges on that panel have been selected, i.e., the judge that we select and the one that the government selects. Now those 2 judges are in the process to select the third arbitrator and judge for the panel. We expect that to happen sometime now in April or in May. So I would expect the first procedural hearings in that case in June. But as we always said, don't expect rapid judgment. This is a process that's going to take from there at least another 2 years. The third avenue is a legal proceeding between governments, i.e., the proceedings under WTO. So the first 2 countries that have started proceedings under those rules are Honduras and the Ukraine. I would -- we would expect actually more countries later in the process to join that effort. Again, however, a process that is not going to last just a couple of months. These are longer processes, but promising legal avenues.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, Hermann, it looks like in this quarter, I guess the mix impact to revenue was negative, not to margin but to revenue, was negative for the first time in a little while. And you're talking a lot about trade up. I guess, can you talk about what would have driven that mix impact to the top line, just so I could understand it more clearly? And I guess the difference between to the top line impact versus the margin impact because obviously, one is a profitability thing and one is a price per pack thing. But can you just talk about the interplay between those 2?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, there must be a misunderstanding, quite frankly. Because in the quarter, our pricing variance is $369 million and the volume mix impact is a positive $224 million, actually adding up to $593 million, almost $600 million, i.e., an increase of more than $300 million versus first quarter of 2011.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right, and I guess that's the volume mix? I guess, I'm just talking about the overall -- the mix impact, the revenue mix impact. I guess I'll take that one offline. It might be my misunderstanding. And then I guess another one on the rate of profitability increase in Asia, the margins, they jumped pretty nicely in a quarter where average pricing has been going up in that market. This quarter wasn't a particularly large increase in pricing in Asia relative to others. Could you just give a little more clarity on why the margins jumped so nicely in Asia this quarter?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, this is -- of course, this is a number of markets. This is many markets. This is Indonesia we talked about before. This is Korea. These are price changes in many markets. It's just, I mean, on a quarter-to-quarter, sometimes, they can be just timing, which quarter comes first. But there is nothing really unusual. We don't -- we take the pricing as we deem appropriate, but no, there's no specific trend out there that I could see.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: Just one question on Turkey. It looks like the markets were -- you reported quite robust in the overall market, up 3%. I wonder if we can expect those to continue to recover. And particularly, given what you're suggesting with tax structure reform, does that bode well not only for the market, but then I would think particularly for Philip Morris?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I would say it bodes well also for the Turkish government. Such change is clearly in the interest of the government. Overall, I mean, Turkey, as a country, has a good economic outlook. Turkey has shown us often in the past that, yes, it's volatile, it's often steeper on the way down, but it's also definitely steeper on the way up. I think that's what we'll see again. We'll see a situation there of a GDP growth expectation of 4%. So things are going pretty well. And coming -- when it comes to us, well, we have a superb portfolio. This is Parliament. This is Marlboro. This is Muratti. This is Lark. This is L&M. This is Bond Street. We cover the entire range. And that's really, I would say, the secret behind our success in that market that we welcome a change in the excise structure. Of course, we do, and as you know, we have been working with the government on that. And now, as I said earlier, so the government has declared their intention to provide changes whilst the nature and the extent of the change, the timing of the changes is still open. Take it altogether, certainly positive dynamics for the Turkish market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to return to the discussion about pricing and pricing you realized in the first quarter and what we know about potential excise taxes in different markets. Is there any change to expected contribution from pricing for the year in your numbers?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. I mean, our plans for the year have remained the same. Obviously, I will not divulge what our plans are going forward. But look back to the last 3 years, 4 years, and you can see that pricing has been a constant factor and has been an important factor in our growth over those years and continues to be, and honestly, always will continue to be.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then if I could also ask you about the U.K.'s review of standardized packaging, any comments you can make on that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes, well, the U.K. has actually announced at the beginning of this week that they'll start a consultation period lasting 12 weeks. As you know, they have done the very same thing 2.5 years ago. The government has clearly stated that they want to listen to the public views, that they want to consider the legal implication, that they want to consider potential cost to retailer and the impact on demand for smuggled and counterfeit cigarettes. We will participate, of course, in that consultation. We will show that there is no credible evidence that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates, and that on the contrary, that plain packaging has serious adverse consequences, including an increase in black market for counterfeit and smuggled cigarettes. And those markets are run by criminals. So on the basis of the same facts, then 2.5, 3 years ago, I would hope and expect that the government comes to the same conclusion.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Marlboro brand and specifically, how you think about it globally versus in any one given country. It's certainly got some struggles in Russia. How critical is it to turn it around there? And if your portfolio is growing in total, does Marlboro need to be a bigger piece of that for you to consider that a successful market for you?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, Marlboro is tremendously successful in many, many places around the world, and it has been growing also in this quarter it's volume quite a bit. That being said, well, the world is never really perfect and we are always open as well about disclosing that we are not happy with the situation of Marlboro. Russia would be the one place. We are just too competitive and ambitious people to accept that Marlboro will stay on a 2% share in the big Russian market. Marlboro can do more and this is why we put the resources behind, the creativity behind. This is about marketing. This is about sales. This is about retail. This is about products also and product innovation for the Russian market. So we are investing because we want to improve the situation. Another markets where the situation on Marlboro has been difficult over the years is the German market, where Marlboro, essentially today, is the only premium brand left because everybody else has repositioned to the low end of the market. However, that being said, low in Germany means $0.50, $0.60 below the premium pricing. This is, therefore, not a price problem. It's an equity problem. And here again, in Marlboro -- for Marlboro in Germany, we have there worked on the campaign, the new "Be Marlboro, Don't Be A Maybe" campaign, which is showing strong signs of really -- of success there and is improving quite a bit the smoker share amongst the 18- to 24-year-old. Innovation that we have brought to the brand has helped enormously. They actually stand in Q1 for 10% of the total volume of Marlboro. So you see, we are tackling it from all ends, but it is important to remember that whilst there are places here and there that our performance can be improved and we are working to improve it, if you put it on a global scale, then Marlboro is doing very, very well. And it's doing extremely well in the most important Asian markets.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then just going back to one comment you made on Korea. Obviously, there's a consumer sort of transition period to get used to the new prices, but you had said something about how it seems like it's already back to normal. Have you already seen some share come back? Or did you just mean that the competitive dynamics have sort of reset wherein that can continue from here?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. I think the share losses have occurred, come back, not yet. I was just saying that at the end of the day, the competition in Korea will be amongst brands, and we certainly have the stronger brands in this market compared to a local competitor there.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then lastly just on tax, it looks like the rate was a little bit higher this quarter than it's been running. Is that something that will wiggle back down a little bit? Or do you think this year's rate may just be higher in general? What kind of outlook should we expect there?
Hermann G. Waldemer: The quarterly rate is our projection for the full year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I only have one quick question for you. I noticed that in your -- in the press release on the country by country discussion, you started breaking out the Philip Morris brand in many more countries. Is that a brand that is getting more attention from you? What's behind that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No, I mean, Philip Morris as a brand has always been one of our core international brands. It is just, if you like, the brand that we have selected to address the -- our underrepresentation in the low-price international segment in Italy. So I mean, it has always been a very strong brand, for example, in Argentina. It has always been a strong and growing brand over the last 10 years, I would already say, in France. No, it's just one of our top brands, but there is nothing. There is no underlying change in the way we look at it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo and Gardner.
Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: You mentioned that -- I have 2 quick questions. You mentioned that Egypt stumbled based on an increase in illicit trade. I'm curious about the sort of magnitude of that and where it's coming from. You've done such a good job stamping it out in other parts of the world. Where is it coming into in Egypt then? And secondly, can you update us on your sense of your capacity to reinvest? You mentioned that you're directing more money towards Indonesia and the Philippines. I'm wondering about other markets and also the new product work that you're doing. What does the uptick in prospects for regions and new products suggest that you'll be able to deploy in capital going forward versus what you once thought?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, Egypt has just a really -- a recent surge in illicit trade. There wasn't too much in the market before. The estimate, but there's a pure estimate. Now I said it probably has already reached about 20% of consumers [ph] in Egypt growing. It is actually eating primarily into the international brands, not really in Cleopatra, which is the low-price Egyptian brand. Well, quite frankly, that's a question of enforcement and capability to enforce their -- this is a difficult situation these days in Egypt. Then in terms of capacity to invest, is there your question really on the CapEx side?
Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Yes, absolutely. Yes.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Of the CapEx side, okay.
Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Putting out long-term capital behind the rising prospects of geographies for you and also the possible prospects for new product launches and the acceptance thereof?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I mean, in terms of really -- of CapEx, we have not changed really our multi-year average that CapEx should be in the 1:1 ratio in relation to depreciation and amortization. From 1 year to the next there can be above and then a little bit below. The average will be there. I mean, in terms of big categories where we invest, that would be super high-speed machinery. There is machinery today that can produce 20,000 cigarettes a minute. Then of course, in the important Indonesian market, that would be the capacity increase that we have there. Then we are in the process of finalizing the greenfield factory in Korea. We are investing in Korea. So the secondary is up and running. Primarily will be running in July, August of this year. In the Philippines, we do the factory upgrades following the business combination there. So it's ongoing. In terms of other investment for innovative products, as you know very well, the margin dynamics of this industry, if you really have a seller, the investment on CapEx is amortized pretty quickly.
Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Yes. Last thing, Hermann, can you share with us in this low-rate environment what have been your best terms? Or is it common about an extraordinary low rate pay for some meaningful amount of borrowings? What is the high watermark issuance at the moment?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I mean, yes, you're right, I mean, in March, we actually issued $1.25 billion of bonds, $550 million with a 5-year tenure at 1.625%. And we actually issued also a 30-year bond for $700 million at 4.5%. So as you can see, again, we think also long-term and not just short-term benefit, i.e., we have increased the time, the duration of our outstanding debt. In terms of total cost of debt, the year-to-date number would be 4.2%. It has been 5% in the year 2010. It has been 4.4% in the year 2011, i.e., it keeps on coming down.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.
Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just have a very quick question around your short-term borrowing balance. It looked like it spiked up pretty significantly in the quarter despite some of the longer term issuance that you did. Could you just speak to sort of what the moving pieces were there?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I mean, essentially, as you said, this is short term. We are able to borrow at extremely favorable rates on the commercial paper market. That was actually a $3.7 billion at 20 basis point average by the way, 20 basis point average at month's end. This fluctuates. So the year-to-date average would be already $1 billion less, would be $2.7 billion. But last year's average was -- the full year average was $1.9 billion. So you will always have fluctuations there. But in terms of overall financing, really, the basic principles and the cornerstones around it have not changed, the most important being that we want to be comfortably in the middle of a single A credit rating.
Operator: And that was our final question. Sir, do have any closing remarks?
Nicholas Rolli: Okay, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team. We're based here in Lausanne this quarter. So thank you all, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for joining the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2011 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2011 full year and fourth quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.  During our call this afternoon, we'll be talking about results for the full year or fourth quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also includes our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines.  Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company's income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs. Free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Louis Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, who will join Louis for the question-and-answer period.  Louis?
Louis C. Camilleri: Thank you, Nick. And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 2011 was a superb year for Philip Morris International. We returned to organic volume growth, thanks notably to our strong performance in Indonesia and in Japan, where we benefited from our excellent execution in response to the tragic events there last March. We achieved global share growth for the fourth consecutive year, driven by our superior brand portfolio. Our solid volume performance, strong pricing and significant productivity savings led to record profitability. Finally and perhaps most importantly, we continued to generate strong cash flow, which enabled us to provide generous returns to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we increased net revenues and adjusted operating company's income or OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, by 8.2% and 7% respectively and grew our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding currency, by 13.4%. The growth in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was driven by higher pricing, particularly in the EEMA and EU regions and favorable volume mix, principally in Asia, partly offset by higher costs reflecting increased marketing investment in several important markets, such as Germany, Japan and Russia. In the Asia region, adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up by an impressive 22.6% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and by a robust 10.5% on the same basis in the EEMA region. These increases more than compensated for declines in our 2 other regions. In the EU region, adjusted OCI, excluding currency, was down 4.3%, adversely impacted by unfavorable volume mix, notably in Italy and Spain. In addition, we increased our marketing investments substantially in the quarter behind a new Marlboro marketing campaign in Germany, Marlboro Beyond capsule product launches in France and Switzerland and the launch of Marlboro Core Flavor in Spain. In the Latin America and Canada region, unfavorable volume mix primarily volume in Mexico and higher expenditures contributed to a 6.3% decline in the quarter in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions. On a full year basis, net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, rose by 9.2% and 14% respectively and the growth of our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding currency was an outstanding 21.2%.  In recent months the euro has weakened, mainly due to the sovereign debt issues in Europe and several emerging market currencies have also depreciated against the U.S. dollar. At prevailing exchange rates, we forecast a currency headwind of approximately $0.10 per share this year with the largest impact expected to come in the second and third quarters. I would like to stress that this would simply bring us back about halfway to the currency levels generally prevalent in 2010 as we benefited from a $0.19 per share currency favorability in 2011. We have excellent business momentum going into 2012, which will enable us to fully compensate for the earnings per share hurdle of $0.10 related to the exceptional circumstances in Japan in 2011. The comparison for Japan will, of course, be especially difficult in the second quarter of this year. For the full year 2012, we are forecasting reported diluted earnings per share guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 compared to $4.85 in 2011. Excluding the currency headwind, this new guidance range represents a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.88 in 2011. Thus, I am delighted to reconfirm that we expect to achieve results in 2012 that will again meet our mid- to long-term currency-neutral annual growth targets, this despite the Japan hurdle I just mentioned. Our strong business results have generated tremendous and growing amounts of cash. Our free cash flow has grown at a double-digit compound annual growth rate since 2008 to reach $9.6 billion in 2011, despite sizable contributions of more than $500 million into our main employee pension funds last year. We expect continued cash flow growth in the years ahead, which will enable us to provide our shareholders with generous returns. We initiated our current $12 billion 3-year share repurchase program in May 2010. At the end of 2011, we had $3.6 billion left under this authorization and we expect to complete our current program well ahead of schedule. We plan to spend $6 billion in total on share repurchases during this year.  We remain confident in our future as the key drivers of our strong 2011 performance are expected to remain in place in 2012. These are a manageable excise tax environment, stable industry volume trends, our superior brand portfolio, our market share growth, a favorable pricing environment, limited input cost increases and strong productivity gains. The threat of disruptive excise taxes has always been a concern. However, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases usually do not generate the targeted increase in government revenues nor are they sustainable. Consequently, there have been no excise tax increases implemented or announced so far this year that we would deem to be extreme in any of our key markets, despite large government budget deficits in numerous countries. On the contrary, we are witnessing a more reasonable approach both in terms of incidents and the structure of excise taxes, most notably in the European Union, as governments are keen to secure sustainable revenue streams from tobacco taxation. Several countries in Europe are most likely to increase general VAT rates this year. But overall, we believe that such increases should be manageable. We anticipate that cigarette industry volume trends will remain similar to those prevalent last year. We see further volume growth opportunities in non-OECD markets where the adult smoking population is expanding and where the economy is vibrant, most notably in Asia and the Middle East. The industry volume decline in the largest OECD markets and in Eastern Europe is expected to be moderate. The one area of significant concern remains Southern Europe, where unemployment remains notoriously high and is regretfully still rising. We expect PMI's organic cigarette volume performance in 2012 to be relatively flat despite the hurdle we face in Japan. This is better than the 5-year total industry volume trend, excluding China, that we forecast in November last year. Our superior geographic footprint and brand portfolio are driving our share growth momentum. We expect to outperform the industry again in 2012. In 2011, we gained 1.2 share points in our top 30 OCI markets to reach a level of 36.3%. We generated particularly strong market share gains in OECD markets, driven by Germany, Japan, Korea and Turkey and increased market shares in a number of important non-OECD markets, such as Indonesia and Russia. Every single one of our top 10 brands realized volume gains in 2011, whether sold in the premium, mid- or low-priced segments or whether international or local. The strength of our portfolio is underscored by the fact that these top 10 brands accounted for approximately 75% of our worldwide volume last year. Marlboro continues to steadily gain market share on a global basis driven by its strong performance in Asia and the EEMA region, which has more than offset the pressure on the premium segment in Western Europe. This growth has been propelled by the new architecture, the launch of consumer-relevant line extensions and enhanced consumer engagement.  Parliament, which has a luxury positioning and is sold at an above-premium price, performed exceptionally well with an increase in shipment volume of 12.1% last year and 18.7% in the fourth quarter alone. In 2011, Parliament share grew in its 5 major markets of Kazakhstan, Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. L&M, our second-largest brand, grew by 1.7% to reach 90 billion units in 2011. This was achieved through continued market share gains in the European Union region, most notably in Germany, where the brand grew by 1.1 share points to reach a market share of 10.4%. Importantly, as the year unfolded, we were able to stabilize the brand's share in the EEMA region and particularly in Russia, where it has been under pressure for the past few years. Overall, we achieved a favorable volume/mix variance of $422 million in 2011. This represents an improvement of $1.1 billion compared to 2010. In 2011, our pricing variance reached $1.9 billion, half of which came from the Asia region, well above the $1.6 billion average achieved over the previous 3 years. The favorable pricing environment is expected to continue to be a key driver of our growth in 2012. Since the beginning of the year, we have announced or implemented price increases, notably in Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and more recently in Korea. In fact, we have already in place price increases which cumulatively account for some 70% of the pricing variance included in our 2012 earnings per share guidance. Adjusted OCI margins improved further in 2011 to reach 44.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by higher prices, the positive impact of geographic mix, particularly from Japan, and productivity savings, which surpassed our $250 million target. At the same time, we made significant investments in business infrastructure in Russia, as well as in our brands in Japan and other markets, notably behind the successful launch of consumer-relevant line extensions.  Going forward, we forecast moderate increases in tobacco leaf prices and direct material costs, broadly in line with inflation. With the exception of higher costs relating to the imposition of reduced cigarette ignition propensity or RCIP paper in Europe, we are targeting a further $300 million in pretax productivity savings in 2012, predominantly derived from manufacturing and supply chain initiatives. We continue to transform a considerably higher proportion of our growing net revenues into free cash flow than our consumer products and tobacco industry peers. Our strong and growing cash flow fuels an attractive dividend and share repurchase program. We've increased our dividend by 67.4% since 2008 and repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin. In 2011, we outperformed every company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in terms of shareholder returns and share price appreciation, with gains of 39.8% and 34.1% respectively. Over the period of March 28, 2008 through the end of December 2011, we have returned approximately $37 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases or nearly 30% of our current market capitalization. While the economic environment, particularly in Southern Europe, remains fragile and continued currency volatility is an obvious concern, we remain optimistic that our growth prospects are sound despite the comparison to what was a banner year for Philip Morris International. Thank you for your attention. Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to ask you about 2 markets, one is Japan and then Russia. Let me start with Japan. Can you talk to us how you envision the 28.2% share entering the year, how you see that evolving throughout 2012. What type of impact, if any, do you think you'll see from JT's plethora of pending product launches? And also as your share has gone up, have you been able to capture a greater share of convenient store shelf space?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, our ambition is to continue to grow our share, David. In January, our share was 28.3%, fourth quarter was 28.2%. We also have a plethora of new products coming up. So in terms of share, our ambition certainly is to continue to grow share in this important market. And I think we have a number of exciting programs there. I think also in terms of the macro picture, the markets performed much more strongly than we had originally anticipated at this time last year. Ultimately, volume was only down about 10.5% last year. And you may recall that our concern was it would be down about double that. So it's not just a share story, it's also volume story. And I think in terms of our presence in convenience vending, generally in terms of consumer engagement and trade engagement, we are very competitive. And as I said in my remarks, we have increased our spending in Japan.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then in Russia, Louis, can you speak to the execution plan behind Marlboro? How long do you think it's really going to take to have a meaningful increase in market share? And have you done anything in test markets or in smaller cities that has some promising indications?
Louis C. Camilleri: You're right to point out that Marlboro in Russia has been an issue for us, and we've clearly devoted a lot of resources to try and find a solution for Marlboro in Russia. We have beefed up our organization considerably. And the good news is that last year, starting last summer, we did one main test in the city particularly focused on Russia and Marlboro's potential there, and I must say the results of all the activities that we did in that city in Russia provided excellent results and really moved the needle quite considerably in terms of Marlboro. It also pointed out some of Marlboro's weaknesses to us. But I would say that probably for PMI, that market test was not only important for Russia, but a lot of the learnings of what we did there would be applied elsewhere in the world. But going back to Russia, what we did, it was in Yekaterinburg, you will see that there will be expansion this year, and we anticipate more spending in Russia. Marlboro's been losing share for some time now. I think we now have to focus on its issues. We know what to do. I'm hopeful that we can grow share. Whether it will be a significant brand will take quite a lot of time, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Louis, so if I just take your volume guidance for 2012 sort of flat, even if you're lapping the Japan impact, so that implies if you take Japan out, you're probably looking for an acceleration in terms of other markets outside of Japan. So I'm just curious if you can just walk through where do you feel confidence that the volume can actually accelerate. Can Indonesia continue to grow at this 20% rate?
Louis C. Camilleri: No, I don't think Indonesia is going to be growing at 20% volume rate. I think it's generally strength across-the-board, Judy. If I look at our share performance in the fourth quarter, and I'm talking just share here, in the vast majority of markets, we did better than the full year, so it shows that we have momentum. I think the big difference is that we anticipate that volume in the EU will be better than it was in 2011 because a lot of the issues are potentially behind us. Southern Europe remains a concern, but we still believe that we can do better in the EU than we did in 2011. Asia and EEMA will continue to propel our growth and we also believe that there are growth prospects in Latin America and Canada because share performance in Latin America has actually been quite spectacular. But obviously Mexico was a big issue in 2011 with a significant decrease in consumption, which affected the whole region's performance. And as you know, there's no tax increase in Mexico this year. So hopefully, we're looking a much better comparison than we did in 2011.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just going back to Japan, Louis, I guess, one downside of perhaps the 2011 success in Japan is Japan is now a much bigger portion of your overall profit, as well as the overall Asia profit. And it is one market where pricing freedom is limited. So can you help us understand how you grow profit in that market without the pricing freedom? And do you need to see acceleration in profit of other Asian markets to really drive continuous healthy profit growth in the Asia region?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, it's a downside I can actually live with. But I would say that you're right, Japan is obviously a significant profit center. I think in terms of growth going forward, we had proven that, in fact, we had probably cracked the pricing freedom issue back in 2010. Now clearly, JT is the leader there. You know that the government is targeting reducing their stake in the company. And from everything I read, JT is focused on becoming much more shareholder-friendly in terms of dividend, share repurchases, et cetera. So I think pricing freedom per se is likely to get better over time. This year, we do not anticipate any tax increases. And we think we have significant share growth potential in that market. Going to the rest of Asia, we believe that Asia will continue to be the growth engine of this company, and that there is still a lot to accomplish in our existing markets, but also in virgin territories. So yes, the rest of Asia will certainly grow faster than Japan, but I wouldn't write off Japan at all, Judy. I should add that we anticipate that this year, partially because of the strength of the yen but despite the huge hurdle we face, we anticipate that our income in Japan will be higher than it was in 2011.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On a constant currency basis.
Louis C. Camilleri: No, I said partially...
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: With the yen. Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: I wanted to circle back on some of the markets. In particular, given your comments on the outlook for Asia, I was wondering if you could update us on the Philippines business and where things are at both in terms of the cost saves, but more importantly the outlook for that business as now it has been a while with PMI really in control of that operation.
Louis C. Camilleri: We're delighted with the business combination in the Philippines. Everything is going according to plan and, in fact, beyond plan. Income is up significantly, driven by both pricing, share growth as well as cost saves. We're ahead of our target in terms of cost saves. And there is more to come this year. We've gained share, the market was down last year because of the price increases and the tax increase in early 2011. In 2012, there's no tax per se. Share growth continues, so the outlook in the Philippines is really quite excellent. We're now focused on merging our distribution arms. And that, I think, will give us even more leverage with the trade and really be able to capitalize on the entire brand portfolio. Does that answer your question, Erik?
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's helpful. And then with respect to Plain Packaging, I was wondering if you can update us on where we're at in that process. Obviously, the implementation is in December 2012, and I believe we can expect a hearing in April. So I was curious both in terms of what it looks like in the Australian High Court challenge, but then also the BIT challenge and where things stand with the WTO.
Louis C. Camilleri: Okay, I'll try to give you a brief summary. You may have read that the government has filed its defense in the High Court a couple of days ago, I believe. And there is a hearing on procedural matters, I believe, on February 23, and we'll take it from there. One of the focus areas will be on the facts behind the claim in terms of we believe that there's been an acquisition of property and the government does not believe that there's been an acquisition of property. And the court will have to decide what are the relevant facts related to that specific legal claim, and if there's disagreement on those facts, that may delay the whole process. If there's agreements, there's likely to be a decision in late summer or the fall. But from everything we see, it seems that there may be significant disagreement on the factual components of the claim. On the BIT claim, where we stand is that both parties have chosen the arbitrators that represent them. And those 2 now are scheduled to choose the third one. So that will take a little while. And really, the case won't really start until this summer. But it's likely to be a 2-year process at best. And in terms of the WTO, there's not much to report other than we are aware that a number of countries have expressed a strong desire to make a claim against Australia to the WTO. So we're really in the early days of all the litigation efforts, the 3 key efforts, but we remain vigorous in our intent to pursue our rights vis-à-vis Australia.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: And if I could follow up on that briefly, is it fair to think that other countries' considerations of Plain Packaging is likely to be that any efforts toward moving into a plain packaging environment are likely to be on hold, given the Australian litigation? Is that a fair view from your perspective?
Louis C. Camilleri: I'm not sure, Erik. Clearly, they're all watching Australia with a close eye. The legal situation changes depending on the geographies. I think that there are a number of countries that are looking at it very seriously, New Zealand is one. The U.K. is starting a consultation phase. But I think that in most instances, people will realize that Plain Packaging does not achieve the objectives that those acts would hopefully entail. In fact, there are such huge unintended consequences that I think it would be detrimental to public health. And it certainly will not reduce consumption of cigarettes, which is the main aim here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions for you. Early in your remarks, Louis, you commented on a $0.10 hurdle from Japan. I just want to understand that figure because I think you were running at a $0.15 benefit. Did I understand that correctly? Or what's the difference in the calculation there?
Louis C. Camilleri: What we've said is if you look at 2011, the increment of the special situation in Japan, the $0.15 was through the third quarter. For the full year, it's $0.18, Chris. That was the impact on 2011. If you now look forward to 2012, we clearly have gained share and we've retained that share. So that's in the base, which is this 28.2%. Hence, the -- really which happened in the second quarter of last year where the share was significantly higher than that, that actually is the way we view the hurdle for 2012. And therefore, it's a different number and that number is $0.10.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That makes sense. The other question I had for you is just in relation to Marlboro. Obviously, the brand did remarkably well in 2011. Is part of your volume growth plans -- I'm sure you don't want to get too detailed on these plans, but do you expect Marlboro growth? And I guess I can go a step further than that. I was just curious that that's a brand you've invested pretty heavily in with new products and promotional campaigns. You labeled some of those for some of the Western European markets in your remarks. Do you have enough sort of new activity there? Do you think that the Marlboro brand could kind of keep up with the overall company's volume growth in 2012?
Louis C. Camilleri: I would certainly hope so, yes. And we still anticipate a number of programs behind Marlboro. It has suffered in a few markets. But even if you take the European Union and you separate the south versus the north, the north has done much better. And we're confident that we can still improve that situation. In the south, essentially Marlboro stands alone in the premium segment, everybody has vacated that segment. And we had programs in place in terms of lathering the brand through the Core Flavor extensions, the Pocket Pack. And that seems to have been quite successful. If you take Greece, Marlboro share is actually up in Greece, which is quite a spectacular performance. So we'll see as things unfold. But clearly, our ambition is to ensure that Marlboro continues to grow and actually hopefully outpaces the total volume growth of the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: My first question is on Parliament, your Parliament brand, which as you mentioned has been generating faster growth and at the above-premium price point. So could you talk a little bit more about why you think this is occurring? Is it driven by improving economic trends in key markets? Or have you been increasing marketing spend behind the brand? And then also, how sustainable is this growth for Parliament? And are there further opportunities to extend the brand into other markets?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well clearly, because it's a luxury brand, Bonnie, it is less sensitive to price than a brand such as Marlboro. And it has proven to be extremely resilient. There has been a lot of innovation behind Parliament, so far extremely successful. It's a very special brand. Its recessed filter has been copied by others in a number of markets, Turkey, in particular. But even then Parliament continues to grow. So it has a good presence in a luxury segment that is less prone to down trading and we're seeing the results, which are pretty spectacular. I don't know what else I could add.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: No, that sounds good. And then I have another question in terms of your business in Asia. And after modeling it out, it's clear to me that your top line market should continue to drive the bulk of the profitability in the region in the next 3 years, particularly Indonesia. But I'd like to hear from you how you think about sort of the mix of the countries within your Asian region and how that might evolve and specifically, in regards to your investment cycle and infrastructure build in some of the other growing markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, India, sort of where you're at with some of those maybe smaller markets for you at this point.
Louis C. Camilleri: Okay, let me attempt. We talked about Japan earlier, and I think Japan will always remain a very important market for Asia. Korea, we feel very good about Korea in terms of its share growth. We just took a price increase, and Korea will continue, in our mind, to show long-term growth. Our share may suffer a bit because KT&G has not increased its prices. But within the portfolio, we feel very good about our business in Korea. Indonesia, I believe, will continue to be the growth driver in Asia for many, many, many years. Philippines, we mentioned earlier. I think Philippines has the potential to be a top 5 income market for the whole of PMI within the next 7 to 8 years. And then there are all the other markets that you mentioned where we are seeing growth. I mean, what was phenomenal in Asia is that Marlboro gained share in every single market in Asia last year. And in terms of share, we gained share in every market, with the exception of Pakistan. There are territories such as Vietnam which I think will be a market for the future, which we are doing well in and I hope we will continue to do well. And then of course there's China, Bonnie. And I would hope within the time frame that you're talking about, somehow we will have a presence in China, which completely changes everything in terms of Asia because there would be a paradigm shift.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Absolutely. That's helpful. And I just sort of want to confirm then some of the infrastructure build in some of those markets where you don't necessarily have a huge presence at this point, you've invested, you're ready.
Louis C. Camilleri: We are ready. And we have invested in terms of resources and we continue to do so and to ensure that we have the appropriate talent as well in all these markets.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the marketing, admin and research. So on a total company level, I guess it was up about 100 basis points. And you've certainly been clear about the specific market investments you guys have made, an infrastructure build in Russia. But that 100 basis points on a total company basis is the largest we've seen since '09. So I was just wondering if you can kind of put the magnitude of that increase in context. Is it timing of a bunch of different things you're doing at once? Is it a reflection of your success so far and just the ability to spend back, having a couple of little fires in the Marlboro brand around the portfolio, I guess? But can you just put that increase in context?
Louis C. Camilleri: I think you sort of covered it all in your question. It's a combination of everything you just said. We have a number of programs in place. And we have exciting programs that we're now implementing and we're putting money behind it across numerous markets. I've sort of highlighted the key ones. Germany is the first market we've used the new Marlboro campaign, which we started in the fourth quarter. And we're very hopeful that, that will move the needle in terms of Marlboro in Germany. And clearly, that campaign will be expanded elsewhere and there's a lot of excitement generated by that campaign. And we continue to build on the Marlboro architecture in the line extensions, and I've mentioned a few examples in the European Union. But if you take Asia, some of the line extensions have been frankly quite spectacular. Ice Blast in Japan has been a phenomenal success. So there's a lot of excitement behind Marlboro, and we're putting the money behind it. But it's not just Marlboro, it's Parliament, it's L&M and it's Chesterfield, where a lot of work has been done in terms of brand portfolio, the actual brands themselves, the campaigns, the consumer engagement activities. It really is all coming together.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, would you expect these levels of spending to be sustained? I guess is there any upfront nature of this spending? Or it's just something you'd expect to continue? And I guess, what do you think of the timing of the payback of these investments, understanding, of course, there are different natures of these? If you could just kind of try to pull it together, I'd appreciate it.
Louis C. Camilleri: We anticipate in 2012 that we will actually increase our marketing spend and investments. And the beauty of our margins is that the returns are pretty rapid.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to dig into India a little bit. I know it's small and far longer-term opportunity, but how has the response to Marlboro been since you sort of retriggered the business there? What's the consumer and retailer, customer response been so far?
Louis C. Camilleri: You're right, it's still small. We're really only active in 3 cities today. And the reaction both from the trade and the consumer in those 3 cities is actually excellent. Marlboro continues to grow its volume every month and we're pretty excited about Marlboro's prospects. And I think we would like to get a more solid footing in those 3 cities before we start expanding. So it'll be a slow process. We face a formidable competitor that clearly is not going to give us an easy ride. We're fully aware of that. And I must say that the progress I've seen in Marlboro in India and specifically in those 3 cities is very, very promising.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Well, that's great. And then also just back to the Philippines. I know you said that the pricing and cost savings were drivers. What split was that? Was one more important than the other? And what kind of sustainability to the pricing do you see there?
Louis C. Camilleri: I wouldn't go into the actual drivers. But yes, we see pricing opportunities in the Philippines over the long-term as being quite significant. Much will, of course, depend on what happens to excise taxes. And there has been talk of a reform of excise taxes, we'll see. So far, there have been debates in committees, but nothing concrete as of yet. And it seems to be that at least for the foreseeable future, the current excise tax structure will remain in place.
Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: And then lastly on Indonesia, it looks like there's some excise tax increases there. Do you see any problem covering those with pricing or more than covering them? What kind of pacing do you see that taking throughout the year?
Louis C. Camilleri: No, I feel quite confident that over time we can handle the excise tax increases that were implemented in Indonesia. As has been the case in the past, they were not excessive increases and they're quite manageable. And we believe that Indonesia will continue to rocket ahead in terms of both volume and income.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rogerio Fujimori of Crédit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could you talk a bit about illicit trade trends in some of your key markets? You flagged Spain on the negative side and Canada on the positive side in 2011. So I'm just wondering if these trends -- you see these trends continuing. Or are illicit trade levels stabilizing in those markets?
Louis C. Camilleri: Illicit trade continues to be a huge problem. It has expanded quite significantly in a number of markets. And yes, you mentioned Spain. But illicit trade is increasing not only in Spain but in Greece, in Italy, in Germany, in Mexico quite dramatically, and remains a big issue in numerous Asian markets. So it's a plague. And we're doing everything to fight it. And hopefully, we can have more success going forward. It's a big problem, but it's also potentially an opportunity because you would hope that at one point those volumes will return to legitimate trade. And I think governments are more and more focused on ensuring that they don't open the door to further illicit trade by huge tax increases. But it remains a big issue, Rogerio. And we've made progress. I think if the world could adopt the industry's tracking and tracing system, it would help considerably. The advent of what are called illicit whites has become a huge issue, and we need to tackle the source of those products.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just one quick question about Russia; the Russian consumer, actually. Is the price elasticity after the latest increase and also the pace of up trading playing out as you expected?
Louis C. Camilleri: Pretty well, yes. I mean, the Russian market in total is down. But in terms of the trends, the segment trends, they are showing signs of improvement. So it's looking quite good. And I think there is considerable consumer confidence in Russia.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just wondering if you could help me with a little more detail in terms of your outlook for the EU market in 2012. You touched a little bit on volume. So what's your confidence in pricing and growing OCI? And what are inventory levels like?
Louis C. Camilleri: Nothing really to report on inventory levels. We are hopeful that we can return to constant currency income growth in EU. Last year it was down, in part driven -- in large part driven by Spain. I think Spain alone, if I recall, was close to 3 percentage points of growth or lack of growth in EU. And our hope is that we can grow income in EU, which wasn't the case last year, Ann.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then in terms of any potential markets requiring the use of LIP, do you anticipate any markets over the next several years converting to the required use of LIP?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, the whole EU is on it now, which clearly is a cost hurdle this year or at least for 3 quarters. Others have looked at it. Nothing seems to be on the horizon yet. But I would anticipate that over time, most of the world would probably go in that direction, Ann, [indiscernible] although it doesn't make much sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Wickham of Oriel Securities.
Christopher Wickham - Oriel Securities Ltd., Research Division: Just going back on Rogerio's point, I mean, you do read increasingly that people are accusing the tobacco industry of using illicit trade as a tool really to get back at governments or to some extent to have it their way on taxes and on communication. I mean, do you feel that the approach to illicit trade has been mishandled? And can you think of ways in which it could be handled better?
Louis C. Camilleri: I think that clearly not enough has been done in terms of fighting illicit trade. I think the reference you made is actually being made less and less because the fact is law enforcements, authorities throughout the world recognize the role that the legitimate industry is having in fighting illicit trade. The bulk of illicit trade today is counterfeit products and illicit whites, by far the bulk of the illicit trade. And I think industry, government stakeholders, as well as consumers need to combine forces to fight this plague. It's been successful in a number of places, Canada was mentioned earlier. Romania was a good example, where illicit trade has been forcefully addressed and has declined quite significantly. It's still there, double-digit, but it's come down by some 40%. So it can be done, but it requires cooperation from everybody. And regretfully, there is so much money involved in illicit trade that at times it's difficult to get everybody's cooperation. But we are very focused on that and, in fact, intend to invest more behind the fight against illicit trade.
Operator: Our final question is a follow-up from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: With respect to another market where there's meaningful illicit, Brazil has a large tax increase coming in May, also with a minimum retail price implementation. What's the Philip Morris view on that? Is that increase going to be disruptive? And is PMI optimistic about improvements in the illicit versus legal volume mix in Brazil post the change in the law?
Louis C. Camilleri: You would hope that if the minimum price is actually adhered to, that clearly would help. Illicit trade in Brazil is not a new problem; it's been 30% of consumption for as long as I can remember. And it's basically 2 sources, one is Paraguay and the other is local manufacturers. I think the Brazilian government has focused more and more on the local manufacturers with some success. But it is an issue. I think that, as you know, the new tax reform is over a 3-year period. There will ultimately be one uniform tax rate applied to all cigarettes. I think that is a good thing. It may cause some short-term disruptions. But in terms of the longer-term prospects for that market, I think the government has made the wise and right move.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Rolli for any closing remarks.
Louis C. Camilleri: Before I pass it onto Nick, I did want to mention, because you all know Nick very well, that today is his 25th anniversary with Philip Morris International, and obviously before, its parent. And I think it's quite fitting to thank him for the 25 years, and that we would announce such spectacular results on his 25th anniversary. I'll now pass it back to Nick.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much, Louis. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you all for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team, we're here in New York. And on February 23, we will be presenting, Hermann will be presenting at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference down in Boca Raton, Florida. So we hope to see you all there as well. So thank you very much. Have a great day.
Louis C. Camilleri: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2011 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010 unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, our Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was 23.7% higher. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.37 per share and grew by a remarkable 33%, excluding currency.  While these results were boosted by relatively easy year-on-year comparisons in the third quarter, we comfortably surpassed all our mid- to long-term currency neutral targets even excluding the whole of our business in Japan. And year-to-date, we are well within these targets. Our business outlook has further improved since July, fully compensating recent unfavorable currency movements. This has enabled us to narrow our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely to $4.75 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this translates into an improved growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 17.5% to 19%, well above our mid- to long-term currency neutral growth target and approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates. Our third quarter volume was exceptionally strong. We achieved an organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4%, led by the Asia region, with an increase of 12.6% and EEMA with 4.8%. On a year-to-date September basis, we have achieved organic volume growth of 0.5%. While there has been a lot of focus on Japan volume, I would like to emphasize that we achieved organic volume growth of 2.3%, excluding Japan, in the third quarter. Furthermore, on a year-to-date basis, the combined increase in our volume in Indonesia and Korea was nearly double that of Japan.  Our entire brand portfolio has performed very well. Every single one of our top 10 brands achieved volume growth both in the third quarter and year to date, be they international brands such as Marlboro, L&M and Parliament or leading local brands such as Fortune in the Philippines and Sampoerna A in Indonesia. I would like to highlight the remarkable performance of Parliament, whose volume was up 16.2% in the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date. We are particularly pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which is gaining share on a global basis, excluding China and the U.S. In the quarter, Marlboro volumes increased at double-digit rates in both the Asia and EEMA regions. On a year-to-date basis, Marlboro has gained 0.3 and 0.5 share points, respectively, in these regions.  Marlboro's slightly share decline in the EU region reflects the pressure on the premium segments from continued economic difficulties in parts of Southern Europe as well as a moderate share loss in Germany. However, the brand gained share or was notably stable in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. The share decline in the Latin America and Canada region marks the superb momentum of Marlboro across the region and is the result of the over-indexation of Marlboro in Mexico, where industry volume has declined at a double-digit rate since the large tax-driven price increases in December last year. This very good performance is evidenced by significant share gains in the 4 key Latin American markets: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Our excellent business momentum is reflected in our overall strong share performance. Year-to-date, our market share in our top 30 OCI markets was up 1.4 share points to 36.3%. In the quarter, we achieved a higher share in a clear majority of these 30 markets for an overall gain of 1.2 share points.  On a regional basis, our results in Asia, the growth engine of our company, were outstanding with net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency and acquisitions, up 39.1% and 75.1%, respectively. This was driven in particular by Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines.  We also enjoyed strong performances in the other 3 regions. In EEMA, net revenues grew 11.2% and adjusted OCI, 13.8%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. In Latin America and Canada, they were up 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Our results in the EU improved with net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, up 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively. During the third quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 16 billion units, up 5.1 billion or 47.1% compared to the same period last year. The increase reflects the higher market share that we have achieved this year as well as easy comparisons due to the payback in 2010 of our distributor inventory buildup in the second quarter of last year in anticipation of increased trade and consumer purchases ahead of the October tax-driven price increase.  Our third quarter market share of 27.9% was distorted by competitive trade reloading following shortages of their products through August. We do not expect shipments to the trade to mirror consumer demand until at least the fourth quarter and possibly, only in the first quarter next year. We remain, nevertheless, optimistic that we should be able to retain considerable additional market share.  Our confidence is based on our ability to maintain a consumer offtake share in convenience stores, such as Lawson, at a level slightly above 30% in September and early October, after all competitive products were available to consumers again. This compared to a pre-earthquake share in these outlets of around 26%.  The other important element that we expect to be able to confirm in the fourth quarter is the evolution in the total market. We now forecast that industry volume will decrease this year by no more than 15%, a much lower rate of decline than the 20% forecast at the beginning of this year. Our business is also doing extremely well in Indonesia. Industry volume growth in the quarter was well over 10%, driven by increasing consumer purchasing power, limited inflation, higher consumer confidence and positive demographic trends. Our volume rose 22.5%, and our market share reached a record level of 31.2%, a gain of 2 share points. This very strong performance was led by Sampoerna A, which increased its market share by 0.9 points to 12.1%. Pricing remains robust, and we expect the government to continue to implement plans to simplify the excise tax structure. All these trends are very encouraging as Indonesia is a very profitable market with significant potential for further growth.  Our market share in Russia was up slightly in the quarter through August to 25.8%, behind Parliament in premium, Chesterfield in the mid-price and Bond Street in the low-priced segment. Our volume in the third quarter was down 3.5% due to distributor inventory adjustments as well as the impact on the total market of recent price increases.  During the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the Russian Parliament to approve the new roadmap for excise taxes on tobacco products. This calls for increases that are higher than originally planned yet still expected to be manageable, with 2 steps in 2012. PMI volume in Turkey rose 21.6% in the third quarter, and our market share reached 45.7%, a gain of 3.9 points led by Parliament in premium, Muratti in mid-price and L&M in the low-price segment.  While the market has stabilized so far this year, we expect the recently announced excessive increase in the ad valorem excise tax rate along with an ineffective minimum excise tax to cause considerable disruption. We will continue, therefore, to vigorously put forward our rational arguments for a more balanced excise tax structure in Turkey. Germany has benefited from more robust market volume trends this year. Total market volume in Germany was actually up 0.3% in the quarter for cigarettes and 3.8% for fine cut, continuing the positive trend of the first half of this year. Our cigarette volume grew by 1.2% in the third quarter, and PMI gained 0.3 share points to reach 35.2% thanks to the continued strong growth of L&M, which remained the fastest growing brand in the market and was able to more than offset the decline of Marlboro. PMI also gained share in the fine cut segment.  Of even greater importance, our profitability has been enhanced by the price increase that we implemented in the second quarter of this year following the May excise tax increase. The next tax step will take place in January 2012. We have tremendous business momentum in France, where the overall market has remained stable so far this year. In the third quarter, we further increased our market share by 0.4 points to 40.4%, driven by the strong performance of our premium brands: Marlboro and Philip Morris. Furthermore, we achieved market leadership in the fine cut market, with a share of 25.2%, thanks to the successful launch into this segment in February this year of Marlboro. The brand reached a 6.8% segment share in the third quarter.  Finally, we have just announced the price increase of EUR 0.30 per pack across our whole cigarette portfolio. This should enhance our profitability going forward. Spain remains a troubled economy with very high unemployment and a difficult tobacco market. Industry cigarette volume is forecast to decline at least 15% in 2011. The pricing situation was resolved in September when we increased our retail prices by EUR 0.25, bringing Marlboro to its previous level of EUR 4.25 per pack and L&M to EUR 3.75. This should enable our profitability to recover. With the temporary exception of Spain, the pricing environment continues to be very favorable. This is highlighted by the $564 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter this year and the $1.6 billion year-to-date. During 2011, we have implemented or announced price increase in the majority of our key markets including: Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia; Algeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine in EEMA; France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in the EU; and finally, Argentina, Brazil and Canada in the Latin America and Canada region. Our outlook on costs remains very favorable. Current tobacco leaf crop prices are stable to slightly declining on a worldwide average basis. Tobacco and direct material cost increases are very moderate and broadly in line with inflation and are being offset by our continued productivity efforts. We expect to comfortably exceed our $250 million pretax target for cost savings this year.  The combination of strong pricing and limited cost increases has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margins. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 47.3% in the third quarter, a gain of 3.1 points. One of the reasons for the absence of downward pressure on prices in our industry is the important role of excise taxes and the desire of governments to continue to grow revenues. This can be achieved through a judicious combination of reasonable excise tax increases, structural enhancements and higher prices. There have been improvements in excise tax structures in several markets this year, and some countries have adopted multi-year tax plans, including Germany and Indonesia.  While government deficit financing needs point to renewed pressure on excise taxation as a source of additional revenues, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases do not improve revenue-generating capabilities over the mid to long term. We do, however, expect some countries to seek to generate higher revenues by increasing VAT, which will push prices higher, though this should be manageable.  Every year, there are, nevertheless, still a few governments that continue from time to time to introduce very large and disruptive excise tax increases. As I mentioned, this happened last week in Turkey, and additional surprises remain possible as it is still early in the budget process in many countries. When it comes to plain packaging, we believe that there is no sound evidence that such a regulation would reduce consumption, smoking incidence or youth smoking or provide any other public health benefit. Indeed, plain packaging would undermine public health objectives by lowering prices and increasing illicit trade. In addition, it would violate intellectual property protections and breach international trade obligations. We, therefore, do not believe that plain packaging regulations should be widely adopted by other governments outside Australia.  Though the proposed bill has not yet passed the Senate, the Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences and on introducing such a regulation. We are, therefore, vigorously pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands. During the third quarter, our free cash flow increased by $577 million or 25.6% to $2.8 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $363 million or 16.1%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was up more than $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to continue to generate a growing cash flow is reflected in the 20.3% increase in our dividend that we announced last month.  As of the close on Tuesday, our dividend yield stood at the very attractive level of 4.6%. Since the spin in March 2008, we have increased the dividend by 67%, an achievement that few companies have matched over a period that included a major financial crisis, significant currency fluctuations and an acute recession.  During the third quarter, we spent $1.4 billion to repurchase a further 21.2 million shares. Since the March 2008 spinoff, we have now used over $20 billion to repurchase nearly 400 million shares at an average price of $50.81. Over the same period, we have paid out over $14 billion in dividend. So in total, we have returned nearly $35 billion to our shareholders. In conclusion, PMI had an outstanding third quarter. Organic volume grew by a remarkable 4.4% with half this growth outside Japan. This was driven by the very strong performance of all our main brands, led by Marlboro and Parliament.  Our market share momentum remains very strong. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up 15.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 33%. Pricing environment remains very favorable, and the vast majority of governments continue to act rationally on excise taxation.  Our business outlook has improved further since July, enabling us to narrow our reported diluted 2011 EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely, to $4.75 to $4.80, this despite recent unfavorable currency movements. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an improved growth rate of approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 17.5% to 19% excluding currency.  And finally and perhaps most important, we have demonstrated again our focus on shareholder returns and shown our confidence in our bright future with the board's decision in September to increase our dividend by a further 20.3%.  Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just actually wanted to touch on Japan. You mentioned you feel comfortable that you're going to be able to retain around a 30% retail share in the market. So I was hoping you could give us a few more details on what you're seeing in this market in terms of the consumer purchase patterns and then maybe also relative to what JT has been doing to take back some of their share.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. The published shares that you see there are also -- I mean on JT's side, the shipment shares, these now in the quarter or year-to-date, are not really representative yet. I mean, it's simply the fact that, of course, the pipeline on JT's product had been empty and has been reloaded now to whatever JT considers to be a necessary level of their volumes. So in terms, really, of what sticks with the consumer, we simply have to wait a little bit until those shipment shares will equal really consumer offtake shares again, which -- as has been the case in the past. For now, I really think that the consumer offtake shares which we measure in the C-stores give you the best indication. This is, of course, not a national average. This is a snapshot. And also, in those stores, our shares before has been slightly higher than the national average. But we continue to see, even now in the beginning also of October, the very latest numbers, and we, of course, look at them every week, that our shares continue to be slightly above 30% with Marlboro shares in there being stable. So therefore, I mean, that, of course, makes us feel good about the retention shares that we will be able to keep and which will form a much better basis from which to grow going into next year.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of your overall business in Asia, it's obviously doing quite well even excluding Japan. It appears, in general, the economy and consumers are faring much better in Asia than the rest of the world, especially when we look at your margins. Excluding currency and acquisitions, I think it's up -- they're up almost 10%. So hoping you can again just drill down a little deeper, maybe give us a few more details on what the key dynamics are here, specifically in Indonesia and then Korea, maybe long-term growth rates you expect in those key markets.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. Indonesia -- Asia, overall, as I said on the prepared remarks as well, is the growth engine of our company, but Asia -- it's not Asia alone. We are also having very decent results in the other regions. Take the EEMA region. Take the Latin America region, but also take the EU region, where we have returned to OCI growth. So whilst the growth rates are the strongest in Asia, the business is doing very well also elsewhere. Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia. While we have a country which has none of the European problems that European governments are facing: Very strong macroeconomic indicators, GDP growing, inflation under control and unemployment down, growing population, of course, as well. And all that taken together leads to a cigarette market that is, year-to-date, growing a bit more than 10%. I mean, this market is marching towards a total size of, probably at one time, reaching 300 billion cigarettes. So it's a huge market, actually the second most important in terms of size of Russia. At the same time, the tax outlook is manageable. Excise taxes go up. They go up slightly above inflation. They are bringing the tax tiers, over time, together. They are willing to do away with that loophole on using new legal entities to benefit from lower-tier tax advantages. And we are having an excellent portfolio in the market, where not only Sampoerna A, which is the best, but also Dji Sam Soe is doing fine. U Mild is growing. So we are doing really well, and we have actually also good price points on our individual brands when it comes to the prices that those are being sold by retailers on a stick basis.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one final question on currency headwinds that you'll be facing as we head into 2012. What can you tell us about what you're expecting and maybe any of your hedging strategies? Can you give us an update?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, now, for this year, where we had forecast $0.25 currency favorability still around the second quarter earnings call, that has been reduced now, and we're now at prevailing rates. We expect $0.20 for the year. Well, that's pretty much the number that we have year-to-date. So therefore, I wouldn't talk about unfavorable currency in the fourth quarter, because actually, at prevailing rates, the fourth quarter of this year is going to be a currency-neutral quarter. We will see what the actual rates will be, but at prevailing rates, you could expect a currency-neutral quarter. Going into next year, who can forecast the currency rates of next year? I can't. I would only say we have so much focus these days, again, on the problems in Europe and around the euro. The focus will come back on the United States as well. That's what I would predict going into the -- into next year.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Will you have an update on the fourth quarter call?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, we will, of course, when we do -- when we come to the guidance for 2012, which will be on the fourth quarter call in February of 2012. There, of course, we will give the updates on what currency assumptions will be the basis of our guidance then.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, Hermann, can you talk about the implicit outlook that you're making for the fourth quarter? It looks to me like on a local currency basis, the new EPS guidance would only imply fairly modest underlying operating profit growth.
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. I mean, David, there is no concern or no watchout that I would have to raise here for the fourth quarter. I mean, the fourth quarter is -- traditionally has always been a quarter where more of the expense is occurring than in earlier quarters of the year. That's normal. That's nothing new. That's every year the case. I mean, we give full year guidances. And as I just said, I mean, the $0.05 of currency unfavorability, we have compensated with even further improved business outlook. And as of now, at prevailing rates, the fourth quarter would be a currency-neutral quarter. So no watchout. Nothing to worry about. Look at the full year guidance, which I believe is a very, very strong guidance and an expression of our confidence in our business and into our future as well.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, Hermann, is the excise tax increase in Turkey the single most challenging one you're going to have to endure, looked at over the last several years, taking into account sort of the nature, the magnitude of the increase, the relative importance of the market, your performance in the market and so on?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I mean, no, I wouldn't say that. It is, of course, disruptive, a disruptive excise increase. It is bad news. But a year ago, we have been discussing Mexico. I wouldn't make much of a difference between the 2 at the end of the day. What I would add and say on Turkey, well, I mean, this -- the excise increase is, of course, a problem for all the competitors. This excise increase is not benefiting the government. I'm convinced about this is not generating really for the mid- and long-term solid increased revenue base. The only one party benefiting from that would be people that sell at the very lowest end of the markets, which is not the international companies, at about TRY 4 per pack, because at that level, their allover need is only 1/4 of what it is at the premium end. This doesn't make sense for the government either. At the same time, we, of course, can expect now a steep reaction -- at least in the first months, a very steep reaction of the tax paid markets. We certainly can expect an increase in the illicit rate. These are all really straightforward, rational arguments which give me the hope that there could be a second step later in the process in this story.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then 2 other quick things, Hermann. Have you had any mediated discussions as of this point with Australian authorities subsequent to the filing of your plan? Anything substantive?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. We have had that discussion during the negotiation period, which has ended under the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Hong Kong and Australia. However, no solution could be found in that discussion, unfortunately.
David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, looking out now in the EU over the next several years, how comfortable -- how confident are you that you can grow your operating income in that market over time in light of the fact that presumably, there's going to be a difficult economic backdrop? There'll be, presumably, government austerity measures. The governments will certainly be looking to increase excise taxes as a source of revenue.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, there are, of course, the markets that we know already, like Spain, which are already in difficulties as of today. However, there are a couple of positive aspects to the EU business, really, because you asked the question in a longer context, in a 2-, 3-year context. First, it is really encouraging to see that we see clearly moderating total market declines. So in the quarter or in also year-to-date, we talk about 3.6%, 3.7%. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, half of that is just Spain. So, i.e. all the other markets together are declining not even 2%. Germany is growing. France is stable, and Italy is almost stable. So that's pretty good. What will the austerity measures do? Well, the point really is what will unemployment do. We have seen that, of course, a steep increase in dramatic levels of unemployment, like in Spain, have an impact. I do not see Spain happening everywhere in Europe. This is very overdone. I don't think that's going to happen. So then on excise tax pressure, could be. Of course, I can't exclude it. But given the financing needs of those governments, I would rather see pressure on general VAT increases. In Europe, those could happen, of course, affecting all products, including our products. That being said, a VAT increase has always been manageable at the end of the day in the past. Why wouldn't we be able to manage it -- to manage through these occasions also going into the future.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The -- in terms of your guidance, Hermann, if you looked at this year, the underlying x currency growth of 17.5% to 19% growth, is there a way that you can sort of point out how much of that was what you would characterize as sort of a one-off impact as a result of what happened in Japan or any other situation that you would sort of characterize as one-off?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I wouldn't characterize anything as a one-off. I would say Japan has been an example of us seizing a business opportunity that presented itself in an optimal manner. And a price skirmish in Spain, also, well, that's part of business. What can you do? I wouldn't call this one a one-off. This is just part of the business on the good and on the bad side. Now really, going to Japan in more detail, well, we can -- let's try to quantify a little bit what is the year-to-date benefit of us seizing this business opportunity. I think the fairest way of doing that is that you take our year-to-date shipment share. That is about 31.5%. Our going-in share prior to the events was about 25%. That's a rounded share gain of 6.5%. On a total market of $144 billion, that gives you roughly $9.5 billion in volumes. You apply the very decent margins that you estimate for the Japanese market. You deduct from that substantial air freight cost that was well above $100 million. You deduct from there other cost and investments. We are right now at a very competitive situation in the fourth quarter. And we, of course, do everything that we need to do to support our brands. You take off the tax rates, and you arrive at something in the range of $250 million net of tax or something in the range of $0.15 on an EPS basis. I have done a similar calculation at the end of the second quarter. It was about $0.10 to $0.12 then. I hope that helps.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It does help. And I guess the context is more really looking at 2012, because -- and part of that, I guess, depends on how much share you retain in Japan, because we'll be lapping some of the benefit you saw in Q2 as a result of this -- the disruption. But I guess your point is if you take the year-to-date number of 31.5% and if you sort of think about that 30% that you're seeing at the offtake trend, that would sort of be the comparable number just on -- in terms of on the volume side. And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison in 2012 is not as positive, I guess, depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Exactly. I mean, the most important point, you just said it, well, what is going to be the tax and price situation going into 2012, which is very hard to predict now. I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year, because nobody expects a tax and price hike of the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the DPJ tax council has come out with a proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually, excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here. Even an exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter, in terms of price, because well, the central approval by the Finance Ministry of price increases is also still in place. So a lot of question marks at this point in time. We will see the outcome, but you mentioned it. I mean, we will, of course, start the year in Japan from a much stronger base than we have been starting the year in 2011.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Hermann, just following up on David's question about EU region. I guess just in terms of the persistent market share losses that you've been experiencing and obviously, more the macro challenges and the fact that you're more exposed to the premium segment than others, are you rethinking sort of your brand portfolio strategy in any meaningful way to be a little bit more aggressive in some of the value segment? I think you talked about this a little bit at your analyst meeting, but just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about sort of share versus maybe a mix or profit in that region.
Hermann G. Waldemer: I mean, we certainly want the EU region to return to OCI growth. Now in the European context, we have seen a number of markets, their brands over the last years have been repositioned to the low end. We have answered that in the markets, where it was necessary, this brand out of our portfolio. I mean, Germany is a much different situation than it has been a couple of years ago. We have Marlboro there. Yes, but we also have today there an L&M, the fastest growing brand in the market. The market -- the brand with the highest young adult smoker share in the market, and we are right now complementing that with Chesterfield at the same price level in the German market. Taken all together, well, the market share in the German market actually has been growing. So our team there, and we have a very strong team in Germany, is doing an excellent job, and it begins to pay off. If you move over to France, that's a different situation there. There, actually, we have 2 growing premium brands. Both Philip Morris and Marlboro are doing extremely well in an otherwise stable market. The market where we are underrepresented at the low end, clearly, is Italy, where our share at the low price segment of the market is well below our overall total market share in the market. So it's a marketing, it's a brand challenge. It's a sales challenge, but we have the portfolio to do something there. And it's not that we wake up to it now. We do something already for the last years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Fell with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Two things. On Japan, Hermann, you mentioned that you weren't sure whether or not shipments would be coming into line with consumer offtake until Q4 or possibly Q1. Does that apply to the industry as a whole or your own business as well? And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more around the factors which create that uncertainty still.
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. You see, I mean, it certainly is not coming from our side, but I simply don't know what the individual inventory situation of competitors is and to what extent they bring volume into the market, to what extent they think that this is the inventory levels that they need. So therefore, I'm just -- I can't know if those will be already the going-in and going-on volumes that are really consumed by the smokers every month. So there...
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. With regards to your own business, there's no -- the reason to believe that shipments and offtakes should match each other more closely in the fourth quarter.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Absolutely. We had no disruption. We just delivered a little more than we usually did. But we kept our business going all through, but there is nothing of that nature on our business.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick question on the EEMA region, where you had quite a nice volume recovery in the third quarter. I'm assuming Turkey will reverse. But I'm wondering about Ukraine as well, which had strong growth in the quarter. Does that reverse in the fourth quarter, i.e. is the third quarter impact undone? Or does it just normalize in Ukraine?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Ukraine is now normalizing. Q3 of this year, actually, in terms of comparison benefits from a very weak Q3 of last year. Q3 2010 had to de-load after the July 2010 price increase, which had a load in Q2 of 2010. So therefore, I mean, we are benefiting in Q3 now from these relatively easy comps. And we are now kind of out of that, and we should see now a situation that normalizes in the Ukrainian markets. Let's hope that we have no new disruptions, nothing on the horizon. Ukraine is one of the markets where you never know.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple questions for you. I guess I wanted to better understand. You've had, obviously, a nice windfall this year in terms of a profit benefit from foreign currency and certainly, some very good performances in Japan. And I just want to understand the extent to which you are, if you will, reinvesting back in the business. You've mentioned some brand building activities, of course, in Russia. I think it's been -- that's been ongoing this year. I wonder if there's a little bit more color you can give on that. And then also, again, are you investing back in Japan or other markets to take advantage of some of this benefit you have coming through to your earnings?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay. I mean, we really don't run our business different if the currency is in our favor or is temporarily against us. We always invest into our brands, into the growth of the future, specifically in Russia. I mean, Russia is big. Russia is not just Moscow and St. Petersburg. So we need to do more there in terms of work for our brands. We want to do also -- to do more there in terms of our infrastructure given that Russia is such a large market, a very profitable market with tremendous potential going forward. So we put the necessary money behind. We are not doing any short-term swings here. This is a strategy that we started to pursue last year, that we are pursuing this year and will continue to pursue also next year. In Japan, it's -- there it's really the fourth quarter is, of course, in terms of point-of-sale presence, in terms of point-of-sale actions, after all the competitors being backed before their products in the market, a highly competitive situation: fight for shelf space, fight for small promotional offers that you make to your consumers. However, please, let's all not forget there is fixed retail prices in the Japanese market, i.e. one-off on prices or buy 2 get 1 for free. All of that does not exist and is not allowed in the Japanese market.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Just one follow-up then on the Russia activities. I'm just curious if those -- obviously, it's a broad brand building activity, but obviously, Marlboro has been quite weak there. So is it targeting that brand? Is it -- explicitly that's -- it could help your performance in that market.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. We are not happy, I've said that before, with the performance of Marlboro. I mean, it's just 2% share of market in a market that big and that important like Russia is, of course, disappointing for Marlboro, and we definitely think that Marlboro can do more. There is -- again, there is a marketing challenge. It can be that we have such little volumes for that brand in the markets. We will invest behind. We will build the brand equity, and we want to bring that brand also on a growth trajectory as in so many other markets in the world, in most markets in the world, actually.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sure. And just the last follow-up would be on Spain. In this quarter, you had, obviously, the ups and downs of pricing. And I'm just curious, so you had about a -- it was 10% decline roughly in the category volume in Spain in the quarter. Do you think that weakens a bit just due to the price realization that's now coming through in the fourth quarter? Is that, again, one that could look more like cases that we saw like in Q1 and Q2, where that market was down pretty aggressively?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Yes. I mean, the Q3 market might now be influenced a little bit here and there by retailers loading some competitor volumes ahead of their price increases. So I think you'd best look at the year-to-date one. And the full year estimate is, I don't know, 15%, 18%, something in that range. So yes, it's a continued steep market decline driven by the economic situation there. It will not continue at those rates forever. We will see. We will have to wait now for a new government. We will have to wait for the measures, budgetary measures. I was mentioning VAT. We will see. Whatever the new government will want to do, the price skirmishes that we have had in the market, of course, have so far kind of prevented us to reap the benefits of earlier price increases. Well, I said the skirmishes are over, so at least that benefit should accrue now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg Bank.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: If we could circle back on just the overall EEMA organic profit growth. That accelerated quite noticeably in Q3, 14%; 5%, Q2. How much of that is simply due to PMI slowing up its brand spend back? How much of that is just due to the markets' very strong pricing and volume growth? And then related to do that, is PMI happy with where L&M is in the EEMA region? Or is there still more work to do?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, if you look -- I mean, if you look at the brands there, and now we talk EEMA region as a whole. Then in the third quarter, I see a Parliament growing 15.9%. I see a Marlboro growing 10.2%, and all our premium brands then together by 10.5%. That's pretty good, I would say. If I then look at L&M, which yes, has left -- or has had problems in Russia. But if you take L&M for the EEMA region, it's up 6.1% and on a year-to-date basis, 3.8%. So no, our portfolio is doing pretty well. The negatives, you have a lot of heritage brands. But the future, of course, and the profitability is not in the previously local acquired brands. It's in our international brands in that part of the world. So pretty happy about the overall performance of our portfolio, thanks to Duhair and Gatness [ph].
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: Okay, super. And then following up in slightly more detail on the plain packaging situation in Australia. Is it fair to expect that the Senate does pass both bills in November? And then has PMI selected and started the formation of the arbitration tribunal at this point?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, the vote in the Senate hasn't taken place. We will see when it takes place. As the Health Minister herself has said, it might -- or that probably will lead to a delay in the implementation date. We are, of course, ramping up the legal cases that, as we said, we will vigorously pursue all the avenues, the bilateral investment treaty case but also other avenues, domestic and you name it. So we are, of course, in full swing to be ready for this situation.
Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, circling back on Turkey. It looked like, from news reports, that PMI took basically TRY 2 per pack price increases, more than you needed perhaps in low-price but not enough to pass it through in premium. On a portfolio basis, is PMI roughly whole? Or is there a negative impact from simply not being able to pass through all of the increase in the premium segment, where PMI is very strong?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I think I said earlier, if you have brands at the very lowest end of the market that have an allover need of TRY 0.7, whereas it's TRY 3 around at the premium end, then it's no longer a mathematical exercise and you have to protect your entire brand portfolio, which is what we did. But as I said earlier, I would still hope that there could be a second step in that story later, because the rational arguments are clearly on our side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My first question has to do with the EEMA region and the favorable trade inventory shift that you saw in Saudi Arabia, and if you can offer some more color on that, please.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, Saudi Arabia is an important and very profitable market for us. A year or 2 years ago, we had some share problems there. We are doing well. We have implemented a price increase in the otherwise very, very profitable Saudi Arabia market. So that's really what it is.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just in thinking about FX, and I fully appreciate that it's so hard to know kind of where currencies will go from here. But it might be helpful if you could just give us a reminder, please, from a transaction standpoint where your biggest cross-rate exposures are.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I mean, let me answer it that way. We have a huge basket of currencies that play into the overall results. This year, year-to-date, the currency that is bringing the biggest variance, positive variance, is the yen. Last year, on the total year results, it actually was the Indonesian rupee, i.e. telling you, in none of those years it was actually the euro, although the euro, of course, plays also a role. And then you have emerging market currencies that are also of significance being the ruble, I said the Indonesian rupee, the Turkish lira, the Mexican peso. These are all currencies that go into that basket. So we have a broad basket of those worldwide currencies.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And the exposure to those currencies, it's equivalent on a translation versus a transaction basis? Or do you have an outside -- outsized, excuse me, exposure to one or a small group of them from your assets?
Hermann G. Waldemer: I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, as I said, we run the business on a constant currency basis. And you will not find us ever into any speculative hedges, what I call income hedges. So that's the way we run it: no speculation, and run the business the same way, the proper way if currency is in your favor or if it's temporarily against you.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. My last question has to do with the health of the consumer in the EU. And I'm just curious, as you went through the quarter, did you see any trends that would have reflected kind of deteriorating consumer confidence, accelerating trade down as you worked towards the end of the quarter or anything like that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. Honestly, I mean, all the media coverage that we see these days on Europe, that doesn't have an impact on cigarette consumption. Even declining stock prices on the equity markets don't really change consumption. Steep increases in unemployment will change consumption. Spain was an example of that last year. My own forecast will be that I wouldn't see Europe collapse. It's just a bit too much focus on the European problems at this point in time. It will shift to other parts of the world.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Just on Brazil, I know it's a smaller market for you in Lat Am. But obviously, there's going to be this tax change that's proposed in February. I was wondering whether you got any more details on that and specifically, I guess, whether the change in structure is in some way beneficial for your competitive position in that market. I seem to recall there could be a change there that potentially helps. And then just in Korea, obviously, good share gains there. But I just wanted to confirm that you're still pricing slightly below BAT and JT in that marketplace. I think they're pricing up earlier in the year. And then finally for me, just on cost saves. Obviously, you made the point on the presentation that you're confident of exceeding the current plans this year. I just wondered whether you can give us any kind of indications on what plans might be for next year in terms of whether more cost saving or similar levels of cost saving as you're achieving in 2011.
Hermann G. Waldemer: Okay, Brazil first. Yes, there is a new excise tax law there which should provide a more level playing field over time. It's not immediately. It is phased in over time and that system then would eliminate the -- I only can call it absurd difference in taxation linked to packaging, if the cigarette is in a box or in a soft pack. So yes, a level playing field is always something good for us and beneficial and fairer going forward. Moving over to Korea. As I have said before, I mean, the real challenge in Korea also is to find a multi-year tax plan and tax structure plan in that market, and that actually prevails for us over short-term profitability considerations. And the third one on cost savings. Well, we have had a one-year target, because that keeps an organization focused. You'll see that the focus has paid off. As we expect, it's too early to say for next year. But yes, there will be a target for next year as well. We will talk about that in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to circle back on Russia a little bit. Given the tough volume results in Russia, is there a need to increase investment behind brands in Russia? Or is there a change in the consumer behavior? Can you just address that a little more?
Hermann G. Waldemer: No. I mean, on our side, yes, we want to do more on our brands, because we simply think that we can do better. When you come to -- when we talk about overall volumes that the Russian market has slightly declined last year at about 2%, I would say. For this year, I would expect a little less than 2%. But there is, of course, the consequence also of the fairly frequent price increases that happened in the market. So in that sense, consumers have been forced to upgrade quite a bit because prices over the last 3 years have come up quite a bit at the low end. This would be a combined average growth of the prices in the range of 25%.
Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then as we look into '12, and you've talked about this a little bit on the call, but is there a growing challenge from numerous excise tax increases in different markets? Is it more of a challenge than maybe expected at the beginning of '11 as we looked out to '12? Is there any kind of comment you can give to that?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, excise taxes are a challenge every year. They are the single most important factor playing into our business. We have had a year, 2009, with 2 surprises; '10 with 5 surprises; '11 with 1. And now we have had recently one for Turkey, which will go into 2012. We have managed through those in the previous years, and I really think that we will be able to manage through 2012 as well. Bad news can always happen. However, thanks to our global footprint, we have always been able to balance the unexpected bad with unexpected good. So I think that should be the case going forward as well. That's simply the advantage of such a broad global footprint as we have it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Lamark with Federated Investors.
Karen Lamark - Federated Investors: My questions have been asked.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.
Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News: By Bloomberg's measure of profitability, Philip Morris I think ranks second in the S&P 500. And I know this is kind of a broad question, but how do you keep that rolling? And what's the biggest challenge to that performance?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, I mean, the key, if you like, the bigger picture here and therefore, I mean, going into the future, well then, they start -- what is the starting point here? The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e. we are and will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012, on the key question there, the first one, we have built the financial crisis, triggered an economy crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times. And we have a portfolio to do that in the good and in the bad times, because it covers all price points. The second key question always is will governments make rational excise tax decisions? We believe yes, but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen. But net-net, we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trends there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the big Russian market, I see only a slight decline. In the very big Indonesian market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be -- the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes, that -- and I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick, because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is that you have always to do your homework and keep your cost under control, which is what we are doing. I have elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator. We have generated, over the first 9 months of this year, an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also, our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So -- and the last point, I mentioned it before on the question before, our global footprint always allows you to balance the bad with the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, and we have been working hard to get where we are. And we will keep on working hard to deliver for our shareholders also in the future.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. I now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rolli for any closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you for joining us on today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team here in Lausanne. Thank you very much, and have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2011 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010 unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.  Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter. We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisition surged 16.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 21% above the prior year's level excluding currency. These excellent results can be attributed in particular to the Asia region with Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines all performing very strongly and higher prices in a wide range of markets. During the second quarter, our pricing variance reached $617 million for a total of $1.1 billion during the first half of the year. In the last 3 months, we implemented or announced price increases in markets such as Nigeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia, thus reinforcing our strong pricing momentum. Furthermore, the pricing situation in Spain improved in July. We also have strong overall business momentum. Our share in the second quarter for our top 30 OCI markets was up 2.3 points to 38.5%.  Marlboro had stable volume in the quarter on a global PMI basis as higher volume in the Asia and EEMA regions offset the impact of lower industry volume in the EU and Latin America and Canada regions. The brand share was up for stable in all 4 regions and its global share, excluding China and the U.S.A, grew by 0.4 points to 9.3%. During the second quarter, L&M, our second largest brand, increased its volume by 3.1%, accelerating its growth in the EU region and part of the EEMA region. These results were achieved by strong share growth in a wide range of markets including Egypt, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey.  In light of our excellent results, strong pricing and good share in business momentum going into the second half of the year as well as a more favorable currency outlook at prevailing exchange rates, we announced today a further $0.15 increase in our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011. $0.10 of the increased guidance relate to the business, the improvement being largely attributable to Japan. $0.05 relate to currency which have been noted that exchange rates may still experience some volatility over the balance of the year. The new guidance range is $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5% excluding currency. Our excellent results in the first half and our favorable outlook for the second half of 2011 demonstrate the benefits of our global footprint and highlight our success with attractive acquisitions and organic volume growth over the last 10 years in Asia, the half of the world population lives.  Our strong results in the second quarter reflect the strength of our management teams in these markets and especially in Japan, where I took the calculated risk to commit around $100 million in airfreight when the extent of the additional demand for our brands was still difficult to judge. Our efficient yet flexible global manufacturing footprint and effective market response enabled us to fill the void caused by the shortage of JT and more recently BAT products. In the second quarter, net revenues in the Asia region grew by 27.7% excluding currency and acquisitions and adjusted OCI was 48.2% higher on the same basis. As a result, the region is now our largest contributor to these measures, accounting for 35% and 36%, respectively, of PMI's net revenues and adjusted OCI during the first half of this year. And this contribution is expected to increase further as our business in the region continues to expand. During the second quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 19.5 billion units, up 1.9 billion or 11% compared to the same period last year. This increase was achieved despite the unfavorable impact of the large October 2010 tax-driven price increases and the boost to our shipments that occurred in the second quarter of last year ahead of that increase. Our market share has reached 42%, 17.7% points above the prior year level and 16.4 points above our share in the first quarter of 2011. As we ensured full product availability throughout the period, all our brands gained share and in particular, Lark and Marlboro.  Determining exactly how the rest of the year will pan out remains very difficult due to the complex interaction of multiple factors. These include the impact of the tax-driven price increase in October last year, the consumer and trade's prior year loading and subsequent deloading patterns, the underlying market decline trend, the price of elasticity and whether it will diminish over time, the disruption of JT supplies and shortages of certain BAT products, the precise impact of our efficient response, and our level of smoker share retention once the full range of competitive products are available. The new trend for industry volume and the new base for PMI's future market share growth will not be clear until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest. Our business is also doing very well in Indonesia. Thanks to a strong economy and a favorable comparison with a relatively soft second quarter 2010, industry volume grew an exceptional 13.9% in the second quarter of this year. For the full year, we expect the annual growth rate to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our volume in the quarter was up by 20.7% to 22.6 billion units and our market share grew by 1.6 points to 30.2% with all our Kretek brands gaining or maintaining market share and Marlboro increasing its volume and its share within the wide Cigarette segment despite a reduction in its overall market share. The growing volume, along with continual moderate price increases, is driving strong profitability growth in Asia's second-largest cigarette market after China. In Korea, we continue to achieve strong volume and share growth behind Marlboro and Parliament. Our market share grew by 3.3 points to 19.9% in the quarter with a 1 share point contribution from innovative Marlboro Menthol line extensions. Korea is one of the few key markets worldwide where we have not increased retail prices in the past year in light of the more important need to secure excise tax reform for the long term. PMI's organic volume in the EEMA region declined by 3.4% in the second quarter due primarily to Ukraine. For the full year, we expect our volume to be stable in the region. Net revenues were up 3.6% during Q2 excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was 4.8% higher excluding currency and acquisition driven primarily by increased volumes in Turkey and North Africa, and higher prices across many markets, in particular Russia. This was partly offset by lower volumes in Eastern Europe and additional investments in business building initiatives in Russia. These investments will further boost the momentum of Parliament, Chesterfield and Bond Street in Russia while addressing the issues surrounding Marlboro. These efforts will, however, take some time to have a measurable impact on our market share, which declined by 0.1 point to 25.4% in the second quarter through the end of May due mainly to a temporary price disadvantage to competitive products. At the beginning of this month, we announced to the trade a further price increase of RUB 3 on Marlboro and RUB 2 on average across the rest of our portfolio. Our lowest price in the market will now be RUB 21 a pack for Optima, up 27% from a year ago. These price increases, along with lower disposable incomes as wage increases have failed to keep pace with inflation, are limiting the extent of consumer uptrading. Industry volume meanwhile is expected to decline at an annualized rate of some 2% to 3% this year in line with 2010. Earlier this month, the Russian government approved its tax policy guidelines or TPG for the period 2012 through 2014, including a detailed 3-year excise tax development plan for tobacco products. The TPG foresees that excise taxes will be indexed periodically in line with inflation and economy conditions in Russia. In addition to the excise tax increases already foreseen for January 2012 in the current law, the TPG calls for an additional increase in July 2012 of 8.3% in the specific element to RUB 390 per thousand and 10.9% in the minimum excise tax to RUB 510 per thousand. While the proposed increases are significant, we believe they should be manageable. It should, however, be highlighted that this is the first step in the process and that the plan needs to be submitted to the Duma and the Federation council for approval. The final adoption of the law is not expected to take place until November this year. In Ukraine, the estimated 15% decline in industry volume in the second quarter masks an improving underlying trend as the data is distorted by the heavy trade loading that took place in the same period last year ahead of tax-driven price increases. We expect the market to stabilize during the second half of the year. The Ukrainian market is tending to polarize with the premium and the super-low price segments both expanding while several small manufacturers and illicit trade continue to grow volume. PMI's market share was down 3.5 points in the quarter to 32.1% as we are under-represented in the super-low price segment. We have reduced the price gap between Bond Street and the bottom of the market to address this issue. Meanwhile, both Parliament and Marlboro are performing well and increased their market share during the quarter. Overall, the Turkish market has now stabilized. Our volume grew by 12.1% in the second quarter though it remains below the levels prior to the tax increase of January 2010. Our market share reached 44.6% in the quarter through the end of May, up 3.8 points. This impressive share improvement covers all 3 price segments and is led by Premium Parliament, mid-priced Muratti and low-priced L&M.  Despite the issues that continue to impact Spain and to a lesser extent, Greece, the results in the EU region in the second quarter were more positive from a number of standpoints. Industry volume declined by a modest 1.7% and was actually up in markets such as the Czech Republic, France and Germany. PMI volume was 3.1% lower due to an 8.4% decline in Greece, a 17.6% reduction in Spain, and a decrease of 9.7% in Poland, where we should share [ph] at the lowest and least profitable end of the market. Our key brands, Marlboro and L&M, performed well. Marlboro's regional share was stable at 18.1% and L&M's share grew at the further 0.3 point to 6.6%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. While we are not entirely satisfied with the situation, there are some clear signs for renewed optimism concerning the future contribution of the EU region to PMI's profitability growth going forward. Germany has again become one of the strongest tobacco markets in the EU. During the first half of the year, industry volume was up 1.9% for cigarettes and 4.8% for fine cut. PMI increased its market share by 0.3 and 0.4 points to 35.9% and 14.8%, respectively, during this period. L&M continues to perform very strongly, gaining a further 1 share point in the second quarter to reach a cigarette share of 10.4%. Unit margin-enhancing price increases have been implemented. Our remaining concern is the growth of discounted larger pack sizes while the market share of big packs, defined as 22 to 25 cigarettes per pack, appears to have stabilized the share of maxi packs, that is packs with over 26 cigarettes, continues to increase and may receive a boost from the recent introduction of packs of 40 cigarettes. The Spanish economy continues to suffer from high unemployment levels with few signs of improvement. Consequently, cigarette industry volumes has been contracting at double digit rates, and consumers have been downtrading to cheaper brands and illicit trade products. This is a special context in which price competition was exacerbated in May and June this year. However, recent developments indicate the situation has improved.  Industry volume increased 1.8% in France and was stable in Italy during the second quarter. Our cigarette market share was up slightly in France to 40.9% as the continued growth of the Philip Morris brand also positioned in the Premium segment more than offset the slight decline of Marlboro share. At the same time, following the entry of Marlboro into the category, we also became the market leader in fine cut with a quarterly share of 25%, up 5.6 points. Our market share in Italy was down 0.7 points to 53.4% with Marlboro down 0.3 points. This was attributable to the relative decline of the Premium segment, where PMI has a 95% share. Our profitability, however, continue to improve in both markets with high single-digit increases in the quarter. Furthermore, we recently announced a EUR 0.10 price increase across our portfolio in Italy. After increasing the specific to total [ph] component in its excise tax last December, earlier this month, the Greek government increased the minimum excise tax from 75% to 100% of the excise tax levied on the weighted average price. This implies a pass-on of nearly EUR 0.50 per 20 cigarettes at the very bottom end of the market, where cigarettes retail at EUR 2.40. PMI has announced an increase in the price of its main low-priced brand, L&M 25s, from EUR 3.20 to EUR 3.70 per pack. The reduction in price gaps should help the continued recovery of Marlboro's market share in Greece.  Our volume in the Latin America and Canada region was 4.8% lower in the quarter, driven by a double-digit market contraction in Mexico, following the large tax-driven price increases at the end of last year and by the timing of shipments in Brazil. Despite the challenging pricing environment, our market share in Mexico reached 72.2%, with Marlboro surging 3.8 points to reach a 52% share. Our business in Argentina performed very well with volume growth of over 8% and gains from Marlboro which added 0.6 point to reach a 24% market share. Net revenues for the region increased by 5.8% in the quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions, and adjusted OCI was 8.8% higher on the same basis. On the regulatory front, the main focus remains on plain packaging. Although certain other governments have expressed their opposition to such a measure, the Australian government continues to appear intent on mandating the implementation of plain packaging in 2010 and has submitted a proposed bill to Parliament. Plain packaging will result in the illegal confiscation of our very valuable trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. We have therefore served notice of our intention to file an arbitration claim against the Australian government under the Hong Kong-Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty. We are now in a mandatory 3-month period set aside for negotiation under this procedure. Consequently, we have written to the government seeking a meeting. Strong pricing and very moderate increases in tobacco and non-tobacco material costs as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements resulted in a 2.5 point increase in PMI's adjusted OCI margins, excluding currency and acquisitions during the second quarter.  Our free cash flow increased by $638 million or 19.4% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $402 million or 12.2%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. During the first half of the year, our free cash flow was up more than $1 billion to nearly $6.2 billion.  During the second quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 22.7 million shares at an average price of $68.32. Since the March 2008 spin, we have now repurchased 17.9% of the shares outstanding at that time.  In conclusion, PMI had an excellent quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth reached 21%, excluding currency. Our outlook is promising with strong market share and business momentum. Pricing remains a very strong driver of profitability, with Spain being a special case. We are not under any significant input cost pressures and expect to exceed our annual productivity savings target of $250 million this year. We have increased our 2011 EPS guidance by a further $0.15, bringing it to a range of $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5%, excluding currency. And finally and most importantly, our cash flow continues to grow and be our focus on generously rewarding our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I want to ask you 2 questions. One would be as we're looking at and doing some modeling around the price realization for the year, you talked about being able to sort of beat the level of pricing last year and just hearing some of your comments and some of the recent price increases from Russia to Italy as well as the pricing that came through this quarter, my estimate suggests you're going to pretty meaningfully outpace that unless I'm not factoring maybe some second half factors. Is there anything that we should keep in mind there in relation to the dollar amount of pricing coming through this year?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I would say -- as you say, I mean, if you look at the numbers year-to-date, June, $1.1 billion for the half year versus actually $1.7 billion for the full year of 2010 last year. I think these numbers speak for themselves. You were quoting a number of markets where we recently have implemented or announced price increases. That's correct. At this point of the year, I think it would be inappropriate to go into further details because any comment I would make could be interpreted or linked to a specific market. So bear with me, I think it's better if I stop it there.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sure, understood. And then my follow-up question is to be in relation to Japan. And I'm just trying to get a sense especially in this quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces, I realize, particularly the year ago increase in inventory. But I'm just trying to understand if you get a sense of where you think you stand today in your inventory position in Japan. Is there any rebuilding that needs to occur given the lag you had in volumes versus your in-market consumption this quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I think our inventory levels are okay in the Japanese market. I mean that was really the tremendous effort that we have made now during this period. I mean, congratulations really to our team in Japan, there. They have done a terrific job in difficult times for the country and for our employees there. Also, congratulations to our factories. I mean, 10 factories actually have been involved in the production ramp up. Our factory workers, production workers, actually have put in 200,000 of hours of overtime during the period, and we actually chartered the equivalent of 150 Boeing 747 cargo planes to bring 10 billion cigarettes into the market. So I think we are good from that side. I mean, if you go back to really what happened in the first half of the year, as you said yourself, the full year with all the moving targets that remains to be seen. But if you look at the first half of the year, then well, you look at the total market of 90 billion cigarettes, we had a share of about 25% January, February before the events. We have a year-to-date share of 34%, that's 9 percentage point difference or 90 billion. So I talk about 8 billion cigarettes here. You make your own estimate of the solid margins that we have in Japan. There was the airfreight. There were other costs. You deduct our corporation income tax rate and you'd probably come into the range of a net income impact of $200 million or something like anything in the neighborhood of $0.10 to $0.12 EPS.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Let me ask you a few other things about Japan, Hermann. Can you walk through with us how your in-market share evolved during the second quarter? Presumably it came down in general, correct?
Hermann Waldemer: That's correct. I mean, we would have started really April with a share of about 55%, May 40%, June, 35%, and the very latest I've seen in daily offtake share now, which is not the same basis, but just if you go to a couple of the important c-store chains then I still see shares slightly above 30% as we speak now. But these are not yet what I would call retention shares, that we have to wait a little later into the year.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then beyond having your product available in market, are there any other tactics that you've been employing to try to enhance your prospect of ultimately retaining consumers that are using and trying your products during this period?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, our teams there have really given full support on the distribution side. I mean our sales force they have been in the market day and night so both the sales, the promotion, the logistics departments, they have been working very, very hard. This I don't think is the moment where you need to bother the consumer with new variants. This is the moment that you have to support your broad array of very competitive variants, and we have seen really, as I said in the remarks, real strong growth in all brands but in particular, strong growth in Lark, a more traditional brand, if you like, but also in Marlboro, which is a very aspirational brand in the Japanese markets.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: And on that particular dynamic, are you surprised or are the people in the market surprised that the gains seem to be skewing to Lark? And do you think longer term, Hermann, does that have any implications on the limitations of Marlboro's longer-term share prospects for growth?
Hermann Waldemer: Quite frankly, if I look at what happened, what we have seen during the process, it gives me confidence in the growth prospects of Marlboro in that market.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then on Korea, am I correct, Hermann, that some of your competitors in that market have raised prices 4, 5, 6 weeks ago and to this point, you have not?
Hermann Waldemer: That's correct. I mean, when it comes to pricing, as you know, of course, I will not make comments on the future but I mean let's -- I'll give you some facts here. In that market, you are correct that there were price increases of BAT and JT in April and May. We have also seen the biggest competitor KT&G putting posters into the point of sales, informing their consumers that they will not raise prices. A third point would be that the government -- the Korean government is very concerned about inflation trends and as I was saying before, PMI seeks excise tax reform, a multi-year plan would be much more important. So things are a bit more complicated just to look at first glance. I would say sometimes in life, it's not enough to do the right thing. You also have to do it at the right time.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then, Hermann, one last thing. The arbitration process that you alluded to in Australia with respect to plain packaging, I just want to confirm the fact that, that action on your behalf does not preclude any other subsequent, different type of legal action that you would otherwise have the opportunity to take. Is that correct? It's not an either-or situation. You can ultimately, if necessary, pursue multiple different avenues of redress.
Hermann Waldemer: That is correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just 2 quick follow-ups on Japan and then a question on Russia. So when you think about your guidance increase for the year, about $0.10 coming from Japan, that's basically all of the realization of what you've gotten so far and doesn't assume any of the market share retention going forward, so to the extent that you do get some market share retention, is that an upside in terms of your guidance?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, the $0.10 to $0.12 that I have just explained, I mean that is the first half of the year that is the actuals.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then the way you played out in the quarter, so it looks like you actually capture more than sort of your fair share of the non-Japan Tobacco volume, which I guess you've talked about the BAT product shortage as well. But just in terms of how much you've captured in the second quarter, do you think that was a function of BAT not having as many products in the marketplace or just more brand equity on your brands that allowed you to take more share?
Hermann Waldemer: I would call it the optimal way of seizing a business opportunity which our folks have done and have implemented. I think that's really what it is. But to come back to the beginning of your question, when you look at the overall EPS guidance, then you have to remember that of course, at the very beginning of the year in February, we had a certain assumption in there for our business already in Japan, you remember there was a price increase and everything. And then when it came to the first quarter, we said that about half a year about $0.05 of the increase business guidance, the increase now was due to Japan and now in this quarter's call the majority of the new $0.10 business-driven increase is due to Japan. But not only due to Japan, I would also want to highlight really the terrific performance we have had in Indonesia and also by the way to the fact that if you exclude Spain for a moment, which is a special case by itself, that the total market size in the EU region is stable.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And just in terms of your guidance what are you factoring in, in terms of Spain situation with respect to your guidance at this point?
Hermann Waldemer: Of the Spain situation is of course in. It is again a moving target so as I said, the situation has improved. However, that being said, of course, OCI will still -- there will still be a substantial decline if you compare it to last year. That is factored in.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then can you talk about Russia post the tax increase next year? You talked about it's a significant increase but you see that as manageable. Can you just elaborate on how you think that market will play out in 2012?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I mean, let me start answering your question by looking at the economy because there is one point in there which I think deserves being mentioned particularly. Whilst real disposable income of the people in Russia, still last year was up net of inflation, about 4% is the estimate. Now in the first half of this year, it's actually down. Inflation is ranging between 9% and 10%. Disposable income therefore probably is down about 2%. At the same time, there were a number of price increases in the market. So whilst we have not seen really uptrading to mid and premium segment to the extent people have all expected it, say 8, 9 months ago, at the end of the day from a consumer perspective, they have uptraded. Because as I was saying in the remarks, well, our lowest price brand is now 21 rubles so prices have gone up quite a bit. In that context, we have seen last year an estimate, there is no absolute number, but a good estimate that the market was down about 2.5%. I expect something of the same nature this year and probably also going into next year but we will probably all have a better feel for that once you have seen the second half of this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Roger Fujimori with Crédit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: My first question is on Indonesia. I was just wondering if you could talk about the industry volume outlook for the full year after the exception of 14%-or-so market growth in the Q2, which is well above the historical run rate, was it one 4 [ph], is going to persist in the second half.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. I mean, in Indonesia we of course see the combination of a thriving economy, also a favorable demographics. The year-to-date number for the market is actually -- it's up 8.5%. The second quarter was particularly strong because it's kind of easy comps to the second quarter of 2010. The full year estimates we have right now would be 4% to 6% for the full year of 2011.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: My second question is on the EEMA region. In your comments, you indicated a stable volume outlook in the region for the full year after a 3% decline in Q2, a 1% decline in Q1. Obviously, there was a distortion in Ukraine in the comparison base, but also it's interesting, I guess you can give a little bit more color on the drivers behind the improvement in the second half.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. I mean, it's really the major impact of the Ukraine market there. That market was down quite a bit then. You really had difficult comps to the second quarter also of last year, where the trade ordered way more at the time because it was -- this was before the subsequent price increase, retail price increases in the market. So this is why I said that I expect already for the Ukraine kind of a stabilizing or a stable market almost in the second half that helps overall. And the other part would be that we are, despite the suspension of our business in Libya, we are also seeing volume growth in North Africa. And thirdly, I think we really have tremendous share performance in the Turkish market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Quick question on pricing, just to follow up. Given the strength of your pricing realization seemingly including and excluding Japan just relative to your going in estimates for the full year, were there any markets in particular where you were presently surprised by your ability to pass on price or to the price elasticity that you were seeing in certain markets?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, we have never any doubt that our pricing plans and expectations that we have put into our guidance from the very beginning, were realistic expectations. Then when you go into the year, well , it always depends on the market-per-market situation. This is government and budgetary expectations. This is the competitive situation as we judge it. And so we take our decisions on our market-by-market basis and as the actual results have shown, we have been very successful in there.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Just to be sure. In terms of Spain, it seems as if the pricing activity that you're seeing from your competitors has subsided somewhat but we did see some more price cuts, I think, from one of your competitors on Monday. Have you guys announced any response to that?
Hermann Waldemer: No, we have not.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Is it your expectation that the pricing movements will continue to subside in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: I will not comment on future pricing. I'm sorry.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I just had a question about Marlboro, and if you could provide us an update on any new initiatives on this brand of the franchise that you might have implemented or will be implementing in the market regarding any new line extensions or packaging styles?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, there are many, many activities within the new Marlboro architecture whilst you will have seen one or the other variant there already in a market, that doesn't mean that the potential for rollout of innovation on Marlboro is already exhausted. To the contrary, there are many more possibilities to continue to successfull rollout of the Marlboro architecture and positive trends in many, many markets are a testament to this. A terrific success on several of the menthol variants, in particular in Asia, are probably a highlight in that context.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And if you compare sort of what's in the market or what you put into the market during the first half of this year versus what you're expecting to put into the marketplace, will you have increased activity here in the second half?
Hermann Waldemer: No, that's a permanent activity throughout the year. We don't time that except that you probably don't do a new launch when everybody in the market is in the holiday period, that you will not do. But otherwise it's spread over the year.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, and then with regards to the EU, you mentioned you're seeing some signs of stabilization as it relates to the down trading pressure that's occurring throughout the key markets. Could you talk a little bit more in depth on your strategy to mitigate this down trading in some of these key European markets? Is it, for instance, strictly a function of narrowing the price gap? Are there other initiatives that you have implemented to possibly help prevent some of this from occurring?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, preventing from occurring, that is essentially related to tax structure that is then very often the question of how much -- how high this specific element is vis-a-vis the lower element and the minimum excise tax. The best news of the quarter there, I believe, came out of Greece. There we had a very substantial increase of the minimum excise tax. So I said before $0.50 a, rollover need, essentially at the very bottom of the market so it's always that. On the other hand, in many other European markets where the price gaps are not that large, there are always exceptions but in general, not that large so it's also about being competitive. At the lower end, that is pretty much the success of the brand L&M in the European union region, which, by the way, is the #2 brand in the region, and you know who was the #1 brand.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Two question. Firstly on Libya, and forgive me if you've disclosed this. Did you tell us how much the -- what was the impact from the disruption there on sticks?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, Libya is simply the point that we, of course, suspended our business immediately when the suspensions came into place. So year-to-date compared to last year, that is almost 1 billion cigarettes. Nevertheless, if you take a total of North Africa together, we are growing volume in the area but of course we have no volumes in Libya.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just on Japan, you were very clear about the profit impact from the Japan factors in the quarter and I believe you've indicated that there was a bit of a boost in the pricing variants. Can you tell us how much -- of your $617 million came from that benefit of the country mix in the quarter, would it be in that number?
Hermann Waldemer: It will, of course, be part of that number but I will not single out the number for Japan only. That I cannot do.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: I was wondering if you could come back to the European Union first, where it looks like the volume dynamic is very encouraging. Could you talk -- give us more color about what's happening in places like France and Italy and why we're seeing actually volume growth?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, I mean, I would say let's go to 3 of the really big and important markets in the EU region, being Germany, France and Italy. And let's use year-to-date numbers, I mean Germany is up 2%, France is up 1% and Italy is stable or a little bit up 0.2% so that is, of course, a positive sign. We have decent tax structures in place. Improvement needs maybe in some, but overall, it leaves the effect of minimum excise tax systems are in place. We have had no disruptive excise tax increases. We have had price increases in all of those markets and nevertheless, we see a much improved trend to what we have seen before. So those are 3 examples. That's why really the total EU number is somewhat distorted really by the Spanish effect.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: And so in terms of consumer behavior, it's simply that people, if let alone, are happy to continue consumer -- I mean, is that something then that we, I think, can rely on going forward in your view?
Hermann Waldemer: I can't predict the future but it's good trends. It looks good because in Germany I gave you the number on manufactured cigarettes. At the same time, all year round, make your own is also up so overall consumption is up. It's not just not a move between the categories. It's more than that.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: Well, could you give us a bit more color on Poland? I mean it looks varied. Are we seeing something happen there like in Ukraine where the market is polarizing with an increase in the super-low? And what does that imply for an eventual increase in Polish profitability?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I would not compare it to the polarization situation. In the Ukraine, it's different. On one hand, we see clear uptrading trends in the Polish market where our premium brands, Marlboro, but also L&M, really benefit from. At the same time you have very intense price promotions at the very bottom of the market and that's probably what's driving the growth there.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: And then in terms of Russia, have you seen competitors follow your price increases?
Hermann Waldemer: We have had recent reports from sales force which has seen packs of new prices from BAT in retail outlets with increases that seem to be comparable to the ones we have implemented.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: But not Japan's Tobacco International?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, also.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: And then finally, on Turkey, that also appears to be a market that has renewed momentum. How do you see the market volumes evolving over the next rest of the year and then into 2012?
Hermann Waldemer: I mean the Turkish market really has taken a severe hit at the time of the excise and price increases that the market has seen. Turkey, typically, is a market that comes out of crisis quicker than others. That's actually, I would say, is valid for the entire economy and not only for the cigarette business. That's what we see again. It's improving there. Now what's still needed is, of course -- some work on the excise tax structure in there, and the ad valorem element is what I would call overproportional. But overall, we look into a more positive situation in Turkey definitely than what we have seen the year before.
Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank: And so the impact of the public place smoking ban appears to be, if it ever had an impact, that's also waiting? Is that fair?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, that is included in the total numbers, of course, so this is also at max a onetime short-term impact but then you return to the overall underlying trends of the market.
Operator: And next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC: I would be interested in your comments on projected overall volume growth rate for the emerging markets over the next 3 to 5 years. Is there any change there to your thought process?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, really, a percentage number, I don't think I can give that. But let me try to answer your question as good as possible at this point in time. I mean, the biggest market in there, clearly, is Indonesia. And that today is already the second biggest market in Asia after China. The 2 other markets in the world that would be bigger than Indonesia would be Russia and the U.S. and then it would be #4 in the world. So it's an important market. The economy is doing well. Demographics are favorable. I think we have a good chance to believe that this market is going to continue to grow. The same, I think, would apply to the Philippine market. I would say really same conclusions that, to our same underlying reasons for growth that I have just quoted in Indonesia, when it comes to mature markets, when it comes to Japan, well there, you need to give me more time to answer that question before the disruption that we have gone through right now.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC: And then if I could just ask one more about the distribution you all have with China, any updates there in terms of volume or change in arrangements?
Hermann Waldemer: No. No change in the underlying arrangements. There's no need for a change in the underlying arrangements. We are very happy with it. It is, as you know, Marlboro production under license in 2 of the CNTC factories in China, albeit if today very limited volumes and it is on the international side, our international joint venture. So cooperation is going well. I believe both partners are happy with the development but nothing really new, new that I would have to report.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next question comes from Karen Lamark of Federated Investors.
Karen Lamark - Federated Investors: I've got a couple of questions. Going back to Japan, I want to make sure I understand your expectations around competitive restocking. Is it in Q3, you would expect both JTI and BAT to be fully restocked in terms of breadth and depths or not till Q4?
Hermann Waldemer: The full restocking and the availability of all products, i.e. all the competitive products as well is kind of as of now.
Karen Lamark - Federated Investors: And then separately, in light of competitive payout ratios and your strong cash flow, I just wondered under what conditions you might consider increasing your payout ratio? And if you have any kind of time frame under which you might consider that.
Hermann Waldemer: I think 65% payout ratio is a very good ratio and, quite frankly, I don't see a reason why that would need to change. In the international context, that's a very competitive payout ratio.
Operator: Our final question comes from Graham Tanaka of Tanaka Capital Management.
Graham Tanaka - Tanaka Capital Management: I just wanted to ask about the price gap in general and your comfort level where you are. I know there are so many markets and so many different dynamics. But in general, how much of a cushion or comfort level do you have in the price gap, at the low end especially?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, we want to get the price gaps right. We don't want cushions in there, we just want to get them right. In many places around the world, I think they are right. In some cases, they need correction. The best way to correct is, typically, via excise tax structure, i.e. in particular, via the tool of minimum tax because it's not only us who don't like down trading, it's also the governments that don't like down trading, be it the finance minister or be it the health minister as well.
Graham Tanaka - Tanaka Capital Management: So of what proportion of the markets do you think made you less comfortable with the price gaps?
Hermann Waldemer: The vast majority of our markets. We have addressed that problem long before and we are in pretty good shape. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to generate the pricing variances that we are generating.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will turn the floor back to Nick Rolli for closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much for joining us today on this call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team here at Lausanne. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2011 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we’ll be talking about results for the first quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010, unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for this purposes of the -- of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines.  Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our web site. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, our Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter most notably, an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4% excluding currency. The events in Japan and North Africa while distressing, only resulted in temporary logistical disruptions for our company and did not have a material financial impact on our overall results in the quarter. Thus, again, emphasizing the advantages of our businesses truly global footprint. As reflected early February, our organic volume performance was dampened by anticipated softness in Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine, as well as by the events in North Africa. Indeed, these markets collectively soften the volume erosion of 8.4 billion units or 18.5%. All other markets contributing slightly more than 80% of our volume base grew their combined volume at an organic rate of 1%. I am delighted to announce that we are increasing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011 by $0.20 to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010. This corresponds to an increase of approximately 17.5% to 20% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 12.5% to 15%, excluding currency. $0.10 or half the increased guidance are attributable to more favorable prevailing exchange rates. The other $0.10 are attributable to an improved business outlook in several markets, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, partly offset as some additional investments in marketing and sales in slightly more conservative pricing assumptions. As you are all aware, Japan Tobacco is facing significant supply disruptions as a result of the tragic events in its home market. It is our understanding that food supply will gradually be in place within the next few weeks. We, in turn, have taken all necessary measures to ensure that we have sufficient in market inventories to supply the market and fill the anticipated temporary vacuum that is likely to occur. While we have certainly witnessed a moderate lift to our in market sales in the last few weeks, you should know that there are still competitive products available for sale in numerous retail accounts. And accordingly, it is proving difficult to go up to full extent of the likely uplift in sales. As retail stocks of our principal competitor's product disappear, we will be in a better position to determine such levels. We anticipate that the second quarter will prove critical in this regard. It will allow us to have a much better read on total consumption levels and whether or not, and to what extent consumers will return to their prior brand of choice. At this point, we face significant uncertainty. But rest assured, that all actions are in place to optimize our entire supply chain. We have a positive momentum in the Japanese market but our share increased by 1.4 points to 25.6% in the first quarter of this year, driven by the success of consumer element innovative Marlboro line extensions.  Our slightly more conservative pricing assumptions are attributable to the continued economic difficulties in consumer affordability issues in such markets as Greece, Spain and Ukraine, and the need to react to certain competitive price moves such as selective tax absorption and repositioning, price discounting and delays in the implementation of tax driven price increases. Pricing will nevertheless remain the key driver of profitability growth at PMI, and our pricing variants in 2011 is expected to surpass the level achieved last year. Overall, our competitiveness is strong and our business is in good shape. This is notably demonstrated by the results during the first quarter in our Asia region. Volume was up 14% in the quarter and on an organic basis it was down just 1.7%. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in the Asia region, with volume up 0.7% overall and by 5.5%, excluding Japan. During the first quarter, we achieved volume and share gains in the key markets of Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. In Indonesia, we expect industry volume to grow by around 4% this year despite the potential unfavorable impact of higher food prices on consumer disposable income. Our technical entry last year into the low price segment in several regions has enabled us to start to grow market share again. In Korea, we achieved a record market share of 17.8% in the first quarter. With both Marlboro and Parliament driving our success. In the Philippines, we expect the industry volume this year will be broadly in line with last year following tax driven price increases in January this year. Both Marlboro and Fortune are gaining share in this promising market, and we are making good progress in realizing our brand synergy savings. Our financial results in the Asia region were excellent, as net revenues up by 11.6% and adjusted OCI by 34%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. The other market in the Asia region that has been in the news recently is Australia that the government has released an exposure draft of its Plain Packaging Bill, which would mandate Plain Packaging in 2012. It has opened the consultation period on the matter through June 6. PMI is firmly opposed to such emission as there is no credible evidence that it will achieve any reduction in smoking rates and the government has ignored the fact that it may actually be counter protective to public health. Plain Packaging will lead to price erosion over time and will further encourage the growth of illicit trade, which already increased in Australia by over 25% in 2010 according to a recent Deloyed [ph] study. Plain Packaging will also result in the illegal confiscation of our trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. Unlike other governments which have focused on establishing whether there is evidence to demonstrate that plain packaging would have public health benefits taking into consideration issues such as competition, trade and legal implication as well as the likely impact on illicit trade. The Australian government seems to be forging ahead without due consideration of any of these important issues. PMI will take all measures it deems appropriate, including recourse to the courts if necessary to oppose the Australian government proposal. Our overall performance was also very good in the Latin America and Canada region despite the significant impact on volume of the disruptively large excess tax increase that occurred in January in Mexico. Industry volume in Mexico during the first quarter was down by 27%, though the underlying decline is estimated to have been about 14%. Marlboro and Benson & Hedges have remained resilient, with Marlboro reaching a quarterly market share of 50.3%, up 1.6 share points. Across the region, Marlboro has been performing strongly with markets share gains in all key markets. On a regional basis, strong pricing of over 15.7% increase in adjusted OCI and a 1.9 point improvement in adjusted OCI margin, both excluding currency. While the economies of most emerging markets have now almost fully recovered, those of Southern Europe remained depressed with unemployment still continuing to climb, most notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Industry volume was down by 25% in the first quarter in Spain, as the situation was exacerbated by the introduction of a total indoor smoking ban, tax driven price increases, a reduction in trade inventories and a sharp increase in contraband off a low base. For the full year, the industry volume in Spain is forecasted to decline by around 15% and consumer down trading is expected to continue. It is worth noting that competitors have introduced or repositioned plants below the kick-in level of the minimum excise tax and have, thus, not rolled over the full effects of the most recent excise tax increase. Greece continued to be a drag on PMI results in the first quarter, with industry volume down 10%, consumer down trading due to a large price gaps and a difficult comparison as this market was not impacted by a large tax increases until the second quarter of last year. While there have been recently structural improvements in the excise tax system, one crucial reform remains to be introduced, an effective minimum excise tax. In addition, a highest specific-to-total tax ratio would also benefit government revenues. Excluding just Spain, industry volume in the EU region in the first quarter was down 2.5%, in line with a longer-term consumption decline trends. PMI net revenues in the EU region were down 3.5% and adjusted OCI by 2.3% in the first quarter, both excluding currency. This was driven by the lower industry volume and the decline of 0.4 share points on a regional basis. We expect our performance in the EU region to be helped this year by structural excise tax improvements implemented by governments in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.K. following the new and improved EU excise tax directive that will be enforced through 2018. In addition, both Germany and the Czech Republic has implemented multi-year excise tax programs calling for regular reasonable increases. The first step in the German tax increase program will take place this May. PMI has announced a €0.20 per pack of 19 cigarettes price increase across its portfolio while the pure pass on require €0.04 for Marlboro and €0.11 for L&M. This will be a benefit to profitability in the German market and our decision to eventually follow competitive moves by also offering discounts on large excises enabled us to regain 0.5 share points in the first quarter to 35.7%. Thanks to the continued stellar performance of L&M and a stable Marlboro share. In parallel, we increased our share in the important German fine cut market by 0.9 points to 14.9%. In both Italy and France, industry volume was stable in the first quarter. In Italy, Marlboro has been performing well. Its quarterly share was down just 0.1% to 2.5%. And more importantly, it's share amongst young adult smokers or YAS defined as legal age minimum 18- to 24-year-olds has been growing again following the launch of Marlboro Gold Touch and remains well above about its market share.  In France, a slightly improved market share performance has been driven by the continued growth of the premium priced Philip Morris brand, who's quarterly share grew a further 0.6 points to 8.2% and the brand YAS share has reached 16%. More generally, we have witnessed greater resilience of Marlboro across the EU region with share of just 0.1 point in the quarter at 17.8% and notable gains in Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. And a strong momentum continued to further 0.2 share point gain to 6.1%, driven not only by Germany but also by Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. Our volume in the EEMA region decreased by 0.8%, driven by the continued industry decline and low and share losses in Ukraine, as well as some temporary logistical disruptions in North Africa, partly offset by favorable comparisons in Romania and Turkey where the large excess tax increases in January 2010 but none this year. Premium brands accounted for more than 40% of our regional volume for the first time since the last quarter of 2008 with increased volumes for both Marlboro and Parliament. The Russian market was influenced in the first quarter by the impact of rampant food price inflation, resulting from last summer's heat wave and drought as well as by cigarette price increases. For the full year, we are forecasting industry volume will decline moderately and consumer up trading may be more modest than originally expected. Our volume declined by 0.8% in the quarter and a 25.5%. Our 2011 quarter on share was up compared with the fourth quarter, but down 0.2 share points year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of the implementation of tax driven price increases as well as increased price gaps at the bottom of the market.  In Ukraine, we have observed the market contraction and the greater polarization with growth in the premium and super low price segments. PMI is underrepresented in the latter, and consequently, we lost 3.6 share points through the end of February compared to the same period in 2010. We have started to address the share issue by strengthening on schedule. The Turkish economy has been performing very strongly. During the first quarter of this year, industry volume in Turkey was down by a modest 2.1% compared to last year, and the market was significantly impacted by large tax driven price increases. Our volume increased by 10.4%, driven by Parliament, Merit and L&M.  Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the EEMA region were down by 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, both excluding currency. However, also excluding the tax price influence in Q1 2010, adjusted OCI would have grown at a double-digit range.  Our good share momentum continues. In the first quarter this year, our share in our top 30 OCI markets increased by 0.5 points to 35.8%. Our market share momentum supported by the strong performance of our two key premium brands: Marlboro and Parliament. Marlboro volume declined by 2.9% in the quarter, driven by the specific issues I mentioned about Japan, Mexico and Spain. In all the other markets together, Marlboro volume was up 0.5% in the quarter and the brands global market share trends continues to improve. While many consumer goods sectors are being impacted by significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we are expecting stable U.S. dollar prices for the 2011 tobacco leaf growth, driven mainly by a larger crop in Brazil. Direct material prices are also stable so far this year despite higher energy costs. For the full year, we expect manufacturing costs to increase probably in line with inflation, partly offset by our $250 million annual productivity and cost reduction target, which we are fully on track to achieve. Strong pricing, most notably in Japan, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in an increase of 2.2 points during the first quarter in PMI's adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our free cash flow increased by 22.6% in the quarter to $2.2 billion, and by 21.1%, excluding currency, driven by higher net earnings, lower pension contributions and lower cash exit costs. We continue to focus on reducing inventory levels, though it should be noted that year-end working capital requirements remain subject to the level of tax price increases and our success in convincing elements around the world to implement strict forestalling regulations. During the first quarter, we spent some $1.36 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares at an average price of $61.21. We continue to expect to spend about $5 billion in total this year on share repurchases. In summary, our results this year so far has been very strong and our business outlook is favorable, though the positive impact of Japan is difficult to measure at this time. We will increase our investment behind our portfolio of leading brands and are being slightly more conservative on our pricing assumptions to ensure that we remain competitive in our key markets. We have raised our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $4.55 to $4.65 to reflect our positive business momentum and more favorable exchange rates, and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to generously reward our shareholders. Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Nicholas Rolli: Operator, can we take questions please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: First, in Japan, So I think you said total cigarette market was down 16.4% in the first quarter. So it looks like that's coming -- that is in the 20% decline that I think you projected at the outset of the year, and it also implies that March was even better than the run rate in January and February. So have you seen any changes to just the underlying demand decline post the earthquake? And then what are you assuming for the market decline as a whole for 2011 at this point?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Yes, we have previously assumed and annualized the 20% decline annualized, i.e. October last year to September of this year. Your number on the year-to-date actual 16.4% is correct. I think we better look at the year-to-date February number, which is 17.1, 17.5 percentage points down because there has been already some consumer hoarding of product in March [indiscernible]. But yes, there is of course an improvement over all. From thereon, of course, what is going to be the effect of the tragic events itself that's very hard to predict. But let's put it this way, we don't see accreting in the market.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of your assumptions that’s embedded in your guidance as it relates to any market share gains that you might experience as a result of Japan Tobacco's disruption. At this point, given it's difficult to gauge, are you embedding any upside in terms of the market share situation in Japan?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, I'll give you the elements. But let me say in general first, that, of course, there are scenarios possible, and of course, scenario plannings. We have not taken the most conservative one. We have not taken the most bullish scenario that you could take. We kind of went into the -- some middle ground, and that is a net-net means for the past half of the increased business guidance is attributable to Japan. Now let me give you a little bit the elements there which go into, which at the same time make it so hard to give a clear cut on. So but I'll try to do my best to describe the situation. I mean, yes, year-to-date share, we said that's up to 1.4 to 25.6%. In March itself, the share was up 2.9 points to 26.5%. So essentially, it looks like we cover more than 60% of JP's temporary losses of there, but now of course to estimate today what the retention level is going to be thereafter is impossible to predict now. I would say only one thing, I would expect it to be lower given the market Japan, given the Japanese consumer than it would be otherwise in another market somewhere in the world. And then when it comes to the potential volume benefits of that disruption, well, of course, the first question mark is how long is the disruption going to last. So how many of the SKUs will come, how quickly back into the markets, actually how efficient JP can be with the replenishment of the product pipeline, then we have seen -- we have mentioned that in the prepared remarks that we have fairly high retail stocks out there, higher than what we originally have thought. So consumers who are searching for their brand. So when that comes together, of course, what we made sure already in the first year for the March, but mostly now in the second quarter. Then of course we have the products available in the Japanese markets, but the shipment number that you see is of course only the number essentially driving of course the financials of shipments from our factories to our importer that is not the number of in market sales or even of consumer uptick. So all that together, these are the elements and that gave us the conclusion I mentioned it at the very beginning and that leads to net result of about half of the increased business guidance is assumed to be attributable to Japan.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just your commentary about taking a little bit more conservative pricing assumption and then more investments behind your brand. Is this a little bit of a different posture just in terms of the last 2 or 3 years where you’ve really focus on more on getting the pricing utilization at the expense of volume? And it is there a little bit more urgency at this point to make sure that you're getting some of that volume back or the volume decline to show some moderation in some of these more challenging markets?
Hermann Waldemer: No. I mean the first and most important points to say yet again is that we continue to expect that our pricing variance 2011 is going to exceed the pricing variance of 2010. Already there, I think, tells you a lot. Also in our general approach, they know me saying that the earnings per share are more important than cigarettes per share for the shareholder. Also that conviction has not changed. The thing simply is I have been discussing and reporting on skirmishes here and there already in the past, and we see a little more of those connected brand repositionings and other technical moves. And to those, you simply then have to respond and we have to protect your competitive position. I'll give you one example, maybe if you look to Russia where we had announced the price increase in December, wherein the market with new prices in January. Other competitors have made public, their decisions, later on. And still today, kind of we see now the last competitor coming into the market with new prices right now in April after an announcement in January. This is the type of thing.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: All right. Okay. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Two things I wanted to ask you. Two different markets. First, in Russia, there's been some chatter in the press from different politicians about the prospect of a fairly substantial multi-year excise tax increase in that market. What's your read on what's really happening and what's likely to happen once you get beyond 2011?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Well, the discussion essentially has started for final tax decisions for January 2012. As you know, there is an existing law in place that brings the ad valorem rate as of January 1, 2012, from 7% to 7.5% and specific from 280 RUB to 360 RUB. That is a 30% increase of a specific component, and the discussion that was very much in the media was to double the increase of its specific component eventually from 30% to 60%. So it is the start of a discussion, final decisions, I would not expect them before the end of the year, October, probably even November of this year. This has been -- this would have finalized, but what you hear there in the press is by no means final.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then, Hermann, I wanted to ask you -- Australia with respect to Plain Packaging, can you give us some sense of the relative strength of your arguments with respect to x appropriation intellectual property, the confiscation of your business if they do implement Plain Packaging in that market versus the strength or the relative strength of the legal arguments in your defense that you could bring forward in other developed markets if other markets were to pursue similar types of legislation.
Hermann Waldemer: Well, let me describe a little bit the situation there. I mean for understandable reasons, I would not want to go into the legal strategy here, but I can give the parameters. So it's not only Australia. It's also the U.K. that go through a consultation period right now. The difference being that in Australia, it's a consultation on a draft legislation whereas in the U.K., it's a matter of concept. In Australia, the government appears to be predetermined. In the U.K., this all appears to be following a normal regular process. In terms of now expropriation of trademarks confiscations of our business, you raise one of the three critical facts that governments must look at and that also Australia must look at because there are, of course, litigation possibilities both under Australian law and under Australia's obligations under international treaties and laws. So those are the 2 avenues. That litigation situation and the leading situation has actually not changed compared to the time when Australia itself and also the U.K. before had been looking at the situation. And in both cases both in Australia and the U.K. the head comes to the conclusion not to implement the measure. So you would think still that whether is no change in facts, but also should be no change in outcomes. So much of the background, but please bear with me it would not be wise to go into discussion of the legal strategy itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fell with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: I have two things as well. First of all, a quick one. Was there any trade loading in Germany in advance of the tax increase in EU? And secondly, you referred to -- to invest more in your brands and marketing, are there any particular regions or countries where you think there's a need to not just spend versus what it is now?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. In Germany, well, it definitely remains to be seen. Certainly, we've seen all ready now some uptick in consumer purchases but you refer to trade. Well, we will have to see what individual competitors have done, i.e. what their respective stocks of old tax, old price volumes will be. That's -- I don't know. We will have to see what the outcome there is.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: But nothing that impacted you abnormally in the first quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: No, not in the first quarter. No. Actually if there is something, it is probably within the second quarter and will have washed out by the end of the second quarter. And your second question on investments, well, this is very, very specific and we talk about individual, large markets where we see consumer response and will immediate return. So it's not just spreading a little bit more money over there.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Are there any particular regions where you see those opportunities? Or are they are really sort of global but individual as well?
Hermann Waldemer: You would look at probably at the Asia and the EEMA region where there is going to be bigger growth potential of course.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: My question for you -- or two questions for you. Firstly, you talked about half of the increased business guidance outlook coming from Japan. I'm wondering if you can elaborate perhaps on where the other half of that business outlook is coming from.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. The other half would be a series of markets. Some example's here. Yes, the first one Germany. You heard about the price. You also heard about the improved share performance. Another one would be Turkey, where turkey has come fairly quickly out of the crisis they were in last year and market size declined of 2% only in the first quarter is a good sign in our share performance. It's really doing -- we are really doing well in the market again, thanks to a complete portfolio. So we are doing pretty well there in terms of shares. Mexico, well, we had expected decline there, a market reaction. If you're kind of take out of the 27% decline in that market in the first quarter, if you take out really the trade load effect over year end and if you take out also additional cylinders that you have in this quarter compared to last year, then you're either in the 14%, or say, in the 13% to 15%. But that's better and the second good news in Mexico really is that the premium segment is holding on very well. You see a Marlboro share is growing. Premium is holding on better than the low end. So no down trading in the market. That's good news as well. Indonesia, we're already doing well share performance, pricing we have implemented market size growth fairly nicely. France, good news essentially a stable market and now improved share performance as well. Holland will be another example of very solid share performance. So it's in a number of places...
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, so it sounds like rather than just better than expected performance in the first quarter, there's some sustainable reasons for your outlook in a number of markets for the rest of the year.
Hermann Waldemer: Absolutely.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, and my second question really has to do with Romania. Just because you called out the market as seeing reduced illicit trade. And I'm wondering how that’s being accomplished successfully. Is that sustainable and are there other regions that could follow suit?
Hermann Waldemer: The other situations in terms of illicit trade has improved quite a bit. This ones been about 30%. I would say this is probably has gone down in the range of 10 percentage points. Well, let's put it this way, it is always a sequence of 2 things, first, you need to attract the attention of everyone including the governments, which we did in Romania, which is well [ph] other places as well. We'll take Canada that was another example that you first need to get their attention and then you need the willingness of government to put enforcement behind. And we have seen that in both countries as well again both Romania and Canada. So it's the 2 elements.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on pricing. You did talk about Russia as an example where there’s some repositioning of competitive brands, and that perhaps might lead to some more conservative pricing on the aggregate. But I'm wondering if it's really quite isolated to Russia or any other markets where you feel this is necessary rather than a broad statement of product positioning in pricing around the world.
Hermann Waldemer: No. It's a little bit more skirmishes, as I said, in selective repositionings and other tactics, Russia was one example. I give you another one, I mean in Spain -- you see I mean -- the minimum tax kick in is at EUR 3.66 and we have prices in the market at EUR 3.40 and EUR 3.35 even. So there is a year absorption of the last tax increase. So that's just another example or remember the one that we have been discussing earlier which was the discounting on the big and so called maxi packs in the German market. So it is hidden there. It is skirmishes here and there. But again, really look at our first quarter pricing variance which is very strong and all set of statement that the sum of the pricing variance 2011 is going to be greater than the one of 2010.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: That’s very helpful, Hermann. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I had two questions for you to follow up on Japan. Not to continue harping on that, but I wonder, just curious you gave a number at a presentation, I think it was you, that about some amount of product you have in the market, I think it was $10 billion sticks sort of in Japan, and I wondered if there was, I think, that number. So I guess, I'm curious you have a long lead time to get a product into that market. Has there been a quicker draw down because of the consumer response, are you able to keep up with the inventory needs in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, we are keeping up with the inventory needs. Yes, sir. I mean, our effort is coming out of the European factories, you are correct. By ship, that's a long way. By the air freight, it's quicker. And we have to take a recourse to air freight in order to get some volume in.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then I wondered if there was any potential to spend a little more heavily in Japan perhaps to use some of the benefit or windfall, whatever you want to call it, to try and sustain some of this market share. Is that part of your thinking for the remainder of the year for what you could do in Japan to potentially hold onto some of this market share?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes. But I mean, Japan, of course, in terms of spending overall already before any of that happened is one of our focused markets in there as I was just illustrating the air freight that is also cost some additional costs. If you simply have due to the situation there this is distribution and logistical costs. We will certainly also do everything we can in terms of brand support as we saw our shares are developing very, very nicely. However, really, I think, the Japanese situation, with the country in trouble, believes to different average behavior of a consumer then it would be the case elsewhere. So I believe that the retention levels probably will be lower and there will be in another country? To what extent? Some of them, of course, we will be able to return I would think. To what extent, that today is just impossible to say.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, and then just one follow-up for you and that's on the premium segment in general. In particular, I was looking at Russia where Marlboro’s down and you clearly outlined a few factors that could be leading to that as some of your competitors have not passed along some of the price increase. But just generally across the premium segment, I saw a good performance overall on the Parliament brand for you and Marlboro itself has had a few troubled market. It looks like it's doing quite well. Would you characterize this is being still serving up trading market you're still seeing broadly across your business?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, I would say -- I mean, if you -- now going beyond Russia and talking about a worldwide picture, then yes. Since if you go back to say probably middle of 2008, i.e. before any of the crisis hits and you compare it to today, then you would have seen a shift -- from a very moderate shift maybe 1% to 2% from premium and mid to the low ends. Now talking total worldwide volumes for half range. But actually if you would look at that more recently, say, over the last three to six months, then you would have a slowdown or even a stoppage of that effect, and I believe we are at the point there now where there's improved economies around the world. Our premium portfolio will serve us very, very well. It’s just there are still a couple of markets out there, the known ones, where like in southern Europe where the situation is still difficult, but overall, I clearly see a return to our trading over time.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank so much for your time.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: A couple of questions. First of all, just on the Western and the Canada region, can you give us a bit more detail about why profitability is so strong, given that Mexico is -- volumes are so heavily down -- Mexico is by far, your biggest profit center there.
Hermann Waldemer: Well, Mexico is a very profitable market and the price increase has helped. So that is certainly a good part of the reason for the strong performance. It's not only Mexico, it is also the profitable markets in that region, take Canada where you had again an increase in development market size or you take Argentina where we continue a stellar performance and I'll audit the market share essentially in the range of three quarters of the market. So there are others, but Mexico is an important.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: So Mexican profits are still well off despite the volume decline?
Hermann Waldemer: Say it again. So Mexico...
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: So Mexican profits are still well off despite the volume decline?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, they are [indiscernible] by the price increase.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, and going back to Russia, I mean, as you pointed out the volume declines of Marlboro and L&M are noticeable is that due to the actual segments that premium and the mix price of the L&M being down or is that more of a brand-specific decline? And if it is brand specific, particularly if L&M, clearly we launched that a couple of years ago. What's the next step trying to stop Winston?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, of course, you're referring to delayed increases of tax driven price increases before so it's easy to grow share at the level of price. Going back now to the portfolio itself to our portfolio. In the premium segment, let me remind you that actually Parliament in Russia is a bigger brand than Marlboro, actually also with much higher margins than Marlboro and Parliament is doing very, very well. Marlboro itself, yes, to be self-critical here, yes, we need to do more work on the brand Marlboro in the Russian market, and we have plans in order to strengthen the brand going forward into this year. From there you go to Chesterfield which is a strong, higher- and medium-price brand. L&M which had suffered over the last couple of years, that too. That is not an easy situation and then you go to the next one to Bond Street that we have had tremendous increases, i.e. we have the best target train international low-price brand in the market. And then if you go further down, actually as we speak, there is now a lot of price competition going on at a very low end, which is also very low margin and at that time the trends like Java [ph] and others which are at very low prices.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: But it sounds like the decline there is from L&M. This brand relative in sort of segments specific, and it's like -- given we launched L&M a couple of years ago is there anything more that you can do?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, I was mentioning -- I was saying that yes, we have to work on L&M to do, we have work to do on Marlboro to do, but then it goes to segments then the story is different. Overall, in the premium segment, we're speaking about Parliament, the segment itself premium is doing well and we are having a good share in there, medium including Chesterfield we are doing well and now there is simply intense price competition as well at the very low end, which is chasing market share for not much margin.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of the Rogerio Fujimori with Crédit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: Two quick questions about Australia. First, you see this segment still far more profitable than the premium segment in your non-OECD markets. And second could you please just remind us about the price positioning along the region that projects in those shipment trials, are bigger brand there?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. First segment, yes. What's called super low in Australia is still very, very profitable. That's correct, and we still used the margin of a premium brand elsewhere. But the positioning of the other brands are mid-priced to premium-price brands. So we are present across the market. But overall, in the market, yes, there is a certain trend towards the lower end. But as you said yourself in the beginning, this lower end is still very profitable end.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: We covered Japan but could you also talk about the shape of the quarter for their key markets that drag the good volume performance in the first quarter? I just wanted to have an idea of the effectuates. I just wanted to have an idea if things are going worse, stable or better, particularly places like Ukraine and Spain? Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Concretely now on the Ukraine -- so you want me to comment on the Ukraine or more on the overall volumes things around the world? What is the question?
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: It's more of the -- particularly on the markets that drive your performance in the first quarter. And I think you talked about all ready about Japan. So I think the ones left are mostly Ukraine, something else [indiscernible] will be appreciated. Thanks.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, absolutely. Ukraine first. I mean, on one end, this is of course a country which has actually very good macroeconomic trends right now. However, when it comes to the cigarette market, then the price increase effects on the market on the consumer are simply not over yet. So I mean for the price that you buy today, a low priced product you could have bought a bit more than two years ago. You could have bought a super premium Parliament brand, so that's really what's happening in the market. As a consequence of that, you really see polarization of the market. You see the premium segment almost stable. Actually our share are doing very, very well. But then, in particular, in our case, you see a very competitive low-price brand and for us share losses at the very low price range, so there is intense competition really at the low end completely polarizing market in there. So that's pretty much the situation in the Ukraine. It will come down -- calm down over time but it is a difficult situation right now, and there are many price promotions actually in place in that market. Now moving over to Spain, what I would say Spain is still very difficult because there are too many negatives at play for the economy to start with. We still have a stagnating GDP. We still have unemployment at 20%. Actually, 1.3 million households out of 17.3 million households total in the country, I was told actually in this 1.3 million households both partners are unemployed, just to give you an impression of the problem. So not surprisingly, consumer confidence is low and the only positive for the economy overall is a recovery in tourism. So in that context, it's not a surprise that the cigarette market is really depressed not to the level of the 25% that you see in the actual numbers of the first quarter because there is an important trade stock reduction in there as well, and there is the effect of a total smoking ban in all the countries of Germany [ph] of this year in there as well. So probably 15% is a better number for the full year. One filament [ph] also you see in the market now beginning in particular in the South, we have made a recent self study in 3 of the Southern cities, Seville, Malici [ph] and Paris there almost 25% of the consumption were not Spanish tax paid products. So that is about double what it was a year before. That's just a snapshot that by no means is representative for Spain's total market, it has always been higher in the South than anywhere else. But that's also of course something adding into the problems, and in such a situation, it is not a surprise that you see down trading in the market and even more so, of course, the more you go South, the more down trading you see. So that's a good presentation on Spain.
Rogerio Fujimori - Crédit Suisse AG: Thank you very much, Hermann.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Not to belabor the point, but I wanted to circle back to Russia and in particular on your expectations for excise tax increases as they stand now. If memory serves, I believe you guys are looking for roughly a 22% increase in 2012 and another 50 basis point increase in 7.5%. I'm just wondering, as is stands today, do you think that's adequately conservative? I believe it falls notably below the 30% to 40% increase JT looking for.
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I would say that I have to say again -- I mean, you have one fixed point here which is the existing law. Ad valorem 7% to 7.5%, specific from RUB 280 to RUB 360. The most discussion about the doubling of the specific element, but this is a discussion and you will hear many more people giving their input in this -- into this discussion until the end of the year. At this point in time, I feel it is impossible to predict the final outcome. As I said earlier, I mean, don't expect a decision there before October or even November of this year. We are only in April. So a lot of water is going to go down the wall guards [ph] and we know that.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Okay, fair enough. The other question that I have on Russia, given your market share trend this quarter presumably before the skirmish that corrupted in April from one of your competitors, it seems like there has been a resumption to a certain extent in down trading in the market. And if that's right that surprises me, given your commentary last month on the stabilization. And I know you highlighted, the up trading could be prohibited by price increases, but it's still kind of surprises me. Is there anything else that kind of caught you guys off guard a little bit in terms of the consumer trend because the food inflation that was almost a year ago? So I'm surprised by the change in tone.
Hermann Waldemer: Yes. I mean, it is the price increase effect. I mean, as we highlighted earlier and you mentioned it. There is of course a certain effect in there. Don't forget that really the recovery of the economy lies to see it in the big cities of Russia. It hasn't really reached the countryside yet. And in that context the rising food prices are a concern because those have gone up quite a bit after last year's summer heat and the drought thereafter and the hardest problems that occurred as a consequence. So it is those two elements.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Okay, fair enough. My last question has to do with your Marlboro market shares in the EU. Certainly you know, I know, so many markets make up that whole number, but it strikes me as potentially troubling that you've seen 2 sequential quarters of market share losses from Marlboro. I'm just wondering if you could drill down a little bit into how to break down for Marlboro and the line extension that you’ve been putting into the market?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Let me give you some information there on Marlboro -- how it performs in the EU region. By variance, those numbers had -- I wouldn’t know by heart, but at the end of the day, they are part of the Marlboro franchise and we do those for incremental volumes but also for the halo effect on the entire brand. Now essentially going into it if you look at the EU, I’m at -0.1, I think I justifiably call an overall state of performance in the EU, albeit it's true that they are considerable market variations within the EU. Poland would be an example where the market share of Marlboro nicely up more than one share point to about 10.5% share. That is clearly up trading and that is in effect that you will see also elsewhere. So there's up trading potential for Marlboro in central Europe’ let me call it in general. Then, I would say you have markets where you have a stable situation in terms of market share Germany and Italy. They will both be down 0.1 to 21.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Then I would say you find other markets that are continuing to grow on an already high basis. That would be Belgium growing 0.7 to 25.1%. And most importantly, Netherlands is growing actually again, 0.7 to 34.9%. That's not too bad. And then you have a loss category of markets very clearly see the effects of a down trading environment, and that would be Spain, Portugal and Greece. Spain, we are down quarter 1 versus quarter 1 down 0.4. It would be even down if you compare more recently to Q3 of last year. Portugal, down 4 percentage points to 18.4, temporary again price increases due to delayed implementation of excise tax, driven price increases of competitors. And Greece again down trading environment where the brand is down 2.4% to 19.3%. So down trading environment stable and growing the number of sale and up trading invaded more the central European part. I think that's the categories that you find within the EU region.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Rey Wium with Ren Cap [Renaissance Capital].
Rey Wium - Renaissance BJM: Just a quick question regarding the production costs. Regarding the full manufacturing cost increase more recent in inflation. But if you look at the first quarter numbers, your cost of sale actually declined by 3.2%. I was just curious to know if there was any specific factors in the first quarter that resulted in a lower -- in a reduction in the cost of sales?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I mean -- overall, inflation that is a worldwide average that is something about 2% to 3% so that's the range. As you know, we have productivity programs in place. In terms of major components of our cost of goods sold, that's of course first of all and most importantly, leaf. That's about 25% of our cost of goods sold. On average is leaf and on a yearly basis, last year, it was $3.5 billion. So within leaf now, you have leaf price increases. We all remember the situation in 2008. That is absorbed. That's no longer the problem today. The leaf price increases for this year that we still expect will be about 2/3 of what they have been in 2010, and now they are essentially driven by the currency strength of the underlying Brazilian real in the leaf price, which then currently is in dollars of Brazilian leaf, that's the most important thing. But against that, so of course also our productivity measures. So that's what I can say on leaf. On direct materials which is about 25% in there, that is essentially stable. And then of course you have conversion costs. Where you have productivity running against percent of the increases that you of course have to give and give to you [indiscernible] so those are essentially the components. But overall, I feel pretty good about it, I must say.
Rey Wium - Renaissance BJM: Yes, but I was just curious about calculations that create -- that your production cost basically in the EU region declined by 6%. That's quite an incredible performance. I was just wondering if there was any specific one sort of factor that benefited that?
Hermann Waldemer: That is probably -- I must say that must be the effect of the Philippines that are included now. Yes, that's it. Of course, if you compare to last year and this year and now you have all the Philippine sector in there which of course on average have a lower cost base then...
Operator: For final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo Gardner.
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo: You had mentioned that you will have a synergy savings coming from Philippines over the year. Will those be part of the $250 million? Or is that on top of the $250 million that you were citing originally. It's first question. And the second question has to do with any further color on forestalling, which you mentioned steps are taking forward, but where else are you still seeing that?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. The productivity and the synergies out of the Philippines is of course part of our total number because the Philippines are part of our total business. The second question forestalling. I mean we have made quite some progress in a number of countries and forestalling the most effective measure always being at the so-called sell by dates. Remember, 2 years ago it must have been were you had really big problems in Poland that’s solved today. So it is essentially 1.5, 2 months delay only. So there is simply further room for improvement also in markets where it's already existing. I was mentioning Russia before, well, that’s certainly is a country that would be on our priority list. But you also can always do better in other markets and that is already in place. Portugal would be an example from a second credit rate.
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo: Thank you, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: That was our final question. I'll now turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Nicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team here in Lausanne, Switzerland today. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2010 and Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter results. You may access the release on our Web site at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we’ll be talking about results for the full-year or fourth-quarter 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009 unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company income is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data table showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income or OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit, and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today’s presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Louie Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, who will join Louie for the question-and-answer period. Louie?
Louie Camilleri: Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with suddenly high employment levels, debilitating the heavy debt burdens, and bleak budget deficits, we posted what I’d characterize as a solid financial performance in 2010. Unprecedented excise tax hikes, affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty, spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced patterns of heightened price competition, and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries. Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance. However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of organic volume and market share growth. The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I’m sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come. Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFPC [ph] in the Philippines, our organic volume fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. Shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes, affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine. Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered a volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base grew at an organic rate of 1%. While the headline organic volume number in the fourth-quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full-year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35% respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth-quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full-year. Our market share performance despite the challenges we face was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco on a pro forma basis rose to 27.9% for the full-year and 28.1% in the fourth-quarter. We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets. While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad-based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably, in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or are planned in all four markets to address the shortcomings. Marlboro share momentum improved as the year unfolded despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand’s new architecture. In virtually all instances, we’re witnessing improvements in the brands key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly, in regards to the Gold’s pillar. Marlboro’s performance in Asia was singularly robust behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro’s momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart. L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe, and particularly, in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this. Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full-year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objective reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries, due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them. Adjusted company’s operating income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full-year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full-year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth-quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth, with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth-quarter. Our full-year pricing variance approached $1.7 billion. Of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth-quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power despite a very challenging economic environment remains intact. I should highlight that the fourth-quarter pricing variance was flattered by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter. We’re very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full-year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings, as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program. Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeding our mid- to long-term target for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full-year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth-quarter. As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital, and in particular, a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain. Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spin-off in March 2008, we set a three year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion. Fast forward to today and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion and this despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million. Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends and our share repurchase programs. We have increased our dividends by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin. By the end of December 2010 had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83. While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we’re able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our path. Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011. As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics with reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within a range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010. On an adjusted basis compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, and approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis. We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010. The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structure thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010. While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation, so far this year the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign. The one exception is, of course, Mexico with the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fell swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appear to be manageable. Furthermore, and very importantly we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed France, the Netherlands, Sweden, have all increased their specific to total tax ratios, and Greece has significantly improved its tax structure. In addition in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period. Unemployment remains persistently high in numerous countries and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation particularly as it relates to basic food commodities remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon. In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that recorded in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011, and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain, and Ukraine. Also, we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea, and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey. The outcome of volume impact of the tax driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half. While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had originally anticipated. Accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious. Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we could more than offset this dynamic given the breadth of our brand portfolio. Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded in 2010, driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented. We anticipate some cost pressure driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product cost in 2011, the more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture and other premium brand offerings as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth-quarter. We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year and we have a set a target of pre-tax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011, in line with the level dispersed in 2010. All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compared very favorably to our consumer product peers. We entered 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency markets and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous plans initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth. Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: Good afternoon, Judy.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Louie, the first question related to the 2011 organic volume outlook. It looks like you are looking for the decline to really no longer moderate versus I think a couple of months ago you were thinking that that maybe volume decline could moderate as you look out 2011. So I’m just wondering what’s really change in terms of volume outlook now being a little bit bolster than two months ago?
Louie Camilleri: Not much I can add to what I said in my remarks, Judy. The economic recovery is somewhat uncertain still. Unemployment remains persistently high in a lot of places. North Africa recently has been an issue for us. Tunisia is now essentially back to normal, but Egypt, obviously, things are essentially at a standstill at the moment, Japan volume, as I’ve said in my remarks, that could be a potential upside, but frankly, it’s too early to say that today.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: What are you assuming in Japan, just to clarify?
Louie Camilleri: We’re essentially consistent with what we said all along which is on an annualized basis, as of October 1, we see volume decline of about 20%. Now, as I said, the quarterly volume shift will be quite significant. I mean, we’ll see a weak first-quarter, a very weak second-quarter because of difficult comparison. Third-quarter should be okay and the fourth-quarter should obviously be very strong in terms of volume.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in terms of the profitability impact, because I look at the Asia region in the fourth-quarter, you obviously had a very strong growth. Some of that was the revaluation of the inventory in Japan at higher prices, but even you exclude that, you had a pretty healthy operating profit growth, presumably, because you’ve seen the benefit of the pricing in that market and even with the volume down 40% plus in Japan, so if we assume that volume decline is about 20% for 2011 in Japan, wouldn’t the profitability or profit growth impact in 2011 be much better than what you actually saw in the fourth-quarter?
Louie Camilleri: In terms of Japan itself.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Well, I think I’m trying to understand what happened in the fourth-quarter from Asia region profit growth perspective and then find (inaudible) how that impacts 2011, if we assume Japan is down 20% or so?
Louie Camilleri: Well, let’s go through it. Yes, Japan was flattered by the pricing on the inventory, and the pricing of the small amount of volume that we actually shipped. However, that was essentially a wash with the volume hit in the fourth-quarter. So what you’re seeing in Asia is a very strong performance in a lot of other markets, principally, driven by Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, and various other markets. I mean Asia is doing extremely well and will continue to do well.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just in terms of share buyback, it seems like you’re accelerating the pace of the buyback this year. I’m just wondering if you can just speak through whether at this point you’re looking at finishing the current program sooner, and then is that a factor in terms of the tax rate going up in 2011?
Louie Camilleri: No. It has nothing to do with the tax per se, but listen, we had a $12 billion three-year program, which annualized it should be $4 billion a year. We met our working capital objective well ahead of plan, and therefore we decided already last year to increase our share repurchases from $4 billion to $5 billion, and this year we believe that given our earnings prospects and cash flow prospects, we can also repeat that performance and go for $5 billion. I think it’s consistent with our views that we should reward shareholders, both in terms of dividends and share repurchases to the extent that we can. And as our results come in strong, that’s what we’re going to do.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: David, good afternoon.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Louie, this is a follow-up in Asia, have you implemented any price increases in the Philippines since the business combination closed?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, we have. We increased prices last August and we just increased prices again.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly, although it’s a very long tail dynamic, are there any milestones you hope to hit that you could call out during 2011 either with respect to the Chinese joint ventures or your efforts with respect to a reduced risk product?
Louie Camilleri: In terms of 2011, that’s possibly early, David. Our relations with CNTC in China continue to be excellent. The joint venture brands are doing well. Marlboro, although very small, continues to grow in China. There have been great efforts on the part of CNTC to enhance distribution throughout China. I think the relationship is excellent and consistently improves. But as I’ve said, all along, it’s kind of take some time and I don’t think there are specific milestones in 2011. Now, in terms of next-generation products, we have and continue to make progress, and we’ll be taking certain initiatives this year. But to come out with specific milestones this year is a bit early still, David. As you know, I have always linked the two together. I think material entry into China is somewhat dependent on the existence of next generation products.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Louie, and then lastly, can you give us a general sense in the four markets you called out where you’re not pleased with your market share performance, the types of tactics that you intend to employ?
Louie Camilleri: Well, yes, let’s go one by one. As you’re probably aware in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany, and has the best demographic age profile today, followed by Marlboro. A lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So, big packs are 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19s and there’s been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to the conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack in particular. So in the fourth-quarter, we launched Marlboro Maxi Pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount and we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro’s performance in the fourth-quarter, so that will continue. The other thing to note is, as I mentioned in my remarks, we now have visibility on excise taxes. There’s an excise tax increase due from May 1. The structure is pretty good. At the low end the tax passengers on is €0.13 a pack. At the premium end it’s €0.04 a pack. So that’s pretty good news. So Germany, L&M in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of Maxi Packs and let’s see how things proceed. In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall was significant and not everybody followed to the extent that we had led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with the significant down trading that took place and the surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase. Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure their taxes. So far there hasn’t been much progress on that front, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic that overtime it will realize that it’s in their interest. We repositioned L&M in the fourth-quarter and in fact, our share grew in the fourth-quarter in Turkey. That’s why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey. In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union volume and income. They remained a 3% drag for the year in terms of the EU’s growth. I think there is just being with the tax restructuring and price increase across the board and we’re confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain share. Ukraine, essentially, what you’ve seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge successive excise tax increases. Such that in a two-year period the low price segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low ends, brand such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Polymer [ph] was two years ago. What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low price segment and the mid price segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we’re doing very well in the premium segment, and we lost in the mid segment and the low price segment and we have plans in place to address that. Does that cover your question, David?
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Very much. Thank you, Louie.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. A couple of questions, Louie, if I could, your comments about pricing in 2011 being stronger or anticipated to be stronger than in 2010, is that comment meant to exclude the Japanese revaluation of the inventory, so maybe six points or seven points of price variance?
Louie Camilleri: No. That obviously include six [ph] because our price variance in 2010 was approaching $1.7 billion, and in my remarks I’ve said that our pricing in this year would exceed that $l.7 billion.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay. So that’s all in. A question on Turkey, if I could, given we are now cycling, I believe the sharp tax increases from a year ago here in the first quarter, are you seeing a return to more normal demand patterns at all?
Louie Camilleri: We’re definitely seeing an improvement in trends. Watch out, Christine, is what I mentioned earlier, which is the surge in illicit trade, and I think the government is very focused on that, but it is a concern.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then finally, with respect to the EU, can you just comment broadly and I suppose ignoring some of those countries with specific factors, but can you talk about the pace of a trade up or trade down and how you are seeing that progress perhaps in light of Marlboro and L&M across your major EU markets?
Louie Camilleri: It sort of varies by market. It’s difficult to generalize for the whole European Union, Christine. I think I could safely say that we’ve seen a slight improvement in the trends, certainly in the fourth-quarter versus the nine months. We’ve various actions in place. Marlboro grew share in Spain in the fourth-quarter, which was pretty significant. Marlboro continues to do well in Italy. It’s been somewhat soft in France, but that been offset by Philip Morris, which is also a premium brand. Germany, I think I’ve described in considerable detail. We’ve done well in Netherlands particularly, and in the Benelux, but Netherlands, in particular. There has just been a price tax increase. And I’d say that we’re witnessing in a number of places a few pricing skirmishes. Nothing all too dramatic but things are heating up on the pricing front with certain companies repositioning their brands. As I said, I don’t think it’s too alarming, but there have been a number of price skirmishes, particularly, in the European Union and Central Europe areas.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, great, thank you very much.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you, Christine.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: Hi, Chris.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: I had just a follow-up on the price skirmishes, particularly, in the EU with the tax structure changing there, I guess what I’m asking is, is it related to the removal of the minimum excise tax, or is it something beyond that? Was it more just price-related and share-related?
Louie Camilleri: No. Because, as I said, I think the taxes are moving all in the right direction as a result of the EU tax directive. I think it’s just competitive moves, Chris, of certain companies repositioning brands in the lower price segments because of the economic weakness at the moment and the high unemployment levels. This is not something that is too dramatic. It just affects the competitive profiles out there.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Sure. Okay. And then I wanted to ask just one more follow-up on Japan. Just to understand like your inventory levels in that market, is there any sort of rebuilding that needs to occur? Can you give a little better feel kind of how much inventory levels have come down in general in that market?
Louie Camilleri: Well, we’ve obviously reduced our inventories at year-end to align them with what we believe to be the running rate going forward. Now, as I said, the indication since October, although they are very difficult to read given both the trade loading as well as consumer loading, but nevertheless the indications are that volume is holding better than we had originally anticipated, so clearly, there could be benefit there in terms of volumes. If we have a run rate in volume that’s better than we had anticipated that may entail an adjustment in our inventories, but they’re all sort of positives as opposed to negatives.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Sure. And then just one final question for you. I just want to put in context the $250 million of cost savings and just understand would that fully offset what you see is some of your packaging and general cost inflation in ‘11 or would it fall short of that?
Louie Camilleri: No, wouldn’t fully offset it. We will still be hit this year with the least price increases that took place in 2008 because of the length of our leaf inventory durations they hit the P&L later. So this year our leaf price or leaf cost, I should say, relative to 2010 is about the same increment, as we saw in 2010. That should get better in 2012 going forward, because as we’ve said before, the supply-demand balance in terms of leaf tobacco has improved, and we’d anticipate that leaf tobacco prices will essentially be in line with inflation going forward.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Leinster of UBS.
Jon Leinster – UBS: Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of things. First of all, with regards to sort of the new Marlboro architecture, is that now being fully rolled out to your satisfaction, or are we actually sort of seeing the annualization of some of the results in many of these markets now?
Louie Camilleri: I mean it clearly is being deployed in numerous markets, but we’re still not there. There is still a lot to be done and there is still quite some exciting innovations to come. I think as I mentioned in my remarks, you have to look at the consumer research we do in the demographic profile of the brand, and it has improved significantly. I mean we can see the trends. For example, we have seen significant turnarounds in the demographic profile of the brands in places as varied as Italy, Japan, France, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands and the list goes on. So we’re seeing improvements in the brands equity and demographics, and we still have quite a lot to do with the brand.
Jon Leinster – UBS: All right. Slight different track there. You’re clearly hoping that Turkey will settle down now that you’ve annualized the big tax increase from January last year. Would you expect similar things to occur in U.K. and Romania and some of the other markets that were hit or are those markets being going to suffer sort of consistent increases in illicit trades and then is it driven by different dynamics?
Louie Camilleri: I think you’re right in terms of annualization things should get better. The watch out is the illicit trade, which is affecting all three countries that you mentioned. The problem is when illicit trade takes off, it’s very hard to curtail. Canada has been an example, where they have started attacking the smuggled product with some success. Legitimate consumption or shipments were up close to 10% in Canada last year solely due primarily to Ontario taking severe measures again illicit product. But Quebec is still relatively weak. So we hope that that will continue. We should see improvements, Jonathan, but my concern is the illicit trade.
Jon Leinster – UBS: Right. And lastly, just in Indonesia, which is, obviously, often we get limited information on this. It still seems they are quite price sensitive. Is that something you hope you will trade up in the following year since cost price is not giving the economics of the country, but it hasn’t improved a bit quicker?
Louie Camilleri: I’d say that it’s being pretty solid. Consumption is up about 4% despite pricing that has been ahead of inflation across the board. What you see is that, when you pass certain threshold stick prices in particular and packed prices, there is a temporary slowdown in the brands performance. There has been a new excise tax decree that came out, which clearly is manageable, excise tax increases were essentially in line with inflation. The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers, that hasn’t quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward. But importantly, I think the government is more and more focused on the various loopholes about certain manufacturers are using to get excise tax benefits. So, to the extent that those loopholes are closed then I think you’ll see a more pronounced shift in what you’re discussing in terms of the up trading.
Jon Leinster – UBS: And you would expect some focus on that during 2011?
Louie Camilleri: Hopefully, over the 2011, 2012 period; probably more 2012.
Jon Leinster – UBS: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Good afternoon. If I can follow up on Christine’s question very quickly, you said the pricing variance would be higher in 2011 than 2010, in your underlying assumptions for the earnings guidance, if you strip out Japan, how does the pricing variance look in 2011 according to your model?
Louie Camilleri: That would still be higher.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Are you able to say geographically, would it…?
Louie Camilleri: I’m not sure I understand your question.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Well, you see, clearly, the pricing variance in Japan is very positive or will be very positive in 2011. I suppose what I am trying to do is get a feeling for the rest of the world.
Louie Camilleri: Well, the rest of the world will still be above 2010. So the increment in pricing in 2011 versus 2010 is not solely due to Japan, is that clear?
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Yes, absolutely, it’s clear. I guess the question is, excluding Japan, is the increment in 2011 versus 2010 more or less than it will be 2010 versus 2009?
Louie Camilleri: More.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Is it not true in each of your four regions?
Louie Camilleri: I’d say that pretty well, yes. I mean I’m not going to go region by region because it’s a subject that’s rather delicate, but the global pricing ex-Japan would still be higher in 2011 versus 2010 as it was 2010 versus 2009.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Thank you very much.
Louie Camilleri: You’re welcome, Adam.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: Good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: Erik, good afternoon.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: Thank you. I was hoping you could update us on the outlook for Russia. I mean you talked about markets where there’s been weakness, but it appears that the Russian market is improving and I was wondering if you could comment both on volumes, but also then on the outlook for pricing and up trading?
Louie Camilleri: Well, obviously, the Russian economy is doing a lot better, driven by the oil price. We have significantly revamped and strengthened our organization there. We’re gaining share. There has been quite a significant price increase I believe you are aware. There has been the usual skirmish of people delaying pricing and repositioning certain brands. But I think we’re quite confident that we’ll have a good year in Russia in 2011 as it was in 2010 where income was up double-digit.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: Okay. Super. And then with respect to Japan, not to belabor the point, is it fair to think about the incremental pricing benefit around $500 million in 2011?
Louie Camilleri: No. That’s pushing the envelope. I think that’s more like the full annualization of the pricing. I think your number includes the pricing in the fourth-quarter.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: And then lastly, could you update us on the status of plain packaging in Australia? And then also your view on the plain packaging discussions underway in the UK and European Union?
Louie Camilleri: Yes. It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing legislation calling for plain packaging. We’ll see what happens. My guess is we’ll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It sort of defies logic, because I don’t think that it will affect consumption levels in any way. Furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So, I’m hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely, because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and will not address smoking incidence or smoking prevalence. The U.K., I said that, they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidence and that they would have to look at very carefully. Legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues also related to trade issues in the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements, so, the UK is looking at it very sensibly. In the EU, DG SANCO, the Health Commission as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive, and is looking at host slew of measures. That’s probably a three-year to five-year process. But as I said, I think plain packaging doesn’t make any sense and we’ll fight plain packaging in every way possible. Does that address your question?
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: Yes, that’s extraordinarily helpful. One last one on the Swedish Match joint venture, has that joint venture launched in another region aside from Asia and Taiwan at this point?
Louie Camilleri: No. We’ve launched in Taiwan and we have the intention of launching in at least two other markets this year.
Erik Bloomquist – Berenberg Bank: Great, thank you.
Louie Camilleri: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Hayes of Nomura.
David Hayes – Nomura: Good evening, gentlemen. Hi. Three if I can, just on the cost save which you’re obviously giving on a sort of one-year forward basis. I mean should we be thinking about ongoing $250 million on a medium term basis? I’m just trying to get a feel for whether we should get it as ongoing medium-term plan, whether it’s very one-year specific and then kind of stops? Second, just in terms of the shape of the volumes in the fourth-quarter. I just want to make sure my math is right. So, of the 5% volume decline organic, about 3 percentage points of that’s Japan I’m guessing (inaudible) right. And then just in Mexico loading into the channels, wonder what impact that would have, or was that was fairly negligible? And finally, just in terms of sort of regulation plain packaging kind of follow on, in Uruguay, I just wondered whether you can update us on where we’re with that legal action in terms of potentially to what particular timing of an outcome of that and what sort of precedent that might set elsewhere? Thanks very much.
Louie Camilleri: On your $250 million productivity target, we’ve decided that we’d do an annual target rather than three-year or five-year target because we want it to be a bit more specific than just to give a general target. I can’t tell you what the cost saving will be in 2012, but clearly, we’re very committed to remain best-in-class in terms of cost efficiency, and we’re very focused on that as you saw in our Investor Day. So, I am hopeful that the $250 million this year will find more in the years to come, but the $250 million is specifically related to 2011. Uruguay, I don’t have much news to offer you other than the litigation is most likely will continue. We believe that we have the stronger of the case and we’ll see where that leads to. Your third question, I am sorry, David...
David Hayes – Nomura: Just on the shape of the volumes in the fourth-quarter. So I am just working out, I was wondering so much with Japan numbers if I am right. Is that 3 percentage points of the 5% organic decline is due to Japan and then I just wondered whether Mexico was a benefit and was that quantifiable?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, Mexico was certainly a benefit, it was marginal. If I recall, it is 0.3%, 0.35% something like that. Yes, I’d say that if I took Japan and Ukraine in particular, they were the lion’s share of the decline, some 70%, if I recall.
David Hayes – Nomura: Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rogerio Fujimori of Credit Suisse.
Rogerio Fujimori – Credit Suisse: My question has been answered. Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: Hi, Ann.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Louie, I just want to ask, what is your volume performance expectation for the overall EU market in 2011?
Louie Camilleri: I’m not sure we’re going to disclose that number, Ann. I’m hopeful that it clearly will be better than it was in 2010. Beyond that I’m not going to give a specific number.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Okay. And then my second question, have you finalized all decisions and contracts related to all IP needs for the EU for 2011?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, we have.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Great, that’s all I have. Thanks.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you very much.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I’ll now turn it back to Mr. Rolli for closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Well, thank you for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you do have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team here in New York this week. We’ll also be here next week. We will be making a webcast presentation at the CAGNY Conference, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference in Boca Raton, Florida on Wednesday, February 23, and look forward to seeing many of you there as well. Thank you again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results in the second quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares on the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenue data excludes excise taxes. Acquisitions for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines.  You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustment to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.  Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It is now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 of $3.70 to $3.80 based on the same prevailing exchange rate. Since then, concerning surrounding the future of the eurozone have calmed somewhat, and the euro has therefore strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Based on the currently prevailing exchange rates, we expect to achieve a reported diluted EPS for 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85. This guidance represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19% compared to $3.24 in 2009 and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Let me now turn to a brief review of our quarterly results. Cigarette volume in the quarter was 241 billion units, up by 8% on a reported basis and by 0.3% excluding the additional 17.2 billion units generated by our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Our shipments in the quarter were also boosted by the buildup of stocks at our distributor in Japan. At the end of June, the inventories at our distributor in Japan were approximately 3.4 billion units higher than at the same time last year. We expect these stock levels to be sufficient to meet the forecasted higher demand from retailers and consumers ahead of the October tax and price increases. The depletion of these stocks will result in a significant reduction in shipments to Japan in the second half of this year. Finally, we expect the revaluation of inventory sales by our distributor to benefit our income during the fourth quarter of 2010. Our volume performance in the quarter was achieved thanks to our superior and broad brand portfolio. The volume of our top ten international brands increased by 3.6% helped, of course, by Japan. Not surprisingly, in the current economic environment, our low-priced brands have performed particularly well. In addition, our key premium and mid-priced brands are also performing solidly. Parliament achieved a volume growth of 2.3% in the quarter, with Japan, Korea and Russia more than offsetting the impact of tax-driven consumer down trading in Turkey. Marlboro volume declined by just 0.5%, as higher volumes in North Africa, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and the Philippines largely offset a decline in the EU region, attributable to a continued challenging environment for premium brands. Chesterfield's vibrancy is confirmed by a 6.2% volume growth in the quarter, despite continued down trading in Spain, one of its key markets. Finally, L&M achieved a favorable volume overall, thanks to growth in Nigeria, Egypt, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Thailand, which compensated for volume declines in Eastern Europe and Turkey.  Our competitiveness is confirmed by our continued favorable share trends in both OECD and non-OECD markets. I would like, in particular, to highlight our strong performance in Russia. Our market share grew by a further 0.2 share point to 25.5% in the second quarter, thanks mainly to the growth of mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street, as well as the resilient performance from above-premium priced Parliament, the volume of which was up in the quarter. It should be noted that Bond Street is now mostly gaining shares from competitive brands in the same pricing. Overall, in the second quarter, our volume increased by 4.9%, indicating that the total market is stabilizing. Consumer down trading continues to moderate in Russia, as evidenced by the fact that this year's second quarter 3.3% decline in the sales to the trade of PMI premium brands was the lowest in the last 18 months.  During the second quarter, we were able to grow our premium volume in several emerging markets, such as Algeria and Indonesia. These economies are generally emerging faster from the economic downturn than those in Europe, where price sensitivity remains high. Increased employment levels remain key to a global resumption of consumer up trading. We are also concerned about the growth of illicit trade in markets that have recently implemented significant excise tax increases, such as Greece, Pakistan, Romania and Turkey. Higher prices in nearly all key markets enabled us to achieve a favorable pricing variance of $341 million in the second quarter. Furthermore, we have just implemented a two-for-three ruble price increase in Russia.  We learned from the media last Friday that the Ministry of Finance in Japan has approved Japan Tobacco’s application to amend its retail prices this coming October. The new price list represents increases of between JPY 100 and JPY 140 per pack for Japan Tobacco’s key brands, well above the excise tax pass-on of JPY 82 per pack. PMI’s distributor has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for an increase on PMI brands effective in October and awaits their response.  We were more than able to offset the recent large excise tax in Australia and the higher VAT rate in Spain through higher prices. We are pleased that the Italian government has introduced through a decree a reinforced minimum excise tax system. In Greece, if we had fully passed on the tax increases, the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest-priced brands would have expanded from EUR 1.20 to EUR 2.45. This would have rendered the brand completely uncompetitive, and therefore, we were forced to partially absorb these tax increases. Marlboro has nevertheless been under pressure after significantly increasing prices in a difficult economic environment has resulted in consumer down trading and a sharp market contraction. We have, however, been able to largely offset share losses on Marlboro through the relaunch of L&M, which grew to a market share of 6.1% in June. The unfavorable price volume mix variance in Greece was a considerable drag on the EU region's OCI in the quarter. PMI's net revenues reached $7.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15.1% compared to last year, and a very robust increase of 5.3% excluding currency and acquisitions. Our exit cost management and productivity saving programs are being used to offset the previously communicated increases in leaf and direct material costs. During the second quarter, we were able to grow adjusted OCI by 7.4% excluding currency and acquisitions. Let me now briefly review our results on a regional basis, starting with the EU region. The net revenues and OCI were down slightly excluding currency. More than 3/4 of our 6.2% volume decline in the EU region is attributable to lower total markets, in particular in Spain, where the market continued to decline at a double-digit rate. Our year-to-date June cigarette share in Germany of 35.6% is 1.8 share points below the previous year's level but is showing a sequential improvement, and L&M remain the fastest-growing brand on the market. In the EU region, excluding Greece, our favorable pricing variance in the second quarter was 1.2x our unfavorable volume mix variance. During this period, the share of Marlboro grew notably in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia, while L&M increased its share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  The EEMA region is expected to be a source of renewed strength for PMI going forward. It had a tremendous second quarter, with volume up 1.6%, net revenues increasing by 8.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, and OCI, 16.9% higher on the same basis. As mentioned previously, our business is very strong in Russia, where our profitability in the second half of the year is expected to be enhanced by the recent price increase. We have strong business momentum in North Africa behind both Marlboro and L&M. In Egypt, there has been an important structural improvement in excise taxes, though tax and price levels are now significantly higher than originally expected, which will have an unfavorable near-term impact on market demand.  The one market of concern is Turkey, where very large excise tax-driven price increases have resulted in a significant market contraction and consumer down trading. However, our market share now appears to have stabilized around 41%, the level prevalent as recently as 2008. And Lark is the fastest-growing brand in Turkey.  In Asia, volume was 5.2% ahead of last year, excluding acquisition, and essentially stable after taking into account the inventory buildup in Japan. Net revenues were 11.5% higher, and OCI was up by 14.7%, excluding currency and acquisition. We achieved higher prices in unit margins across several markets, in particular, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Our business momentum in Korea continued, with volume growing by 15.9% and market share up by a further three share points to 16.6%. In Indonesia, our volume decreased slightly, as price increases have slowed the overall market growth, while volume was lower in Pakistan, where the duty-paid market has declined significantly due to tax-driven price increases and the growth of illicit trade. Asia is the growth engine for Marlboro. The brand gained volume in many markets, including Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and was supported by our Marlboro Fresh initiative, such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast.  Volume in Latin America and Canada increased by 0.9%, driven primarily by an increase in the size of the legitimate market in Canada, following more rigorous provincial legislation and most importantly, the improved enforcement. We achieved a slow market share performance with continued gains in Argentina and Mexico. Net revenues increased by 6.1% excluding currency, while adjusted OCI excluding currency was 0.5% higher, as we increased volume and higher prices were partly offset by higher leaf and manufacturing costs. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.00 in the second quarter, a significant increase of 20.5% over 2009 and up by a very robust 16.9% excluding currency. As previously announced in June, reported diluted EPS of $1.07 was boosted in the quarter by a favorable onetime tax item of $0.07 for the reversing of provision, largely due to the completion of U.S. tax audits.  Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 10.1% higher at $3.5 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 6.3%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate of 11.1%, and by 7.4% excluding currency. Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders. In April, we completed our $13 billion share repurchase program on time, and in May, we started a new $12 billion three-year program. In the quarter, we spent $1 billion to purchase an additional 21.7 million shares. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis represented a yield of 4.6% on July 20. So let me summarize. We again achieved strong financial results this quarter, thanks to an improved volume performance, intact pricing power, driven by our superior brands and broad portfolio and productivity savings that have enabled us to absorb the foreseen increase in leaf cost. These results were achieved despite some additional challenges with regards to excise taxes and VAT. Our improved volume performance is based on our unmatched brand portfolio, though please keep in mind that our quarterly shipments in the second half are expected to be unfavorably impacted by this quarter's inventory buildup at our distributor in Japan. The new architecture and consumer-relevant product innovation are strengthening the Marlboro franchise. During the second quarter, Marlboro's market share was sequentially up or stable in 21 of our top 30 OCI markets. Since we established our 2010 EPS guidance in June, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, at currently prevailing exchange rates, our positive business momentum should enable us to achieve a reported diluted EPS in 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19%, and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer questions you may have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Couple of questions on EEMA. First, just in terms of Russia, obviously the improvement here is pretty encouraging, and the Premium segment moderating, I think, is also encouraging. Can you just talk about how you see that sort of playing out for the balance of the year? And do you actually think that the Premium segment can grow by year end in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, you're right. I mean, the situation in Russia is encouraging. We see clear signs of improvement. The down trading is not fully yet over, but it's substantially improving. And if we look at kind of the decline rate of the Premium segment in Q1, that was still down by 12.2%. I'm talking our volume share. In this quarter, it's minus 3.3%. The mid-segment, which was down in Q1 11% was now down by the 6% only, but still, but only in the second quarter. So that is a clear, clear sequential improvement. Let's see how it shakes out going forward. Overall, measured unemployment in Russia is down to 7.3%. It's the last May year-to-date number I have seen. That was 8.4% before. So it's substantial improvement. Also, in terms of total market size, I would expect at least a stable market for the full year, despite the recent price increases that we have implemented.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then another important market in that region, Ukraine, you've talked about the benefit in terms of the inventory movement in the quarter. Can you quantify how much that was? And then, if you think about the consumption trend post the excise tax-driven price increases, what do you think the impact at the consumption level would be?
Hermann Waldemer: There are, I would say, about on average, old price volumes in the market of duration of about 1.5 months. So there is still no effective forestalling regulation in place. That’s why we have that situation. I mean, the market reaction, you remember, I mean, it's still very affordable in the Ukraine overall, but we had a number of consecutive steep price increases. So total market, I mean, nominally in Q2 was only down 3%, yet we’re down [ph] (0:36:52) -- to date, it's down 11%. I think we will still look in the third quarter results at double-digit market decline. Overall, situations will improve also in the Ukraine at a slower pace than Russia, that's for sure, but it will improve. So GDP in the first quarter that I've seen, the last number was up 4.9%. Inflation is now down now to 8%, 8.5% year-on-year May. But the employment is still high at 9%. So it will come there was as well, but it will take longer.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: But in the second quarter, Hermann, the 4% increase in Ukraine, do you know how much that was boosted by the inventory movement?
Hermann Waldemer: I would say you would have seen still a double-digit decline without the inventory.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And just finally on Japan, is it your expectation that all of the $3.4 billion inventory build in the quarter will come out in Q3? Or what's kind of the timing of when that gets flushed out in the marketplace?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, I mean, essentially the 3.4 is the inventory buildup, because that's the number, the really hard number, what was the inventory at same period as last year, and what is it now? So therefore, I mean, essentially, it’s at least the $3.4 billion cigarettes numbers to take into account. You will see quite a bit of inventory de-loads because of additional consumer demand but also, of course, also of additional retailer purchases in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter will, of course, come also the overall market reaction of consumers, then, to those new prices and that's the harder impact to predict. Essentially, I must say, they’re not really new insights to when we discussed a month ago. The negative remains the high percentage retail price increase. And the positive remains that even in the JPY 400 price range, prices in Japan will still be very affordable, given the purchasing power of the Japanese consumer.
Operator: Your Next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just a quick follow-up on Japan. Again, in the third quarter, given there was some inventory buildup going into the third quarter, would you expect demand and even some more inventory to build or just basically demand pull up your shipments in the third quarter before we see declines in the fourth?
Hermann Waldemer: No. The shipment is our sales into the distributor, and I would say our inventories that we have built up now are sufficient to cover both the consumer demand and the retailer demand. Therefore, I mean, the consumer-increased demand in the third quarter will be reflected in the inventory reductions but will not anymore be reflected in the shipments on our side, i.e. therefore, in our financials.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then moving to Marlboro, I'm wondering if you could tell us how much the inventory pickup in Japan was Marlboro or helping Marlboro? And then when you look at Marlboro's underlying trends, can you speak to the architecture? There were certainly some comments about its having a stabilizing effect, but I'm sure if we pull out the inventory build, what underlying Marlboro might have looked like?
Hermann Waldemer: I mean, the inventory buildup in Japan, the brands contribute to that buildup essentially according to their market shares in the market. Then more broadly, your Marlboro question I thought was Japan, but your question is broader. I will go to other markets there as well. I mean, in Japan, Marlboro is doing well. It is up 0.2% a share to 10.8%. It has about double the young-adults smokers share than its actual market share. But it's not the only place where we see nice improvements in share increases of Marlboro. Give you a couple of examples: Korea would be up 1.2% share points to 6.8%; Poland would be up 0.7% to 10.2%; the Netherlands is up 0.8% to 34.7%; Italy is up 0.3% to 23%; Argentina, to go into Latin America as well, is up at 0.3% to 23.4%. So there is really good trends in many different places around the world. And we, of course, still also have a couple of places in the world where we have to continue on our work and with the good work that has been done there. The ones where Marlboro is really down is first of all those markets which were really hit by the economy, like Turkey, Greece and Spain. Turkey is down 2.5 share points to 8.1; Greece down 3.7 to 19.3; and Spain is down 0.6 to 14.8. So that is really the economy that drives the down trading in those markets. And then there is Germany, where we now are down to a share of 21.6, which is, however, sequentially stable over the last couple of months. That is not the economy. That is simply an overall price-sensitive market overall, where it’s really a bit more difficult to act. On the other hand, if you are being very successful in that market with L&M, which is our answer to the market situation there.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Let me ask you some follow-up questions in Japan, if I could. First, can you review with us on the major brand how much pricing you've requested?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, I can. The request for Lark and Philip Morris is up JPY 110 to JPY 410 plus tax. Virginia Slims, Marlboro, up JPY 120 to JPY 440. And the king-size variants of Parliament also up JPY 120 to JPY 450. The 100 versions actually retail even JPY 20 higher, we have requested JPY 470.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: And then, am I right, Hermann, that the favorable operating income impact of the trade buildup in the second quarter might have been about $75 million? Is that in the right ballpark?
Hermann Waldemer: $75 million for the trade inventory buildup of Japan only?
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Yes.
Hermann Waldemer: I think there you are being a bit too modest.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: And then the release, Hermann, mentioned that the Japanese market volumes were down 7.1%? Is that a consumption number during the second quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: What it is, it is the market number we see there, I mean, there are a couple of onetime effects in there, the results already, a lot of talking going on about the price increases, although they have not even materialized in the market yet. I'd say for that quarter, it's probably the number is rather 5% than 7%.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: And then lastly in Japan, Hermann, can you just explain the comment you made in your prepared remarks that in the fourth quarter after the price increase there will be a favorable variance in your operating income from the revaluation of inventory and the trade. Exactly, what’s it going to occur? And how does it affect your P&L?
Hermann Waldemer: There will be a certain inventory level, then, on September 30 or October 1, okay, at the distributor. The additional value arising from the price increase of those inventories accrues to us. And that will be then reflected in adjustments of the selling prices in October. So therefore, this is an effect in our P&L in the fourth quarter. The inventories held by the retailers, that added value is actually to the benefit of the retailers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just to want to follow up, if I could, on David's question. It would be, in terms of the benefit to you in the fourth quarter on the inventory revaluation in Japan, would be only based on the inventory that's still left at the distributor where prices have gone higher. Is that the right way to say it?
Hermann Waldemer: That's correct.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: We can't predict necessarily where those inventories may stand just at this time, right?
Hermann Waldemer: No, because we don't know yet what really what the additional consumer demand will be and how much additional volume will go into retail. But there will be substantial number of volumes to lift.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then I just had two questions: The first would be, in this quarter, we're seeing a bit of an improvement overall in premium and especially with Marlboro doing well. Can you say even in rough terms if mix was positive in the quarter? I presume it was. I want to get -- just get a sense of that?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I mean, we have -- as we've said, we have a number of places around the world where Marlboro is just doing well. I mean, this is principally in Asia, which as I said in my prepared remarks, is kind of the growth engine for Marlboro. So that's where you probably get the most. It’s not in Asia, you will also see some in the markets, which would be Latin America, also in Latin America, then in Mexico. So it goes through a broad range of markets, I would say. It kind of goes along with my earlier remarks on where Marlboro is doing really well and where, due to economy or price sensitivity, Marlboro, there is still some work needed on the brand.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And my other question just is related to -- you called out some higher costs in Indonesia. It was one of the markets you mentioned. Could you just give a little more color on that? And I think we saw it last quarter, too, if I recall.
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, it is. It is in manufacturing cost. It is in leaf, in Indonesian leaf. It is also, I think, in cloves, so these are really the cost increases. It’s in the manufacturing area.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Higher leaf costs?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup Inc: You may have answered this already, but I had to -- as I say, I’ve missed a lot of the call. But is there any way of quantifying what the pricing variance in Greece was? I mean, I suppose I’m -- another way of doing that is, what the EU might have looked like if it hadn't been for the problems in Greece.
Hermann Waldemer: I would say, roughly, the situation in Greece has been a 3% drag on the OCI growth rate of the EU region in the quarter.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup Inc: Are you able to say what it would be as a drag on the net revenues as well?
Hermann Waldemer: I think that was already very precise, no?
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Fell of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: First of all, on Canada, clearly a very strong bounce back in the legal market there, and you had a good first quarter as well. Do you see this improvement in the situation with regards to the [audio gap] (0:50:22) -- is this sustainable? Or are there particular one-off sort of factors which have pushed the market up more temporarily? And secondly, just with regards to Philippines, the incremental benefits that you're getting from acquisitions there, the 17.2 billion of volume in the second quarter. Are we done now with the impacts of the Philippines deal in terms of one-offs for the rest of the year? Or will we be feeling impacts as well in the third and fourth quarters?
Hermann Waldemer: So Canada first. The market, actually, the legal market in the second quarter, up 20%. There was an additional effect in there, which were price increases actually, due to the harmonization of the provincial and federal sales tax in Ontario and Québec. So if you take an estimate for that effect out, then the increase is still about 15%. That compares to 10.5% in the first quarter. I think, together, if enforcement that I, of course, dearly hope will continue to increase, increases should be possible further. It will not be forever 15%, though. Then on the Philippines, well, on the volume, this is, of course -- we will separate that out until the year has left and that then this becomes part of the organic and underlying business. So it will continue until then. For the Philippines itself, maybe let me add a word there. It’s going really well. The market is growing, expected to grow 8% to 10% for the full year. Marlboro is going strong in the market, benefiting from improved distribution, so -- it has a share of market of 21% there. The integration is going really well. Cost-saving potential that we saw before the acquisition, more and more is confirmed. We see that, for example, in terms of tobacco usage. So it's going well. It's going nicely. I'm very happy with this business combination in the Philippines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede from Credit Suisse.
Thilo Wrede - Crédit Suisse AG: Hermann, I think at the beginning of the year, you talked about that you had already taken 2/3 of the prices that you saw necessary to achieve your guidance. Are you done with all the necessary price increases by now? Or is there more coming in the second half of the year?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, pricing is always a little bit skewed or very much skewed towards the beginning of the year because this is when governments makes their budgets. And this is then when our pricing decisions follow those governmental budget decisions. So I would only -- I always have to limit myself to the actuals here. You have seen that we just announced a price increase in the Russian market or implementing a price increase in the Russian market. Let me put it this way, we are fully on track with our pricing plans to achieve the results that are reflected in our EPS guidance.
Thilo Wrede - Crédit Suisse AG: And then are you still planning to buy back $4 billion of your own shares this year? I think you're running well ahead of that pace by now.
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, that we have a higher amount so far that is driven by the old share repurchase program that we finished in April. So that was a higher going rate in there. The decision is to be in the range of $4 billion for the full year. That's still the plan.
Thilo Wrede - Crédit Suisse AG: And any updates on the attempts to buy pro-tobacco in Colombia? Are there any new developments in that story?
Hermann Waldemer: It's still a pending process, an ongoing process. We don't have a decision yet. I would say the outcome is open.
Operator: Our final question comes from Thomas Russo of Gardner.
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo: In the Western European markets that are sagging from Marlboro, and generally show challenging through the economic conditions. To what extent are you beginning to see evidence of increased illicit or contraband coming into those markets?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, in the German market, there is a little bit of an increase, maybe a percentage point or something in the broader sales. So that is 20%, 21%, right now, of consumption in the German market. From market increases in the other markets, no, I don't see.
Operator: That was our final question. I'll now turn it back to management for closing remarks.
Hermann Waldemer: Let me close, just couple of remarks then. I think we have had another strong quarter. Our underlying business is there, pricing power continues. We are competitive in the marketplace. And thanks to our global footprint, we are able to compensate excise tax hiccups, which we are managing through. And based on the currency at prevailing rates, that situation looks a bit better, hence the increase in our guidance. Thank you very much. I'll hand it back to Nick.
Nicholas Rolli: Thank you, Hermann, and thank you, all, for joining us. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team in Lausanne, Switzerland. The telephone number is posted on our website and also on our press release. Thank you, again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International and the question – I'm sorry– by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be talking about results in the first quarter 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009 unless otherwise stated. References to volume are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares of the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions and net revenue data excludes excise taxes. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating company's income or OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs and adjustments to EPS as well as reconciliation to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter. With all our financial results in line with our constant currency, mid-to-long-term annual growth targets despite some unwelcome developments on the excise tax front. Cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 0.7% to 240.7 billion units, including 6.1 billion additional units resulting from our business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. On an organic basis, volume declined by 2.3%, a very satisfactory result in what is still a difficult economic environment in many parts of the world and we remain confident that we can achieve our full cost, 1.5% decline in organic volume for 2010 as a whole. Overall, volume developments in Japan are obviously the biggest unknown element contained in this forecast. There are four main factors that impact our volume, the economic environment, consumer behavior, excise taxation and our competitiveness in the marketplace. Emerging economies in Asia are continuing to grow and we are seeing an improved outlook in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico. We have commodity prices recovering, there are also signs of stabilization in Eastern Europe though this has yet to translate into higher employment levels and improved purchasing power. Across the EU, however, economic conditions remain difficult. Premium volume is growing in several emerging markets such as Algeria, Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico. Consumer down trading is moderating in Russia and we are cautiously optimistic that the market will stabilize towards the end of the year. However, price sensitivity remains high across the EU, putting pressure on the premium segment in these markets. On a global basis, improvements in employment levels will be the key for consumer trading to resume. The other element of adult consumer behavior that is impacting industry volume is illicit trade. While stricter laws and better enforcement have had a positive impact in Canada where a duty paid industry volume was up over 10% in the first quarter, illicit trade remains a significant issue across the wide range of geographies particularly those which has been subject to large tax driven price increases. Excise taxation is, of course, a key factor influencing industry volume. Most governments are continuing to pursue a policy of reasonable increases as they recognize that this optimizes their long-term revenues and avoids the unintended negative consequences of increased illicit trade and consumer down trading. Meanwhile, excise tax structures continue to improve on a global basis. The latest very important example of this is the new EU excise tax directive which is premised on gradual tax increases, includes three important structural improvements and provides visibility through 2018. The increase in the maximum specific total tax ratio from 55% to 76.5% will allow governments to introduce excise tax systems with a very high specific element. A gradual reduction in the difference in taxes between fine cut and cigarettes will over time lessen the tax advantage of roll your own and make your own products. Finally, the removal of the previous cap on minimum excise taxes provides governments with a much stronger fiscal mechanism to limit down trading, which is important in the context of the recent decision of the European Code of Justice not to allow the continuation of the current minimum reference price systems in Austria, France and Ireland. Nevertheless, there continue to be a few countries which, from time to time, implement unreasonable disruptive increases. In 2009, we had Brazil and Ukraine. This year, we have Romania and Turkey where taxes increased by over 30% in general. Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that industry volume in these two markets was down by double digits in the first quarter as consumers turn to cheaper contraband and counterfeit products. PMI estimates that illicit supplies have doubled to 36% of cigarette consumption in Romania and has recently increased substantially in the eastern part of Turkey. The Greek government, meanwhile, defied logic by decreasing the minimum excise tax at the same time as it increased the abnormal excise tax rate. We anticipate this will result in consumer down trading as price gaps widen. Old price product was still extensively available in the first quarter. Therefore, the main impact is expected to be felt starting in the second quarter. Due to such unintended consequences, there appears to be a strong likelihood that government revenue targets in these countries will not be met and we hope that, going forward, these governments will take a more appropriate approach to excise taxation. Finally, we have Japan, where the Parliament has approved the government's proposal to increase excise taxes by an unprecedented 70 yen per pack in October of this year. As I said earlier, it is very difficult to predict what the impact will be on industry volume. PMI has obtained permission to increase prices by 20 yen per pack this June. However, we have now decided not to implement this price move. The fourth element impacting our volume is, of course, our competitiveness, which remains as strong as ever. We continue to gain share across many key developed and emerging markets, driven by a superior brand portfolio and consumer relevant innovation. Boding well for the future, our smoker shared among legal age minimum 18-24 years old is at least five points higher than our smoker share among legal age 64 year old in a wide selection of markets. Marlboro had a strong performance in the first quarter. With total volume down just 4.6% and up by 1.4% excluding Romania and Turkey. Asia continues to be the key driver for Marlboro. Thanks notably to Japan, Korea and the Philippines. The brand also performed very well in the Latin America and Canada region with volume and share increases in Argentina and Mexico, only partly offset by the impact of industry volume softness in Brazil. Marlboro volume increased significantly in North Africa and we saw an improvement in duty free sales. Nevertheless, volume was down 1.2% in the EEMA region as a whole, due to the aforementioned tax driven price increases. Price sensitivity in Germany and a very difficult economic situation in Spain and the overall industry volume decline negatively impacted Marlboro shipments in the EU region which were down 6.2%. It should be highlighted that today over 60% of the brand's volume is in fact generated outside the EU region. The strong performance of Marlboro has been driven by the rollout of the new architecture and successful innovative line extensions. Marlboro Filter Plus in the red line notably achieved a 2.8% market share in Kuwait. Marlboro Gold Touch in the gold line had a 1.4% share in Italy. Finally, Marlboro Black Menthol in the fresh line achieved a 1.3% market share in Japan. Our success with consumer relevant innovations has provided us with incremental volume and has reinforced the equity of the overall Marlboro franchise. Marlboro has been complemented by a broad portfolio of leading international and local brands. In these difficult economic times, our international low price brands has been performing particularly well. With strong volume growth for Bond Street, Next and Red & White, as well as local brands, such as Delicados in Mexico and Optima in Russia. So let me now look at our performance on a geographic basis. In the EU region that a premium segment continues to be under pressure from the difficult economic environment and high unemployment, PMI obtained an estimated 38.4% market share, down just 0.2 share points whereas Marlboro share declined 0.3 points to 18.3%. L&M share grew by 0.5 points to a record level of 5.7%. Our strategy of establishing a strong brand at the lower end of the market invest in Europe as we have done successfully elsewhere around the world is clearly working well. In Japan, our market share grew by 0.3 points in the quarter to 24.2%, thanks to the condition strong growth of Marlboro and the much improved performance of Lark, both driven by the success of our products innovation strategy. In Korea, our strong momentum continued with a market share gain of 3.6 points, led by Marlboro and Parliament. In the very important Russian market, we achieved a further market share gain of 0.5 percentage points to reach 25.6%, driven by the excellent performance of Bond Street, which is the fastest growing brand in Russia and has captured a disproportionately large share of consumer down trading during the recession. The market share of above premium Parliament is stable and the share of mid priced Chesterfield increased during the quarter, an early sign that the down trading trend in Russia is abating. These developments auger well for the time when Russian consumers are more confident and start to trade up again. We have also reinforced our industry leadership in several other emerging markets. Our market share in Ukraine was up 0.4 percentage points to 36.2%. In Turkey, in spite of the unfavorable impact on the premium segment of the large excise tax driven price increases in general this year, our share resisted well, being down 1.5 points at 14.9%. In Indonesia, our volume grew by 5.7% as a mild continued to show tremendous momentum and our overall share remains stable. In the Philippines, the recently completed transaction with Fortune Tobacco provided us with a combined market share of approximately 90% in March. And the integration of the two companies is proceeding very smoothly. We had a very strong quarter also in the Latin America in Canada region with share gains notably in Argentina and Mexico. Higher prices in nearly all key markets across the world enabled us to obtain strong revenue growth, despite the lower organic volume. In the first quarter, we achieved the favorable pricing variance of $449 million, including inventory windfalls resulting from the sale of old tax product at new prices in the EEMA region. Net revenues, reach $6.5 billion. This represents an increase of 16. 1%, compared to last year in the very robust increase of 6.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was $2.8 billion, up 17% over the previous year and 8.6% higher, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our adjusted OCI margin, excluding the impact of currency grew by 0.4 points in the quarter to 42.7% with increases in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. The reduction in the OCI margin in the Asia region reflects the inclusion in the quarter of $6.1 billion units in the Philippines resulting from our business combination with FTC which were consolidated and resold with no additional margin. Going forward on adjusted OCI margins, will be impacted by the delusion effect of this and surprisingly emerging market OCI margins tend to be lower initially than the PMI average. However, over time, such transactions enhance the volume and profitability growth potential of PMI. Our improved adjusted OCI margins take into account higher tobacco leaf costs, which this year are expected to amount to $200 million. This increase will be largely offset by productivity savings and manufacturing and overall, we are on track to realize our planned $500 million in productivity and cost savings in 2010 and our three-year cumulative savings of $1.5 million. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.90 in the first quarter, a significant increase of 21.6% over 2009 and up by a very robust 13.5%, excluding currency. Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 38.3% higher at $2 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 29.2%. The growth in our cash flow was driven mainly by higher net earnings, stricter forestalling regulations most notably in Poland and the initial positive impact on inventory durations of our $750 million to $1 billion three-year working capital improvement program. We have further leveraged our operating cash flow growth through tight controls on capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow increased at the faster rate of 42.3% to $1.8 billion and by 33.2%, excluding currency. We have also been active on the financing front. We issued a $1 billion 10 year bond with a 4.5% coupon in March and established a new $2.5 billion bank revolver to replace two facilities that were maturing later this year. Since the spin, we have issued over $14 billion in well-laddered bonds in three currencies with an attractive average cost of 5.5%. Our total available bank revolver credit now stands at $5.2 billion. And these facilities remain undrawn. Our profitability growth momentum, very solid balance sheet and tremendous cash flow have enabled us to establish strong A2 and A long-term credit ratings, which we intend to maintain, thus insuring condition access to the tier 1 commercial paper market. Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders well. During the first quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to purchase an additional $36.1 million shares and had just $257 million left on our current program, which will be completed on schedule by the end of this month. We have announced a new three year $12 billion program that will start in May. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an analyzed basis represented an attractive yield of 4.5% on April 19. So let me summarize the first quarter. We achieved very strong financial results, pricing power remains intact, our superior brand portfolio and successful innovation drove market share gains across a wide range of geographies and we grew our cash flow at a rapid pace. There were nevertheless some road bumps from excise taxation in a few markets, though the global economic environment is showing signs of recovery. As a consequence, our overall business outlook is also expected to improve during the second half of the year, which should enable us to build further on our good momentum, though the impact of the October Japanese tax increase remains uncertain. Finally, I'm very pleased to reaffirm today our reported diluted EPS guidance of $3.75 to $3.85 for the full year 2010, reflecting a growth rate of some 16% to 19% off our 2009 EPS of $3.24. Exchange rates today are more favorable than they were in February. However, we have decided to maintain our guidance at this stage in the year, reflecting a more cautious stance on Japan in light of recent developments. Accordingly, our guidance on a constant currency basis represents a reported diluted EPS growth rate of some 10% to 13%. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Your first question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Hi, Hermann
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, David.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Hermann, the reduction in the underlying growth rate target excluding currency for the year, is that solely due to the roll back of the proposed price increase in Japan? Or are there other factors afoot?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Look, I'm in the first and most important statement here to make I believe is that our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. Just look at our Q1 results, I think, they are a testament to that statement of that fact. The second point really is that currency is more favorable now and we’ve decided not to reflect that favorability in increase of the guidance because we took a more cautious stance on Japan overall. So I wouldn't link it to this June event only. It is just – look, we are five months ahead now of the October 1 tax increase. And at this point in time, there are kind of only two things that we really know and more things that we actually don't know at this point in time. So what we know is, yeah, there will be this excise increase on October 1 and the roll over on the margin neutral basis is 82 yen per pack. That we know. The second thing we know is we have decided not to implement the previously approved 20 yen pack per price increase in June, but what we don't know is then the consumer reaction we will see in the market the price elasticity, adjusted in Q1 without any price whatsoever, volumes were down in the market by 4.5% about we don't know what the trade loading patterns are going to be, what the competitive situation will be and therefore, what our final pricing decision will be which we haven't made yet.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Okay. But outside of Japan on a local currency basis in totality, is the business more or less tracking to plan?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes. That was my statement number one.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Yeah.
Hermann Waldemer: We have really, of course, I mean, you have a couple of excise developments. We all have heard about Turkey or Greece or Romania. And we know that the situation remains difficult to start from an economic point of view in Spain. But there are also other elements like a slowdown of the down trading in Russia continued good momentum in Indonesia, so then we come back to really a worldwide business and the balancing effects of a worldwide business.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just a quick second question, Hermann. $1.8 billion in buy backs for the first quarter, is the plan for the year still just to do $4 billion?
Hermann Waldemer: In the range of $4 billion, yes, that has not changed.
David Adelman – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning. Chris.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. I have – just to be clear on your volume assumption for the year, the negative 1.5% organic decline, would that include Japan in that figure whatever may happen around the tax increase?
Hermann Waldemer: I would say that contains a kind of the middle of the road assumption for Japan. But as I said in my remarks, Japan is of course the biggest uncertainty in that forecast..
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Sure. Okay. And I had just two other questions related to pricing, first as you see that and if you saw, just forgive me, I may have missed it. But you said, last quarter you took roughly two-thirds of the price you needed for the year. Could you update us on where you stand in terms of the price increases you have taken in need for your guidance for the year?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah. Okay. Look, I mean we all know that price increases that tend to happen more toward the beginning of the year, because this is when governments also make their budgets. So that number of course has further increased. I don't have the precise number here. It will be in the neighborhood of 70% by now.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Got you. And the other question I have was just to be clear on how the – I guess kind of the accounting worked around in the EEMA region where you had the big benefit from pricing you mentioned something in your prepared remarks about that. I just was curious. Did that reverse in Q2, I guess?
Hermann Waldemer: No. It is not reverse. It is a long time benefit which is shown in the pricing variance.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. That is the benefit from selling at new prices, like in advance of tax increases? Is that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: That's correct, yes.
Chris Growe – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. Got you. All right, that's great. Thanks a lot.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Hi, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Hermann, just in the Asia region, the margin declines you've talked about the impact from the acquisition. But the profit was also down year-over-year. And I'm just trying to understand what really happened, outside of the acquisition impact.
Hermann Waldemer: Well, there's always a little bit of inventory movement. I mean the shipment changes on the Japanese market, always clear over there. There is nothing underlying or on the fundamentals from, the impact really there, the unusual or unique thing, onetime thing is those $6 billion volumes in the Philippines, where essentially the margins on those volumes had been taken, if you see they have – before the business combination, before the transaction, that is why when you consolidate them in and you resell them to the trade, you have no additional margin. That is a onetime effect there.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: But you get the benefit of the volume and the revenues, but you really don't get the benefit of the profit. And you are saying this is one quarter impact?
Hermann Waldemer: This is only – this time one time impact, which has to do with the around the acquisition. That is part of the – around the transaction of the acquisition, around the transaction. It is a onetime impact that you see that way on the consolidated numbers. But that is not going to be repeated. So the only other thing which of course you will continuously have is overall, emerging markets margins tend to bring down OC I margins initially, because these markets tend to have lower margins than the average. But that is usually an initial effect only.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And can you quantify that impact in the quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: If you would take that out, then you would be down to 1.7.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Margin would be down 1.7?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Yeah. Okay, all right. And then Hermann, just in terms of the markets like Romania and Turkey, where you have seen pretty sizable tax increases and obviously the impact on demand. Does the magnitude of the decline, particularly in Romania just seems very large? Can you just talk about, maybe the illicit trade and sort of, when can we see that trend improving, or is the government really looking to crack down more aggressively? What are you guys doing to sort of mitigate that issue? It just takes time for that issue to just get resolved and we are just going to have to deal with this for the next few quarters?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean Romania, unfortunately, is an example of how not to do it from a government perspective. There were several price increases, tax increases already in the market. April, September of last year, again, January this year. Now, illicit trade has literally exploded, doubled from before, 18% to 36% now. To crack down on this, is much more difficult than to take a reasonable decision beforehand. So of course, we try to help. But the real help would be there to come back on decisions, which rarely happens. In markets I must say. So yeah, it has driven prices in Romania to a point where I mean the average net income in Romania is anything between 1400 and 1500 Romania leis. And the pack of cigarettes is in the range of 10 leis. I think that tells you everything. It just went beyond. The government took it too far and that is what we are faced by now. That will of course not meet the revenue targets. I hope that it will come to a more normal situation, but I don't give you a short-term hope for that.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then finally Hermann, just in terms of Marlboro's performance in the quarter, looks like the volume decline has actually moderated even though your overall organic volume continues to be challenging. So is it fair to say a lot of the improvement is starting to really show up in more markets, as you have gone through these brand architecture initiatives. And maybe some of the markets where you are actually seeing better trends more recently versus the last two quarters, can you talk about some of those markets?
Hermann Waldemer: It is obvious that in difficult economic times, it is more difficult for a premium brand than it is for a low priced brand. So therefore, in that environment, I think the market performances are very, very good performance. And there are so many examples around the world. We talked about in this, before in Asia and Latin America, where the growth is, actually, even if you didn't look a little closer into Europe, this is not an EU problem either, because there are a number of important markets in the EU where Marlboro is doing pretty well as well, with substantial increases in share like Italy, Portugal, Poland, or also the Netherlands would be good examples. Then if you really looked into where we have share declines, then there are specific reasons. Germany is really a very price sensitive market that you can recognize that from the growth of trade brands renewed of growth of trade brands in the market. What did we do about it? Well, we have established now L&M at the low end of the market. And it's doing extremely well and almost compensating the losses there. So that's why you can do in such an environment, or you go to France, there actually we have a second premium brand, which is almost picking up the share losses that we make for Marlboro which is Philip Morris Filter Kings. And then you have two others with Greece and Spain, where the declines are simply linked to the economic situation. So there are specific problems here and there. But if you take it all together, I see many more positive signs around the world than problems. And with the problems you have to deal.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Leinster of UBS.
John Leinster – UBS: Good morning. Just a couple of things, first of all, can you actually quantify that inventory gain you took in the EEMA region?
Hermann Waldemer: No. I wouldn't go to a specific number here. It was a sizable number. It is by the – highlighted in our remarks but I wouldn't want to quantify.
John Leinster – UBS: Okay. Secondly, in terms of Western Europe, I mean there's obviously been some quite significant price increases in many of the major markets in recent times, particularly, obviously Spain, France and Germany. I think given the ongoing, unfavorable economic conditions and indeed in some of those markets as you say continuing down trade, is that likely to be the ongoing policy? Or would you expect it to moderate a bit?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, you know that forward-looking pricing I will not comment. There is only one thing out there which is a fact that as everybody knows, VAT goes up by two percentage points in Spain in July.
John Leinster – UBS: Okay. Just going back to the previous question, how far is the new Marlboro architecture should be imposed in those Western European markets? How long has it been fully introduced?
Hermann Waldemer: Right. It is not being imposed. It is implemented as appropriate on a market-to-market basis. The European markets – we are pretty well advanced. On a worldwide basis there is a lot more to come. And I would even go that far to say look, it's not a program that has just to be worked down and then we are done with it. New Marlboro architecture innovation is an ongoing thing. It is about having a pipeline always ready that kind of brings you into the next three years and that is what we will continue to do.
John Leinster – UBS: Okay. Lastly, I'm I right in saying there is no particular rules against trade loading in Japan, or is there any rules stopping retailers from loading up ahead of that tax increase?
Hermann Waldemer: No. There is no such rule yet. There is no excise tax advantage in the Japanese market, but the retailers, yes, can load more if they want to.
John Leinster – UBS: Thanks.
Hermann Waldemer: You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from of Thilo Wrede of Credit Suisse.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Thilo.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: Quick follow-up question on Japan and the impact that market has on your currency neutral EPS growth guidance. Should we read from the reduction of the growth guidance that you are now less confident that you will get a good enough price increase in October to offset the volume impact from the tax increase?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, as I said before, I don't know what the situation is going to be. We have not made our pricing decision yet. It is just we felt that at this point in time, five months ahead of that date, it is prudent and wise to take a cautious stance.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: But why have you gotten more cautious on your ability to take pricing in Japan since February when you confirmed the guidance at Cagney.
Hermann Waldemer: We had a sequence of event in the Japanese market as well. We initially decided to increase our prices by 20 in June. As we all know, you have to go through an approval process, with the Japanese government there and we did that and we got it's approved. And then thereafter we found ourselves in a fairly uncompetitive situation as other companies had made different decisions. So our final decision in this case was to give priority to volume and market share over profitability.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: Which is a departure from your usual approach, right? My impression has always been that you prefer to take pricing over volume growth, isn't that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: No. It is actually perfectly in line with our approach. When we make pricing decisions for any market around the world and we will look at the level of the excise tax or the increase of thereof, we will look at the excise structure or the change of that structure. We will look at government revenue expectations. We will look at overall affordability, expected price elasticity or consumer reaction and we will make an assessment of the competitive situation. And after having done all that we will make a pricing decision. That is valid for Japan like it is for any other market.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: Okay. And one completely unrelated question, I was little bit surprised by the low cash bonds that you showed, especially given the strong free cash flow that you had. Can you help me understand what happens below the operating cash flow line? Why cash is so low?
Hermann Waldemer: No. There is nothing specific in there. This is timings on a day-by-day basis. So it's a little lower than we typically run, but these are normal fluctuations, just nothing specific there.
Thilo Wrede – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Welcome.
Operator: Next question comes from Christine Farkas of Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Christine.
Christine Farkas – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: I just as a broad question I think every quarter, every year you talk about the potential for pricing to be more difficult or the ability to take pricing to be more difficult. And your price variance is still pretty stable at $449 million as you have indicated. I am wondering do you still feel the same way are you still comfortable with your ability to take pricing at this rate? And then I have a follow-up.
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I can't talk about the future in terms of amounts, because we will see what the future brings. But I can answer your question that way. That our pricing power, I believe has remained intact.
Christine Farkas – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: And there is nothing aside from some country variables clearly that are difficult to predict? There is nothing structurally again changing your view of your ability to take pricing?
Hermann Waldemer: No. Structurally, it’s principally excise tax structures and therefore in this area of excise structures. I actually see continuous improvement despite some unpleasant developments that we have discussed earlier.
Christine Farkas – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Philippines, you talked about the one-time impact from the benefit of getting volumes and revenue and not profits on the merger, was that a one-time impact for the quarter or for the full year what we’ll see that margin pressure from that transaction?
Hermann Waldemer: It was a one-time in the quarter.
Christine Farkas – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: In the quarter. Thank you very much, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: As markets are improving, are you finding consumers are trading back to premier brands? Is that movement in line with expectations?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean just start if you all know it's not a – has never been a phenomenon around the world. I mean let me pick therefore the most important market really in that context, which is Russia. And there just is a couple of things, when I look at our distributor, ex-distributor sales in the market of in the first quarter. Then I see that premium volumes are still down 12, but no longer 13, 13.5 like they were in the fourth quarter. The growth in the value and below is about 11. But it was 16, 17% in Q4. A look at our Nielsen market shares. I see that Parliament brand is flat at about 2.9% market share. I see a high mid priced brand Chesterfield that is picking up share of 0.3% to 3.3% of the market. So these are good signs, there that things begin to improve. So it’s signs of recovery. It isn't recovery, yet. It’s not up trading yet. But the day will come. So up trading therefore is not a question of if, it's a question of when in this important market.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: All right. And then secondly, just on raw material costs, any change in costs?
Hermann Waldemer: No, no surprises. What I said about leaf is what I had communicated also earlier, so no real big surprises there.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport: Great. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Hi, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: My previously question about Russia, first of all, are you able to give your revenue market share and how that's progressed over the last few courses?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, I don't have the revenue share here. Or I don't know it by hard. But the revenue share, of course, is clearly higher than our market share.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: So the question is it improving, because I suppose – because the question behind the question is you are doing very well with some low priced brands like Optima and Bond Street. And I was wondering whether what impact that’s having on your mix in that market relative to the market as a whole?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah. Look I mean, overall, of course over this time. The share of premium in that market has come down and the share of low has gone up. I mean that’s not a surprise. Being able in such a context to increase your market share means that you do have international and local brands at the lower end of the market, which enable you to capture these down traders and actually, in particular Bond Street has been doing extremely well in attracting those smokers. So it is the benefits of a complete portfolio that you see in Russia. But that this is a certain effect is clear. But at the end of the day in dollars, the margin is flat.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Thank you. And turning to the more broader EEMA Region, is it fair to say that the source of price mix you would have got without the one-time gain from the tax issue. Would have been roughly similar to what you might have got let's say, in the fourth quarter? In terms of price mix?
Hermann Waldemer: Without the windfall? Should be pretty, pretty similar, yes, it should be pretty similar, absolutely.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Thank you very much. And just finally, geographically which markets we do not occur in this gain?
Hermann Waldemer: Now, look at in. Now we go to market profitability. I'm sorry, I can't.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: No. But surely you can say, the main impact was in Turkey or the main impact was in, I'm not looking for profit by market. I’m just trying to understand where this thing happened?
Hermann Waldemer: You look to big markets in the EEMA Region or Russia, the Ukraine, Turkey, the Middle East and GCC.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hermann Waldemer: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our final question comes from Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo & Gardner.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Hi, Hermann. Good morning.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Good move on responding to the Japanese market quirky developments. I'm pleased to hear what you have done. A question in Russia, you mentioned at the start of the downturn two years ago that you were well prepared because you had a full price tier and you thought you would travel up and down with the consumer. And I'm wondering in the other markets of EEMA that we just side in Adams questions. Did you also have a full price tier? And what was it about those markets they didn’t, maybe didn't allow you to travel up and down with the consumer as well as you did in Russia?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, let's go to the neighboring market there is go to straight to Ukraine then. The situation there is actually similar in terms of market share gain. We did achieve market share gains in the Ukraine as well. However, the market actually has behaved differently. The market has been contracting, driven by a series of excise in price increases, but actually contracting more or less on an equal basis. So if you look at Q1, total market actually, then the premium and the low of the total market I'm talking now is pretty much the same. And you have a little bit of a change between mid and value it just below mid.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Yeah.
Hermann Waldemer: So it is stable segments. In that sense it’s different. But did we have the brands to keep up our market shares or in other markets the answer is, yes. Or you go to another one you like, Turkey very recently and right now, actually we have lock in place at the lower end of the market, which is doing extremely well in a difficult environment for premium brands like Marlboro or Parliament.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Thank you. Thank you, Hermann. Then Hermann, in Poland, you had this remarkable in-switching effect that took place and drove the market up 4% and Marlboro up 11. What markets would you say have the chance, if governments get it right to have the same kind of in-switching left? Is there anything that stands out for you in that regard?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, in Poland, yes, they have really made tremendous improvement on regulation in that area or on the excise tax system there. They closed really a loophole that they had in there and that causes this back switching into the cigarette market. If you look at EU total, because I mean that’s pretty much happening in the EU to start with, then this is only going to be gradual and is going to be gradual along the changes that you have seen in the new excise tax directive, which does increase over time earlier own taxes. Actually, another important market where you see back switching in a different form that we are really happy about it would be Canada. The people switch back from illegal trade into the regular cigarette market.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: I see. And then last question, you mention in the fortune tobacco company, consolidation in Philippines that you will enjoy cost synergies. Any look toward revenue synergies that might come about from consolidating your respective shares. And talk just a second about how what the fortune tobacco corporations business looked like in terms of its position to the consumer and how that will work for you? Last thing is to think about India in the same context of what you will extract from the Philippines. Since you'll have a chance to possibly partner in India and then develop that market in the way like what you might see in the Philippines?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. I mean in the Philippines really I mean the transaction, our combination of the two businesses that has really just started. I think our guys are doing a tremendous job and the guys from FTC do a tremendous job they are to get being together now. We have got to give them some time. The brands and the portfolio are complimentary. I think we can learn from each other in sales and distribution. We can look at manufacturing for the focus for now really isn't all that for the rest. Let's wait and see. On India, really the thing is, I mean, you have seen that there are further restrictions actually on foreign investment that have come up in India very recently. These actually should not have an impact on our business. We have established last year a new business structure in India that has laid the foundation for organic volume growth in that market. So we have an entity we control, which is the – is holding the license for the international brands, then the manufacturing. And the distribution is happening let’s got the Philips, so we don’t manufacture in India to start this so we are not hit by that new regulation. I think we have a good structure in place, but to translate the Philippine model into India is probably not too well because of Indian regulations.
Thomas Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Thank you very much, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Rolli for any closing marks remarks.
Nick Rolli: Thank you for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team in Lausanne , Switzerland. The telephone number is posted on our press release that was issued earlier today. Thank you again. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International fourth quarter 2009 and year end earnings conference call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question and answer session. (Operator’s instructions). Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusions of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2009 fourth quarter and year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com. During our call today we will be talking about results in the fourth quarter or the full year 2009 an comparing them with the same period in 2008 unless I stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume to market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. And net revenue data excludes excise taxes.  You’ll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating company’s income or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs. And adjustments to earnings per share as well as reconciliations to US GAAP measures. At the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website.  Today’s remarks contain forward looking statements and projection of future results. And I direct your attention to the forward looking and cautionary statement disclosure in today’s presentation and news release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It’s not my please to introduce Louie Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer who will join Louie for the question and answer period. Louie?
Louis C. Camilleri: Thank you, Nick and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It’s a pleasure to review our fourth quarter and full year results with you and share our outlook for the coming year. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across all financial metrics. And helped us to achieve a full year financial performance that met or exceeded our mid to long term targets.  These results were accomplished despite the challenges we faced in numerous markets that bore the brunt of the global economic downturn. And a testament to the vigor and breathe of our brand portfolio, the geographic diversity of our earnings and the inherently favorable characteristics of the industry in which we are privileged to participate. And most notably, the pricing power that we enjoy relative to the broader consumer package goods sector. Our volume performance in the fourth quarter was solid. In part reflecting the reversal of the timing issues that dampened our third quarter numbers that had caused such unnecessary anguish at the time. Full year cigarette volume fell marginally below the 2008 level. And on an organic basis was just 1.5% lower. While any volume erosion, even if models tends to garner a disproportionate attention. In this instance I would venture to say that our performance was, in fact, quite solid.  The combination of stubbornly high unemployment levels, lower discretionary incomes and tax induced pricing took their toll on volumes. Most notably in Spain, Ukraine, the Baltics, Romania, Serbia and Columbia. Which all suffered extraordinary double digit contractions. Indeed absent those six markets, we are the market leader in four of them, we would have posted a marginally positive organic volume growth number for the full year.  Our market share performance was one of the key highlights of the year, with 70% of our top 30 income markets registering a stable or growing trend. Those few markets that incurred share erosion suffered to varying degrees from either consumer down trading or competitors seeking to bolster their share by fully or partially absorbing excise tax increases for several weeks or months. The widespread nature of our solid share performance is under scored by our momentum in both OECD and non OECD markets. Which reflect the impact of our product innovation and enhanced consumer engagement activities, as the year unfolded. And the gradual elimination of the price advantage enjoyed by some competitors. A much discussed concern over the last few quarters has been the fate of the industry’s premium segment and whether or not consumers will slowly abandon it and seek the lower priced products. The evidence clearly suggest that such a phenomenon has been relatively restrictive. And that the potential for widespread contamination did not materialize that some may have feared. While the premium segment suffered significant erosion in several markets, and most notably in Spain, Russia and Germany, it held up remarkably well in markets as varied as Turkey and the Ukraine. And in the quarter, actually, sustained its growth momentum in markets such as Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Poland and Greece.  The disciplined roll out of Marlboro’s new brand, Architecture continued the pace as the year unfolded. While the brand’s overall volume performance suffered from the market contraptions that occurred primarily in the European Union and in Eastern Europe, it faired remarkably well in numerous markets. Volume growth of 4.3% in Asia was particularly note worthy with solid market share performances in Japan, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippians.  We (inaudible) early signs of the brands new architecture are positive. And our efforts to enhance the brands vibrancy are starting to bear fruit. The brand’s demographic profile has responded as intended and it is gaining share in both developed markets, such as Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece and developing markets such as Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippians, Romania, Algeria, Morocco and Poland. While much remains to be done, we believe that we are on the right track and that the brands consumer appeal will be ever stronger going forward. I would be remiss if I did not highlight L&Ms performance in 2009, particularly in the fourth quarter. The brand exemplified the strength of our portfolio and the key strategic walls that it and the others played in our operating model.  In the European Union, L&M’s volume grew by close to 9% in 2009. And was up over 17% in the fourth quarter. It’s performance was such that it more than offset Marlboro’s volume erosion in the European Union during the quarter. Also of note, the long hopefully stabilization of the brand, historical strong hold in Eastern Europe appears to have now materialized as evidenced by the fact that L&M’s volume was flat for the quarter in this important region despite continued share erosion in Russia. Net revenues of $25 billion rose 7.5% for the year, excluding the adverse currency hit of $2.6 billion. And we’re up 5.35 for the full year excluding currency and acquisitions. In the fourth quarter currency turned in our favor and net revenues were up a sharp 9.7% or 7.2% excluding the favorable impact of currency and acquisitions. Adjusted operating companies income increased by 8.7% for the year, and 8.9% for the quarter. Both excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, our adjusted OCI margin rose a full 1.4 percentage point to reach a level of 42.8%. Again, on a constant balance basis. With each region contributing to the strong performance. Pricing across the vast majority of markets was the key driver of our strong constant currency operating company’s income growth. Contributing nearly $2 billion to the full year, and just under $500 million for the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by an adverse volume mix variance of $570 million for the full year and a more modest $90 million for the quarter. Of particular relevance is apprised variance offset the adverse volume mixed variance by a ratio of 3.5%-1% for the year and 5.1%-1% for the quarter. Those ratios will hopefully put to bed the end of the debate on the appropriate balance between volume and impact. Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year increased by $0.51 or 15.4% on a currency neutral basis. The principle contributors to this strong constant currency performance were operations growth of $0.47 and the impact of share repurchases as $0.19, partially offset by an increase in interest cost of $0.17. As a quarter, adjusted diluted EPS rose $0.11 or 15.5%, excluding a marginal unfavorable currency variance of $0.01 due to adverse currency on the interest and tax line more than offsetting the modest benefit on the operating line.  Operations growth contributed $0.09 and share repurchases $0.06. Partially offset by higher interests costs of $0.04.  Discretionary task rate defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures ultimately the most important metric increased by 4.9% or $333 million, the reach slightly more than $7.1 billion in 2009, despite an estimate adverse currency impact of $1.5 billion.  Absent current fee, discretionary cash flow would thus have increased by 26%. In part due to our tight management of working capital and the favorable results of our determined efforts to seek stricter forestalling rules. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to continue to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7.4%, for an annualized rate of $2.32 a share in September. And by year end have deployed $5.5 billion to repurchase close to 130 million shares or 6.5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2009.  All in all, 2009 proved to be a very solid year, especially within the context of the global economic downturn with which we all had to content. And I’m particularly pleased that we achieved most of what we had set out to do this year.  The fragility of the economic recovery and its geographic disparity coupled with its uncertain impact on employment levels and potential currency volatility naturally wants a cautious outlook for 2010. Given our momentum, however, we remain optimistic that while our organic volume performance is likely to parallel that of 2009, reflecting further market contraptions, we will again post strong financial results this year. As amassed in our release, we project reported diluted EPS of between $3.75-$3.85 in 2010. Reflecting a growth rate of some 16%-19% or by 2009 EPS of $3.24. Our prevailing exchange rate, we will benefit from a modest (inaudible). And accordingly our guidance assume a constant currency reported diluted EPS growth rate of some 12%-15%.  Compared to our 2009 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.29, this new guidance projects a growth rate of approximately 14%-17% or 11%-14% excluding currency. The key driver of our earnings growth will continue to be pricing. Of note, is that we have already secured some 2/3 of the pricing that is embedded in our guidance. And remain confident that the remaining sales will be secured. The potential for disrupted excise tax increases is always a risk. So far this year we have witnessed abnormal increases in Greece, Turkey and Romania. Which will undoubtedly effect indiscrete volumes there. More important than the increases to sale, however, especially over the longer term, are potential changes in the structure of excise taxes. And on this front we continue to witness a rational and virtually universal approach.  Greece, is a notable exception. There the government increased the excise tax incidence in January from 57.5% to 63%. An increase of 5.5 percentage points. While actually reducing the minimum excise tax burden. In our humble option, such an action will stimulate significant down trading and revenues will fall substantially short of the government’s expectations. In Japan, the government has called for a 70 yen per pack of 20 cigarettes or 40% excise tax increase effective October 2010. And Parliamentary approval is excepted to be secured by the end of March. Apart from taking into account sales taxes and current trade margin levels, implies a minimum price increase of 82 yen per pack of 20 cigarettes, to remain revenue neutral and per stick basis. Even such a minimum increase is notoriously price sensitive Japanese market will frankly put us in the uncharted territory. But in an effort that will consequence will be the industry volumes will fall severely in the fourth quarter and in 2011. The precise extent of the damage remains to be seen. However, this heavy toll may ultimately prove to be beneficial over time, if the industry simultaneously secures the pricing freedom that has eluded it in the past. We remain cautiously optimistic that such freedom will be granted. As was the case in 2009, we believe that the premium segment in select markets will continue to be under pressure, especially if unemployment remains an intractable issue. But we do not believe that such adverse forces will be either pervasive or particularly disruptive. Indeed we anticipate continued widespread share growth as we further deploy our product innovations and continue to perfect our adult consumer engagement activities, equity enhancing promotions, point of sale presences and distribution infrastructure. On the cost front, we anticipate productivity savings of some $500 million. Essentially in line with the level achieved in 2009. And we also project continued improvement in the management of our working capital as we optimize inventory levels across our entire supply chain.  As previously announced, we believe that our discretionary cash flow growth rate will outpace that of our earnings this year. Our optimism regarding the future is underscored by our announcement this morning of a new three year, $12 billion share repurchase program which will run out of May upon the sole completion of our previous $13 billion two year program.  We anticipate that our total 2010 share repurchases will be in the $4 billion range. We believe that this new program strikes an optimal balance between our relentless desire to continue to reward shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet and credit rating entails.  All in all, we delivered very solid results in 2009 despite a challenging economic environment. We met or exceeded our principle financial targets. And we did so in a high quality manner. We entered 2010 with significant momentum and a potential currency (inaudible).  Thank you. Hermann and I will now be pleased to field any questions you may have.
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question and answer portion of the conference. (Operator’s Instructions) Our first question is coming from Thilo Wrede of Credit Suisse.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Could you give us an outlook or your idea how the Russia market will behavior this year? Will we eventually see a peak of the down trading there? And also, what’s your outlook for Canada and the impact this enforcement of contraband cigarettes could (inaudible) the market there?
Louis C. Camilleri: We anticipate the trends are likely to remain similar to what we witnessed in 2009, Thilo. As the year unfolded the premium segment down trading, actually, abated somewhat. The mid-priced segment, however, down trading continued to the value segment, and we don't really anticipate much of a change there as the economy recovers in Russia. I think hopefully towards the second half we'll see improvements and hopefully certainly in 2011. But I would say in the first half certainly that the trends we saw in the fourth quarter which were better than the previous nine months will probably continue. In terms of Canada, as you know, industry shipments were up in 2009, and we are hopeful that the enforcement activities being taken will continue and hopefully that will also favorably affect industry shipments, and therefore our own volume, because we continue to anticipate share growth of our business there.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then what's your reason for the cost as optimistic regarding pricing freedom in Japan? Can you share that with us?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, as you can imagine we've been in discussions with the government and particularly the ministry of finance, and the indications we've had so far is that they would be favorably inclined to giving us pricing freedom. That's the ministry of finance and we'll see as things unfold. I think we'll get a much better picture within the next month to two months.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. And lastly, and I think the discussion about generic packaging in the UK has increased again in the last few weeks or months, do you see that as a realistic risk and is that something that could spread to the rest of Western Europe?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, let me first put in context, yes, the minister of health in the UK recently gave a speech in which generic packaging was mentioned. I would say that the speech was cautious in terms of such an action, and for the very first time the minister recognized the potential ramifications in terms of intellectual property and the trading or free trade arrangements that they have. So I think people are beginning to recognize there are significant issues, the main one being that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that generic packaging would affect total consumption of cigarettes.  In fact, certain governments, and particularly Sweden and New Zealand, have declined proposals to look into generic packaging specifically for that reason that there is no evidence to suggest that it helps in terms of total consumption which ultimately is the objective of that measure. So I do not believe that it is something that others will follow. It remains a risk, but I think the industry has some very pertinent and powerful arguments against generic packaging, not least of which is the unintended consequence in terms of counterfeit and contraband.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: All right. Thanks a lot, Louis.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon, Louie. First just as a followup to plain packaging, Louis, if any country were to mandate generic packaging, just to be clear, is it fair to assume that you would do everything possible within the law to act aggressively to protect your intellectual property and trademarks?
Louis C. Camilleri: Yes.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly, in terms of the local currency operating profit growth that's embedded in the 2010 forecast, Louis, the last two years you've been either at the high end or above your targets, 2010 it's essentially consistent with the target, is that under conservatism or is there something that you see in the markets that would indicate that 2010 might be a bit more challenging operationally than 2009?
Louis C. Camilleri: I think as I said in my remarks, David, the economic recovery is extremely fragile and I believe that one has to be cautious when one's sitting in January looking at the year. We know for a fact that given the tax abnormal increases, specifically in Turkey and Greece, that will hurt this year. There will be offsetting marks as is always the case, but I don't think there's anything that is out there other than Japan as I mentioned in my remarks, which remains an uncertain picture today and that's probably what you're seeing in terms of the local currency organic operating income growth target.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly, Louie, as it relates to the buyback, am I right that if on a local currency basis over the next several years if you don't make acquisitions, the total trailing growth debt to EBITDA will probably take about 1.6 times and then come down slightly? Am I thinking about that correctly?
Louis C. Camilleri: Yes, you are.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: And so the followup question to that is can't you take it a little bit higher within the existing rating and is there any reason why you should essentially deliver a touch over time?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, we think that the $12 billion program strikes the optimal balance, as I said in my remarks. Between one (inaudible) retaining a very strong balance sheet, David. I just go back to earlier what I said in terms of an uncertain climate going forward. You know that every time we do have a program we complete it on time and indeed if you are right and we get currency favorability we can see in terms of the program itself with regard to its timing. But at this stage we actually are very happy with that program over a three-year period.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Great. Okay thank you very much. Good luck.
Louis C. Camilleri: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Louis, the decision by some of your competitors to partially absorb the tax increases, how concerned are you about those actions and is there a cause for concern that these actions expand and undermine the positive pricing environment that you see in the marketplace?
Louis C. Camilleri: I don't think so, Judy. They're usually temporary skirmishes that we see here and there. The overall environment — what there remains highly competitive is one that I think is relatively favorable, but I think it's inevitable in a highly competitive environment that one company or another in a specific market occasionally tries to take a temporary advantage. But I think everyone is aware that other players will react quite forcefully if the duration of those excise tax absorptions are too long, and I think we're all aware of that. So I wouldn't say that it's a concern. It does however, affect our market share performance in a given quarter over another quarter depending on the market where the skirmish happens.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just in terms of the market share performance, specifically I guess on Marlboro where you have seen a bit of a decline in the fourth quarter in some of the more EU markets, assuming that the macro comes back and things normalize, how confident are you in terms of Marlboro seeing growth again and shares getting better?
Louis C. Camilleri: I would say I'm quite confident, Judy. As you know, there's been a lot of activity on the brand in numerous EU markets in particular. The emphasis so far has really been on the gold line and we have seen significant improvements in demographics. Its share as an SKU or a sub brand family has done better than the full flavor variant, especially in the down trading environment. So it has withstood the down trading more than the parent, if I could call it that.  There's a lot of activity now happening on the parent with the new packaging, the new red packaging which is being rolled out in various markets. And I'm confident that with the economy recovering that the brand will not only gain share of premium, but will actually start gaining share itself, and Italy is a perfect example where in Italy, Marlboro's share is growing for the full year and the quarter, and the numbers suggest that the momentum is indeed accelerating.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then my last question on Indonesia, it looks like in the fourth quarter you had a pretty nice pickup and I guess some of that is just the timing of the Ramadan shift, but maybe you can just give us some color as to what you think Indonesia could do in 2010? Obviously it's a market where up until 2009 it was showing pretty healthy volume growth and it slowed a little bit so I'm just wondering whether you see a nice recovery as we look out over the next few quarters there?
Louis C. Camilleri: You're right. The fourth quarter volume was up double digit in Indonesia and it was principally driven by the timing of Ramadan which heard our fourth quarter as Hermann had told you at the time. Share continues to be relatively strong, particularly behind the A mild and Marlboro. As we've said in the past, shares somewhat is a bit volatile based on the stick prices and when those stick prices go over certain thresholds. Total industry shipments in Indonesia were up 5% which is a pretty attractive number and we would anticipate that those consumption levels would continue. The economy of Indonesia is doing well. There has been excise tax reform which I believe will be favorable going forward. Today we are seeing quite a lot of growth in the low-price segment, and if you recall, there is an excise tax benefit for manufacturers that manufacture cigarettes below a certain threshold. And I think over time, that loophole will be closed and that will be a benefit for us and the bigger players. Let's not forget there are over more than 700 manufacturers, small manufacturers of products that enjoy these excise tax benefits which clearly potentially help employment, but damage government revenues. And I think the trend that we've seen in terms of the surge in the volume of that segment will attenuate as the excise tax reforms take place.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: What's the timing on the excise tax reform?
Louis C. Camilleri: There is a plan which I think is a three-year plan and it's already started to be implemented as of January.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Good afternoon. I'd like, if I can, to try and understand how to reconcile your long-term growth targets with what you've achieved in 2009 and what you appear to be likely in 2010? Because as I understand, what you're saying is that 2010's going to look very much like this last year we've gone through. Organic volume is supposed to be down a little bit, mix little bit negative but very strong pricing leading to good revenue growth and good OCI growth, and buybacks leading to even better EPS growth. But is that EPS growth you've achieved 15% in 2009 and you're saying it's going to beat the top end of your long-term guidance range in 2010? How should I reconcile that apparent contradiction? Or are your long-term targets just too conservative?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, at least having actuals that beat our targets is a good thing, Adam.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: That's certainly true. I'm not complaining.
Louis C. Camilleri: I see what your concern is. It is a long-term target. So far we've done better. I would say that part of our pricing has also been driven by the need for government revenues and as we take pricing in a lot of markets that have an ad valorem tax, that increases government revenues. So pricing has been a big driver, as you know, and will continue to be this year. Whether we'll be able to price indefinitely the way we have, long term, remains a question. I believe that we can give them the relative pricing of cigarettes versus other products and in a number of places they're relatively cheap still, but I would say that excise task threats, as I mentioned in my remarks, to be realistic, is a risk that always is there, Adam. We feel very comfortable with the 10-12. If we can do better, so be it.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: I'm taking out of that that you think the long-term guidance is pretty conservative and that you've got it where it is because there were some threats, like on excise task which may appears, but they may not.
Louis C. Camilleri: Yeah. I wouldn't say that 10%-12% EPS growth rate long term is an unnecessarily conservative number, but I do say that at the moment with the momentum we have, and we proved it in 2009 and we believe can do it in 2010. When we say long term it's for the next 10, 15, 20 years, Adam.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator's Instructions) Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good afternoon, Louis. I just have a couple of questions for you, a bit of a followup. I wondered if you could speak to the different tiers of product and premium, mid tier, and low tier, and basically how those performed in 2009? Was there any material shifting out of premium if you look at the full year or does it get any better in the fourth quarter I guess would be a follow-on question?
Louis C. Camilleri: The evidence would suggest that certainly we saw an improvement in the fourth quarter in most instances. An exception to that was Germany where the premium segment actually, the down trading from the premium was aggravated in the fourth quarter. The two key markets that suffered significant down trading were Germany and Spain and I think however that one has to be very careful because I can give the example about L&M, for example. People are down trading in the EU to L&M. Take the Germany example, or in fact, Spain as well, which has been driving a lot of L&M's growth. What you have to understand is, L&M's average marginal contribution in the European Union is equal to even higher than Marlboro's marginal contribution in Asia, in Latin America, and in the EMA region. It's something that I think you should be cautious about in terms of discussing premium segments versus mid-price segments because if you look at it globally, whilst there may be down trading from primarily the European Union, it is down trading to a level where the marginal contribution is ahead of the company average. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Absolutely, it really depends by region. And I think the same would go, if I'm correct, with the mid-tier category in your Eastern European region as well, right?
Louis C. Camilleri: Correct. 
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: It's a very profitable region for you, I understand. Thank you. So two quick follow ons then, I guess just to kind of get a better sense of kind of looking forward for the EU region, I just want to get a sense of how you're looking at that region and should we expect from a volume standpoint? Is the underlying -3.5 or so this year, is that a good run rate to build in or was that aggravated to your point by economic conditions? And it should be a little better going forward.
Louis C. Camilleri: It was certainly aggravated by economic conditions and I would hope that over the mid to longer term it would get better than that. We did witness an improvement versus 2008 despite the circumstances, but clearly it was dramatically down in Spain and the Baltic's which affected the number you're saying of 3.5%. You take a market like France, consumption or industry shipments was actually up last year, and I think that longer term you would hope that we could do better as an industry than a decline of 3.6% which was the underlying decline that we suffered last year.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, thank you. I just have one follow on. I hate to have Hermann not be able to speak today and maybe this is a better question for him, but my question was just if you look at 2009 just looking backwards at your foreign exchange hit in the year, would you be able to give us kind of an update on how much of that was transaction versus translation?
Hermann G. Waldemer: Well, the transaction and translation is always the question how you define it. Let me answer that way. We had, when we talked about a year ago, at the prevailing exchange rates at that time we were facing an $0.80 hit on EPS level. Actual results have come out, better. Essentially we came out with -$0.53. Out of the $0.80, really the big difference or the big hit there was an assumed $0.58 out of the key emerging markets currencies that ended up to be $0.39 in actual results.  So I think the name of the game forward always will be and remains to be not to look at the euro and the yen only, but also at the key emerging markets currency as the ruble, the Indonesia rupee, the Turkish lira, and the Mexican peso.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karen Lemark of Federated Investors.
Karen Lemark - Federated Investors: I have a few questions. Even just in terms if rates have changed based on the first quarter compared to the first nine months of 2009, are you at the point of saying maybe broadly speaking at that we've seen the worst of the down trading unless we see obviously another leg down in the global economy or massive increases in excise taxes?
Louis C. Camilleri: I would say that that's probably a fair statement. I think we've probably seen the worst in the principle markets. As I mentioned in my remarks, the watch out this year are certainly Turkey, Greece, and Japan. Those are watch outs that we're clearly aware of today. And Germany, we'll see as the months unfold, but clearly Germany in terms of the premium segment, we are witnessing growth of the value segment and in fact the trade brands have gained about a one share point in the second half in Germany as some of you may be aware. But generally I would say if I look at the world, the worst is probably behind us.
Karen Lemark - Federated Investors: And then following up on Turkey and Greece and Japan where you called out obviously particular pressures expected, what's sort of in your toolbox for fighting that, whether marketing, whether promoting some of your lower price brands if you choose to do that. I mean, what do you do in a situation where you are expecting significant pressure because of an external force?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, the first tool is to try to convince governments that in abnormal excise tax increases they have to ensure that they have the appropriate structure in place, and then we look at price gaps very carefully. We know that consumption will decline and therefore other than price gaps we try to take pricing that would offset that volume and we've done so successfully in most markets. Turkey was an example where they increased the minimum tax, but probably insufficiently in terms of structure, to assure that there wouldn't be down trading. I mean, we have witnessed retail price increases of 25%-30% across the board. That creates a bit of a shock to the system. In Greece, as I mentioned in my remarks, the tax increases was accompanied somewhat irrationally by a lowering of the minimum tax burden and therefore price gaps are going to widen and down trading will inevitably happen. The strength of our business is that we are in both markets and have a complete portfolio of brands so we feel that shares should be okay. The issue will be total volume, and clearly mix.
Karen Lemark - Federated Investors: That's very helpful. And then lastly, under what conditions might you consider a more aggressive dividend payout ratio? I think you're at 65% formally if I'm not mistaken?
Louis C. Camilleri: Formally we're at 65%, but we're in fact above 70% in actuality. We like to retain that formal 65% and Adam probably thinks this is a conservative number because we are ahead of it and we think we will continue to increase our dividends in line with our earnings going forward, but 65% remains our payout ratio and I think the balance between dividends and share repurchases is pretty fair. We'll see, as the years unfold, whether taxes will change in terms of capital gains and dividends and we'll see whether that requires some sort of rebalancing or not. We'll see that.
Karen Lemark - Federated Investors: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your final question comes from Pam Yuk of Financial Times.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Hi. I just have a couple of questions on the share buyback. I was just wondering kind of what was the rationale for continuing extending the share buyback program and is it because perhaps you don't see too many acquisition opportunities out there in the market at the moment? And secondly, how would this affect PM's ability to make acquisitions should one come along?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, we believe we have a strong balance sheet and we will continue to have a strong balance sheet. That's what I meant about having the optimal balance between rewarding shareholders which is the purpose of the dividend and share repurchase program, but retaining the financial flexibility to go and pursue acquisitions if necessary. And we believe we have the luxury of being able to do both.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: With the new share buyback, how much cash would this leave on PM's balance sheet?
Louis C. Camilleri: I'm not quite sure I understand your question.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Just in terms of how much firepower this will give you if one were to include taking into the new share buyback program?
Louis C. Camilleri: Enough firepower to do what it is we need to do.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Which is?
Louis C. Camilleri: I don't think I'm prepared to go beyond that, frankly. As we discussed earlier, you may recall David Adelman mentioned EBITDA to gross debt ratios. We are comfortable with those ratios in terms of our credit ratings, and if a significant acquisition were to come about, we believe we could pursue it, but at this stage I'm not prepared to give you any numbers or anything and I'm sure you understand why.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Sure. I mean, do you see any kind of acquisition opportunities out there at the moment in the market?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, we have a list of projects that we pursue. Last year we pursued a number of transactions. We continue to pursue them. I can't tell you when they will materialize, but certainly we have a list of business development projects that we pursue quite actively.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Okay. And also, given how cash generative the tobacco sector is, do you think you will be seeing a similar wave of share buybacks being announced by other tobacco companies in the months to come?
Louis C. Camilleri: I don't know, you'd have to ask them. I think we have a slightly stronger balance sheet than most of them. I think you should ask them that question.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Okay. And also, the share buyback, I mean is it fair to interpret the new share buyback program as a sign of PM's confidence that the pressure the company has seen during the first three quarters of 2009 are easing, and by pressure I mean the down trading trend and just currency headwind?
Louis C. Camilleri: Yes. Certainly as we said in our guidance we feel pretty confident in terms of our financial results going forward, and the share repurchase program per say underscores our optimism going forward. Yes, certainly.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Okay. So I mean I guess it goes back to the earlier question so you think the worst in down trading and currency headwind is over?
Louis C. Camilleri: Well, currency remains volatile. Anybody who projects currency is always a dangerous exercise. We're very focused on our constant currency growth rates. Last year we faced a pretty severe currency headwind. Prevailing rates we get a mild tailwind and we'll see how things develop going forward. You've seen that the euro has certainly weakened in the last two or three weeks because of the issues particularly all the concerns regarding Greece and Portugal and potentially Spain. We'll see who things develop going forward.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: And are there plans to expand PM's presence in the non-cigarette market? Because in 2009 we've seen the PM did quite a number of deals and joint ventures in the non-cigarette areas. Are we going to see more of that in 2010?
Louis C. Camilleri: In terms of other tobacco products? Clearly that's an area where it makes sense and where the segment is lucrative we will continue to pursue organic entry or entry through acquisitions just as we've done in the past, yes.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Okay. When you talk about doing I organically or through acquisition, would that include potentially having a look at Swedish Match?
Louis C. Camilleri: As you know we have an international joint venture with Swedish Match which we're very pleased with and hopefully this year you will see some signs of activity. The organization is in place, we're working on the products, and we're very satisfied with our relationship with it which is an exclusive relationship for the international market outside of the US and Scandinavia clearly. So we have a 50-50 joint venture for smokeless tobacco with Swedish Match for the international market and that's clearly our priority and what we're interested in.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: So would you be interested in a closer relationship with Swedish Match? I mean, potentially do you see —
Louis C. Camilleri: I know what you're driving at, but out of principle we don't comment, but I think you can read quite a lot into what I just told you.
Pam Yuk - Financial Times: Okay. Thanks, Louis.
Louis C. Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Rolli for closing remarks.
Nick Rolli: Well thank you very much for joining us today. I just want to remind listening audience that PMI will be presenting at the Consumer Analyst group of New York's conference in Florida on February 17th. It's an event that will be webcast for those of you not able to attend and we of course will post our presentations to our website. Again, thank you for joining us and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2009, Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome, thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2009 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com. As we take you through our call today, we will be talking about results in the third quarter of 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008 unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and share data is sourced from ACNielsen, other third party sources and internal estimates. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenue data exclude excise taxes. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and operating company’s income or OCI for currency and acquisitions; adjustments to earnings per share as well as other reconciliations to US GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release, for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In spite of the impact of the global economy recession, I am pleased to announce that PMI has achieved very strong third quarter results that confirms our company’s ability to growth of stability even in these difficult times. We have achieved excellent financial results in the quarter, thanks to our strong pricing initiatives, with net revenues excluding currency up 6.9%. Excluding currency and the acquisitions, up 4.1%; adjusted operating company’s income or OCI, excluding currency up 13.7% and excluding currency and acquisitions up 10.6%; and adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency up 18.3% While we expect volumes in 2009 to fall below last year’s level, the 4% organic decline in the quarter was amplified by specific circumstances in a few markets. Therefore our year-to-date organic volume decline of 2.1% better reflect our anticipated full year volume performance. On a year-to-date basis through the end of September, we have achieved a 4.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions; and 8.6% increase in adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions; and a 15.4% increase in adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency. This chart shows that in 2009 we have delivered consistently against our mid-to-long term currency neutral financial targets, in spite of recession driven weaker volumes thus demonstrating our ability to generate strong results even in the most turbulent of economic times. We are today revising our EPS guidance for the full year 2009 to a level of $3.20 to $3.25 compared to our previous guidance of $3.10 to $3.20. This represents both an increase in our guidance and a narrowing of the range. The improved narrow guidance reflects the continuous strengths of our underline business and a more favorable currency environment. We expect the currency impact to be neutral in the fourth quarter of this year and at current exchange rates it would be a tailwind in 2010. However, we will continue to focus on our constant currency growth rates, as PMI will continue to manage its business in the long-term interest of its shareholders. The key driver of our improved profitability in 2009 has been our ability to successfully increase prices across nearly all our major markets by safe guarding our competitive position. I would like to emphasize again, that our pricing decisions or established on market-by-market basis, taking into account the competitive environment, consumer affordability and the fiscal and the economic situation.  We are confident that our price increases are sustainable and we will continue to balance revenue growth with volume growth going forward. As at the end of the day, shareholders are interested in earnings per share, rather than cigarettes per share. Boosted by recent price increases in Germany and Spain, our pricing variance was $590 million in the third quarter, for a total year to date variance of $1.5 billion, even though we increased price this year at the somewhat faster rate than previously. Consumer behavior has remained resilient during this recession. Consumer down trading, which was a major concern of investors in the first half of the year has remained a globally manageable phenomenon. It has had a substantial impact in three of our key markets that have been particularly affected by the economic crisis, namely Russia, Spain and Ukraine. The situation in the latter has been severely exacerbated any large excise tax increases. Positive trends have however continued in other emerging markets such as Argentina, Indonesia, and Mexico. In most markets the key economic component that tends to impact consumer behavior is unemployment, and in particular any sharp increases thereof. In this context, the consumer down trading in Spain was therefore no surprise, as unemployment has climbed to above 18%, nationally and 25% in the south of the country, with the exception of Brazil and Ukraine, nearly all governments across the world have treated excise taxes so far in 2009 in a rational manner and they have been affected from the positive impact on excise tax yields for higher retail prices. We remain optimistic that such a rational approach will generally prevail as governments prepare their budget plans for 2010. Although, we do expect some VAT increases in addition to excise tax increases as government seek to boost their revenues, we believe that these should be globally managed. Let me now highlight our performance in some of our key markets. As I mentioned earlier the magnitude of the organic volume decline in the quarter can be attributed to exceptional factors with nearly two thirds of the decline coming from three markets, Ukraine, Spain and Pakistan. In Ukraine domestic excise tax increase in May this year which led to retail price increases in that month alone of 22% to 50% on PMI brands, resulted in a severe market disruption and our shipments were down by 23% in the quarter, broadly in line with the total market contraction. While our share declined slightly in June due to the greater availability of old price competitive products in the markets, it has since recovered to reach 35.6% in the third quarter up by 0.1 share points above last year’s level. In Spain the total cigarette market was down an estimated 10.2% in the quarter, due to the recession and higher retail prices exacerbated by weak tourism. Our shipments declined by 23.5% due to unfavorable distributor inventory movements, as well as the overall market decline. Our market share in the quarter was of just 0.2 points to 32.1% .This gains for L&M nearly completely offsetting the decline of Marlboro and Chesterfield. The 16.1% shipment volume decline in Pakistan is attributable to trade inventory movements subsequent to the excise tax increase of June 2009.  In Russia, the total market which grew at an estimated rate of some 4% in 2008 is declining at an estimated 3% to 4% this year, reflecting the economic downturn and the departure of an estimated two million migrant workers. In the third quarter PMI shipments were down just 0.8%. Our market share rose however, up 0.6 points in the third quarter to reach 25.6%. This strong performance is attributable to the growth of Bond Street in the value in optimizing the low price segment, the resilience of Parliament; and the overall strength and range of our brand portfolio. In Indonesia, market growth is trending at 3% to 4% this year compared to an estimated 10% last year even though the Indonesian economy has suffered less than others from the global economic downturn. Due to the timing of Ramadan this year, PMI shipments were down 1.1% in the quarter. PMI is a key brand A Mild continued to grow share and was up 0.5 share points in July and August to 10.7%, while Marlboro share was also higher. Excluding currency our OCI increased in Indonesia at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in Japan in the third quarter, gaining 0.4 share points to 10.6% behind the success of Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Filter Plus.  During the quarter we rolled out Lark Mint Splash nationally. Along with the previously launched Lark Classic Milds, this new launch has helped us stabilize the market share of the Lark family at 6.6% in the quarter.  We believe all these new products from Marlboro and Lark has helped consolidate our leadership in the growing menthol segment, which was up 1.1 share points to 23.2% in a total market that was down 3% in the quarter.  With respect to the intentions of the new government in Japan as to the future of the tobacco sector they there at this stag much speculation, but nothing concrete. We expect clarification of their plans early next year. We continue to advocate regular, moderate excise tax increases combined with manufactural pricing freedom. The highlights of our strong growth in Asia was Korea. Our shipments increased by 21.4% and regained 2.4 share points to a record quarterly level of 14.6%, due mainly to the continued strong performance of Marlboro and Parliament.  I will now to our improved results in European Union region. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 5.3% in the third quarter, helped by price increases in Germany and Spain that more than offset negative volume and mix. On a constant currency basis our adjustable OCI margin grew by 2.2 points to 52.2%. Our market share was down slightly by 0.2 points at 38.9%, due to our weaker performance of Marlboro in France, Germany and Spain. However, we are continuing to strengthen our second pillar in the EU region, L&M; already the region’s second best selling brand, gaining 0.9 share points to reach 5.7% regional share behind strong performances notably in Germany, Holland and Spain. We are optimistic that the rollout in the EU region of our innovation pipeline behind Marlboro will start to bear fruit next year.  We are very pleased by the strong performance of Marlboro in Italy. We succeeded in growing the market share of Marlboro during the third quarter from 22.6% last year to 23.1% this year, and thus stabilized our overall market share at 54.5%. This achievement was made possible by the successful launch of Marlboro Gold Touch, a new innovative offering in an unprecedented cigarette form, designed with a slightly slimmer diameter to provide a smooth taste and comfort in the hand. Marlboro Gold Touch achieved a 1.4% market share in Italy in the third quarter and continues to grow. On a global basis we have continued to benefit from the strengths of our overall portfolio. Where down trading has occurred, we have generally been successful in keeping our consumer base. Thanks to our range of strong value international and local heritage brands. Our best performing international brands in this recessionary environment has been Bond Street, particularly in Russia and Lark particularly in Turkey, which are in the lower price categories. In the premium segment the rate of decline in the shipments of Parliament and Marlboro during the third quarter was in line with our overall organic volume trends. Both brands achieved volume growth in the quarter in Asia primarily driven by their strong performance in Korea and they have been gaining share in the premium segment in those key market. We have continued to invest strongly behind our key brands, increasing our level of our spending this year in the EU region behind Marlboro  The new architecture for Marlboro is being successfully deployed in two steps. We are strengthening the core Red and Gold variants, through an upgrade of the Red pack so far available in Austria, France and Italy and the modernization of the Gold pack now available in 26 countries. Consumer acceptance new Gold packaging is very positive. The second aspect of the rollout of the Marlboro architecture is in the development and launch of innovative line extensions appropriate for each family in the nine different consumer preferences.  These new products has not being deployed globally but rather we have focused on one or two of them per market, establishing priorities on a country-by-country basis in line with our enhanced consumer understanding and engagements. In total we have launched Red line extensions in 34 markets, Gold line extensions in 17 markets and Fresh line extensions in 33 markets. Let me give you some examples of our successful innovative Marlboro line extensions. Marlboro Filter and Flavor Plus, has an innovative 4-zones of filter that includes a tobacco plug, intended to enhance the flavor experience in the low tar cigarette; and is sold in an innovative sliding pack. Marlboro Filter and Flavor Plus is available in six, three and 1mg variance. In July, August this year, Marlboro Filter Plus notably achieved a 2.4% share in Rumania, 2.3% in Kuwait, 1.8% in Paraguay, and 1.3% in Kazakhstan. Under the Marlboro Gold umbrella, we have launched a range of different line extensions. Marlboro Gold Advance is a smoother tasting, fruit flavored product, in a very elegant [impressive] pack. This variant is now available in four markets and achieved a promising 0.3% national share in France and Portugal, in September following its launch in June and July respectively. Marlboro Gold Touch is available in eight markets, in addition to Italy. In Greece based on in-market sales data, Marlboro Gold Touch already had a 0.5% market share in September and initial consumer research learning in July, showed that over 40% of earlier adopters were of legal age, minimum 18 to 24-year old smokers. Marlboro Gold Edge is a super slims variant that is sold mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. During the third quarter it achieved a 3.4% share of the fast growing super slim segment in Poland and 4.8 share in Hungary and is performing well and duty free obviously. Marlboro Gold Smooth 1mg has been launched in the Middle East. In August, it achieved market share of 0.7% in Kuwait, 0.5% in the UAE and 0.3% in Saudi Arabia. In Marlboro Fresh family our most successful innovation has been Marlboro Black Menthol, this has refreshing high Menthol content and attractive pack. In the third quarter of this year Marlboro Black Menthol obtained a [11.4%] market share in Japan and a 3.3% market share in Hong Kong. Marlboro Black Menthol has also been launched this year in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Our latest innovative line extension is Marlboro super-premium, the cigarette is made using flue cured and burley tobaccos. The distinctive pack is its red metallic interior was designed by Pininfarina, the world famous Italian designer of cars, notably Ferrari models. Marlboro’s super premium was launched in the exclusive setting of Singapore Formula one Gran Prix last month. Our sales in the premium segment underpins our profitability and positions us very well to further grow profitably as the world economy gradually moves out of a recession. During which our cash flow has remain formidable. In the third quarter our free cash flow totaled $1.7 billion and year-to-date it has reached $5.9 billion. Excluding the impact currency on net earnings, free cash flow was 17% higher in the quarter and 12.4% higher in 2009 through the end of September. Our commitments to enhance shareholder returns remains as strong as ever. Reflecting the strength of our underlying business, we increased our quarterly dividend in September by 7.4% to a level of $0.58 per share at our current stock price of $50.82 per share this represents an attractive yield of 4.6%. We have continued to steadily implement our share repurchase program spending a further $1.5 billion in the third quarter to buyback an additional 31.5 million shares. We now have $3.4 billion remaining in our $13 billion program, which runs through the end of April next year.  In 2009 we have so far returned a totaled of $7.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since, we spun off in March 2008 the number adjust to $15 billion representing more than 15% of our current market cap. Our financial strength is a key component of our success in the current difficult economic environment. It is reinforced by our excellent business momentum. The third quarter has illustrated again, our ability to deliver against all our currency neutral financial targets. While, volumes remain weaker than last year, we have more than offset this by higher prices, strong performances in most key markets, the continued benefits of our productivity and cost saving programs, and we have intensified our efforts to optimize working capital levels. Today, we have raised our 2009 EPS guidance for 2009 to $3.20 to $3.25 representing an increase of 12% to 14% compared to 2008 on a currency neutral basis. Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank You. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: As we think about 2010 and think about volume outlook. I was hoping to just get your perspective on volume outlook. Is it year-to-date down about 2.1% organic? As you thought to lap some of the challenges that you faced this year and then the macros start to get better globally would you expect to see the volumes sort of start to turn positive as 2010 progresses?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, let me start really with in terms of the perspective, I mean 2% minus 2% organic volume, I believe is an excellent performance for a consumer goods company in a recession. Looking forward, that's the key of your question here is, look I would say, I expect some improvement in 2010 over to 2009, but I would say at this point in time it's impossible to quantify. I mean they all number of factors that influence that situation. Of course the first and most important one is the general question about the economic recovery and also recovery in terms of employment. A rebound in the stock markets doesn’t mean we get new jobs for the people, there will be a certain lack to that, that is of course one thing, I mean in key markets like Russia, I think that could come and begin to improve in the second half of 2010. Then of course gets to the next question on really, total market size, development of major markets. Look Russia last year and it is a huge market and it was last year about 400 billion. A year ago it was growing 44%, this year it’s declining 3% to 4%. Is it going to stabilize or even already returned to grow? That's a key question. This major impact is on the total volume number. Indonesia is 250 billion cigarettes market. That market has been growing last year about 10%, now it is growing 3% to 4%. The growth of next year is going to be important. Another important market is being Japan, also in the range 250 billion cigarettes. It’ll also depend on the new governmental policy on excise tax and I guess we all would love to accept a certain market decline in Japan in exchange for pricing freedom. So, all-in-all it will depend on those key points, we will continue to strike the right balance between price, earnings and volume.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just following up on the Indonesia, you said, industry is growing 3% to 4%. I think you said your volume was down, but there was timing of the Ramadan Holiday. So, can you quantify how much the timing impacted your volume in the third quarter? Then just broadly speaking, can we talk about some of the factors that maybe impacting slower growth for the industry in that market this year versus last year?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. The Ramadan impact I would estimate and this is just a shift quarter-to-quarter. Anything around 1 billion cigarettes probably is good estimate there. In terms of overall growth of the market, that will of course depend here again on economic recovery. Indonesia is a country in any case is doing much better than many others. The main thing for Indonesia that I also would like to highlight is, that the growth of that market today is actually in the very low price category of that market. That growth is driven by a tax loophole in that market. As we will recall, there is a three-tier excise tax system in the market. The lowest tier called Tier-3 goes for volumes of a brand of up to 0.5 billion and it's specifically for hand-rolled cigarettes that’s of course perfectly justified for employment reasons, but then there is a second tier that is valid between 0.5 billion and 2 billion that actually also includes machine made cigarettes and there is the abuse of the legal loophole in particular by one big competitor in there. So, you just have new legal entities then and then fall under this category and all the rest is just taxed normally. So, that’s something we are working on that should be at rest going forward that's the one and only a reason actually why we show some market share lost in that market. It's only due to that segment otherwise we are doing really well in Indonesia.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Fell of Deutsche Bank.
Jon Fell - Deutsche Bank: Just wanted to follow-on on the volume question first of all a little bit. I mean, Hermann, you said yourself that investors in the market just looked at earnings per share rather than cigarettes per share. Do you think that maybe your 1% to 2% long-term growth target for volumes is maybe a little bit aggressive in this environment? I think price-mix in the last quarter was 8%. At what points would you start to get worried that you're maybe asking the consumer for a little bit too much?
Hermann Waldemer: First of all, on the overall volume targets, 1% is our organic volume growth target, 2% would include acquisitions. While the 1% organic volume target, we have met it early last year. We will not meet it this year and we probably it would be unrealistic to assume that we already go back to 1% organic growth next year, but these all made to long-term targets and as I’ve said at the beginning, we have achieved it last year. I think we again can achieve it going forward. I see no reason to change it, but as I mentioned previously, it also will depend really on the overall market growth trends of some of the really major, major markets, which are Russia, Indonesia, and Japan. On the second part of your question, I’m convinced that we are striking the right balance and as you know we really managed all those for the long-term and not for the short-term. Look at this year's year-to-date pricing variance. It is actually 2.5 times the negative volume mix that we're having on year-to-date basis. I think that one is the strongest argument. The second argument I think is that we kept our competitive position. We are very strong and have remained very strong. The third one is that sometimes price increases also can avoid, excise increases, the [lowering part] governments make more money. The last point is that excise tax structures around the world have improved a lot minimum excise taxes, [hire] specific elements, you name it there is some progress there everywhere around the world and if you go to the top 25 markets around the world such protection is in place in one form over the other in every one of them. Actually in that context I probably should mention that this morning European Time, the Advocate General has come out refer opinion on the pending case on minimum reference prices in the European Union. Your opinion is a negative opinion and of course this opinion carries some weight. However, I'd like to stress that the member states involved in these cases. They've also voiced there opinion supported by what I would considered to be very strong arguments. So, finally it will be the European Court of Justice who decides about that in about three to six months is probably a realistic timing. I would like to add that, for me it's kind of hard to understand why the principle of free circulation of goods which is, anyway I would say an illusion, when it comes to cigarettes in the European Union, labeling requirements excise tax stamps you know all that. Why such a principle would overwrite the public health concerns that have been brought forward by those member states. That being said, we just said that there are other means which are being used by governments around the world and it’s actually interesting that the EU commission themselves acknowledges that these tools might need to be further reinforced, just one example there could be that the minimum tax which today in the EU is kept at the 100% of the tax on the most popular price category eventually could go above and beyond those 100%. So, I wanted to use that question also to provide recent information to everyone.
Jon Fell - Deutsche Bank: Can I just follow-on from that announcement. If you could remind us which markets currently have minimum reference prices in place at the moment? Are there any of those markets where you are worried that alternative tools such as existing minimum excise tax requirements couldn't be used to achieve pretty much the same thing?
Hermann Waldemer: The [country] is concerned by the case or Ireland, France, and Austria. A fourth country that has a minimum reference price is Italy. I believe that all those countries if the final decision on that, we don’t know yet. Let's wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice. It would be negative I think they would address it in the sense that they are discussing earlier. You have to see that is simply then a burden on the low price end of the price segment and not on the premium price segment actually.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Just to clarify what you are saying to Jon. If you couldn't have minimum reference pricing in Europe, governments could elect under their existing authority or essentially achieve the same impact on cigarette pricing architecture through the utilization of minimum tax levels. Correct?
Hermann Waldemer: It is a question that depends on country-to-country, you can go under today's law you can go up to 100% of minimum tax of the most popular price category in that market, that category of course varies from market-to-market that can be actually the premium price, in the specific markets it depends. New rules eventually good foresee that that goes beyond that 100% and the other element that is of course available today is a higher specific component in the overall excise tax mix.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Secondly, Hermann, I realize this is a forward-looking question. At a current exchange rates, do you think something like $4 in earnings has a stretch next year is feasible?
Hermann Waldemer: We haven't put our budgets in plan yet together for the next year. I think I have to beg your patience for the 2010 guidance until we publish the full year earnings, which would be February 11 of 2010.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Then Hermann, what's the early read and I know that you have a competitor that had a fair level of inventory of 17 packs, but what's the early read on consumption trends in Germany subsequent to the fairly substantial increase in [Prestek] pricing in the middle of the year?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, there are two things here. I mean 17 packs which are on the new price and 17 packs that will still be available on the old price. On the new price this is just a face value advantage and not a real advantage. There is some advantage, but I wouldn't to say is huge in the German environment, where via the vending pack contents smokers are still used to somewhat to differing pack contents. So I think we have in the German market for now and the Marlboro. We have some impact of the price increase, but there is a temporary phenomenon, we will have to see what the fourth quarter is going to show to us, but it is important that we have that minimum pack content change actually in the German market to 19 and I'm glad that this has been achieved.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Then Hermann, lastly, what’s the status of your request to increase pricing in France?
Hermann Waldemer: The status in France right now is, you are right. We have sent a price list to the French Government for homologation that homologation is still pending. There might be implicitly some link of course to the announced publication of President Sarkozy's anti-cancel plan. I would expect and that’s the public information that that plan might be announced anytime from here to the mid of November. I don’t want to speculate on the contents of that plan. We will have to wait for the announcement. However, I would say that over the last couple of years the French Government has been pretty rational and pragmatic and efficient when it comes to cigarette taxation. So, I don't expect any catastrophes at that end.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch
Christine Farkas - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: A question on pricing if I could. We saw eight points of positive pricing in the third quarter similar to second quarter, given the timing of price hikes earlier in the year and what you might see in the fourth quarter and perhaps what we are lapping, is this an achievable growth in the fourth quarter as well for pricing?
Hermann Waldemer: A forward-looking pricing you know that I won't do that, but we had strong pricing this year at somewhat faster pace than we had last year. Our expectations, I would say are of course lumping and part of our assumption for the full year guidance, which as you have seen was narrowed and raised. So, it's all worked into that number.
Christine Farkas - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: Okay. On that point, Hermann, the guidance then which was narrowed and raised, could you quantify at all how much you would you say is coming from the improved FX outlook versus pricing and the stronger than expected third quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, that I can. Look, we had in the previous guidance. We had in there a $0.55 negative currency assumption, remember down from at the very beginning of the year $0.80. Now our year-to-date September, negative currency is actually $0.52 and I don’t expect a further negative currency in the fourth quarter.
Christine Farkas - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: Then moving to Marlboro or EU in general, we saw now the third consecutive quarter of share losses despite some improvement in the underline markets. I am just wondering, if you could comment a little bit on Marlboro’s performance or your expectations or perhaps the year-over-year challenges and when do you think that trade down might stabilize for you in the EU?
Hermann Waldemer: In general I didn’t talk about the EU markets in particular, but in general. I mean the first thing is off course that would the Marlboro volume will be stronger if there are no recession out there in the world? Off course I mean being in the premium segment, as I said in consequence but that that’s the way it is. Going forward this is going to change and when this is going to change we will have to have Marlboro for upgrading to come back and remind you as we’re discussing pricing earlier that upgrading to come at higher margins. I mean innovation is out there, its working, it will provide future benefits. You had the examples in prepared remarks and there are plenty of examples around the world that Marlboro is very strong and is growing and there is in places like Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Philippines and Japan but also in markets in Europe, like Portugal or Italy. In the Italy I would say is may be a little bit comparable to what you see for the moment also in Germany.  After the last price increase in Italy, Marlboro for a couple of months or for two quarters was weaker because it had to absorb the price increase and now its back on track and growing so really I think the share decline in Marlboro is attributable to the price increase. We haven’t had one for a while in Germany. I am convinced it nevertheless was the right decision  In Spain the share decline is the simple consequence of a severe recession. The country really is in deep trouble overall. In Russia I guess we see down trading but there that is from a small base and in France and quite frankly it is right now a difficult price point situation. We have major brands still at 4.80 Marlboro is at 5.30. That’s the temporary disadvantage that Marlboro is suffering from in France but that won’t be forever
Christine Farkas - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch:  Okay.
Hermann Waldemer: Besides in all I think we’re doing the right thing. We keep on going we keep on strengthening the brands. We even have increased the investments behind Marlboro in the European Union in this year. It will pay off going forward 
Christine Farkas - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: Thanks for that Hermann and my final question on Canada. We saw organic growth this quarter, which reversed decline in the first half, if I am not mistaken I know there is some regulatory factors helping. Is that really what’s going on there with a comps or can you talked about where the growth is coming from, perhaps high end, low end and whether the government support is really what’s driving that churn?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes we all are growing the share, first of all in that market point bringing share to 33.9 in Q3. So we are doing competitively really well, but what is very important is actually that the total tax paid market in the third quarter is up about 6% in Canada. What’s happening there is that you do see increased enforcement or literally more police cars controlling people coming out of the Indian reservation or along the Indian reservations, checking if there are illegal products being bought. That helps, that is a good development, it is very positive. However, I have to add that in order to have a sustainable Improvement in Canada, the enforcement then really would have to go to the roots of the problem and roots of the problem are well known. There are factories in the Indian reservations there, so the place is known, the ones who run them are known. This is where I would hope that the next stage of enforcement would go. So it is positive news, for the quarter. I hope that they keep it up, but I hope even more that finally the underlying problem will be tackled.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup.: Can I ask you just the first question, what the market share was for Marlboro in the EU in the quarter and what it was in the second quarter as well? Because I didn’t think that is in the press release?
Hermann Waldemer:  I know many things but about this one I don’t know by heart, but I can give you a couple of markets, I wouldn’t know the rate, that’s around about 0.9%, I believe, Germany was down some 1.2%, Spain is also down in a similar range. These are the markets those are really down. Italy, we already told you is up, Portugal is up, Poland in the quarter is actually up 1.7 share points to 9.5 percentage points. Hungary is also up. So therefore we really and I believe that’s, of course the core of your question. There is no generalized Marlboro problem in the EU. There are specific regions in France, Germany and Spain that I explained just in the question before. So as you can see that there also a number of markets with positive news. There are also a number of markets where the younger smoker share is in between 18 and 24-year-olds. It is growing, its actually for example, steeply growing in Portugal. It comes back to the points here that I really believe we are doing the right thing for Marlboro, and at the same time I am happy, that I am also able to say that we are making the progress in establishing a very solid second leg in the European Union and our name is already number two brand in the EU today.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup.:  One question on that buybacks and one about Mexico, So quickly the buyback figure at $1.5 billion, if I remember rightly, is there a step up from your previous $1.4 billion. Should we assume that $1.5 billion is the sort of quarterly rate going forward?  
Hermann Waldemer:   No, there is no change to what I said earlier. You should expect for the full year of 2009 a total amount that is very similar to the amount that we expect last year, and last year’s amounts was in total $5.4 billion. 
Adam Spielman - Citigroup.:  Can I, can I quickly then in Mexico, the final question. Your major competitors there has said that it believes it has changed the competitive dynamic very exceptionally through specific innovation and from their point of view better distribution and I was wondering on how you would see the trends in that markets on your outlook, particularly given you have been very successful there in the past?
Hermann Waldemer: Well I wouldn’t rely that than our distribution, they are one of our competitors there and I guess the best argument is that our share is up 0.9% to 69.4% in the Mexican market. Couple of words, I mean what’s really happening in the Mexican market is that really you have essentially a polarizing markets. It’s a very strong premium segment.  So this is where we are with Marlboro and Benson & Hedges. I mean Marlboro is 48% market share and Marlboro and Benson & Hedges together has a premium segment share of about 83% and then the music for the rest of it is actually in the low price segment. There we are being extremely successful with Delicados growing very nicely there as well. Our segment share in this growing segment is actually growing to 25% of the market now. Our segment share in there is now also 60%. Really the segment that is in this squeeze is the mid-price segment, I believe that’s the real dynamic in this markets.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup.:  So it will be wrong to say that its become harder for your to compete in that market or would that just be wrong conclusion? 
Hermann Waldemer:
 : We have always enjoyed every competition but as I said look at our market shares, I think we are doing well. We will continue to take the competitive situation very seriously and we will continue to compete as good as we can. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus:  I Just a couple of question for you, First of all I didn’t get this earlier in the call but I noticed that in most of your, lot of your major markets you started inventory distortion and distributor movements, that kind of things and I looks to me overall to have been a burden to your volume and I am sure that’s the reality of the economical environment we are in but can you quantify or give us a sense of how much that hurt your volume in the quarter? 
Hermann Waldemer: No, I wouldn’t say that it’s in most of our important markets. I have given a couple of specific examples, that was Spain, that was then the shift in Indonesia. I will rather say in general and this is not huge numbers but if you are in an environment and also eventually here and there, your customers i.e. your wholesalers or even your retailers are in a working capital squeeze. Then I think as the manufacturer, as Philip Morris, we are better served to help the trade by lowering the inventory levels, as the trade comes back to a situation where I would keep up those levels and increase payment terms. To do the second thing would be wrong. In that scenario we have chosen rather the first one, i.e. help the wholesaler with their own working capital squeeze there. So yes there were some effect there, but it’s not a world wide serious phenomenon.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. I understand and then I think you mentioned before your premium price products your volume was down or bottom line with your organic volume growth. Is that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: That’s correct.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: So you If you looked it at like mix in the quarter, I guess I am trying to understand is, how the different price segments from premium, mid and low performed. It sounds like there wouldn’t have been major mix change in this quarter if premium was down or bottom-line with the categories that earns in line with your business. Is that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: Well that kind of equalizes that also that PMI. Yes, I mean but off course we had a couple of market that your are aware like Russia where we did see down trading from the premium and meet actually through the lower price segment. So that actually, that down trading trend did deteriorate. However, I also have to say, it didn’t improve yet.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus:  Understand, sure and then my last question for you is, in terms of the, if you look a ahead in 2010 you mentioned in your slides about potential VAT increase and excise tax increases. Are there any slated for right now that you are aware for next year that we should be watching out for?
Hermann Waldemer: In terms of VAT increase, there is now a proposal in Spain that would bring VAT up by 2% by the middle of 2010. So off course that then will require in the cigarette categories an adjustment of the minimum excise tax. You remember that the last price increase in Spain, the Spanish government has understood that mechanism very well, so I am confident that we’ll do the necessary again. Another example there you’ve essentially seen, there are published plans out there not yet fully finalized in Russia. The excise increases there would be somewhat higher than the ones that we have seen this year, but in general, I would say the rollover of those increases in 2010 would be in the range of 2 Rubles, if you put that into relation to the overall price level, Marlboro is retailing today at 42 Rubles and L&M is retailing at 27 Rubles, so it’s a manageable situation again.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Sure, Okay
Hermann Waldemer: So the [Russian government] today never, so to speak another best price is of course and remains Ukraine.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Sure, sure, okay.
Hermann Waldemer: So then I don’t know what’s happening now.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Then in Japan sort of a watch out for right now and I’m sure how that’s going play out.
Hermann Waldemer: There you have to wait in Japan, we of course make our arguments and we talked to opinion leaders, the advocate as I said for moderate and regular excise increases accompanied by pricing freedom. I hope that we will be hurt, but as I said, there is really no official government tobacco policy out there, we have to wait there. You know that the project cycle of the Japanese Government does not follow the calendar year, but goes from April to March. So beginning of next year; I think there should be more clarity on Japan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Credit Suzie.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Seize: Just wanted to clarify one thing, the guidance increase that you gave today, only $0.03 of that is driven by better than expected currencies, is that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: That’s correct.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Seize: I was little bit surprised though that that this quarter was the worst quarter in terms of currency impact, can you give us an idea of what the major currency movements were behind the big impact ?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah local, as far as this planning, you had seen the breakdown that we had forecast for the year. Now we are essentially done, I would hope that this negative currency for the year over these three quarters, I mean the currencies that has hit us most, are of course, The Euro, but beyond the Euro the emerging current market currencies, first of all the Ruble, the Ukrainian Grivna that had severe impact and these are the most prominent ones and then thereafter would come the Turkish Lira.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Seize:  Okay. Then at the beginning of the year you explained to us that down trading in Russia was driven by the collapse of the oil price. Do the recent gains from the oil price changed the outlook for Russia; is the worst over in Russia? So if we get back to trading there, if oil continues to grow up?
Hermann Waldemer: It will certainly help Russia now. We are talking about the Russian economy overall and not just cigarettes. I mean this will certainly help, however, from there until you see really more employments, remember I mean there is not only unemployment in Russia, there is also under employment in Russia, where people only work part time and get paid, therefore only part of the salary and on the country side you would find situations where people get there salaries paid late or may be for a month not at all. As soon as that comes back to a more normal pattern and the consumer confidence is going to come back. That is going to be the moment where you will stop seeing upgrading in Russia, let’s be realistic, I don’t think we will see that beginning before the second half of 2010.
Operator:  Our final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport:  I had a couple of things, one Hermann, if you would give us an update on the outlook for tobacco lease pricing for the balance of this year and 2010?
Hermann Waldemer:  Okay. Lease pricing, year-to-date we have a negative lease price in our [P&L] also $150 million compared to last year. So, you will have for the rate there about the semi fixed till for the remainder of the year, that of course again is baked into our guidance for the full year. I mean going forwards, the crucial question remains, that we achieve a balanced supply of the tobacco balance, there is the demand for the tobacco and quite frankly, I think this is perfectly achievable, that to speak for us I mean. We at PMI, we know exactly how much tobacco we need for the coming year. Our volumes don’t vary that much. So therefore I think, as we know that the farmers are the ones who need to have that visibility and the farmers need to know that they can make a decent normal margin on the leaf they grow and not actually like it had been in past, a boom one year and a loss in the next year. So that’s actually how we are tackling the problem. So we are in the process of getting it in under control.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport:  Okay. Then as we look to 2010 should we expect a similar pace of new product introduction like we saw this year?
Hermann Waldemer: We have quite a nice pipeline developed out there. We also talked about Marlboro. We are also working with the other brands. Not every innovation is already rolling into every market. That as is a say would be even wrong. It has to be adopted to that market. That’s what we will continue to do.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport:  Okay and then my last, any update on potential of lifting the ban on snus in the EU?
Hermann Waldemer:  Well the ban on snus in the EU there really nothing has changed. The lifting of that ban is still 50-50 chance. We will have to wait and see.  Okay so before we conclude let me may be add one point here. You have seen our results of the third quarter and the point I would really like to highlight is that really since being public company, since the spin we have consistently delivered on our constant currency financial metrics and we have done that even in the most difficult of economic times. I believe that is a great achievement and we will work hard to continue to do so.
Nick Rolli: Okay, well thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes our investor call. Have a great day the investor relations team is in Lausanne, Switzerland and available for further questions, if you need to reach us. Again thank you and have a great day.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Executives:  Nick Rolli - VP, IR and Financial Communications Hermann Waldemer - CFO 
Analysts:  Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch David Adelman - Morgan Stanley Jon Leinster - UBS Adam Spielman - Citigroup Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan Ann Gurkin - Davenport  
Operator: I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead sir.
Nick Rolli: Welcome thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2009 first quarter results you may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com.  As we take you through our call today, we will be talking about results in the first quarter of 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008 unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and share data is sourced from AC. Nielsen. Other third party sources and internal estimates net revenue data exclude excise taxes. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and operating company’s income or OCI for currency and acquisitions at the end of today's webcast slides which will be also posted to our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release. For a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. And now its my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hello, everyone. I am pleased to report that PMI's strong business momentum continued into 2009. In spite of the difficult economic environment net revenues in the first quarter grew by 3.9% excluding acquisitions and currency driven by price increases across a broad range of markets. OCI increased by 6.2% excluding acquisitions and currency. This was driven by strong performances in the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA. In Asia regions there net of currency we achieved double digit OCI growth in key markets of Russia, Ukraine, Australia, Indonesia and Korea. A 2.3% decrease in EU region OCI net of acquisitions and currency resulted from a short contraction in industry volume in Poland. Due to large tax driven price increases lower shipment volume and the less favorable mix in Germany. Some minor market share erosion across the region, and higher marketing investments behind our new Marlboro initiatives. Reported diluted earnings per share or EPS declined by $0.05 or 6.3% in the first quarter to $0.74, but there are $0.10 or 12.7% excluding the adverse currency impact. Before I go into further details let me focus on the three topics which appear to be top of mind amongst our investors and journalists who follow us. These are consumer trends in emerging markets pricing and currency. I can say today that we have not seen any broad based trends towards consumer down trading on a global basis. Let me illustrate the situation and how it varies from country to country. The four examples Russia, Ukraine, Indonesia and Argentina. In Russia, we are seeing signs of consumer down trading driven by the impact of the collapse in oil and metal prices on the Russian economy. And the substantial cigarette price increases that have taken place over the last 12 months. While shipments of super premium Parliament continued to increase in the first quarter. The volumes of premium Marlboro and mid priced Chesterfield were below last year's level. And sales of low price Bond Street increased significantly.  Overall PMI shipments in Russia were in line with last year. Our first quarter market share was up 0.3 points to 25.1% as measured by AC. Nielsen. It should be noted that we have now switched to this service provider in Russia due to its more extensive market coverage. We have achieved double digit OCI growth in local currency through pricing and this has partially mitigated the negative currency impact on profitability in US dollars. The impact of the global economic crisis on Ukraine has been worst than on Russia and this has been compounded by political uncertainty. Nevertheless our shipment volume in the first quarter rose by 0.7% and our market share for the period increased by 1.1 points to 35.8% driven by Parliament and Chesterfield. In our efforts to boost revenues Ukrainian government has brought forward to this May excise tax increases planned over two years. This is expected to result in large retail price increases. Which in turn could lead to consumer down trading, however we believe that we will be able to maintain our leading position should any turmoil occur thanks to our excellent momentum and broad brand portfolio. There has been no consumer down trading Indonesia where our volume in the first quarter increased by 2.8% broadly inline with the evolution in the total market. Consumer sentiment in Indonesia has been positively impacted reduction in inflation following significant price increases last year for cooking oil, gasoline and rice. And unemployment levels have remained stable. The Indonesian economy has weathered the economic storm much better than most countries in Asia helped by its lower dependence on exports. The fastest growing segment in the Indonesian market is machine-made lighter tasting kreteks. This has helped us to grow the volume of A Mild by [12.5%] in the quarter. While our [Alexandral] achieved some soup and some [Perner] brands have been negatively impacted by a difficult transition to higher price points. In addition to a continued strong volume performance we have been able to boost ability in Indonesia by pricing both A Mild and Marlboro ahead of inflation. The fourth country I would like to talk about is Argentina. Their up trading in the cigarette market has continued this is a country that has been frequently mentioned by economy commentators as being particularly vulnerable. This pessimism is not reflected in the performance of the cigarette so far this year. During the first quarter consumer continued to trade up from the low end price segments to the mid price Philip Morris brand and premium Marlboro. PMI's volume was up 1.2% in our three months moving average market share through the end of January reached 72.2% up 2.7 share points. In addition we were able to implement price increases in order to improve our profitability. The outlook for the balance of the year remains positive the introduction of a minimum excise tax in February should help minimize tax driven down trading to lower price trends over the longer term.  As these four examples show we are not witnessing a global consumer down trading trend and the situation is quite different market-by-market. Some people have questioned our ability to continue to increase prices in the current economic environment. Our track record over the last six months shows that on the contrary we have retained our ability to increase prices in order to boost our profitability as shown on this slide. We have increased prices across a broad range of markets including Greece, Italy and Spain in the EU. Romania, Russia and Turkey in EMEA. Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia and Argentina and Mexico in the Latin America and Canada region. Also you may have seen press reports that we have announced to the trade our intension to increase prices by 20 euro cents across our portfolio in Germany in June. Our pricing variance in the first quarter was $358 million this is the largest pricing variance that we have ever achieved in the quarter. This highlights our ability to successfully implement price increases during a recession. In fact, our pricing variance this quarter was larger than our total annual pricing variance just three year's ago in 2006. We webcasted our presentation at CAGNY provided investors and analysts through a better understanding of how currency impacts our business. As anticipated our first quarter results were severely impacted by the strength of the US dollar. Indeed currency adversely impacted net revenues, OCI and EPS by some $700 million, $400 million and $0.15, respectively.  As you are all aware in the recent weeks we have witnessed a slightly more favorable currency environment. In fact, should current spot rates prevail for the rest of the year, we would anticipate that our EPS would climb to the high end of our February guidance, while unit volume maybe somewhat softer than our earlier expectations. We are confident that this shortfall should occur will be more than offset by the benefit of pricing. All in all, given continued currency volatility, we believe that it would be in prudent to raise our guidance at this early stage of the year. However, our solid start to the year certainly affirms our confidence in achieving our 2009 constant currency EPS, targeted growth of 10% to 14%. Let me now comment on our first quarter results in a little more detail. Our cigarette shipment volume was stable at 203 billion units, but was 1.1% lower excluding acquisitions. However, on a per selling day basis, volume excluding acquisitions was stable in spite of significant price increases. This represents a solid achievement in light of our stronger results in the first quarter of 2008. Our shipment volume in the EU was down 3.7%, driven primarily by the aforementioned contraction of industry volume in Poland and a slight market share erosion in Italy that was compounded by trade inventories distortions.  At 38.4%, our estimated market share in the EU region was down 0.3 points, due mainly to the sharing of low price low margin volume in Poland as well as the impact of a slight decline in the premium segment in Italy. It is important to underline that our market shares in France, Germany and Spain has stabilized.  In the EMEA region, volume was down 0.3%, but up 0.8% on a per selling day basis. This region includes our worldwide duty free business, which was down 10.5% due to the expected impact of reduced (inaudible). PMI volumes and market shares were strong notably in Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. And we also gained market share in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.  A very strong share performance in Korea, continued volume growth in Indonesia and the favorable distributor inventory movement in Japan related to the resourcing of production from the USA to Europe last year. Drove a 2.2% shipment volume increase in the Asia region. We have stabilized our market share in Japan at 23.9%, thanks to the strong performance Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Filter Plus, and have just launched Lark Classics Milds nationally and Lark means fresh interest market  In Korea, PMI gained 2.8 share points and achieved a record share of 13.8% in the first quarter. Thanks to Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slims. In the Latin America and Canada region, reported volume was up 4.4%, boosted by our acquisition of Rothmans Inc. in Canada. Excluding acquisitions, shipments were down 4.7%, due to a targeted inventory reductions and weaker consumer demand in Columbia, the impact of December price increases on industry volume in the first quarter in Mexico.  Our share of the Mexican market increased by 2.3 share points to 69.2% behind the strong performance of Benson & Hedges and Delicados. Marlboro Fresh, contributed 0.5 share points to the 48.3 share of the Marlboro family. On a brand basis, super-premium Parliament was a top performer, it was also 5.9%, in spite of the weakness of the duty free business and the continued market decline in Japan. Volumes grew strongly in Korea, Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine. After particularly strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2008, Marlboro shipment volume was down 2.4% to 71.1 billion units driven by lower industry volume and the 0.4 share point erosion in the EU region. We already mentioned decline in duty free sales and a softening in the premium segment in Russia.  We are not particularly perturbed by Marlboro's performance this quarter. As we continue to rollout our new brand architecture for Marlboro across many markets. We indeed remain very optimistic about the future of the trend. The new Marlboro Gold packaging has been introduced in Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Poland after very position trial results. The slimmer diameter Marlboro Gold Edge is performing ahead of expectations in Russia and Ukraine and we are just launching Marlboro Gold Advance, a 10 milligram product under the gold umbrella nationally in France after excellent consumer feedback in this market. Under the Marlboro Fresh umbrella, Marlboro Black Menthol continues to drive to return to growth of the Marlboro franchise in Japan. During the first quarter, Marlboro achieved a share of 10.4% in Japan, 0.5 points ahead of the same period last year. This Marlboro Black Menthol contributing a 1% share and enabling us to stabilize our overall share in the growing menthol segment at 44.9%.  Given the success of Marlboro Black Menthol in Japan, it was launched during the first quarter in Hong Kong and Indonesia. In the mid-price segment after achieving strong growth in 2008, Chesterfield's volume remains resilient. A strong performance in the EU where volume was up 5.5%, thanks to Austria, France and Portugal was partly offset by a decline in Russia.  L&M is globally showing a stronger performance than in 2008, this volume just down by 0.5% in the first quarter, in spite of continued double-digit decline in Russia and weakness of the Polish and duty free markets. L&M remains the fastest growing brand in Germany, and it's the second largest cigarette brand in the EU region after Marlboro.  Our key low price international brands, Bond Street, Next and Red & White achieved a combined volume of 15 billion units up 1.5% over the first quarter of last year. Overall, during the first quarter, PMI volume by price segment remained very stable, as premium representing 49% of cigarette volume, mid price 29%, and low price 22% in line of the previous year. PMI's financial position remains very strong. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures was $1.3 billion in line with last year as lower capital expenditures in the quarter offset the negative impact of currency and net earnings. And working capital requirements remained firmly under control.  Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains very strong and we continue to benefit from strong fixed income investor confidence. During the quarter, we successfully issued additional bonds for a total of 2 billion euros and 0.5 billion Swiss francs and now have a weighted average cost of long term debt of 5.6% We continue to implement our strategy to return cash to our shareholders we have declared our willingness to support our target dividend payout ratio of 65%. And we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 36.7 million shares during the first quarter. As we have said previously we do not expect the tobacco industry to be immune from the impact of the global economic crisis but to remain resilient. This has been borne out during the first quarter. We have seen some softening on consumer trends in Russia and Ukraine but now global negative pattern. We have continued volume growth for example in Indonesia further trading up from the low and super-low price segments in Argentina. We have also seen some reductions in trade inventories in certain markets as our partners seek to optimize cash flows. If unemployment continues to increase we may see a further softening of global consumer trends but think that should this occur it is likely to be moderate in nature. We believe we have the strongest overall brand portfolio and the best geographic balance in the industry between mature and emerging markets. The efforts that we have made to refresh our innovation pipeline and to strengthen the Marlboro architecture are beginning to bear fruit. As highlighted earlier we have increased prices across broad range of markets in order to partially mitigate the impact of unfavorable currency as well as any future potential volume or mixed softness. And most recently have announced the price increase in Germany. The excise tax and regulatory environment continues to manageable. We are not aware of any potentially disruptive threats on the horizon in our key markets except as previously mentioned in Ukraine. We continue to implement our productivity programs. And are on track to deliver substantial cost savings. In the short term we face some strong currency headwinds nevertheless our business continues to generate substantial cash flows which along with our very solid balance sheet provide us with excellent liquidity.  We remain committed to generous dividend level and foresee share repurchase in 2009 at a level similar to those undertaken in 2008. We remain focused on further strengthening our brands and our overall business and will therefore not take any measures to provide only short term gain. We remain committed to our mid to long term currency neutral finance growth targets and strongly believe that we will be able to achieve them in 2009 in spite of the difficult economic environment. I will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Christine.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: I am looking at the EU I respect your comments about no global trade down but looking at Marlboro share across France, Germany, Italy and of course Poland some share erosion as well as some sequential slow down in some key markets. Given the importance of the EU on your profits can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing sequentially and given the strong innovation portfolio behind Marlboro why perhaps Marlboro is not holding better than what we saw in the quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: Well first of all I would say that if you look at the shares for the EU region then you clearly can see that Marlboro is stabilizing let's not forget that Marlboro over the past couple of years was under pressure by price repositioning of premium brands to mid price brands that went to the low end. That is behind us we still have some slight share erosion in Germany. It is still down 0.6 France is down into quarter-on-quarter comparison but flat actually if you compare it to Q4 of 2008. Spain down 0.5, Poland down 0.04, so these are much lower rates than what you have seen and actually when you go to the innovation pipeline. Well not just enter the beginning of rolling that out. You have the Marlboro relaunch, repackaging of Marlboro Gold its now in the markets in Germany, Austria, Poland, France, Italy. So this is just starting Marlboro advanced had milligram product under the Gold umbrella the role out actually is only starting with France now later this month for the beginning of May. So many of the initiatives that we have done have just started there is much more to come. And this is what gives me the confidence that this is going to strengthen the Marlboro franchise going forward. When it comes to the total EU market then you have to see that there was one really very special item in there. Which was the trade or the retail inventory reduction in Spain which was driven by working capital requirements of tobacconist these are all small entrepreneurs. Which have brought their stocks little bit down but not to the point where we would risk any other stocks there, so that had an impact on the market and therefore on the volumes this quarter.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thanks for that Hermann. If I could follow up with just a couple of housekeeping items. Could you quantify the cost savings achieved in the quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: We are, we have delivered our $500 million actually last year we are fully on track to achieve $500 million again this year. We have leave cost increases in the quarter that was $40 million again that also something reflect earlier. So I have to tell you I can fully reassure that we will deliver the next $500 million in the year 2009.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay great. And finally just on the chatter around multinational tax changes or potential changes in the US tax regime do you have any commentary about that and what you are potential impact or alternative may be there?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes I have, I mean the most important thing first of all is that any limitation of tax deferral would put US companies simply at competitive disadvantage versus that international. That is certainly not something that the US government wants. I would say that actually probably what the US government has in mind that all of those points do not apply to PMI. I mean first I think the government probably wants to avoid foreign profits or part approach forever. I mean our case is that three quarters of our earnings abroad are actually repatriated to the US every year, in order to satisfy dividends and other US dollar requirements the second thing is that this is of course a fight against the abuse of tax havens. We are not using or abusing any of those tax havens. And the third one is probably that the government wants to avoid profit shifting via inter-company pricing abroad. I can tell you that we have conservative inter-company pricing policy around the world consistent policies, and actually we secure those policies where feasible with advance pricing agreements with the respective fiscal authorities of those countries. So in terms of looking forward to see what will happen we did some if you like simulation what the Wrangler proposal actually would mean to us that this is idea of combining some restrictions of deferral and restrictions on possible deductions with rate reduction while that impact would be less than 1% on our tax rate. So we will see what's going to come but you can see we are clearly not the target that the US government is having in mind.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Great thanks for that Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Good morning Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: First I have a question about market share I think its fair to say that your overall share trends improves throughout 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter and it appears not just in EU. But broadly that is going to have momentum has moderated in the first quarter, do you think that’s a fair observation and if it is true what’s happening, is it a reflection of the economy, your premium price positioning, the price increases you have taken and so on. 
Hermann Waldemer: While we have been talking about the UB4, let's go to the other regions, I do not agree this statement, let's go one-by-one. You go to the Asia region, there actually we have stabilized our share in Japan, very important market at 23.9%. We are growing tremendously in Korea, we are growing 2.3% in the Singapore, 48 region share in terms of in-market sales is also up 0.3% to 19.8%. So, that’s not valid I would say for the Asia region. If I then go over to the EMEA region, then you look at Neilson shares while our shares both in Russia and in Ukraine and actually in Turkey and other important market are up quite a bit. So, now I don't see any general trends that are always specific market situation on a market-by-market basis.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly, Hermann is illicit trade becoming anymore of an issue with the weakening economies?
Hermann Waldemer: No. We don't see that, I mean elicit trade I would say in general is rather triggered by large price differentials between neighboring countries. No, we don't see an increase there. It remains a problems, but it's not increasing it's not much decreasing either. I mean our EU agreement there is very successful, we have seen that the UK actually joined now. The EU agreements just a couple of days or a week ago. Now all 25 member stage are now part of that agreement.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then two aspects Hermann, with respect to share repurchases what's the argument given where the stock is valued, where it traded in the first quarter. What’s the argument against either accelerating the programs which or just front-end loading it a bit given the current stock price.
Hermann Waldemer: It's again is what we are speculating if you like at the end of today. We have been pretty heavy in the market in the first quarter I would say, 1.3 billion is US $1.3 million that’s a sizeable amount of money I would say. We will continue to do what we did that in principle and in general we will go now on a steady pace.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly Hermann, in Brazil I know it's not a big profit center for you, but being BAT led a price increase in that market I think a few weeks ago. Have you followed them as of yet?
Hermann Waldemer: We are filing our price list today, that price list contains substantial price increases across the Board of our portfolio. That being said it's a bit unfortunate that this heavy excise increase driven change was not accompanied by reform of the excise tax system, which in my opinion is over due in Brazil.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you. Hermann, I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Again just a couple of things, in Germany taken a price increase first time though for a number of year's, given that down trading continues and then there still seems to be a problem with elicit trade. Is that simply reflect that perhaps you have accepted ongoing down trading within Germany or is that something that can still be stopped.
Hermann Waldemer: Well look, the Germany market is not an easy market has never been an easy market, but I think in terms of performance, we have seen substantial improvement in Germany. We have a great team there that has done a great job. Our share performance for cigarettes is stable now at 35.8%. So, we have restabilized Marlboro in that market is slightly down. The new gold a new pack design is going out there. At the same time we have established L&M at the low price which has you know is not that much of a difference in price than in other markets, just on $0.40 we have established L&M there, it is the fastest going major brand in the markets, it is now at 7.6% share, it's having an 24 share of 15%.  So, I think overall we are doing fine in the market, it's just that the market environment in that sense has changed at what you were used to say 3-4-5 year's ago, that we were talking about the image contenders between Marlboro, Lucky Strike and [Angola's Blonde]. And today we talk about those free to giver eventually versus at the low end the [JPSS, the Parmars] and most importantly our L&M. 
Jon Leinster - UBS: Alright. And on the Ukraine, you mentioned a big tax increases coming through in May, are you there expecting, is the slight increase in volumes now and trade, is that just going to be [NOCS or trade launch] trade load in the second quarter. Is that something that’s [illegal] in the Ukraine. 
Hermann Waldemer: No, it's not going to be a much of a loading question there in the Ukraine, I mean the thing in the Ukraine simply is and that’s why we issued the word of caution there on that market is that advice overall prices or still I would say nevertheless in the affordable area. Nevertheless, we have seen a serious of excise driven price increases in a very short timeframe. We had one in September of '08, we had another one in January and now you will have another one in May. So, the speed of those price adaptations is what makes it difficult in an overall really difficult economic environment for that country. So, that I think is the crucial point in the Ukraine.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Alright. And can I just lastly, the industry signed an agreement trying that the Canadian government crack down on the elicit trade there. There seems to be a bit of a slowdown in the decline of market. I mean is the enforcement agencies actually looking at the sales of cigarettes coming up the reservations or is that still an issue to be?
Hermann Waldemer: There is still an issue and we don't see much improvement there yet. The one notable improvement I do see, however, is that the problem gets much more media attention and usually governments attention follows media attention. So that’s a good development, because at the certain point in time, this will need more enforcement and therefore, more government intervention into that topic. But we talk about 30% of consumption which is coming out illegally out of these reservations.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Okay. Well thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup:  Hello, good morning. A question on the balance if I may between pricing and share. You said that if I understand you right, you are extremely confident that your constant currency earnings guidance for the year will be met even if volumes are perhaps not weaker than expected. And it's necessary that you will increase pricing and clearly you already had a huge increase in pricing as you said on the pricing variance.  But at the same time I am interested in how you squared that, where the market share loss in the EU and they are beginning to see some signs of down trading in Russia which I guess is your most important emerging market.  I always understood that you wanted to balance profit growth and share growth. And I was wondering just in these rather difficult year where business slight changing emphasis compared with what you had been a few year's ago?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I can only talk about past pricing here, you will see what we have done. This is not a question that you answer for the word is not a question that you can answer for. A region this clearly an answer on a per market basis. We tried to find the right balance there, that’s what we have done in the past, that’s what we do now, that’s what we want to do going forward. It is a balance overall on a market-by-market basis.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: And I guess I infer from that, even some markets you loose a bit of share but you basically improved profit by taking pricing as you have to than you are comfortable with that.
Hermann Waldemer: We made conscious decisions on a market by market basis yes.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, hi Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: One question on Russia here. As you see signs of some down trading in that market can you talk about what's happening with price gaps between premium and low price. And as down trading is happening do you sense any reluctance on the part of your competitors to follow price increases or is this industry still pretty rationale in terms of the pricing?
Hermann Waldemer: Look I mean in terms of price gaps in the Russian market they have not increased substantially I mean some times at the low end it’s a little bit less in absolute terms in terms of our price increases than at the high end I mean the gaps are Russia are wide in any case. So therefore question of down trading is not driven price gaps in that market I am speaking Russia here. It is really rather the rather the environment overall and then when you looked at our in market sales data. And you see that actually Parliament which is super premium continues to grow then Marlboro being premium Chesterfield being at the high end of the mid price being in somewhat declining. And then you see sharp increases at the low end in other case Bond Street being up 27% almost. Its clear what's happening there and its clear how the different segment of population are doing so this is very much driven by that. Let me add there that actually Parliament in our case in Russia is a bigger brand than Marlboro and actually the margin we derived from Parliament in Russia are about 50% higher than the ones from Marlboro.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then in Latin America and Canada region Hermann you saw pass it down about 9% if you take our currency and as actually pricing seemed pretty favorable there so I am just wondering what happened just from a profitability perspective in that region?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Of course minus 9% I believe it will sound terrible but that actually means in absolute terms $14 million. So we have to put in to the context there this is actually driven really by trade inventory adjustments, Columbia is an ancient also little bit into Dominican Republic. Then in terms of comparison to the year before you had an excise windfall profit in Ecuador which you don’t have this year. So its kind of unfavorable comparison there and in terms of absolute money we do not talk about this stuff. I mean let me put it this way there is nothing fundamentally wrong in the business model to contrary we are doing we had price increases as it said in both Mexico and Argentina. We are growing share in our most important markets of Mexico up 2.2% to 69.2, Argentina 72.2 I mentioned. Brazil is also up and important Canada is up also on share point performer if you (inaudible) my be we are not yet 100% owner of the company so there is nothing fundamentally wrong in the Latin America region.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then finally on currency Hermann. If I look at your first quarter it looks like currency was about $0.15 of a negative impact I think your guidance still implies about $0.80 hit for the full year. And I know you have alluded to some favorability that was seen more recently. But if you sort of annualize the $0.15 you get $0.60 and then fourth quarter I had imagine year-over-year comparisons are actually more favorable versus kind of the first three quarters of the year. So it actually seems like there is even bigger print upsize than kind of the EPS coming in at the high end of your guidance at rates. And am I not reading this correctly?
Hermann Waldemer: We are doing here also kind of regularly our currency sensitivities where we think we are going to come out its actually the volatility in the which is the key argument and we have this instance of impact when we the guidance at spot rates then beginning of February than actually if you were, the simulation at quarter close i.e. at the end of March. $0.80 would $0.75 then if I would do it we did do it again on Monday this week than it was $0.70. And if I do it yesterday it is $0.73 you see the volatility up and down in there. So given that volatility we simply see no basis to change our guidance based on currency at this point in time let's talk again once we have three more months of actual after end of quarter two.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Credit Suisse.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Hi Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi Thilo.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Do the four markets of Russia, Ukraine, Mexico and Turkey still account for about 75% of the negative currency effect this year?
Hermann Waldemer: Roughly, yes.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then you talked about Spain and the one-off inventory expansion that you saw did your working capital requirements for the wholesalers. What gives you the confidence that this is only a one quarter phenomenon, why could not this strike out into second and third quarter as well? And how much do the price increases in Spain have to do with the volume there?
Hermann Waldemer: I do not think its price increases it is, at a level but I think that they are at least close to the levels that they really need I mean I would imagine that quite a number of retailers given the difficult situation our country is in and they are in terms of working capital that they had a close look at the inventories again what they really need. And that’s what they have adjusted to I mean if I just give you comparison you have 10% down as I mentioned. But if you take the last four week moving average than its simply down 3.1% so I think that has already come down I think it was an adjustment and it should not repeat itself.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then the down trading that you are now seeing in Russia you said it was driven by the state of the economy and commodity prices what has to happen for the down trading to turn this up trading against entirely the oil price and other commodity price?
Hermann Waldemer: Well the oil price as the commodity prices have, certainly and had a big impact on the currency rate of the rubel for the consumer I think we told about consumer confidence to start and I would say leading indicator be it Russia or be it elsewhere is unemployment rates. Steeply rising unemployment rates are always warning signal and improving rates are a good signal. I think that’s what I would look at.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay and then just one last question on Poland real quick how much is illicit trade driven by the tax summarization there in Poland from that is contributing to the volume decline there?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay its right there of course now Polish practice are relatively high therefore there is now in flow into Poland. Whereas we were all used to in flow from Poland to Germany. So I mean the thing really is that the key to suggestion in Poland is however not it plays a role that you are right it plays a role but the key there is simply that driven by EU session and therefore compliance with the EU excise requirements we had a series of really steep excise driven price increases in the market. I mean look today Marlboro prices after the stock depletion we had already announced almost [9 slotis] for a pack of Marlboro that’s quite a price. And whole portfolio in the market has become much expensive than what it used to be smoking incidence which used to be in the range of 40% or even slightly above if Poland is coming down to lost measurement data we have about 33% in the market. That’s a steep decline on the other hand this around the normal rate for a Western European country. So its rather there than in cross border sales.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: All right, thanks a lot Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fell of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: I have couple of things first of all on Germany. How optimistic are you at the price increase you announced it is going to be something that generates a longer term price increase or is it something that will just be in there for. How many before the number of sticks per pack ends up? And then the second thing was on just on this general situation at distributors and destocking are there any other markets around the world where you think there might be abilities to that going on that we have not seen yet. That you are concerned about?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay I mean the first question on Germany I am commenting on future pricing but I fully enjoy the existing price increase that we have announced than on the minimum pack content yes that law is in the parliamentary process I see no reason why that piece of legislation should fail. So they changed to the new minimum pack content of 19s can eventually be in August. In terms of stock reductions at trade levels I mean we have in the general terms we probably have seen that already, I mean Spain was of a magnitude that I do not see repeated elsewhere on the other hand we took review of this in the trade try to manage pretty tightly those stocks. So I can not exclude some adjustments in addition in other markets driven by the financial situation but only by that but it would not lead to a situation where that would have impact on the competitive position I can not see situation where that would trigger out of stocks than we have the necessary trade programs in place in August to make sure that there is always enough stock available.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: And then just lastly on Japan where you benefited a little bit in shipment terms because of this production there from the US and Europe is that going to unwind in the next quarter or coming quarters or is that sort of one-off adjustments that we will not see again?
Hermann Waldemer: It is rather a one-off adjustment upward driven by that resourcing but that adjustment has been made there won’t be more of that. 
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: Okay will it unwind.
Hermann Waldemer: No 
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: Okay thanks a lot. 
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi good morning Hermann 
Hermann Waldemer : Good morning Chris.
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi If I could just follow-up on that question quickly on Japan you gave some information in the press release how excluding that one-time adjustment I believe your shipments in Japan were still up 0.8% is that correct? I thought of this, you said that market, 5.5% but I think you said your shipments were still up even excluding the inventory movement?
Hermann Waldemer: Right look I mean in overall I mean maybe a couple really on the situation in Japan I mean the underlying market decline in that market because the minus 5.5% down on the market is of course influenced caused by selling days. I think the underlying market decline is rather in the range of 4% there really, have stabilized our share performance in the markets that’s very, very important Marlboro is up that was higher priority and in terms of market competitiveness, we have achieved that and we have a double that share in young adult share. So I think we have been doing pretty well there, congratulations to the team down there. 
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay and then I wonder if you would give like a overall measure of your product mix in the quarter would that have that been positive in the quarter I know you had a little challenge of course at Marlboro being down in volume. But was your overall product mix, given measure that you could share with us?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, in terms of our volumes I mean we have that chart in presentation there premium mid and low, that actually percentage of rates has not changed versus last year.
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay right best we look at it yes sure. And then I guess maybe you perhaps have answered this question before but I was surprised by the degree of the OCI increase in Russia given what it is to Marlboro but perhaps Parliament was that much shorter that it overcame would that be the main factor even though you had big growth in the low-end?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah look in Russia first of all we have gained market share. We have kept our volume stable. We had very nice increases on Parliament and of course overall we had substantial price increases in the market so it’s the combination of those elements.
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Sure okay and then just one last question and you have mentioned you know how volumes could be tight, unemployment that’s no secret, I guess my question would be that as much as you have been very strong and diligent about taking pricing. And seem that you are really focusing our profitability as you look ahead other markets have you seen this I guess to-date where you are having to get little more promotional because of whether it’s down trading or just weakness in volumes fortunately it should be a little bit more volume sensitive and maybe you would like to be.
Hermann Waldemer: You mean in terms of us making promotional price offers or --
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes correct you promoting more heavily to try and may be stabilize volume or to slow some down trading are there any markets where you had a move on that to this point?
Hermann Waldemer: First of all it plays a much lesser role in the international markets than it does play in the US. So we have to do it at a much less extent and actually our target would rather be to bring as a general also bring it down than up. So there might be here and there in the market and we need do it for tactical reasons at a certain point in time. But is there a general trend to that then the answer is clearly no.
Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You are welcome. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of JP Morgan
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan: Hey good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Erik.
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan: Just wanted to follow-up down little bit more in terms of the Polish situation, given that the, the excise tax increases has now been put in place and are unlikely to increase further, it certainly thinks that we could gradually see some recovery in Polish volume overtime given that the, unless a trade does not appear to be massively increasing?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean if the situation in Poland I have described at present we are managing through a very difficult environment. If all those tax driven, price driven consumption declines in the market, some down trading to OTPs. So the economic downturns, so that is a difficult period that we have to mange through on the other hand now and after the end of this transition period by the end of June. The consumer will see the new prices finally. So there will be another price increase for the consumer if you like by that time. That being said, going forward in the Polish market I see really substantially improved parameters, I mean the excise tax is now in place and the system is being reformed at a lower end and went down specifically rent up there is an effective MET in place forced on in the regulation is in place. So these crazy situations we have seen before should not repeat itself, as no new excise tax increase on the horizon. So I think overall that’s going to be okay and therefore, going forward I would say that our performance in the markets is also bound to improve. Once that has all shaken out and once we come back to a normal marketing and sales competition in the market.
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan: Okay, thank you. And then just going back to the Russian situation, could you give us some more precise information on the degree to which pricing has come up in the Russian market and perhaps into the segment say from December?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, look I mean essentially if you look at the two recent price moves that we did in that was December, January where we went up at the high end by total, one and the half end then the low end and then the next one in April where we went to roughly two rules at the high end and one little bit at the low end.
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome.
Operator: We have time for one more question. So our final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Hello.
Hermann Waldemer: Hello.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: I am going to ask about the tax raise in the UK amounts, increase in the UK on both tobacco and alcohol and is this inline and in your forecast and should we be concerned but when we will see drop ends looking given price are going up?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, I personally don’t think so because look at the overall price levels in the UK already today.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Its excellent, secondly you highlighted the higher, tobacco leaf cost in the first quarter, what is your expectations for a leaf cost in the second half versus the second half of last year?
Hermann Waldemer:  Okay, look essentially what happened on leaf is really that we had to buy already lost here, I mean the price increases in terms of cash flow came last year. So we both of those higher prices and the there was cash impact last year of $480 million and now this of course washes into the income statement as you used leaf. So this crop is actually going to be a less larger crop as we expect the situation already to normalize this year. But what you have on stock you have on stock. So I would say its something between $250 million and $300 million for our P&L this year however that amount is of course included in our guidance.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: That’s right, thank you everyone.
Hermann Waldemer: Welcome. 
Operator: Thank you, I will now turn the call over to Hermann Waldemer for final remarks. 
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, well thank you very much for joining us on the conference call, the investors relations group is available in Lausanne on for follow up calls. The numbers are on our press release I would also like to remind you that our annual shareholders meeting will take place on May 5th, in New York and the our proxy and annual report can be found on our website. Again thank you very much and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, that does conclude today’s Philip Morris International first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Philip Morris International 2008 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolly, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Philip Morris International. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Rolly: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2008 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com. As we take you through our call today, we will talking about results in the fourth quarter for the full year 2008 and comparing them with the same periods in 2007 unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for Philip Morris International shipments and net revenue data exclude excise taxes. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and operating company’s income for currency and acquisitions on the last two slides of today’s presentation which will be posted on our website.  Prior to 2008 certain of PMI’s subsidiaries reported their results up to 10 days before the end of December rather than on December 31. During 2008, these subsidiaries moved to a December 31 closing date. As a result the first and fourth quarter results of previous periods have been revised to reflect this change and we have provided the revised quarterly information for 2007 and 2008 on schedules nine through 12 of today’s earnings release. The effect of this change for the year was not material to PMI’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement in today’s presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Louie Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer who will join Louie for the question-and-answer period. Louie.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining our review of our first full year results as an independent company, as well as our expectations and guidance for 2009.  In March, we shared with you our mid to long term volume and constant currency targets for net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. In 2008, we achieved or surpassed all of them. We plan to do the same in 2009, but as I shall discuss later, our results this year will be adversely impacted by significant currency hit, should current rates prevail throughout the year.  In the fourth quarter our cigarette volume growth momentum continued, with increases of 2% and 0.6% excluding acquisitions. As a result, for the full year, our cigarette volume was up 21.1 billion units to 869.8 billion, representing a growth rate of 2.5% and 1% excluding acquisitions. This marks a significant improvement over our performance in recent years and was achieved despite above trend market declines in the EU region and Japan.  Emerging markets were the principal growth driver of our solid volume performance, with particularly strong results in Algeria, Argentina, Bulgaria, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. In these markets, we benefited from overall industry volume growth and consumer up-trading to our premium and mid priced brands.  This dynamic continued through the end of the fourth quarter. Illustrated by the fact that during the quarter, our revenue growth excluding currency in key markets such as Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine remained robust and essentially in line with and in several cases exceeding the annual trend. As of yet, we have not witnessed any evidence of a shift in consumer behavior in our principal emerging markets. While the rate of up-trading appears to have slowed in very recent weeks, in some markets and most noticeably in Russia, no sign of consumer down trading has yet been detected. This is obviously good news.  We must however recognize that the year has barely started and the global economic crisis is still unfolding and accordingly, there is no certainty that these trends will be sustained. Having said that, we believe that any shift were it to happen, would be mitigated by both the fact that the premium segment is still of moderate size in numerous emerging markets and that absolute and relative retail price levels have not reached prohibitive levels. Net revenues in the fourth quarter grew by 3.6% on a reported basis and by 5.6% excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, net revenues were up $2.9 billion to $25.7 billion, representing a growth rate of 12.7% on a reported basis and 5.6% excluding currency and acquisitions. Net revenue growth has been driven by our good volume performance, significant increases in prices across all regions and a favorable product mix. Of particular note, is that the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was equal to that at the full year.  Operating companies income or OCI in the fourth quarter suffered a substantial currency hit and was essentially even with the corresponding prior year period. However, excluding acquisitions and currency, OCI was up 7.4% or $171 million, in spite of the increased expenditures of some $100 million in brand building in several key markets including Indonesia and Japan. For the full year, OCI reached $10.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion or 16.7% and 9.9% excluding currency and acquisitions, surpassing our constant currency target for operating income growth of 6% to 8%. Income growth was attributable to stronger volume and a significantly better mix than in previous years, a $1.2 billion pricing contribution and productivity initiatives. In addition, OCI was lifted by favorable currency of $481 million for the full year. Adjusted EPS declined by $0.01 or 1.4% in the fourth quarter, but we’re up a strong 12.5% excluding the adverse currency impact incurred during the quarter. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share of $3.32 were up $0.52 or 18.6% and excluding currency rose by 13.2%. Discretionary or free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, reached $6.8 billion in 2008, an increase of $2.4 billion or 52.7% compared to 2007, despite higher capital expenditures, related in particular to the establishment of new factories in Indonesia and Greece.  This very strong cash flow performance was attributable to our strong net income growth, the optimization of our supply chain and a lower use of cash to fund working capital, reflecting a partial resolution of forestalling issues. We expect that our cash flow in 2009 will benefit from our continued focus on all elements of our working capital and thus should exceed our net income performance. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our year end net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 0.94:1. In our debut year, we successfully accessed the capital markets and issued $10.1 billion of bonds at various well laddered maturities and currencies for an attractive aggregate interest cost of 5.8%. Our continued and uninterrupted ability to tap the commercial paper market at particularly favorable rates underscores our recognized credit worthiness. Our resolve to reward shareholders has remained steadfast despite the financial market turbulence. We raised our dividend by 17.4% in August, to an annualized rate of $2.16 per share, inline with our target payout ratio of 65%. Our share repurchases totaled $5.4 billion, ahead of our timetable for our two year $13 billion program ending April 2010.  One of the key benefits that we expected from the spin-off of PMI was faster decision making and speed to market, the fostering of a greater entrepreneurial spirit, more effective execution and a focus on innovation. Marlboro’s performance is testament to our progress in these areas. Indeed Marlboro achieved a 0.2 shipment volume growth in 2008, with gains of 2.8% in the EMEA region, 6.4% in Asia and 4.1% in Latin America and Canada, more than offsetting a decline in the European Union region of 6%.  Marlboro’s improving momentum is underscored by its volume growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and we are confident that in spite of the current difficult economic climate, we will further strengthen and grow Marlboro going forward. Marlboro’s brand architecture, supported by three key pillars which we have described to you previously, is in full construction mode and early signs in each affected market are exceedingly promising. Let me provide you with a few examples of initiatives that are in place in numerous markets and that will gradually be rolled out geographically. Marlboro Filter Plus or Flavor Plus is now available in 20 markets. It has garnered significant consumer interest and enhanced Marlboro’s vitality.  It has been particularly successful in Rumania, where it has captured a 2.5% national share and a 4% share in Bucharest in December. In Moscow it now has a 1.2 share, in Almaty, Kazakhstan a 1.5 share and a 0.6 share in Kiev. In November it was launched in Japan and has already captured a 0.3 share.  Marlboro intense, which is also named compact or pocket pack, is now available in the 11 markets. In December it enjoyed a national share of .6% in Spain and 0.5% in Italy, with stronger shares in key urban areas and an attractive demographic profile. Several launches of the new gold pillar have been executed to-date. Gold edge, Marlboro’s first ever slims offering, is now available in Hungary, Poland, Russia and Ukraine and has already got a 0.4 share in Brussels.  The new Marlboro gold offer is currently being expanded nationally in Austria, after a very promising test market in Vienna, which witnessed to solid lift in market share. It is also being tested in both France and Italy, in four cities with encouraging results. The test market in France has been supplemented with an additional offering called Marlboro gold advance, again recording positive early signs. The third pillar which revolves around the concept of freshness is also under construction in numerous Asian and Latin American markets. Initiatives have been launched to date in 19 markets with solid results. These have propelled a 32% increase in Marlboro Menthol and fresh volumes in Latin America. The most successful launch has been in Japan, where Marlboro Black Menthol holds a 1% share of market. Numerous exciting plans are in place to continue to build upon Marlboro’s architecture in 2009 and beyond. As we have often stated, our brand portfolio extends well beyond Marlboro and each brand has a key role to play as evidenced by their strong performance in 2008. Indeed Parliament and Virginia Slims performed very strongly last year, with volume growth of 20% and 8.2% respectively, driven by their unique product characteristics, premium priced position, innovation and geographical expansion. In the mid-price category, Chesterfield’s 13.7% volume increase in 2008, more than offsets L&M’s decline, which slowed in the fourth quarter as the new L&M essence performed better in Rumania and Ukraine and L&M continued to be the fastest growing brand in Germany with a gain of 1.9 share points for the year.
 : On the acquisition and business development front, 2008 was another exciting year. In October we completed the acquisition of Rothman’s Inc. in Canada. I’m pleased to report that the integration is progressing rapidly and smoothly and we are delighted with this new member of the PMI family. We enhanced our presence in the growing fine cut segment, with the acquisition in June of Interval, the leading fine cut brand in France and we are pleased to announce today the acquisition of the Petteroes brand, the leading fine cut brand in Norway, with a 58% category share. Yesterday, we announced our agreement with Swedish Match to establish an exclusive smokeless tobacco products joint venture, which will cover all markets outside of Scandinavia and the USA. We believe that such products represent a reduced risk for adult smokers and are very excited about their potential over the longer-term in a wide variety of geographies. As discussed previously, we continue to pursue a number of business development initiatives and I remain hopeful that some of these will materialize as the coming year unfolds. All-in-all, as I look in the rearview mirror, we had a strong year by any measure and we entered 2009 with a reenergized organization, solid momentum and exciting plans. Let me now turn to our prospects for the coming year. Regretfully, currency will cast a dark shadow on our financial results, should exchange rates remain at current levels. Since the end of the third quarter, we have witnessed an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and a steep depreciation in the value of many emerging market currencies, in particular the Russian ruble, the Turkish lira, the Indonesia rupiah, the Mexican peso and the Ukrainian grivna. We also witnessed huge volatility in exchange rates. For example, the dollar/euro exchange rate traded in a range of 123 to 147 in the fourth quarter alone, making currency forecasting quite hazardous. While we believe that economic fundamentals will pressure the U.S. dollar overtime, we established our EPS guidance for the year based on current exchange rates. As a result, in spite of the strength of our underlying business, our current EPS guidance, including an adverse currency impact of $0.80 for the full year is in a range of $2.85 to $3, compared to our EPS of $3.32 in 2008. Let me illustrate the extent to which currency movements within the last month have impacted this guidance. At the spot rates prevailing as recently as mid December 2008, our EPS guidance would have been $0.40 higher. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect EPS growth to fall within a range of 10% to 14% in 2009 and we’re confident that we will be able to achieve our volume and currency neutral targets again this year, namely volume growth of 1% to 2%, net revenue growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 6% to 8%.  Our confidence is based on our solid momentum and the strengths of our fundamentals. We own seven of the top 15 international cigarette brands. Our superior brand portfolio is led by Marlboro, which remains the only true global cigarette brand and it has demonstrated its growth potential following our renewed focus on innovation and the development of the new brand architecture. We believe we have the greatest global reach and the best geographic balance in the industry between mature and emerging markets. The spin-off has enhanced our speed to market and our flexibility. Our ambitious productivity program is generating substantial cost savings and we believe that the excise tax and regulatory environment is manageable, with no immediate and potentially disruptive threats on the horizon.  Furthermore, our business generates substantial cash flows, which along with our very solid balance sheet provides us with excellent liquidity. We remain committed to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders during the year, through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate that our share repurchases in 2009 will essential be inline with the dollar level we expended in 2008. We are very focused on the fundamentals of our business and intend on delivering industry leading growth. Therefore, while we will do everything we can to mitigate the impact of unfavorable currency, we will not implement any measures that could jeopardize our strong underlying business momentum and sacrifice our long term growth for a short term benefit. Thank you.  Hermann and I will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon Louie and Hermann.
Louie Camilleri: Good afternoon David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley:   Louie, let me start with currency. I obviously and other outsiders try to forecast the adverse currency impact or the currency impact. Clearly I was fairly far off in ‘09 and I’m just curious, is there something other than translation that’s substantial, that’s having that magnitude of a negative impact were there are hedging gains that aren’t replicable, are there transactional issues in the businesses in ’09, etc.?
Louie Camilleri: No, it’s purely translation David. I mean, I don’t know what your models and other models are. My own sense is you have probably underestimated the hit, the currency hit in terms of translation of the emerging markets. If I just take four principal emerging markets; if I take Russia, Turkey, Mexico and the Ukraine, those four markets alone account for some $0.60 of the $0.80 hit and I would suspect that your models probably haven’t factored in such a hit for those emerging markets.
David Aldeman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly Louie, are you and the board prepared, at least temporarily, to allow the payout ratio to drift above the 65% target in the short term?
Louie Camilleri: Most definitely.
David Aldeman - Morgan Stanley: Okay, good. Thirdly, is there any evidence to date or any realistic risk that some of your global competitors that are based in a market whose currency has not appreciated to the extent of the dollar like the British pound, have been or will be more willing to reinvest in the markets with price competition or greater levels of spending behind their own innovation?
Louie Camilleri: I think you’d to have ask them that question directly David. The evidence would suggest, over the last couple months, and there’s been quite a lot of pricing activity across the world, the evidence would suggest that nobody at this stage is trying to use a currency benefit, to get some sort of competitive advantage. The year is still early, but we haven’t detected anything. My own sense is that, just the way you haven’t given us much currency benefits in 2008, investors are unlikely to give much currency benefit to our two key competitors who report in sterling. I think that investors tend to look at constant currency growth rates more and more, especially in these volatile times.
David Aldeman - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then Louie one last thing. It obviously doesn’t make sense today to put your the pedal to the floor in terms of raising real pricing in emerging markets, but do you think there’s a lesson to this point, given how well the business has held up versus other consumer goods that just from a secular perspective the industry is giving emerging market consumers too much value, and therefore there is an opportunity over time to substantially increase profitability in these markets?
Louie Camilleri: Well again, that’s potentially an oversimplification David. When has to look at excise tax levels as well, but clearly, as I mentioned in my remarks, in most emerging markets, we’re in a pretty good situation in terms of absolute and relative price levels and that would lead to you believe that there is significant pricing potential going forward. I would want to highlight however, that we have used the pricing leader quite significantly, certainly in 2008, in a lot of these markets and we will continue to do so and our guidance does project quite a lot of pricing across the world.
David Aldeman - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Adam Spielman with Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Good afternoon gentlemen.
Louie Camilleri: Good afternoon Adam.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Can I ask just a clarification that I hope I had it right. You said at the beginning of 2009 there was no change to the trading in your main markets, but then I think you said there have been some slowing of the up-trading in Russia. Have I got what you meant correctly?
Louie Camilleri: You’ve said that correctly, yes, that we have witnessed a slowdown in the up-trading to premium. It used to be sort of double-digit rates, it’s now single-digit rates, but the up-trading continues.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Excellent. Second question if I may. I’m talking about in January ‘09, have you raised prices of any of your key brands in any of your major markets apart from Spain and the UK?
Louie Camilleri: If I take, quite a lot of pricing happened in November and December, Adam. So, in a number of markets we’ve increased prices. Russia, Ukraine is going up, Indonesia has gone up, Italy we just launched price increase with the administration, so that should happen within the next two or three weeks. There’s been pricing in the Benelux, I mean there’s been pricing across the world. Mexico has been pricing. I could go on.
Adam Spielman – Citigroup:  Thank you. That’s very useful indeed. Thank you very much.
Louie Camilleri:  You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Louie Camilleri: Good afternoon Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Louie, if we look at the Marlboro’s volume growth in the quarter, obviously this is the second quarter in a row that we saw volume grow for the brand. If you will look out 2009, I’m just wondering how you think about the sustainability of that improvement.  On one hand, I guess you could point to potentially some weakening of maybe the premium brands. On the other hand, that your market has been under pressure from a Marlboro brand perspective, so potentially there is some recovery that we could expect. If you can just characterize, how you feel about the Marlboro’s outlook, if you look out for the rest of 2009?
Louie Camilleri: Yes. Well, I think as I said in my remarks Judy, if you take the EU and Japan, the market declines in those two territories, we’re above trend in 2008 and we feel that in 2009 we won’t suffer such market erosion, so that’s already a positive. With regard to Marlboro itself, this new architecture that is basically taking place is still very much in its early phase and we have a number of ambitious plans for Marlboro and clearly our plans call for continued growth of Marlboro radio both in share and volume. So, what you saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we anticipate that that hopefully will continue as 2009 unfolds. In fact, if I look at our momentum, both in terms of OECD and non-OECD markets, the momentum is actually accelerating. So that’s a good sign and we have a number of exciting initiatives this coming year and we’re very hopeful that will all translate into better results.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and part of the acceleration that you’re seeing in your underlying business momentum, I presume is partly driven by the step-up in the investment that you’ve made throughout 2008 and I’m just wondering how you now feel about the level of the brand support at this point and whether we could start to see more positive operating leverage and some more of the cost savings now flowing to the bottom line, rather than that getting reinvested back into the marketplace, given that the volume momentum that you are seeing?
Louie Camilleri: Listen, we continue to invest judiciously behind the brand, Judy. Our productivity initiatives, we have called back in March for productivity of $1.5 billion, averaging about $500 million a year. We achieved that in 2008. We believe we will achieve in that in 2009. We also I think alerted for sometime the investment community to increases in leaf costs. That will be around $350 million next year in terms of leaf costs, which is part of our guidance. I would say that we are in competitive levels, but given the actions we have for Marlboro in a number of markets we will continue to invest behind the brand.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Can you quantify how much of the productivity savings you got in 2008 versus the three year target?
Louie Camilleri: We were smack on the number of 500.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then finally, just in terms of how you’re thinking about the share buyback commitment, the two year $13 billion you have in place and I know you’ve committed to the dividend rate being higher than the 65% target rate. I’m just wondering if you have the same level of commitment to completing that buyback program.
Louie Camilleri: Absolutely, we have a steadfast commitment both in terms of the dividends and share repurchases. Listen, we have the benefit of generating significant cash flow. As I mentioned in 2008, our cash flow was up close to 53%. We think our cash flow performance in the coming year will be better than that of our net income performance. We have still a very strong balance sheet and we believe that as I mentioned in my remarks, our share repurchases will be essential in line with the ones we did in 2008.  In 2008 we expended $5.4 billion. That was some 25% or $1.1 billion ahead of schedule. So we have the luxury in 2009 and let us never forget that by buying back these shares, we’re also saving the dividend and that should give some comfort to those who are somewhat worried; I don’t know why, but I am told that some are worried about the dividend. I think if you looked at the history of PMI’s parent, if I can call it that, and PMI, we have always ascribed huge importance to the dividend and the 65% target payout ratio was a target and if that slips above in any given year, so be it. We recognize the importance of the dividends and we have the benefit of a very strong and predictable cash flow, which gives us confidence in our dividend and share repurchase programs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you, Judy. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Fell with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: Hi everyone. I have to say excellent, David’s (Inaudible) as well as far as getting the FX impacts wrong. I’m just wondering if you could give us a bit more help for the models. I mean, it looks like you are talking about an overall FX impact if we take the mid range of your underlying growth estimates and the actual guidance. It looks like the FX impact is negative 20%. Is it going to be a similar negative 20% at both revenue and EBIT? Would I be right in thinking that in the EU and Asia the impact’s going to be quite a long way under the 20% and we’d be treating it higher in your region?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, that would be a fair characterization Jonathan. As I say, we’re be dramatically hurt by principally the four markets I mentioned, which were Russia, Mexico, Turkey and the Ukraine. There are others, the Kazakhstan; Tenge was devalued by 20% just today. That’s a $35 million net income hit.  So there are a lot of other currencies that one has to build into the model, but I would say that the four key ones are the ones I mentioned and they are $0.60 out of the $0.80, those four. I mean, the ruble alone in the last month has affected our guidance by $0.20. So 25% of our currency hit happened in one currency in one month.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: Okay. I guess on the EU, it looks like we saw a little bit of a deterioration there in underlying shipments and profitability trends in the fourth quarter. Is there anything there which concerns you or is that something that you’d expect to see sort of disappear fairly rapidly going into 2009 and those turn to normal?
Hermann Waldemer: No, I’m not overly concerned; in fact, quite to the contrary. I think we sort of tried to the best of our ability, to point out that the distortions in the EU that were caused by events in both the Czech Republic and Poland. If you eliminate those, as our earnings release points out, the trends are actually okay and in fact if I look at market shares, in most instances the trend is actually pretty good and we’re looking towards a much better year next year, because we’ll have the distortions of the Czech and Poland behind us. Germany is doing well. I think with the pricing in a few places we’ve narrowed the gap with Marlboro, so we’ll see what happens there and I would say that EU looks today better than it certainly did at the beginning of last year. Let’s forget also as I mentioned in an answer to a previous question that the total markets, we don’t see eroding the way they did 2008 either, because most of the public smoking restrictions that affected industry shipments and consumption are behind us.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, thanks very much.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you, Jonathan.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Christine Farkas with Banc of America. 
Christine Farkas - Banc of America: Thank you very much. Good afternoon Louie and Hermann; a question on volume, just keeping with volumes, could you quantify the trade inventory boost in Bulgaria in the quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: It wasn’t major. It was essential 500 million units.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America: Okay, great and then just broadly speaking Louie, speaking of excise taxes, I guess around the world, would you expect these generally to accelerate over ‘08 next year?
Louie Camilleri: Well, you would think that because of the economic crisis, governments would want more revenues and excise tax revenues from tobacco. So far we frankly haven’t seen any dramatic increases. In fact in a number of places, legislators have voted down increases because of the economic crisis, so it’s working both ways in a way.  Where we have seen increases, they haven’t been dramatic Indonesia is one example, where there has been a tax increase. It’s roughly up 7%, which is sort of in line with what we've seen in the past, but very importantly the structure of the tax and the eventual gradual harmonization of the tiers continues, so that’s good news.  In the Philippines they’ve called for a tax increase to try to buttress the budget deficit. It’s being discussed in parliament now, but there are a lot of voices calling for no tax increase. Japan, was probably the best example. I know a lot of investors were very concerned about a tax increase in Japan. Whilst it’s not over and we’ll know at the end of March, but the tax committee has recommended no tax increase on cigarettes in Japan and that committees recommendation has never historically been changed.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America: Okay, that’s helpful. Moving to your brand spending, you called out about $100 million in brand spending, so it looks almost like a one-time and I know this question was sort of asked; is this something that’s stepped up now into your base or do you think that this is specific initiatives around specific initiatives in the year and of course we’ll lap this in a year’s time?
Louie Camilleri: Well, they are clearly specific initiatives linked to some of our brand launches, but also I think that was part of it, particularly in Japan, was to make us or render us more competitive in the inconvenient store channel. I think we’ve mentioned this in previous calls, there’s been a dramatic shift in the market in Japan from vending to convenient stores. Convenience stores in 2007 used to represent 40% of consumption; in 2008 it was 60%. So they’ve taken on a huge importance and the competitive battlefield has moved to the convenient store. So we need to be equipped to be able to compete in these key outlets. That is one example.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America: Okay great. Now, finally on snus given your arrangement with Swedish Match, my question to you is where are the key market that you see as appealing in the near to intermediate term? And should we view this as perhaps seeing some sort of signal that the EU may lift the ban?
Louie Camilleri: Well, we are hopeful that the EU will lift the ban and we will do everything together with Swedish Match to ensure that that ban is lifted. There are very strong arguments to lift it and if you go back to the origins of the ban, it was essentially a protectionist measure by what were the Mediterranean monopolies at that time. So, they had nothing to do with health; it was just pure protectionism. I would be weary to give you specific markets at this stage as to where we will focus our attention, but as things developed you will be the first to be informed of where we’re going to launch and how for obvious competitive reasons, but there are a number of markets where we can launch news today that we will explore and study very carefully.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: Thanks so much, Louie.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you very much Christine.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Erik Bloomquist with JP Morgan 
Erik Bloomquist – JP Morgan: Good morning.
Hermann Waldemer: Good afternoon, Eric.
Erik Bloomquist – JP Morgan: Just wanted to drill into a couple markets then; with respect to Germany, could you update us on where things stand with respect to potential increase in the stick count?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, we understand that there’s quite a lot of movement on that subject. Within the German administration and we’re cautiously optimistic that decision will be announced in the not too distant future. So, that is excellent news.
Erik Bloomquist – JP Morgan: Okay, super and then are there discussions, I suppose you can’t comment directly, but it seems to us that the French pricing environment is one in which would make sense to further move price points above current levels. Are there discussions with the French administration on improving the revenues for the French government?
Louie Camilleri: Regretfully no, not at the time being and I regret to say this, but unfortunately in the last quarter of last year, one of our competitors publicly went out and said that the government was considering a price increase to generate higher revenues, at a moment where the economic crisis was unfolding. The government actually denied that, asked us denied it, which we did and regretfully we’re sort of stuck in limbo at the moment. Having said that, our hope is that as the months unfold and tempers calm, we will be able to seek a price increase in France.
Erik Bloomquist – JP Morgan: Great. Then with respect to Indonesia, I understand that there’s been a fatwa issued to recommend no public place smoking for Muslim men. Is that something that we should take seriously in terms of having an impact on volumes or consumption within Indonesia, or is it more likely to be followed in the breach in your view?
Louie Camilleri: I wouldn’t worry about it too much. I think there have been mixed reports. This is not a new issue. All the Muslim teachings on smoking have been that it is discouraged, but it is not what’s called harem, i.e. not allowed. In Indonesia, it came out at the same time as banning yoga. So, I don’t think its being necessarily followed very seriously, and we haven’t seen any impact at all.
Erik Bloomquist – JP Morgan: Great. Last question it was just on the agreement with Swedish Match and what it means in terms of your harm reductions strategy going forward. Does this signal kind of a precedence for smokeless tobacco in terms of the harm reduction product and that focus on reduced harm or reduced risk cigarettes is something that will follow only once tobacco control people accept the validity of the smokeless claims?
Hermann Waldemer: No, I don’t think that should give you any sign of us slowing down on our other plans. This is all in parallel. It’s a basic strategy of harm reduction and the product elements of it include smokeless, but also include cigarettes, which will hopefully eliminate a lot of the harmful compounds. So, we’re working on both tracks and in fact spending quite a lot of resources on both tracks. So, it’s not one or the other, it's both at the same time.
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan: And sorry then, a quick follow-up; if you are continuing to spend in parallel, is that then a large chunk of that increase in the marketing and research spend that we saw this year; I mean the approximate $1 billion increase? Is that R&D work on reduced risk cigarettes a component of that?
Louie Camilleri: Yes.
Erik Bloomquist - JP Morgan:  Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Thilo Wrede with Credit Suisse
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon gentlemen.
Louie Camilleri: Good afternoon.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Just a quick follow-up on your commence about the volume outlook in the EU. I understand that volumes are down pretty much; it was a trend line on an adjusted basis. At the same time other tobacco products seem to be growing rather than declining. Is that an indication that maybe there is more down trading going on in the EU right now?
Louie Camilleri: I don’t think we’ve witnessed an acceleration in the down trading in EU and I suppose Marlboro’s performance is testament to that, because as the year unfolded, its performance got better. So, I would not say that there’s been an acceleration in down trading at all in the European Union.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then you mentioned brands like Next or Red & White is basically a safety net in case there would be down trading. Can you give us an idea what the average price gap would be between Marlboro and these brands?
Louie Camilleri: Varies by market quite dramatically, so it would be very dangerous for me to give you numbers. I mean, in France its 10%; in Russia it’s like 3% to 1%. Those are the two extremes, the rest is in between.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then you had some very interesting product introductions in 2008. Should we expect to see a similar range of new product introductions; be it filters, be it packaging, be it flavors like menthol, as we saw in 2008 for that to continue in 2009?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, I think as I mentioned in my remarks we have a number of exciting plans for 2009. A lot of it is geographic expansion of some of the products you already see in certain markets and others are new products. We’re very happy with our pipeline of new products and we’re going to deploy them across the world in a sort of diligent and deliberate manner.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: There are no slowdowns in spending on innovation despite the headwind from currency?
Louie Camilleri: No. I think it’s very important that we maintain our momentum and yes, currency is a dark cloud. But currency in my opinion is always a relatively short-term issue and my experience has been in times of difficulty, that is when you need to invest and push for growth and we’re in here for the long term. I’m very confident with the product portfolio we have. With the infrastructure we have we can gain share.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Alright, thanks a lot. 
Louie Camilleri: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon Louie and Herman.
Louie Camilleri: Hi Chris.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: I just had a few follow-up questions for you, if I could. The first, just as in relation to the Czech market, the distortions from that really occurred all throughout 2008 if I recall. Do we lap those starting in the first quarter?
Louie Camilleri: Yes.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay and then in terms of your expectations for 2009, would you have built in if you can just talk to this in general terms if anything, some mix degradation in your business on a concern that trade-down could occur? Can you talk about that net detail I should say for ‘09?
Louie Camilleri: Well we’ve clearly taken into account of the fact that the up-trading has slowed down, that’s something we clearly build into our numbers and beyond that I’m not sure want to till much more.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Understood, and then if I could ask, relative to your mid-tier performance, it looked like it was pretty solid in 2009. I know this can vary by market, but in terms of profits from mid-tier products versus say profits from Marlboro, are those vastly different or does it vary a lot by market?
Louie Camilleri: It varies dramatically by market, it really does, but no, we were very pleased with the performance of our medium priced brands. I mean if you take L&M and not many people know this, L&M is the number two brand in the European Union Region after Marlboro. It had strong growth in Germany, in Benelux, in France, as well as Poland, where it’s the number one brand. Chesterfield also grew very strongly across the world, but particularly in the EU, it grew very strongly in Italy and Spain and Portugal and in Switzerland. So there is quite a lot of growth coming from this mid-priced segment and it’s a lucrative segment.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay and then the last question I had for you is just in relation to consumption and I’m particularly keen on some of the emerging markets. Have you seen overall consumption of cigarettes slow, putting aside up-trading and that kind of thing for now?
Louie Camilleri: No, we haven’t really seen a shift. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, particularly because of Japan and the EU, we are projecting a better market environment than what we had in 2008, but we haven’t detected any reduction in consumption. We just got the January numbers and they’re smack on our plan.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. I appreciate that insight. Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: I should add that probably the one area which is not major, but the one area we have seen some softness is Duty Free, but clearly we have seen a reduction in travel in a number of places and particularly in Asia and we have detected some softness in the numbers on Duty Free, but that’s really so far the only thing that seems to have been hurt by the current economic climate.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. Thank you.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Hi gentlemen. So, I have two questions from me. First of all, going back to the currency translation in respect of; clearly quite a lot of the raw materials are dollar or hard currency denominated, so are you building a sort of margin impact on this sort of devaluations we’ve seen in Turkey and Russia and elsewhere?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, it goes all the way to the bottom line, to the extent there are offsetting benefits for local currency costs, that’s in the guidance.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Yes, but effectively assuming they are for quite significantly lower margins for those operations, because of the currency impact.
Louie Camilleri: Absolutely.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Alright and secondly, in terms of the debt geographically, I don’t know what the debt has been swapped into, is there an obvious geographic profile to the debt?
Louie Camilleri: No, because we have done quite a lot of euro and Swiss Franc, the bulk has still been in dollars. I think going forward, you will probably see more euros. Some of these other currencies, the interest rates are prohibitive, so it doesn’t really make much sense to do so.
Jon Leinster - UBS: Alright and also in terms of the one sort of big obvious transactional thing going back to currencies is exports in Japan. As you believe that’s hedged, so there is no real benefit in ‘09 but going forward if the end stays where it is then is that a big benefit potentially or not?
Louie Camilleri: That is the one currency that is offsetting all the big negatives and yes, we have locked in that favorability as has been our case traditionally, but if I take the Yen ‘09 at current rates versus ‘08, that is an offsetting benefit to the $0.80 hit.
John Leinster - UBS: And then lastly, no mention of the Chinese joint venture is that progressing well?
Louie Camilleri:
 : Importantly, Marlboro is doing quite well in China and as we’ve said this is a slow progress, but so far all the signs are green and things are moving. So we’re pleased with our cooperation with the CNTC and I believe they are pleased with our cooperation. 
John Leinster - UBS: Thanks very much.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
David Hayes - Nomura: Good evening gentlemen. Just going back to the guidance from $2.85 to $3 and just in terms if you obviously you’re going to fix FX assumption in that, you told us operating profit will be up organically 6% to 8%. I mean potentially that’s quite large guidance range that you have given. Is there some kind of volatility whisking the tax level or the interest cost that we should be aware of that drives that range and anything else that we should begin factoring in our numbers and then my second question is really about Camba, that was the first question?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes. No, tax will be slightly higher than it was in ‘08, I think it’s a like a $0.02 hit. There is no other real volatility. I think we’ve usually given guidance of the $0.10 range. We felt that prudence would dictate that given the world situation today, a $0.15 range was something that was more prudent.  As we said in our earnings release, we think we’ll be at the upper end of our long-term guidance and I think our long term guidance is 10 to 12. This guidance on a constant currency basis is 10 to 14 and that gives you a sense of we’re at up the upper end of our long-term guidance. I don’t know if that addresses your question.
David Hayes - Nomura: Yes, I guess. I mean I guess slightly to be offsetting if we do six at the operating profit level, here at the 2.85 range if you do with the higher end, eight or a little bit more, you are at the three and that’s proven to the statement, is that right?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, that’s right and hopefully we’re a bit more than eight.
David Hayes - Nomura:
 :
Hermann Waldemer: No, clearly we watched that and we watch our receivables and exposure like hawks. We haven’t detected any real movement. I would say that the only place we’ve detected some movement is in Japan, where the shift that I mentioned from vending to convenience stores has caused a return of quite a lot of product that was destined for vending. So that affected volumes in the fourth quarter, I think across the whole industry and those returns were higher than anticipated. This card that’s used for the vending, I think it’s now up, it’s only around 32% of smokers have that card, which gives you a sense that it hasn’t been a roaring success and therefore that explains the returns of products in the fourth quarter. Other than Japan, we haven’t seen anything and frankly I’m not surprised by it. Cigarettes are a fast moving consumer good. The margins for the retailers are excellent and they are bread and butter products for a lot of them. So, they tend to invest in that category because it’s both profitable, generates cash and moves rapidly.
David Hayes - Nomura: Sure. Okay, thank you very much.
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question is from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Good afternoon.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Ann.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: As you focus the business on faster decision making and more local market management, are you finding more opportunities to save money and if so are those potential savings in that 500 million or so number targeted this year?
Louie Camilleri: Yes, we continue to look as to ways of getting more effective. We haven’t really detected any huge things, but it’s a continual priority for us to become more effective and more efficient and I think over time we will do so, but that doesn’t impact the 500 million, if we can buy more, we will. As I said in my remarks we will do everything to mitigate this huge currency hit, obviously through pricing and cost, but not to jeopardize the long term growth and the momentum that we have and I think that’s in the best interest of our shareholders.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Great and then secondly if I may just follow-up on, Louie I think you said leaf costs are going to be $315 million this year, is that 425 number that you gave out in March of ‘08 still the right number or has that number gone up?
Louie Camilleri: No, it’s gone up. I think Hermann certainly in the third quarter and possibly even in the second has alerted investors to leave cost increases and therefore that 400 was probably going to increase by 100 to 200 and that 300 is part of that. The good news is, our sense is, as commodity prices have declined, there is more interest now in tobacco and the supply demand situation appears to be becoming much more balanced. So, I would hope that we would have the benefits in 2010 and 2011.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Then with respect to paper, do you anticipate adopting the LIP paper standard, perhaps in the EU market or Australia in the next 12 to 18 months?
Louie Camilleri: I’m not sure I understand your question.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: The low emission propensity paper, do you all anticipate using that in your products in the next…?
Hermann Waldemer: Sorry. Yes, eventually I think there will be regulatory glucose from more and more of these lower emission propensity cigarettes and we are ready to do that when necessary.
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: That potential could be in 18 months or so do you think?
Louie Camilleri: In the number of markets, yes. 
Ann Gurkin - Davenport: Okay great. That’s great thank you.
Louie Camilleri: Thank you very much Ann

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Philip Morris International's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Media representatives on the call will also be able to ask questions following the conclusion of questions from the investment community.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Philip Morris International. Please go ahead, sir. 
Nick Rolli: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2008 third quarter result. You may access it on our website at www.pmintl.com. As we take you through our results today, we will be talking about results in the third quarter 2008 and comparing them with the same period in 2007 unless specified otherwise. References to market shares are PMI estimates based on a number of sources. Net revenues data exclude excise taxes. You will find a data table showing how we made adjustments to revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions on the last slide of today's presentation which will be posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.  And now it is my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer for Philip Morris International. Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you, Nick. Hello, everyone. It is a pleasure to report excellent third quarter results in the present environment. We achieved cigarette volume growth of 4% and 3.2% excluding acquisitions. Net revenues of $7 billion were up 17.5% on a reported basis and 7.2% excluding currency and acquisitions.  Reported OCI of $2.9 billion increased by 16.7% and by 7.2% excluding currency and acquisitions. In spite of the foreseen skew in our marketing investments and expenses in the second half of the year. Finally, reported EPS of $1.01 increased 23.2% and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93 was up 19.2% versus the pro-forma adjusted base of $0.78 in 2007. These numbers track favorably to our mid-term to long-term targets which we shared with you in March. Before I delve into more detail on these very strong results, let me first address the four key topics. These are currency, our geographic balance, our Canadian acquisition and our capital structure and liquidity. In looking at currency issues, investors should remember that we are a global company with sales in some 160 markets and revenues in a wide variety of currencies. The most important of which are the euro, the Japanese yen, the Russian rouble, the Indonesian rupiah, the Mexican peso and Turkish lira. This wide basket of currency means that there are often offsetting effect. Further more, while the euro is the most important currency in terms of revenues, we have significant offsetting costs in euros and Swiss francs.  During the third quarter, the overall effect of exchange rate movements was positive to the tune of $217 million on an OCI basis. The growing strength of our business as reflected in our quarterly results enables us to reaffirm our full year 2008 guidance for adjusted diluted EPS of $3.32 to $3.38 representing a growth rate of between 19% and 21%. At current spot rates, our results should come in at the lower end of this range which is in line with current consensus estimates.  During the quarter, we generated 28% of our volume and 44% of our OCI in the mature and stable EU region. Asia which has a mix of mature markets such as Japan and emerging markets such as Indonesia contributed 25% of our volume and 19% of our OCI. The EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions which consist predominantly of emerging markets accounted for 47% of volume and 37% of OCI. We believe this represents the best geographic balance in the tobacco industry. Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that in our key emerging markets such as Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, we have continued to witness consumer uptrading to mid and premium priced products in the third quarter. Although, we cannot exclude an eventual impact of the global financial crisis on consumer behavior, we remain very upbeat about the future and the resilience of our business in these markets. Our geographic coverage is being further enhanced by our successful acquisition of Rothmans Inc. in Canada. This acquisition is both financially and strategically compelling. It provides us with a strong position in one of the five largest international markets in which we have a limited presence. The investment of just over 2 billion Canadian dollars is expected to provide attractive returns going forward. Rothmans has a growing share of about one-third of the very profitable Canadian cigarette market, and is the leader in the fine cut market. As previously disclosed, the acquisition will be modestly accretive in 2009. Following the announcement of the tender offer, we received some questions from analysts and investors regarding the litigation environment in Canada. Let me re-emphasize that we considered the issue of litigation very carefully before we made the tender offer. Our traditional defenses remain available and strong, including common knowledge of the health risks of smoking, absence of product defect, compliance with government policy, defense similar to preemption in the US and flowed statistical models to mention a few. PMI's legal team under Chuck Wall has a vast amount of experience in this domain and we believe that the Canadian litigation environment is and will continue to be manageable. The Rothman stock was de-listed on October 20 and we now own 100% of the company. The Canadian business results were incorporated into the Latin America and Canada region as of September19, but were immaterial for Q3 results. As you know, PMI has a prudent approach to its capital structure and our business generates a formidable cash flow, which underpins our healthy liquidity position in these turbulent times. Earlier this year, we successfully issued bonds for a total of $9 billion denominated in dollars, euros and Swiss francs. Thanks to our strong credit rating. We have had an uninterrupted access to the Tier 1 commercial paper market. We have currently $1.4 billion outstanding at an interest rate of 2.4%, which is well below LIBOR. We have established a committed revolving credit facility of $6.4 billion, which remains undrawn. The strength of our business fundamentals and our strong cash flows underlies the decision made on the 29 of August by our Board of Directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 17.4% to $0.54 representing an annualized rate of $2.16, which at the current share price represents an attractive yield of 5.1%. Since May, we have spent $4.5 billion against our $13 billion two-year share repurchase program. We are well ahead of schedule, and therefore are in a comfortable position to appropriately and prudently balance our fourth quarter share repurchases with developments in the financial markets over the next few weeks. In reviewing our third quarter results, let me first focus on the overall strength of our superior brand portfolio. Our cigarette volume reached 225.9 billion units, an increase of 4%. Excluding acquisitions, volume increased by 3.2%, which represents our best organic volume performance in many years reflecting continued consumer uptrading, new product initiatives and enhanced communication and consumer engagement activities. More importantly, this volume growth was accompanied by higher pricing in most key markets, resulting in a 7.2% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions. The EEMA, Asia, and Latin America and Canada regions achieved strong organic volume growth while the decline in the EU region was broadly in line with the overall market decline. The vast majority of our key brands including Marlboro had positive volume trends. Marlboro shipments volume increased in the quarter by 1.1% to 80.3 billion units. Marlboro shipments were up in all geographical regions except the EU. Strong results were achieved in a wide variety of markets such as Argentina, Indonesia, Japan and Ukraine. Our innovative line extensions are helping to strengthen the vitality and overall equity of the brand. Marlboro Black Menthol, for example achieved a 1% share of the Japanese market in September. This is the best result in recent years for any new brand in Japan.  Despite some cannibalization, this launch enabled Marlboro to gain 0.4 share points compared to the previous quarter and PMI to reinforce leading position in the growing menthol in Japan. Marlboro Filter Plus continues to grow and is being further rolled out geographically. For example, we have achieved a 3.1% share in Bucharest, a 2.1% share in Kuwait and 0.9% share in Moscow. With a strong skew towards young adult smokers which we define as smokers between legal age, minimum 18 and 24 years old.  Other new initiatives behind Marlboro include the further geographic expansion of the shorter Marlboro Intense, the introduction in Latin America of new Menthol variant and the launch in Poland of Marlboro Gold Edge, a super-slim variant. Parliament shipments were up 15.8%, thanks to tremendous momentum in Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine while Virginia Slims volume was 3.6% higher. We are further reinforcing Parliament in Russia and Ukraine with the launch during the fourth quarter of the Luxury Super Slims Parliament Reserve. While Virginia Slims is benefiting from the growth of its UNO variance. Our two key brands in the mid-price segment are L&M and Chesterfield. While L&M continues to be an issue in Russia, the brand appears to have stabilized in Romania and Ukraine. Outside of the EEMA region, the volume of L&M grew by 3.7%, driven in particular by Germany where L&M is the fastest-growing brand in the market.  The growth of Chesterfield, which is generally sold at a higher price is more than offsetting the decline of L&M. Shipments of Chesterfield increased by 14.6% in the quarter driven by strong results, particularly in Italy, Russia, and Ukraine. While we focus our efforts on the more profitable, premium and mid-priced segment, PMI also has three strong international brands in the low-priced segment. During the third quarter, the combined shipment volume of Bond Street, Next and Red & White increased by 12.3%. In addition, our local heritage brands in such markets as Indonesia, Italy and Mexico are performing well. Let me now briefly take you through the results and key developments in our four regions. Industry cigarette volume in the EU region is estimated to have declined by 1.2%. Our cigarette shipment volume decreased by 2.1% reflecting the total market decline, unfavorable distributor inventory movements in Italy and the timing of shipments in Spain. Constant currency net revenues and OCI were both up 1% with increases across all major markets except the Czech Republic and Poland, which were impacted by the need to temporarily absorb excise taxes as well as the overall market decline in these two countries. We are particularly pleased by the progress in the very important German market where we gained share in both the cigarette and fine cut categories. During the third quarter, we continued to achieve very strong results in the EEMA region with volume up 5%, net revenues excluding currency 14.9% higher and OCI excluding currency growing by 25.5%. These strong results were driven by continued volume expansion and an improved mix due to our strong position in the premium segment in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Higher prices further boosted our profitability in these key markets to record levels.  Cigarette shipment volume in Asia grew by 5.6% to 55.9 billion units with growth in Indonesia and Korea more than offsetting the impact of the market decline in Japan.  Net revenues, excluding currency were up by 7.8% and OCI excluding currency was 8.6% higher thanks to favorable volume, mix, and pricing. We are very pleased with our progress in Japan with sequential total market share growth and the strengthening of our leadership in the growing Menthol segment behind Marlboro Black Menthol, Lark Menthol X and Virginia Slims Noire.  Our shipments in Indonesia increased 2.2 billion units or 13% driven by the strong performances of Marlboro and A Mild as well as the timing of Ramadan which resulted in an estimated of 800 million units being brought forward from the fourth to the third quarter.  The other key highlight in Asia was Korea, where our shipment volume grew 28.1% and share was up 2.3 points. Latin America and Canada also had a strong quarter. Our cigarette shipment volume was up 6.5%, excluding acquisitions. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisition increased by 7.8% and OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions was up 4.2% excluding the $61 million distribution related charge in Canada. These strong results were driven by all our key markets and by Marlboro, the shipment of which were up 3.3%. To sum up, our business in EEMA, Asia, Latin America and Canada are performing very well with strong volume growth and improved mix and higher prices and margins. The outlook for the EU region is expected to improve with pricing power remaining strong, enhanced competitive position notably in Germany and an end to the distortions in the Czech market. Enhanced innovation is driving improved organic volume. We are on track with our productivity and selling programs. We have increased our dividend and continue to enjoy a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. As you can see, we are delivering against the targets that we shared with you in March. We firmly believe that we're well placed for any potential future consequences from the current global financial crisis and to continue to deliver a superior performance for our shareholders. And I'll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Jonathan Fell with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: I have a couple of questions actually. First of all, just to clarify your remarks on the buybacks. It doesn't looks though the current credit situation has impacted the repurchases to date, but it sounds like you are expecting in the fourth quarter that the rates will be lower than it's been. Can you give us any sort of guidance at all on exactly how much lower the rates of repurchase will be? I mean is the question at the moment that you can't buy any back at all, or do you expect at least to be able to continue to do some once the closed period ends. Secondly, on EU, I mean if we were consistent in saying the outlook should improve next year and pricing is strong, how much of a concern is it in particular at the lower-end markets like France, Spain and Italy? If the industry doesn't move pricing up quite soon, governments might do it for you given the increasing holes in their budgets?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. So let me start with your question to the share repurchase program. This is an ongoing program. We will keep ongoing with our share repurchase program. What I wanted to say is my remarks is that we are actually in the good and comfortable position, in that we are ahead of the schedule and that we now can simply watch and see what the financials and what the market situation is out there in the financial markets. I mean, we all have witnessed the turbulences up and down everyday. This is simply what we look for and what we watch out for, but let me put it this way. A company of our strength with liquidity, our balance sheet is, of course, probably as always amongst the ones that can access those markets first. It's just we have the comfortable position of doing what's necessary and best for both the company and the shareholders. So that's on the share repurchase. On the other question EU, yes, governments are also in budget season right now, but I can tell you that in neither one of the three countries that you quoted France, Spain or Italy, there is really a discussion out there about significant excise increases, so I don't see those, and I hope also that this won't change from here to the end of the year.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank: Well thanks.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Hermann ,first, just to be clear, there's still no change in the commitment to buy back $13 billion in your stock through I guess it would be March of 2010, correct? 
Hermann Waldemer: This is correct. This is a $13 billion share repurchase program over two years. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Secondly, Hermann, as it relates to emerging markets, I heard your comments in your prepared remarks, but did you see any change in the tone of business as you went through the quarter and came into October? 
Hermann Waldemer: Look, no. I mean the thing is really, the down-trading that everybody is referring to, or is afraid of, we just have not seen that anywhere around the world. Really, you go to Asia, you go to Indonesia, where you have a 12% inflation year-on-year right now, volume are up 13%, Marlboro is growing share, A Mild is growing share in the market.  The only thing you eventually can see of course low price segments are growing as well. Maybe they grow a little faster than the mid and the premium segments, but they all grow. So there is no down trading there.  Russia, to go to a different part of the world, our volume is up 8%. Our shares are up, actually Parliament is up, Marlboro is up, Chesterfield is up, just L&M is down, but as the brand related question and not the down trading related question because smokers actually trade up, for example, to Chesterfield. The same would be valid for the Ukraine. Or if you then go to Latin America, actually in Argentina where we have fantastic results and Marlboro being up, Philip Morris being up, the only brand that is down there is Next which is in the low-priced segment and Latin America overall I would call an uptrading environment.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then Hermann, if you think about the potential risks in those markets, particularly as it relates to the results that you would demonstrate over the next quarter and year on a US dollar basis, what do you think of as being the principle risks for the delivery of US dollar profits out of those markets? Is it currency? Is it the local operating profit results? Is it the threat of excise in a weaker market? Is it stress on the distributors financially?
Hermann Waldemer: Well look, I think, I mean the key to everything I would say is that first of all we deliver on our constant currency targets and that's what we have done the last three quarters and that's what we intend to keep on doing. I think that's the key to it.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Hermann Waldemer: In those markets that you quoted, down trading I just gave you the answer, I haven't seen it. Our own financial strength is certainly untapped.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then two other quick things, Hermann. Any update on the discussions within Japan on a potential substantial excise tax increase in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: No. There is actually not much news there. The 45 MPs which are working on that proposal. This is not the government. This is a partisan group of MPs working on that. They haven't come out even with their proposal yet.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, on Rothman's. In terms of getting approval for that transaction, did you have to commit to any particular employment numbers or maintaining the plants for a certain period of time and will that adversely affect your initial intended returns? 
Hermann Waldemer: Look, we will keep the manufacturing sites there and actually modernize them. So we keep those with pleasure. And we are very happy to have that excellent organization now within our company, within our family. So there is no issue from that side.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Nick Rolli: Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Adam Spielman with Citigroup.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Hello. It is Adam Spielman here. 
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Adam.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: To be fair, a lot of my questions have been answered already, but just wondering about Jonathan's Fell's question in a little bit more detail. Bearing in mind, your balance sheet is so strong and bearing in mind the stock has fallen as much as it has, do you think there is any chance to actually accelerate the buyback program to take advantage of the low stock prices?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I think I can only repeat what I've said before, that we are in this very comfortable position just so we can watch the situation out there in the financial markets and do the best thing depending on how those markets develop. It is just pretty much impossible to forecast these days what the financial markets are doing.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you very much.
Hermann Waldemer: But we are and remain committed to our share repurchase program.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you. I think another question if I may as well. This is regarding emerging markets. Obviously in the past year or two there has been quite a lot of consumer inflation in emerging markets. Maybe that's one of the reasons you have been able to put up your prices in Russia and Ukraine and similar. If inflation generally slows down, do you think that means to say that your ability to put up prices or brands like Marlboro in these markets will be reduced or do you think it's the general inflation level is in fact completely irrelevant to your business?
Hermann Waldemer: I don't think so. If you look into a couple of the key markets taking Indonesia as example, actually our price increases generally have been even below inflation there, so we didn't overdo it in those markets, and if you don't overdo it in year one, you don't regret it in year two, so I think we are well-equipped there.
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: So you continue to take pricing in the market like Indonesia or wherever you happen to choose even if inflation becomes less intense?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes. 
Adam Spielman - Citigroup: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hermann, I know you said in the third quarter, the operating profit ex-currency slowed down because of some of the timing issues. Is there any way to quantify how much of the timing related spending increases or expenses put a little bit of a damper in terms of the operating profit growth?
Hermann Waldemer: The specific marketing investments, which we have made in individual markets for competitive reasons, that number I really wouldn't want to give. It is clear and obvious that we have invested in Japan and we begin to see the positive effects of those investments. All that was from the very beginning included in our forecasts and again I would say if you compare our ex-currency results, and then you compare them to our mid to long-term guidance, we fare pretty well against those.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And Hermann, I know that you don't typically give guidance on following year until you report the fourth quarter, but just in terms of how you think about '09 at this point just given some of the economic conditions around the world? Obviously, you've got the currency issue and then offsetting that you still have the cost savings that are coming through. In '09, are you comfortable still looking at on a constant currency basis in line with your long-term targets?
Hermann Waldemer: Absolutely comfortable with our mid to long-term targets on a constant currency basis that we have given, yes.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And on currency, I think in the beginning you've talked about some of the offsetting factors. If you could just elaborate that and as we think about the currency impact in '09, how should we think about all those offsetting factors as well?
Hermann Waldemer: The start of course is that, yes, currency movements have a substantial influence on PMI's dollar results. The last time it has been unfavorable was actually 2006, where it was unfavorable with some $180 million, it was $470 million favorable in 2007, and now year-to-date we are favorable $750, but really and that's what I was referring to. Currencies, of course don't move all in the same direction. I mean the recent moves of the US dollar versus the euro, but on the other hand versus the yen is just a living proof of what I say. And we have many other currencies that we work in around the world and take. For example, the Indonesian rupiah which actually was rather stable against the dollar with maybe 5% swing only. In the euro exposure, I believe sometimes maybe overestimated that we really have. I mean, of course just to take 46% of OCI, which is the portion of the EU as the exposure would be misleading because we have substantial euro expenses. For example, to make one example for product sourced out of the EU for the Japan market, so there is a substantial euro expense out there. Secondly, and very important, we have very substantial Swiss franc expenses at the operation center here in Lausanne, at the R&D center also in Switzerland. You remember, our R&D expenses, they're on a yearly basis in the neighborhood of the equivalent of $300 million. The Swiss franc is of course the currency strongly related to the euro, co-related to the euro. So here you have the further netting against the euro exposure. So, therefore the euro net income exposure is, of course substantially lower in percentage than the percentage of EU OCI compared to the overall OCI of PMI.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: I have just a couple of follow-up questions for you. The first one is in relation to investors concerns and it is appropriate one about a trade down in whether it is an emerging markets or developed markets, could you tell us in this quarter how well premium versus say mid-tier versus the low end for your business?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, the overall segment, if you would try to really to go a little bit on the overall segment size that you have out there, then actually the premium segment and the mid-priced segment on a worldwide basis would be growing. So our latest internal estimate there would be the premium slightly growing to 26, a bit above 26% worldwide. I am talking now mid price with growth of a bit more than a percentage point to 29% in the neighborhood of 29% and the low actually being down to something like 1.5% to 44%. That will be roughly the picture that you see on a year-to-date basis out there. So and then if you go a little bit into the regions if you like in EEMA and Latin America, they are clearly up trading to mid and premium and I would say there was some talking about down trading in the EU. I think that has never happened. What actually has happened, the consumers were down traded by some companies via the repositioning of their brand to the low price segment. 
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: That's actually very helpful. Thank you. Then, I wonder if you could say if there has been any difference between consumption and shipments in any of your major markets. I think of Russia, for example, where you could have wholesalers working through inventory and not repurchasing as quickly. Are you seeing that now in any major markets?
Hermann Waldemer: No. I mean, the only really meaningful impact is the one that I quoted on Indonesia where just because of the timing of Ramadan we had this 800 million, but I mean in terms of really our trade bringing inventories down or even up, I mean you can argue it either way. No, I am not seeing that.  We are actually watching that also quite closely. Look, if you take out trade receivables at the end of September, that would be $2.3 billion. Our top 50 customers around the world are 90% of that. So we of course follow them individually and closely. There are credit limits in place with every one of them and in this industry and in particular in our company, we have short payment terms. Ours are under two weeks.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that's great. And my last question for you is if you can give us any kind of update on the progress that occurred in the quarter in China, as well as the joint venture you have operating outside of China and that's fully operational there and especially in Europe?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Look, I mean Marlboro is up and running. On August 7, the locally produced Marlboro was launched in China. In terms of the international joint venture, we have essentially now launches in all three price segments. In the low segment that is RGD. It has a launch-to-date market share in the Czech Republic of 2.6%, in Slovakia of 1.1%, Poland of 0.7%, so going very well.  Dubliss, which is manufactured in our [Rizora] factory is a mid-priced brand which was launched in two cities in Russia and two regions in the Ukraine. Well, that launch is too early to give shares, but that's working fine. The latest news is that actually just a week ago or so we launched the first premium brand which is Harmony in Argentina. It is actually launched at the price of Marlboro, a premium cigarette, there is a touch of the orient. So you see we also go for the premium segment and for the most difficult launches in that joint venture and it is going well. We're very happy, we're making progress every day.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: It is only if you're in about maybe six markets and that's what if I am correct, where you want to be by the end of the year, are there other market shares you're looking to launch into?
Hermann Waldemer: This year no. Other markets going forward, of course, yes.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: But in 2008, no?
Hermann Waldemer: In 2008, we are done.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you very much.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Eric Bloomquist with JPMorgan.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Hi, Hermann and Nick.
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Eric.
Nick Rolli: Hi.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Just wanted to follow up on a number of things. Firstly with respect to the cost savings, you said that you were on track. Can you give us any more detail on approximately how far along we are in the cost savings and reconfirm the potential timing of the savings over the next three years?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, look. I just went through that some ten days ago. Yes, we are on track to deliver the 1.5 billion and we will deliver the first 500 million this year, The things are on track. We had the US volume transfer over to Europe. Remember I'm still in 2007. There were about 57 billion cigarettes produced by PM USA for PMI, all that has been absorbed and still produced about 25 billion this year for us. It has happened now. The financial service centers are up and running and delivering very nicely. So, all the programs individually are on place. You have swings between one and the other, but if you add it up, you're right there.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Secondly then, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the outlook for leaf costs. Again, coming back to March, that was expected along with other raw material costs to be about a $500 million drag, and of course with US dollars strength that means I suspect that leaf costs may be somewhat declining. Can you talk about the overall outlook for that and then, as a secondary issue, could you talk about the issue of having to provide financing performers to grow the leaf and if indeed that's something we should start to try and factor, as we're thinking about the cost base for PMI?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. On the lease situation overall, for the 2008 situation, and I am comparing with 2007, we have about P&L impact year-to-date of $90 million, something like that, but you have really to put that into perspective. You remember that typically you have three crops going into one blend. The total leaf costs that you see on a yearly basis is about $3.2 billion, so we talk about an increase eventually of 5% of the leaf costs for this year, and then again I would like to put it into the context of the total cost of goods sold which for the year is in the range of $9.5 billion. So therefore, $90 million or $150 million for the year for increased leaf in relative terms, something that you simply have to live with.  Leaf prices in the year 2008, yes, they have gone up quite a bit. The cost of a kilo was up 15% to 20%. And what you already see now is the cyclical effect that the next harvest is already expected to be larger, so the supply is being expanded. If the seeds are in the ground now we know that, that the next harvest is going to be bigger and then of course you also have the currency effects, the dollar on one side. But on the other side, also the Brazilian real because underlying, although the leaf is denominated in dollar, there is an underlying Brazilian real impact in there. So, on the overall outlook for the three years to be seen, it could be somewhat higher between a 100 million and 200 million to compare to the number that we had at the beginning.  However, let me emphasize there, that definitely has no impact on our mid-term to long-term guidance. That will be absorbed either through additional productivity or the revenue line or we will see and that's why I gave you the other numbers to put it into context and into the proportion.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Thanks.
Hermann Waldemer: The question of financing of a farm. That has always been part of the program of us with the leaf dealers that farmers are being helped. So that is nothing new at the end and therefore nothing new that you need to factor in.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Okay. And there is not a risk of the leaf dealers being squeezed and that some of that financing having to move to reside with the manufacturers in your view or with PMI?
Hermann Waldemer: Well look, that is rather really the question of the financial crisis, is that having any impact on key suppliers. I mean the way we work with key suppliers is that in the case of leaf, we of course have commitments to them. They know roughly what we are going to buy, so that is much more foreseeable for them than for say, the supplier of a car manufacturer which not only has to suffer his own financing problems eventually, but also a much reduced demand by the car manufacturer. Our business is stable in that sense. Our volumes are stable or growing and therefore plannable. At the same time we of course have a principle on all major materials in place that we have, at least a dual sourcing for key ingredients, filter top will be the other one. We actually have four key suppliers around the world. So, yes, we're watching that, but it is all manageable as much as we can see.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Okay. Super. Lastly, it seemed to me that looking at the underlying volume trends in key West European markets like Italy, Germany, even France, Spain, that the environment looking pretty good for future price increases. Is that a fair assumption?
Hermann Waldemer: I will not comment about future price increases. I am sorry.
Erik Bloomquist - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome. 
Operator: We will now open the call to our media representatives. (Operator Instructions). Your next question is from the line of Thilo Wrede with Credit Suisse. 
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Good morning. I am Thilo Wrede here. 
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning. 
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: The first question and just a housekeeping question. What would you consider your normalized tax rate for the third quarter? 
Hermann Waldemer: Our ongoing tax rate is between 29% and 30%. 
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay because you had a few factors that impacted the tax rate this quarter? 
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, there are always one-time effects that can happen, but the ongoing rate is between 29% and 30%. 
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. Then looking at the EU market, with the continued down trading there, how do you see the future of Marlboro in that market? 
Hermann Waldemer: Look, in my opinion really and I am convinced about that, there is no and there has not been a down trading in the European markets. What has happened in Western Europe is that a number of brands, competitive brands that had been in the premium or in the mid-priced segment were repositioned to the low-priced segment which as we both know is not that far away.  In Germany, you talk about the price gap of $0.40. In Italy, you talk about $0.70, Spain would also be $0.70. So it was really consumers being down traded and not consumers down trading. There is a big difference in my opinion. In the EU and maybe there, take the German situation. Yes, Marlboro has been under pressure because of the reason that I was just quoting, and we are working on it. This is what we have to answer and what we are answering with our product innovation, with our refilling of the pipeline, with our focus on the brand and we clearly can see, for example, in the key German market that, yes, Marlboro is still declining, but at a much slower pace.  This is very much improving, and we will keep on working to get that even better, nevertheless let me say also in the German market we talk about 24% of market share from Marlboro today. So is not that bad and at the same time what we of course in such a situation had to do and our German team did an excellent job there, is you have to answer the challenge and the answer was L&M which is now the fastest growing brand in the market. Which is year-to-date up more than 2 share points to 6.8% and has a young adult smoker share of 10% and now we don't go just the cheap way again. No, we bring out L&M Night as an image version if you like of the L&M brand at the $0.10 premium to the regular L&M. That's how we tackle those situations and I have full confidence that we will keep on being successful there.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Yes, that was helpful. Since you mentioned Germany, I am getting the impression that there are efforts going on in that market to repeal some of the smoking bans there. Is that something you are seeing? What's the outlook for the smoking bans in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, okay, there is some easing due to recent election results in some states, to some court cases. Overall it will be eased. It will be a bit more consumer friendly or smoker friendly I would say. However, overall in the long-term, I don't expect a reversal of public smoking bans. I would just expect a more smoker friendly implementation of those public smoking bans.
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, last question on the Czech Republic. How much longer will the trade inventory movements there impact your results in that market?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Actually I would hope the mess is behind us there. So, by now I would say 90% to 95% of the products out there are in the market now at new prices. So finally almost one year after the last brands have come in with the new prices. Going forward therefore I really expect now a situation that it is coming back to normal. The good news in the Czech Republic is that there is no excise tax increase foreseen in the budget bill. It is going to be voted in November, but there is no excise increase foreseen there. I would say we are then in a normal environment well-positioned with a very strong and very broad portfolio covering actually all the price clauses covering international and local brands that we should be able to recover some of the positions that we have lost due to this unfortunate forestalling in that market. 
Thilo Wrede - Credit Suisse: All right. Thanks a lot, Hermann. 
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner. 
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Hi, Hermann. 
Hermann Waldemer: Hi, Tom. How are you?
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Hi, Hermann. Two questions. First, what steps helped drive Korea so sharply up this year? 
Hermann Waldemer: Innovation, our team in Korea is doing a fantastic job there. Really Parliament is on fire. Marlboro is doing very well, so we think this is really product innovation, excellent marketing, excellent sales in their true success story from that point. So this is neither pricing nor excise. This is a true marketing and sales success story. 
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Terrific. And then in both the quarter and the nine months, you continued to spend quite substantially on marketing, the [lime] marketing administration and research, so for the three months at least it was up almost 30%. What is behind that? It's up to 1.5 billion versus 1.1 billion in prior year?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. The numbers I don't have in front of me, but there must be some currency effect there, I guess. 
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Yes. 
Hermann Waldemer: There is reinvestment in there as we have said and the skewing of expenses really towards the second half of the year. You can see that our innovation pipeline which needed to be refilled has been refilled and now we are going out with all of these launches. You see the success on the revenue and on the volume side, but of course it doesn't come without investment. 
Thomas Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner: Thank you. 
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome. 
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up question from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, Hermann. Thank you for the follow up.
Hermann Waldemer: Sure.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: The only question I have is there was a $61 million one-time item in Latin America that it looks like you're including in your $0.93 if you will of operating EPS, is that correct? That is one-time in nature, though, correct?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes that's right. Distributed terminations happen from time to time in the business. That's why such a charge is in underlying and not just in reported.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And if that's not there the next year you have that benefit then with your Latin America division in the third quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: That's true. Yes.
Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus: That's all I needed. Thanks so much.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. You're welcome.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. It is still Hermann. I would like to make one last remark before we conclude this call. In these difficult times for the worldwide economy, no business in the world is actually recession proof, but I am convinced that our business is very recession resilient. There is no replacement product to cigarettes and our smokers are very loyal to our brand. Nick?
Nick Rolli: Okay, Hermann. Well thank you very much. As we did in the second quarter, the Investor Relations team is available in Lausanne and you could follow up with any questions. The phone numbers are posted on the website and also on our press release. Thank you again for joining us on this call. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's Philip Morris International's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

John [Blancter] – UBS Ann Gurkin – Davenport & Company LLC [Prea Oreguta] – Lehman Brothers [Pam Duke] – Financial Times Christopher Barrett – Bloomberg News Thomas A. Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner   Welcome to Philip Morris International’s second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I’d now like to turn the call over to Nicholas Rolli, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Philip Morris International.
Nicholas Rolli: Early this morning we issued a news release which contains detailed information on Philip Morris International’s 2008 second quarter results. If you do not have a copy, you may access one on our website at www.pmintl.com. Following the completion of the spinoff, historical basic and diluted earnings per share amounts were recalculated based on the actual number of shares distributed by Altria Group, Inc. on the distribution date. In our first quarter earnings release we provided a reconciliation of 2007 reported results to 2007 pro forma adjusted results by quarter and for the full year. For your reference this document is also available on the website. As we take you through our second quarter earnings results today, please note that we will refer to certain results as being after adjustment. This will imply that this data has been adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions. Furthermore to provide you with a pure organic comparison we will also exclude the impact of the transfer of our US duty-free business to Philip Morris USA in August last year. This latter adjustment is not included in the numbers in our press release issued today. Please also note that unless otherwise stated we will be talking about results in the second quarter 2008 and comparing them with results in the same period in 2007. References to international tobacco market shares are Philip Morris International estimates based on a number of sources. Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement in today’s presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. And now it’s my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer for Philip Morris International.
Hermann Waldemer: As you have seen from our press release we have reported excellent second quarter results. These results combined with our continued strong business momentum, currency favorability, higher pricing in a number of markets such as Italy and Russia, and planned reinvestments in key markets have enabled us to raise our annual guidance. Our revised adjusted full-year diluted EPS guidance for 2008 is between $3.32 and $3.38 representing a growth rate of between 19% and 21%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.86 up 22.9% or $0.16 per share. Of this increase $0.06 or about 40% of the increase reflects the strength of our business and favorable currency accounts for the other $0.10. In the first half of the year reported EPS was up 26% or $0.36 per share with business growth and currency each accounting for about half. Net revenues excluding excise taxes were 15% higher at $6.7 billion representing an increase of $874 million. After adjustments, net revenues increased by 4.4% driven by higher prices as well as improvement volume and mix in several key markets. Reported operating company’s income for OCI increased by 23.7% to $2.8 billion. After adjustments, OCI was 9.8% higher. We achieved double-digit OCI growth in EEMA, Asia, and Latin America. Our cigarette volume reached 223.2 billion units an increase of 1%. Organic volume increased by 0.6%. Strong growth was achieved notably in Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. This is an improved performance that reinforces our confidence that we can achieve our longer-term goal of 1% to 2% volume growth. Marlboro shipment declined by 2.4% or 79.1 billion units. After taking into account the impact of the transfer last year of our US duty-free business, Marlboro shipments were up in all geographical regions except the EU. The brand continues to perform strongly in Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Romania, Russia and Ukraine. Our [enormative] line extensions are helping to strengthen the vitality of the brand and its overall equity. Increased shipments of Parliament and Virginia Slims have reinforced PMI’s leadership position in the premium segment. Parliament shipments were up 28.1% thanks to tremendous momentum in Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Virginia Slims shipments increased by 12.2% reflecting both volume growth in existing key markets such as Japan and Korea as well as the penetration of new markets such as Greece and Romania. Our two key brands in the mixed price segment are L&M and Chesterfield. Outside of the EEMA region the volume of L&M grew by 3.4% driven by France, Germany, Netherlands and Poland. L&M is the second largest brand in the cigarette industry in the EU region behind Marlboro and over the last 12 months has been the fastest growing brand in Germany. We have revamped the brand in Russia and Ukraine. While L&M shipments continue to decline in these markets, we were able to more than offset this volume decline through higher shipments of Chesterfield. Chesterfield sells at a premium to L&M and consequently generates higher margins. Globally, we are delighted by the performance of Chesterfield as it maintained its very strong momentum with an increase in shipments of 18%. Our key brands are in good shape and we are continuing to strengthen our international brand portfolio leadership through the development of a successful innovation pipeline. We have talked to you previously about the success of Marlboro Filter Plus in a number of markets. Let me share with you some other examples. Marlboro Intense is a rich flavorful usually shorter cigarette in the red pack. It was launched initially in Turkey and more recently in Belgium and the Netherlands. In Italy a lighter-tasting version was launched in March as Marlboro Compact in a silver pack. To support our leading position in the growing menthol segment we have launched Marlboro Crisp Mint, Marlboro Fresh Mint, and Marlboro Ice Mint in a number of markets in Asia and Latin America. These refreshing products are performing well. For example, Crisp Mint reached a 1.4% share in Hong Kong, Fresh Mint 0.4% in Malaysia, and Ice Mint 0.3% in Japan. I will discuss our latest menthol innovation Marlboro Black Menthol when I talk specifically about Japan later. We have successfully developed a number of new products in response to an increase in demand in several markets for cigarettes with a slimmer diameter. Premium-priced Virginia Slims UNO has notably achieved an 0.3% market share in Greece and Romania in May and an 0.2% share in Japan in the quarter. Mid-priced L&M Link has achieved a 1.5% market share in Poland. Let me now take you through the designs in key business developments in our four regions. Industry volume in the EU region is estimated to have declined by 3.7% during the second quarter driven by the one-time impact of recent public smoking restrictions, higher prices, and the long-term decline in smoking incidents. Our shipment volume decreased by 4.4% to 64.8 billion units and our estimated market share was down slightly to 39.4%. Revenues net of excise taxes after excluding the very positive currency impact declined by 1.7% and OCI was essentially stable. These results were impacted by the total market declines and the need to temporarily absorb some tax increases in the Czech Republic and Poland where we had shorter inventory durations of OTX products than our competitors. During the first half of the year revenues net of excise taxes in the region were essentially stable and OCI increased by 5% net of currency. Business fundamentals in our four key new markets continue to strengthen. In Germany our adjusted cigarette market share was up 0.3 points to 37%. L&M is growing and Marlboro is sequentially improving its share. We also expanded our position in the important German fine cut category with a market share increase of 4.8 points to a record quarterly level of 16.5% thanks to our enormative tobacco block and the strength of our L&M and Next brands. Our profitability in Germany is both in the quarter and the first half of the year. In Italy and Spain we continue to improve our profitability during the quarter. Our share is up in the first half in both markets. Chesterfield is performing very well and Marlboro is resilient. In France while share is down on a year-on-year basis by 2.5 points due to the impact of a less favorable price point for Marlboro. Our market share of 40.9% has been stable since the fourth quarter of last year. The outlook for the EU region is improving. We have recently announced price increases in Italy, the Netherland, and Switzerland and have strengthened our competitive position in the important German market. Public smoking bans have now been implemented across most of the yield and we expect a one-time impact on total industry volume to have been largely absorbed by year end. The very large tax-driven price increases in Central Europe related to EU excision are moderating. The Czech Republic has now reached the excise tax level currently required in the EU. Hungary, Poland and Slovakia should reach it next year. In this context I would like to comment on the update to the tobacco excise directive that the EU Commission is proposing. First, I would like to emphasize that we welcome the review as it is an opportunity to improve the framework for excise taxes in the EU. Second, a proposal essentially in land was what we had expected following a broad consultation. The next step is for the EU Commission to discuss the proposal in detail with the member states, a process that will allow individual countries to convey their views one each element of the proposal. As a unanimous agreement is needed on every proposed change to the current directive amongst the 27 EU member states, we expect that the proposal will be modified prior to its finalization which is foreseen during the second half of next year. We are pleased that the EU Commission recognizes that there is little justification for significant differences in the taxation level for cigarettes and fine cut products. We also welcome the proposed increased flexibility to be given to governments in terms of the excise tax structure and the level of the minimum excise tax. We, however, regret that the Commission has not taken this opportunity to propose an abolition of the excise incidents rule and are concerned that tax increases resulting from the proposal could have unintended consequences in certain EU countries if implemented as currently proposed. During the second quarter the EEMA region continued to achieve very strong results with volume up 3.2%, net revenues excluding excise taxes and currency 10.2% higher, and OCI excluding currency increasing by 22.9%. We are benefitting from the premium SCU of our portfolio as consumers continue to trade up. The resulting volume growth and improved product mix has been further boosted by price increases, thus driving profitability to record levels. Russia is central to these excellent results with PMI shipments increasing by 8.3%. Continued strong consumer up-trading has benefitted Chesterfield, Marlboro and Parliament. Revenues net of excise taxes and currency rose by 24% driven by favorable volume and mix and higher prices. This has enabled us to increase profitability to record levels. Our shipments grew by 2.9% in Turkey. While our share was essentially stable we benefitted from consumer up-trading with very strong Parliament growth. This more favorable mix along with higher prices has been driving profitability. In the Ukraine, shipments increased by 8.2% driven by Chesterfield, Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slims. As a result our market share reached a record level of 35.2%. Our profitability will be further boosted by the recent retail price increases in this important market. Cigarette volume in Asia grew by 1.9% to 56.8 billion units with growth in Indonesia and Korea more than offsetting the decline in Japan. Marlboro is performing very well across the Asia region with a volume increase of 1.8%. Marlboro Filter Plus and Marlboro Mix 9 Kretek have reinforced the brand’s equity helping to drive the brand synergy to record levels in Korea and Indonesia and Marlboro continues to perform strongly in the Philippines. Marlboro’s success is complemented by the tremendous performance of Parliament driven by Korea whose shipments were up over 50% in the region and Virginia Slims which experienced double-digit growth. Revenues net of excise taxes were up 4.9% excluding currency. We achieved a 15.2% increase in OCI net of currency. In Asia, excellent results notably in Australia, Indonesia and Korea more than offset the decline in Japan. We are very proud of our results in Indonesia. Our shipments there were up 14.9% as our entire portfolio grew with A Mild and Marlboro performing particularly well. Let me focus for a moment on Japan. During the second quarter industry volume was down by 1.6% helped by freight purchases in advance of the implementation of the new vending age control mechanism. PMI shipments meanwhile declined further by 7% due to the declining total market and an optimization of stock coverage levels. Our share reached 23.9% which was open 3 points below the prior year’s level but stable compared to both the first quarter of this year and the last quarter of 2007. Marlboro’s share remains stable at 9.8%. We are launching Marlboro Black Menthol during the first week of August to reinforce the brand’s performance. This enormative new product has a unique refreshing mint flavor and provides a bold cooling sensation. Lark’s share of 6.8% was marginally down from last year but slightly up compared to the first quarter of 2008. Recently launched Lark Menthol X has achieved a market share of 0.3% and the new Lark Classic is doing well in test markets. Virginia Slims has continued to expand to reach a market share of 2.1% driven by the successful launch last year of Virginia Slims Noire. These results show that our increased focus on innovation is starting to have a positive impact and we expect improved results going forward fueled by additional marketing investments. While we are focused on restoring share growth momentum, we are also very conscious of the pressures on profitability from a declining market which is subject to price controls. While we oppose the recent call for a massive tax and price increase we believe that this debate may encourage the government to consider revising the tobacco law to allow pricing freedom. Latin America had another very strong quarter on all accounts. Our cigarette shipment volume was up 7.9% and 1.3% excluding acquisition driven by strong results in Argentina and Mexico partly offset by Colombia. In Argentina our shipments increased by 8.8% and we gained 1.9 points to reach a market share of 70.3% driven by Marlboro and the Philip Morris brand. In Mexico the total market remains stable while we were able to increase our market share by 3 points to 67.2% driven by Benson & Hedges, Delicados and Marlboro. In Latin America as a whole our revenues net of excise taxes increased by 8% excluding currency and acquisitions while our OCI was 15% higher on the same basis. Let me say a few words about our actions to enhance shareholder value. On May 1 we started our two-year share repurchase program. Since then we have spent $2.1 billion out of the $13 billion approved by the Board of Directors. In total we have so far purchased 41.4 million shares at an average price of $51.48. On June 18 we announced our first quarterly dividend as a public company of $0.46 a share. As stated previously we expect to return a total of $21 billion to shareholders over the next two years which reflects about 20% of our current market capitalization. In order to help finance these and other business requirements, we successfully erased $6 billion in May and the US dollar bond offering at what we believe our attractive rates. During the second half of the year we intend to continue to access the capital markets provided financing conditions are suitable. To sum up, our business in EEMA, Asia and Latin America are performing very well. We have strong volume growth and improved mix and higher prices and margins. The outlook for the EU region is improving with pricing power remaining strong and an enhanced competitive position notably in Germany. Japan remains a challenge due to continued to price controls in a declining market. We have however stabilized our market position and have the strategies in place which we believe will enable us to grow share again. Enhanced innovation is driving better organic volume and we are on track with our productivity saving programs and our financial measures to return significant cash to our shareholders. As you can see, we are delivering against the targets that we established and shared with you in March. I will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: First, with respect to share repurchases, what’s the argument against maintaining for the foreseeable future the execution pace in the second quarter? You are basically buying back $1 billion a month. Why not keep that going?
Hermann Waldemer: On the share buyback we have always been and will stay on a steady pace there. We actually did opportunity purchases given the attractiveness of the share prices and will continue to do that when appropriate.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Why weren’t diluted shares outstanding? They were flat sequentially. Why weren’t they down Q2 versus Q1?
Hermann Waldemer: We started the share repurchase on May 1. Remember there is the 30-day delay after being quoted so it starts only on May 1 and then it is going in weighted averages so it washes in over time.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Could you clarify your comment in your prepared remarks with respect to the EU tax proposal about regretting the absence of an abolition of excise tax incidents rule? What specifically are you referring to there?
Hermann Waldemer: Article 4 Excise Review. The way I would put it is I see three good elements in there, one watch-out, and I would say one overriding remark which is probably what I should start with. The overriding remark is that any change to the existing laws, the existing directive, needs unanimous agreement of all 27 member states. So therefore that’s going to take a while and I expect something final say in the second half of 2009. Then the watch-out which is precisely your question is the proposed incidents increases that you see in the proposal. That could trigger price increases, excise driven price increases in some markets which could actually lead to the known undesired side effects from counterfeits to border sales to all these things that we have seen before. So that’s really what I would call the watch-out. But very importantly let me also say about the good things in there, because it’s really three good things. More flexibility on the minimum excise tax which right now is capped at 100% of the most popular price class; that’s a good one and important one. Proposing to raise the specific element which today can go up to 55% to 75% is another very good element in there. And the partial alignment of roll-your-own make-your-own at two-third of cigarettes taxation is also a good element.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Are you willing or prepared in Germany to have Marlboro at a per-pack price point above 5 Euros alone as you’ve repeating the situation you’re suffering through in France?
Hermann Waldemer: Of course future pricing, I will not comment on that. We will decide once the moment is there. I think that’s what I have to say on pricing in Germany.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: It’s early days but is there any evidence in the market place of any change in the behavior of Altadis/Imperial subsequent to the consummation of that merger?
Hermann Waldemer: No, not really, this is competition. There has been competition before. We will have to see. Certainly there will be a lot of integration going on in these companies but we focus on our own place here and really everybody around to target increased revenues and increased profitability in our own place. That’s what we concentrate on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research (Europe).
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research (Europe): First of all, have you seen either in the second quarter or in your trading since then any signs at all that a weakening economy either in the European Union or elsewhere is causing either weakness in volumes or weakness down trading? I know for example that you’ve seen some down trading away from over in France, but we saw that in the first quarter. What I’m interested in is whether there has been any incremental worsening really anywhere in the world? That’s my first question.
Hermann Waldemer: Starting with the EU region the down trading we have seen there in the last couple of years, that was mostly triggered by price repositionings of previous mid-price and even premium brands by competition to the low end. While there’s nothing left I’m afraid to be priced down there by competition, so that is over. We are operating in a more normal competitive situation going forward. If I then expanded the other, on a worldwide basis in light of increasing inflationary pressures, rising food prices, and all of that, then actually I must say we can see that Indonesia would eventually be a market where you could expect to see something like that. We don’t. Actually our volume in Indonesia is up 14.9%. The market overall is up in Indonesia and that is an environment with high inflation and with reduced fuel subsidies for the people earlier this year. So we can’t see there. If I go over to Latin America, there actually we have to see that Latin America is rather a part of the world which is a source of commodities and where actually salary increases are still in most places above inflation, so we don’t see that either. So cigarettes are probably a fairly resistant product to these type of things. The only place where I could see a little bit of that would eventually be Colombia where you see it at the lower end of the price spectrum where you see some impact there. More stick purchases and less purchases overall but there it’s the lower bracket income class of population because in that very same market by the way Marlboro is growing.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Actually you already touched on what was going to be my second question which is to really focus on Indonesia. Obviously in May the price of gasoline went up by 30% I believe. Your volume as you say in the second quarter was exceptional. But if we can just look forward, firstly what do you think volume is going to look like because presumably it’s going to have to slow down from 15%? And also just to reiterate, you see no signs that the increase in fuel is having any impact on your business even in July in Indonesia?
Hermann Waldemer: No. I cannot exclude that for the future that this is going to have an impact at a certain point in time but right now I just do not see that. I agree with you that 14.9% volume growth is of course an exceptional number and will not be a number that keeps on going there for the next 10 years, but no we don’t see any of that. What is of course important in the context probably is as well that [inaudible] you have roughly I would estimate an inflation of 10% in Indonesia. Cigarette prices were up about 6.5% so a little bit below inflation. And if you go through our portfolio Marlboro is up 27%, A Mild is up 20%, and DJI Sam Soe is up 4% so this is really going very, very nicely. And we also express our confidence going forward in that market by putting the Greenfield there which actually the official opening is going to be on August 20.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research (Europe): In your earlier remarks you referred to price increases in Italy, in Holland or the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Are those very recent increases or were those ones back in Q1?
Hermann Waldemer: No, no. These are recent increases. The Italy price increase for example if I remember correctly was the last week of June.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: On the cost savings you did talk about cost savings being on track. Will you quantify those? Do you plan to give us an update for example in dollars or perhaps where you may have allocated these cost savings so far year-to-date?
Hermann Waldemer: On the productivity and cost savings we are on track. We will meet our productivity and cost savings target over the next three years of $1.5 billion. So if I may go through a little bit the main elements and what are we doing there. In manufacturing where we said $850 million in manufacturing productivity. The first big element there is the resourcing of volume from USA factories to PMI factories. We will be one or two months ahead of schedule with bringing that over. Remember that was almost $180 million by 2009. Perfectly on track. The clustering which was all regrouping the technical functions and procurement functions in about 10 places around the world is progressing. Rationalizing non-strategic SKUs, product specification simplifications, is an ongoing job as we go ahead. On the $450 million G&A procurement, the headcount reductions in the regional and PMI HQs are essentially done. The financial service centers are up and running. The human resource shared service centers are being implemented as we speak and are being rolled out. And the other, essentially by the end of the year you can say we will have implemented one SAP program around the world as an REP backbone system for the company. And in the EU the cost cutting program that is also part of the secret of our profitability increase in addition to of course the pricing variance there; we keep on going there. We have an early retirement program for example in Germany in our one-time charge is this quarter, so we keep on going. So we’ll stay on track with all of that and we will give a detailed review once a year.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: You certainly did talk about Indonesia. Can you tell us what your share was in the quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: Indonesia is actually a very difficult place in terms of news and shares. The shares in Indonesia show us essentially stable shares given the volume increase that I know for sure because these are simply sales and revenues. I would rather think that those shares for the moment are somewhat understated in Indonesia.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: I was just curious given you’ve provided that share in the past but not this quarter it looks like. It’s at least stable if not higher.
Hermann Waldemer: The share numbers as I have in front of them, they are stable; they’re not higher, but there is always a certain delay in certain floors. It’s a big country. It’s difficult to measure.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: On Poland, just as a broad statement I was pleased to see underlying organic volume growth. So that’s favorable. And looking at a country like Poland and keeping your comments about trading up across many of your regions, we should be lapping the price increases soon I believe but remind us when that is. But there’s also some down trading. Can you just put the two in context as to how the outlook is for that market?
Hermann Waldemer: Poland is a very important market. I would talk about 65 billion cigarettes market and another probably 7 billion to 8 billion in roll-your-own cigarettes tobacco. In 2007 this market really turned into a much more profitable market. The problem in Poland for the time being is still the missing forestalling regulations, i.e. these huge durations of old priced old taxed products that are in the market. You had some competitors, some brands, in there with durations of up to one year so when the consumer sees the new price, actually the next price has already taken place. So that’s a bit unfortunate and it’s because we’re a big company in that market. It forced us to do some absorption in the second quarter of excise taxes which is something we really don’t like to do unless we are forced to do, which we were here in Poland and actually also in the Czech Republic. In Poland this is the last round that is coming, the last excise increase in the context of EU excision fortunately on 2009. So we will have one more round of this gain so it’s going to normalize in the third or fourth quarter of this year but it’s going to restart then as of January 2009. However the good thing is as well that there are a couple of excise structure improvements eventually considered in Poland although forestalling regulations will not come unfortunately in 09, or unlikely to come. So going forward we are soon out of that effect of the EU excision and that then will be the moment that actually there is room for up-trading in that market. Today there is not much up-trading in that sense if you like because prices are going up already that steeply. Once they stabilize we will benefit actually from our premium portfolio and what you see now in terms of down-trading what you talked about is really rather at the very low end of the market and is traditional 70 mm products. At the end of the day we made a conscious choice there between volume share and profitability for the sake of profitability.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (UK).
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (UK): Implicit in the increased guidance is a slowdown in the second half in terms of the earnings per share. I was wondering if you could talk about the places where we should be thinking that there is going to be a sequential slowdown in the second half versus what we’ve seen in the first half?
Hermann Waldemer: It comes down to the overall guidance development there. What we took into account is the business momentum overall which is very positive to start with. The currency projections of course and importantly as I said already in the first quarter the spending pattern which has skewed anyway towards the second half. And the additional investments that we are making into the markets, they will actually also hit the market and be visible to the consumer and therefore will hit the income statement also principally in the second half so that’s our additional investment. And of course financing costs go up with the build-up of the leverage on our balance sheet. In terms of investment where we go, that of course Japan is one of the places to go but I wouldn’t go into individual markets because that would be too sensitive from a competitive point of view.
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (UK): So is it fair to characterize what you’re saying that the slowdown in the second half EPS is more driven by PMI investment than by any anticipated slowdown in your markets?
Hermann Waldemer: That’s right, I would say. If you look at growth that you have seen in the first half of the year in the actual, as we said it’s 50/50 between currency and business. Actually for the second half I see a higher proportion of business than currency of the growth.
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (UK): Second question is with respect to Japan. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential for a Japanese large tax increase and also expand on your comment that PMI hopes that the discussion on tax could lead to a reform of the Japanese tax structure.
Hermann Waldemer: The proposal that is on the table is being discussed now. Let’s first really properly situate what that is. It is a group of 45 members of Parliament that have gotten together and are developing that proposal. There are hearings that are bringing that proposal together. But it remains a proposal that then goes to the Budget and to the Finance Ministry which is the decision body. So therefore also in terms of timing that goes to that decision body somewhere towards the end of the year and you will not see any impact of whatever the outcome is before sometime like spring next year. Then I would say that all around the world governments have seen that abrupt increases don’t work. I think that the real chance in there is that this can lead to a discussion of the imbalance in the system that you have today. You have price control on one hand, you have the wish to reduce consumption from the health side on the other hand, you have government stake in one of the top four cigarette companies around the world, and then at the end of today you have price control in the Japanese home market. So over time I would think and I would hope that this could lead to a better discussion about how to bring that forward in terms of eventually moderate regular excise increases accompanied by pricing freedom in the market. So let’s hope that this is a trigger point that can lead to a decent discussion on those points.
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (UK): My last question is related to the current EU tax proposal. As you noted in your remarks one of the things that they’re doing is increasing the potential level of minimum excise tax. As I recall from the Spanish experience in 2006, that tended to benefit premium brands. Is that a fair way to characterize one of the outcomes of this tax proposal is we should see a benefit through the EU as it’s implemented over time toward more premium product?
Hermann Waldemer: I would think so. As a government you don’t want to raise your taxes and therefore prices on one hand and then see the people simply trade down and actually deliver less taxes and smoke as much as before. Then as a government you have neither achieved the Finance Ministry targets nor the Health Ministry targets. Spain is a good example there that of course minimum taxes at an effective level put limits to down trading and therefore achieve on one hand the government’s targets and should help actually then the more decently priced products on the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: First, just clarification in terms of your guidance and you talked about some of the drivers, but can you quantify how much is currency driven versus operating performance that’s coming in better than expected?
Hermann Waldemer: What we took into account are of course also, as I said before, the currency projections, I think I will go that really for the increase that you will see in the second half that really the business portion of that is really the more important part than the currency part. But I wouldn’t want to split it up in detailed numbers.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: If we look at your EU performance in the second quarter, your operating profit was flat if you take out currency versus the first quarter where operating profit was actually up 9% and the volume decline really didn’t change much from quarter to quarter. So I’m wondering why the operating profit actually slowed down in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And secondly, in relation to that, you sound actually more optimistic about EU outlook going forward despite the second quarter performance, so if you could talk a little bit more about what gives you comfort that the trends will improve and as you look out for the balance of the year, are we expecting that EU profit to actually see positive trends in the back half of the year?
Hermann Waldemer: There are two rather I would call them almost short-term effects that you see in the EU and actually if you look through the markets, about 50% of EU markets are actually affected by one of the two effects that I will describe. The first one is that actually smoking bans are now implemented essentially everywhere in the European Union and then of course as well all know, there’s a more or less strong one of impact and then it goes back to normal trends. So that is of course hurting overall total markets and therefore the volumes of the market participants. Take Germany, UK, France, Portugal together then the market decline in those in the second quarter is 6.1% and revenue decline in those markets in the second quarter is 3.8%, so that’s very much driven by that but as we all know this is a one-time one-off impact. And then the second short-term effect is really the EU tax formalization in the excision countries which as I said is essentially done by year end. Poland’s to come on January 1, 2009 so going into 2009 otherwise it’s just Hungary, Slovakia, and in 2010 you will have Romania, Bulgaria, Baltic but all the rest is done. The big ones are done. On the positive side going forward is that the pricing power is intact so we have realized substantial pricing in the EU so in the quarter $77 million and that’s despite the fact that we absorbed for Czech and Poland together $45 million again for this stalling effects that we had in those two markets so that’s a one off. The hit was in Q2, that’s not something that comes every quarter as I said before. We hate doing these things unless we have no choice for competitive reasons so we did it.  
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: And the price increases you’ve taken in Italy and Netherland and Switzerland, can you quantify the magnitude of the price increases?
Hermann Waldemer : The price increase in Italy we did is essential 10 Euro cents across the board, Switzerland is essentially 20 [inaudible] across the board and Netherlands is, if I remember correctly, is 40 Euro cents. Again, for example Marlboro going to $4.40.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: How do we think about your operating profit growth this year coming in well above your long term target of 6% to 8% even with some of the challenges that we’ve talked about in the EU that should get better going forward? When we think about that 6% to 8% long term growth outlook and we look at this year’s performance, is that number maybe somewhat conservative in your view and if trends stay relatively stable that there’s actually potential for growth targets to be actually higher than what we are at, at this point?
Hermann Waldemer : No. Guidance is our mid to long term guidance and that guidance remains unchanged. So, if I look at this year’s results, then we are simply pleased to see that our innovation activity really begin to pay off, that we see improved organic volume growth on our way to our midterm target. We are not there yet. So, that’s a positive. We see that our productivity cost reduction programs work, we see that we are able to realize pricing around the world so we are happy about the conciliation but that doesn’t change our midterm guidance.
Operator:   Your next question is from Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities: A couple of things, first of all, on EU I just wanted to clear up this Czech and Poland thing. Is there going to be any effect of you swallowing excise increases in those countries in the third quarter, or has that already unwound as we speak?
Hermann Waldemer : Most of it is done.
Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities: And the other thing on the EU was I think last quarter when we were speaking about this, there was some prospect in Germany of registration which could put a minimum pack size of 20 cigarettes in place. Where have we got to on that debate now?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, we continue to support it as I said last time. However, we regret that as it looks like now, the 20 pack rule will not be implemented in the short term. That doesn’t mean that it cannot come back.
Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities: Any particular reason why? What has caused you to think it won’t be implemented in the short term?
Hermann Waldemer : That’s the news that I have, that it is not being implemented so all I can say and repeat and that is what we have also told the German government that we do support such a change in the law.
Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities: As I look at your quarterly rate of dividend now, $0.46, even at the low end of your EPS guidance range for this year $3.32, the payout ratio will be coming in at 55% against your target of 65%. Are you expecting the board to review that dividend rate at the end of August?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, the payout ratio is 65% as you correct say. We are now at $0.46 which is 3.5%, 3.6% dividend yield. This is an entirely decision of the board. We have regular board meetings throughout the year, yes there is one at the end of August. We will see, this is in the entire discretion of the board.
Jonathan Fell – Deutsche Bank Securities: But they haven’t indicated to you yet when they might review that rate. Because, most companies it’s not a secret really when they start to review dividends.
Hermann Waldemer : The Board will decide. It is a Board decision.
Operator:   Your next question comes from Filippe Goossens – Credit Suisse.
Filippe Goossens – Credit Suisse: You talked about pricing in Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands but can you maybe just broaden the comments a little bit and talk to us about how the pricing environment or competitive environment more specifically is in the European Union and how you look at potential room for price increases in both Germany and Spain? If my memory serves me right, I think Germany the last time you took pricing was in October, 2006 where Spain was, I think, early 07.
Hermann Waldemer : I’m afraid I’m sorry I will not comment on future pricing. I can only really comment on what we did and I think our actions speak for themselves.
Filippe Goossens – Credit Suisse: Then second question, can you talk a little bit about the ongoing restaging on L&M in the Russian market please?
Hermann Waldemer : In the Russian market, L&M you’ll remember that we had revamped L&M both in the Ukraine and in Russia. Yes, L&M is still declining in the Russian market, that’s right. But, if you take then as a comparative loss in the Ukrainian market where actually we did the change already before Russia, i.e. first. There, we can now really see improvement so it is really declining much less now in the quarter than it did before so we see rejuvenation of both the brand franchise and a more effective smoker profile. But, I’d like to focus there really as well on the portfolio aspect of our franchising the market. We have tracked ourselves with just a number of the smokers that are actually leaving the L&M franchise and as Chesterfield is priced 2 Rubles higher than L&M, this is actually a much better margin. And, if you take L&M and Chesterfield together, then actually the Chesterfield growth outweighs the decline of L&M. So, we keep on working on L&M but I urge you to look at it in a portfolio comparison as well and not only for the L&M brand but on L&M itself we keep on going with our programs. We said from the very beginning that this is not going to be a short term fix.
Filippe Goossens – Credit Suisse: Moving on to the Czech Republic, Hermann when will the inventory adjustment be anniversaried?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, it depends if you talk about our brands then probably we will be the ones who bring the new consumer prices to the consumer first. As I said, you had a couple of market participants in the restorations after one year so we will have to see when that comes. But, I would expect in the Czech Republic that the fourth quarter becomes a normal quarter and then actually 2009, we could come back to a normal fair environment overall where there is normal competition in the markets. So, 2009 should be a normal market. It’s now we’re working our way through a messed up market. I think it’s important also to mention here that the Deputy Ministry of Minister of Finance of the Czech Republic, although the final decision comes later in the year, has said that there are no plans to increase tobacco excise tax again as of January 1, 2009. So, yes we should have it behind us soon I hope.
Filippe Goossens – Credit Suisse: In the US historically people have always assumed that price elasticity of demand is about .3. We’ve never really focused on the European Union in terms of what price elasticity is there. But, the question I really have Hermann, based on how you’re seeing things develop, particularly in the European Union given rising inflation across the board. Do you think that this inflation is starting to perhaps have an impact on price elasticity? In other words, its wanting to raise pricing 5% per annum let’s say if there’s no inflation in the general economy but with household product companies, personal care companies, them raising pricing anywhere between 5% and 10%, could that ultimately have an impact on the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes? Have you done any work on this so far Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer : That is actually something that is just almost impossible to answer. Yes, we have done some work but it’s impossible to come to a clear conclusion. You actually can argue the other way around, you can say that in a highly inflationary environment, people are more use to price increases because they see it in all products everyday while in a low inflation environment, if your cigarette prices go up only and nobody else’s prices go up, it might be even more difficult. So, you can turn it around the other way. All I can say is what I said earlier, that so far we haven’t seen impact of inflationary pressures on our product. And, overall, I think it is fair to say that cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than any or most other consumer products.
Operator:   Your next question comes from Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Could you quantify in the quarter or give us a feel for how much your volume was down in the Czech Republic? I know that’s been a tough market but what decline would you have seen in that market this quarter?
Hermann Waldemer : A quarter number for the Czech Republic, I don’t have here but it is such a screw up at the end of the day in that market that you really have to wait until it washes out. At the end of the day, if the measures we took on the marketing side, on the pricing side, on the absorption side, we have defended our cake in the market, if you like, and we look forward to a more normal situation next year.
Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Am I correct that you’ve already raised your prices to reflect the new tax level in the Czech Republic?
Hermann Waldemer : You will see in the third quarter, it will be the first one to pass on really to the consumer.
Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: As you’ve raised your guidance for the year have you also reflected perhaps some increases in marketing or promotion in this higher guidance? Are your spending levels going higher even as your guidance is going higher?
Hermann Waldemer : Yes, we have reflected in that guidance that we have skewing of expenses towards the second half and we have reflected in that guidance the additional investments that we plan to make in a number of markets.
Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: In the quarter, Marlboro was a little weaker than I expected but you did have a little tougher comparison there too. But, given all the new product benefits, a pretty robust R&D pipeline across your portfolio, is the second half of the year when you’re closer or on track with getting at least in the range of your long term volume growth of 1% to 2%? Or, is the second half a period where you could see that even being a little below that long term guidance?
Hermann Waldemer : We will keep on working as much as we can on our innovation pipeline, on excellence in marketing of sales out in the markets. We are really pleased to see the improvement in the second quarter here. We will do everything to stay on track and to keep on improving and to keep on refilling the innovation pipeline.
Christopher Growe – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Then in the second half could volumes be up closer to 1%? Or, should we see consistent progress we should say sequentially in your volumes?
Hermann Waldemer : I wouldn’t want to change the volume projection that we had given earlier for the year. I would rather prefer that we keep on working as good as we can.
Operator:   Our next question comes from John [Blancter] – UBS.
John [Blancter] – UBS: First of all you [inaudible] a number of times that the market expense is going to go up in the second half. As a percent of net revenues, was there growth in the first half or was it essentially flat as a percentage of sales in the first half?
Hermann Waldemer : Flat in the first half, growth in the second.
John [Blancter] – UBS: Secondary, on the proposals to include this idea of a much closer alignment between tax on factory made cigarettes and roll you own, what do you think the future of roll your own is within the European Union if this proposal is passed in any shape or form?
Hermann Waldemer : Look first, the proposal is not full equalization so therefore there will be always a role for that segment because even in that proposal there remains a substantial size differentiation tax advantage still for this type of product so there will be always that part of the market. Will there be in such a conciliation more up trading to cigarettes? I would hope so. Nevertheless, we are also very present in that market and we are increasing as we speak our presence in that market. Take Germany as the best example or take the acquisition of the InterWorld trademark as the second example, there is always some market there, even with such a change in the excises.
John [Blancter] – UBS: But do you think it’s likely to cause some double digit or significant declines in volumes in some of those markets where at the moment [inaudible] questions on the tax even if the market continues to exist?
Hermann Waldemer : There wouldn’t be very much speculation at this point in time. Let’s wait until we have something more final there on what is really going to come out of the commission. Then, you can see what that means in terms of rollover prices and then we can have a better view of that that can eventually mean. That’s too early.
John [Blancter] – UBS: Lastly, just on Japan, you obviously mentioned the cigarette market was down 1.6% because of trade purchases prior to the implementation of the vending machine age verification I didn’t realize that the market was reacting quite in that way. Why was there a big trade impact because of the change in vending machine age verification and also my understand is that age verification had been done, [inaudible] in machines over time and implemented at the time. Secondly, how successful, how’s the implementation of this tax payable card been? As there been a rapid shift? Is there an ongoing rapid shift from vending to OTC in Japan?
Hermann Waldemer : First, in terms of implementation there has been implemented really by region, by area so now in the Tokyo area was the last area that was being implemented now actually in July so it’s fully rolled out. Now, you can in every area you had the load and the deload impact but when one deloaded the next area loaded so it’s very hard to read for the moment what the real impact is. We will know in the next two or three months because now it’s everywhere. As for card, actually when it started as low as 15% or something in the area when it was the first area when it was rolled out, in that very same area the penetration is now about one third of the people who have that card so it’s improving but it’s of course, still far away from 100% of the smokers applying for such a card. So, over time it will increase. Will there be a substantial shifting to convenience stores? Yes. And that’s of course, what we have prepared in our sales programs.
John [Blancter] – UBS: Does that mean that there might well be quite a substantial asset write off of a lot of these vending machines that exist both all of the packing companies and some of the retailers as well.
Hermann Waldemer : Now, I can of course only speak for ourselves. In our case, we did adapt our vending machine product somehow before all that came in to place so it’s not a surprise for use and therefore there are no surprise write offs that I would expect in that area.
Operator:   Your next question is from Ann Gurkin – Davenport & Company LLC.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport & Company LLC: I just want to ask you about lease costs that you all highlighted in our March presentation. I think $550. Is that still a number you’re using?
Hermann Waldemer : In the lease situation is as I said before, this stays an area of concern. Supply is below demand but really let me focus on that this is manageable. Just maybe best is I give you the proportion of simply our numbers of the first half. We have lease inventory sitting on our balance sheet of $4.1 billion. That means a duration of our lease inventories are well beyond one year. The year-to-date income statement costs expense of lease in the first half of the year is $1.7 billion. You have to put that in to relation of the net revenues excluding excise tax which is $13 billion and the actual price impact that we have had, price increase impact that we have had year-to-date in June, is some $50 million. So, it’s there, $50 million is $50 million and we take it serious and you look at that how to increase supply but the overall thing is of course manageable.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport & Company LLC: But that $550 number, is that still a number you are using through 2010 or is that number going up?
Hermann Waldemer : The number you have been using is correct, yes.
Ann Gurkin – Davenport & Company LLC: If I could get an update also on China. I think you are all licensing Marlboro production with the Chinese and vice versa distributing some of their brands. Can we just get an update on that?
Hermann Waldemer : The China domestic, the license production has actually started in two factories in [inaudible] and [inaudible]. So, we are very pleased, that’s a major step forward and the products will be on the Chinese market in the month of August. On the international JV side, we are also progressing. RGD, Red Golden Dragon which has been launched in Czech is having 0.5% share, 0.4% in Slovak and has just now been launched also in Poland. [Dubellis] we are doing which is a mid-priced brand, we are doing test market launches now in the Ukraine and in Russia. It’s launched in Romania this year and by the end of the year you’re going to have six market launches out of the international JV so yes, we are making progress, steady progress going forward.
Operator:   Your next question comes from [Prea Oreguta] – Lehman Brothers.
[Prea Oreguta] – Lehman Brothers: You indicated at the end of your remarks that you would expect to continue to access the capital markets in the second half of the year provided that markets are suitable. Now, in the past I believe that you had indicated that if you were to come to market again it would likely be in Europe. I wanted to know if that was still the case and then secondly if you could just highlight your leverage target for the end of the year?
Hermann Waldemer : Yes, we of course look at other currencies so your first question clearly, it is not just the US dollar but it’s also the other major currencies like Euros, Swiss Francs, that’s what we look at. The leverage for the year, well right now we are at net debt to equity ratio something like 0.4 so we keep ample flexibility and in that sense nothing has changed in terms of what we have said earlier, i.e. what the share repurchase program is so on and so forth. But, that’s the way we go.
Operator:   Your next question is from [Pam Duke] – Financial Times.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: What are your credit facilities at the moment? And, do you have any idea how much you would access in the second half?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, we will decide how much and the amounts once we get to the market so that is something I wouldn’t want to reveal already right now. You have seen that we have done a very successful $6 billion bond offering in May at really what we believe very attractive rate at a weighted average of 5.7%. That I believe, really, really good. And, we look at the other ones as they come and we look at the right moment and what the market gives and then we look also at the right size so it’s nothing you really can say well ahead.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: And the funds raised, would that be to continue the share buyback program or are you looking to perhaps fund acquisitions?
Hermann Waldemer : Look, it is for the overall business. These funds provide us the flexibility for all of it, for share buybacks, for acquisitions should there be attractive acquisitions. We always look at them but, I will of course, not go further than that. So, really for the overall business, it’s nothing earmarked specifically to one or the other activity.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: This time last year we were just costing a big wave of consolidation within the tobacco sector. Do you think there is still room for further industry consolidation?
Hermann Waldemer : I do not expect the large scale industry consolidation that you have seen the last two years, I would not expect anything of that size.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: And given the sales and revenue performance in your European business, I was just wondering whether you can perhaps elaborate a bit more on your strategy for Europe? How you plan? Do you think sales or revenue will stabilize any time soon? Or, are we looking at a continued decline in the European market?
Hermann Waldemer : The European market I would say is a market where of course, in terms of overall market size this is going to continue to decline. I think that European markets, EU markets will probably decline on the midterm basis between 1% and 2% going forward. That doesn’t necessarily mean that revenues decline because, as I said, the pricing power is intact so whilst volume will certainly go down in that part of the world, that does not mean that therefore profitability is going to go down. That’s the big difference to say the emerging markets but, both mature and emerging markets in that sense are good markets, they’re just different.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: Do you see any acquisition opportunities as far as your European business is concerned at the moment? You mentioned earlier that the money raise is not earmarked for anything specific but, if there are any attractive acquisition activities that would be something you would consider.
Hermann Waldemer : We always look at acquisition opportunities around the world and if they are a strategic fit and if they have attractive financial returns then we look at that wherever that is around the world. At the same time, we certainly have the financial flexibility to do them if we want to do them but, otherwise I really have to stop it there because I cannot go in to geographies or potential targets.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: Would [inaudible] be a market PMI would be interested in getting in to?
Hermann Waldemer : Well, we are overall a tobacco company and not just a manufactured cigarette company.
[Pam Duke] – Financial Times: Is that a yes?
Hermann Waldemer : I think that’s the answer.
Operator:   Your next question comes from Christopher Barrett – Bloomberg News.
Christopher Barrett – Bloomberg News: Could you provide an update on your activities in China and how soon we’re going to see the cigarettes coming and going to and from that country?
Hermann Waldemer : It really is our business in China is twofold as I said under China domestic side we are very pleased at the localized production for Marlboro in those two Chinese sectors has started and on the international JV side where we are working with our Chinese partners on the commercialization of Chinese heritage products in the international arena. That is key to our relationship. I believe that we are today, and that has always been our target the preferred partner of CNTC, China National Tobacco Corporation, this is a huge company, this is a huge market and anything there you will see it will take time. This is not for tomorrow. In our guidance we have always said that we don’t expect in the short term substantial impact on our financials these volumes will be in dollars. However, going forward, this is of course an extremely important business development market and here I close the loop, that’s why we are happy that we have made progress again in the last couple of weeks with the startup of the licensed production of Marlboro.
Christopher Barrett – Bloomberg News: So, would it be accurate to say that Chinese smokers are now able to buy Marlboros made in their country? Or, is that still in the production distribution stage?
Hermann Waldemer : It is being produced now. Distribution will start in August however, there would be certainly more demand in China than the supply will be. This is a supply driven market, not a demand driven market so it’s not that Marlboro is available in any desired quantities around the country, it is a stock.
Operator:   Your final question comes from Thomas A. Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner.
Thomas A. Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Hermann, in your release you mentioned that one interesting factor was the Marlboro impact of the allocation of duty free in the US over to Altria from PMI and I wonder how, as you look out over time and PMI develops a portfolio in local markets and starts to look different from Altria’s portfolio, how will this relationship best serve PMI’s interest when travelers returning to their home lands look to buy products in duty free that may bear no relationship to those products which Marlboro naturally addresses? So, how will you get the proper marketing support and encouragement for those travelers with this arrangement?
Hermann Waldemer : Look the split of the trademark between geographies is nothing unusual, you see it in many other trademarks as well. The genes and the origins of the backbone of Marlboro is what Marlboro stands for and nobody on either side of the Atlantic is going to change what really Marlboro stands for. That being said, Marlboro has always been adaptive to the tastes, to the preferences of the consumers around the world and it’s actually extremely important. The best example is probably Marlboro Filter Plus which has tremendous success in a number of markets. Take one, Romania, it’s now 1.5% national share and 2.3% in the City of Bucharest. I bet you that Marlboro Filter Plus is a one milligram product, would not sell much in the US so it’s a normal situation I would think and nothing that concerns me.
Thomas A. Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: Then thinking about some questions about the dividend payout ratio and it raises a broader question about the role of currency and reported results. Assume a year and a half from now we have a vastly different currency picture, what steps does PMI take going forward to protect against the possible reverse of the dollar’s decline on its OCI and then its net? And then accordingly, on the dividend that you would natural project from that net income? What steps do you take to buffer against the OCI impact of currency?
Hermann Waldemer : We always look at transactional exposures. I’ll give you one example. For example, the dollar dominated purchases of leaf tobacco, that’s something that we always look at but it’s always transactional hedges. We have not done in the past, and it’s not our policy to do respective hedges there going forward. I believe, we stick to our business, to our underlying business that has always been our philosophy in that area.
Thomas A. Russo – Gardner Russo & Gardner: By the way, just as a side, the fact that you’re up and running in China, and it wasn’t really highlighted on the printed release, I think you’re being far too modest. I know that Lewis has spent an enormous amount of time getting to this point and I would have thought you would have celebrated it a little bit more that you’re actually up and running and producing in China. That’s quite a milestone. Are there any Virginia blend Marlboros or is it an American blend Marlboro that’s being produced? Are there any other western manufacturers in such a position today?
Hermann Waldemer : It is an American blended product that is being produced there, it is a true Marlboro in there. TH difference, and I will let others speak for themselves but the difference really is that we have an agreement with the top of China National Tobacco and not just with a factory somewhere in the country. That I think is key to future success. We are happy about it, about the recent achievements in China, believe me.
Operator:   I would like to hand the floor back to management for any further or closing remarks.

Nicholas Rolli: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release which contains detailed information on Philip Morris International's 2008 first quarter results. If you do not have a copy you may access one on our website at www.pmintl.com. Following the completion of the spin-off, historical basic and diluted earnings per share amounts have been recalculated based on the actual number of shares distributed by Altria Group, Inc. on the distribution date. As a result, we are provided in today's news release a reconciliation of 2007 reported results to 2007 pro forma adjusted results by quarter and for the full year on Schedules 5 through 9. Accordingly, our 2008 EPS growth rates will now be compared to $2.79 per share versus $2.78 per share. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the safe harbor statement at the end of today's news release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's not my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer for Philip Morris International. Herman?
Hermann Waldemer:  Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone.  It is a great pleasure for me to host the first conference call of the newly independent Philip Morris International. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and were delighted to meet many of you during our road show in March. In our March 11 presentation, we shared with you our longer-term annual growth targets of 4% to 6% growth in net revenues with 1% to 2% volume expansion, 6% to 8% in operating income growth, and 10% to 12% EPS growth rates on a constant currency basis. In January we issued EPS growth guidance of 12% to 14% for 2008 off a base of $2.78. Since then we have witnessed further decline in the value of the U.S. dollar and accordingly we today increased our EPS guidance to reflect our business momentum and current exchange rates. Our 2008 full year EPS guidance now stands within a range of $3.18 to $3.24, representing growth of 14% to 16% from a revised pro forma adjusted basis of $2.79. This new guidance includes the marginally positive impact of the acquisition of Interval and other OTP trademarks from Imperial, and also includes an increase in building expenditures in some key markets to accelerate growth. Let me now share with you our strong first quarter results. Diluted earnings per share were $0.89, up 29% or $0.20 per share. Of this increase $0.11 per share reflects the strength of our business and favorable currency accounts for the balance of $0.09 per share. Net revenues excluding excise taxes were 14.1% higher at $6.3 billion, representing an increase of $781 million.  After adjusting for currency, net revenues increased by 5.4% primarily reflecting improved mix and higher prices. Net revenues increased in all four regions and in the vast majority of our top 25 OCI markets. Reported operating company's income or OCI was 31.7% higher at $2.8 billion in the first quarter. On a like-forlike basis, excluding the favorable impact of currency, acquisitions, and the U.S. duty free business, OCI increased by 17.5% compared to 2007. This very positive result was driven by improved volume and mix in all the regions except the EU.  Higher prices, particularly in the EU and EEMA, reduced administrative costs and the expected skew to the remainder of the year in the timing of some promotional, marketing and overhead expenses.  OCI growth net of currency was very broad-based across most of our markets, with particularly strong growth recorded in Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.  PMI cigarette shipment volume increased by 2.2% or 4.6 billion units to 218 billion units driven by Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico and Russia as well as by the positive impact of our acquisitions in Mexico and Pakistan.  Excluding acquisitions and the U.S. duty-free business, first quarter volume declined by 0.5% or 1.2 billion units due mainly to the continued overall market declines in the EU and Japan. In terms of market share, we made progress in many of our top 25 OCI markets, including Argentina, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine. In Poland and Turkey, while we lost share in the lowest price categories, we improved our mix and substantially increased our profitability. Marlboro shipment volume declined by 1.2% to 77.3 billion units, with growth in EEMA, Asia and Latin America regions offset by a decline in the EU. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the U.S. duty-free business, Marlboro volume declined by 0.6%. Outside the EU Marlboro volume increased by 3.7% driven by its strong performance in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine.  Marlboro Filter Plus, Marlboro Intense, and new menthol variants are helping to re-energize the brand in key markets. We continue to work on the repositioned L&M in Eastern Europe, and are encouraged by the positive developments in the renewal of the brand's smoker base with an improved age and gender profile. Nevertheless, L&M shipments continued to decline in the first quarter though volume trends remained positive in the [inaudible] region. As we explained during the road show, the repositioning of L&M in Eastern Europe is not a short-term exercise, but will take time before positive results are reflected in volume trends. The decline in L&M in Eastern Europe has been largely offset by the very strong performance of the higher-margin Chesterfield, which grew by 18% during the first quarter. The brand is doing particularly well in Russia and Ukraine, but it's also performing strongly in such markets as Italy and Spain. While our other key international brands continue to perform strongly, I would highlight the continued positive development of Parliament. Volume increased during the first quarter by 19% thanks to Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and we are further expanding the brand geographically to build on this momentum. Parliament, with its unique taste and defined packaging, occupies a special place in our portfolio, positioned in many markets at the premium price for Marlboro and generating superior margins.  Let me now comment on key specific developments in our four business segments.  I will begin with the EU region, which remains PMI's most profitable region and was the single largest contributor to PMI's reported OCI growth with an increase of $279 million to $1.3 billion driven by favorable currency and higher pricing partially offset by legacy volume mix. Excluding currency, OCI in the EU region increased by 9.8%.  OCI was only down in one of our most important markets in the EU region, namely in France. There our volume and share declined, we believe temporarily, as a result of Marlboro moving above the round price point of 5 Euros. I would like to highlight in terms of positive OCI developments in the EU - our continued profitability growth in Italy, our strong recovery in Spain, and markedly higher OCI in Poland. This strong profitability was achieved in the context of a rather extraordinary estimated total regional cigarette market decrease of 5.5%. This decline was driven by higher retail prices across the region, the implementation of further smoking restrictions in France, Portugal and most German states as well as tight inventory movements in the Czech Republic. Results in the EU during the first quarter of 2008 highlight our ability to successfully grow profitability in challenging circumstances. PMI's EU shipment volume reached 62.8 billion units, a decline of 3.9 billion units versus 2007, largely reflecting the overall market decline. PMI's overall estimated market share reached 38.8% in the first quarter as positive developments, notably in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain were more than offset by share declines in France and Poland and the impact of the aforementioned tight inventory movements. Marlboro's share was down slightly during the quarter though there was sequential improvement compared to the 2007 first quarter share.  Turning to key markets, our strong performance continued in the first quarter of 2008 in Italy. Our market share was up 0.5 points to 54.7 driven by Chesterfield, Merit and our local heritage brand, Diana, partially offset by a decline in Marlboro's share, which we are addressing through normative line extensions such as the recently launched Marlboro Compact, a product similar in concept to the Marlboro Intense launched in Turkey but lighter in taste.  In Germany, total industry shipments were down 2.7% in the first quarter and PMI's reported share declined by 0.2 points, however, adjusted for competitive inventory changes. We estimate that our cigarette share was up 0.9 points, with L&M now gaining share predominantly from other low-price brands rather than consumer downtrading. We also performed strongly in the fine cut segment, with a quarterly share of over 12% largely driven by innovation. In Spain the total market was up by 5% following weak generally 2007 sales driven by a tax and price-related buildup of trade inventories at the end of 2006. Our market share was slightly higher at 31.8% behind a strong portfolio across all key price segments, with Marlboro and Chesterfield gaining share. Profitability is also recovering strongly. As mentioned, our business in France has come under pressure after increasing [inaudible] prices last year. However, PMI's total market share has sequentially stabilized compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 thanks to the strong performance of Philip Morris Filter Kings. We believe that over time consumers will adjust to the new pricing environment and we are taking steps to further enhance the equity of Marlboro. We're also reinforcing our position in the French fine cut market through the acquisition of Imperial, the segment in France. In the EEMA region, we achieved excellent results in the first quarter helped in part by a favorable comparison to the 2007 first quarter. Net revenues excluding excise taxes rose 20.8% and grew 11.8% excluding currency. Shipment volume in EEMA increased by 2.9% to 75 billion units as we gained volume and market share in the key markets of Russia and Ukraine, continued our growth momentum in Egypt, and reinforced our penetration of two markets which we have entered more recently, namely Algeria and Bulgaria.  Reported OCI in the EEMA region increased by $225 million during the first quarter to reach a level of $792 million driven by higher volume and pricing, positive product mix and favorable currency. This represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 39.7% and 31.6% excluding currency. These results reflect increased profitability across all our Eastern European and Balkan markets as well as other geographies such as Egypt and Turkey, to name just two.  Russia shipment volume was up 7.8% in the quarter thanks to favorable comparison with a weak quarter in 2007 and our improved underlying business performance. Both net revenues and OCI expanded at the fast pace. Our high-end portfolio of Parliament, Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Chesterfield and our infrastructure in [inaudible] position us very well in terms of business fundamentals at a time when the Russian economy and consumers in large cities are benefiting from continued economy growth. Marlboro recorded double-digit volume growth during the quarter and its market share was up. We are particularly pleased by the progress of the normative Marlboro Filter Plus, which we introduced in key cities during the second half of 2007. The brand has already achieved a market share in Moscow of some 1% and consumer reach research indicates a very positive impact on the perception of the whole brand family.  The key driver of our continued volume growth and share expansion in Ukraine was Chesterfield, which grew volume by over 30% in the quarter. Overall, PMI's quarterly share reached a record level of 34.7%.  Our profitability in Turkey surged over 30% during the first quarter thanks to higher pricing and an improvement in our brand mix.  The share of premium brands in our portfolio was up from 39% in the first quarter of 2007 to 44% this year. Parliament is performing very well, with volume up over 25% and a gain of almost 1 market share point.  Egypt also merits special attention as it is an excellent illustration of PMI's ability to grow volume, share and profitability in emerging markets. The market has grown at 2% a year since 2002 to reach 75 billion units last year. Our portfolio is made up of premium-priced Marlboro and Merit, mid-priced L&M, and low-priced Mix. All four brands are performing well, which enabled us to achieve first quarter market share of 13.5% and a share of the international segment in excess of 75%.  Our business in Asia has been strengthened by acquisitions and the robust performance of our brands in such markets as Indonesia and Korea. This has helped to offset the challenging environment in Japan, where the overall market is declining, pricing flexibility is limited, Marlboro's share has lagged our growth expectations, and Lark has been under pressure.  Reported OCI in Asia was up by a strong 24.5% in the first quarter to $584 million driven by favorable currency, higher prices, and positive volume mix.  Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI increased by 17.5%. There were positive developments in nearly all markets, led by Australia, Indonesia and Korea with the key exception being Japan.  Net revenues excluding excise taxes were up 10.2% and 6% excluding currency. At 57.1 billion units, shipment volume was helped by the 5 billion unit contribution of Pakistan. Shipment volume was up 10% and 0.4% excluding acquisitions.  PMI's market share increased in Korea and Thailand, remained stable in Australia, and declined in Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines.  Marlboro volume increased in Asia during the first quarter and Parliament and Virginia Slims also showed positive trends.  The Japanese market declined by 3.6% in the first quarter but is down 4.3% on a 12-month moving average basis. We are expecting this trend to continue during the year, and we might see some temporary disruptions from the introduction of age verification systems for vending machines. PMI's shipment volume in the first quarter was down 4%. Our 23.9% share during the first quarter in Japan was off 0.8 share points primarily due to Lark. We have the programs in place to correct this going forward though we expect the recovery to be gradual. We are addressing Lark through the rollout initially in the eastern part of Japan of Lark Classic and Lark Menthol X was launched during the quarter with encouraging early results.  The brand family is being supported as of May with a revamped marketing campaign. In addition, Marlboro Ice Mint is performing well in the menthol segment, and we have other normative initiatives in the pipeline in order to accelerate Marlboro's growth going forward. We are confident that all these initiatives should help grow our market share in Japan. In Indonesia shipment volume increased by 5.6% in the quarter and profitability was strong though our market share was off slightly to 28%. Marlboro Kretek continues to perform well and provide an overall boost to the whole brand family. Marlboro's share in Indonesia increased by 0.3 share points during the first quarter to 4.2% and we have launched A Volution, the first kretek offering in the super slims format.  Korea was the first market where we introduced Marlboro Filter Plus. It continues to provide a stimulus to the overall franchise, with Marlboro's total share up to 4.5%. Parliament and Virginia Slims are also gaining, and late last year we introduced a local heritage brand called Lim.  Let me conclude by regional review with Latin America. At $152 million, reported OCI was up 72.7% and 54.5% excluding currency and acquisitions. This increase in profitability is attributable to higher pricing, the impact of acquisitions of local trademarks in Mexico, and positive volume mix developments in Argentina and Mexico, partly offset by difficult trading conditions and distortions related to the January 2007 tax structure change in Colombia. Net revenues excluding excise taxes increased 10.8% and 6.9% excluding currency and acquisitions. Shipment volume was 5.6% higher at 23.2 billion units, but essentially stable after taking into account the contribution of 1.3 billion units from our acquisition in Mexico.  On a regional basis, Marlboro shipments increased by more than 5% to over 10 billion units after the brand gained share in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.  Mexico is our most important market in Latin America. Our profitability was up substantially during the first quarter as we gained share, achieved higher pricing, and benefited from our recent acquisition. Our quarterly share reached a record level of 67%, with Marlboro, Benson & Hedges, and Delicados all growing.  We also successfully expanded our business in Argentina. Our share reached 70.7% in the first quarter as both Marlboro and the Philip Morris brand continued to perform well, thus helping to drive a double-digit increase in profitability.  To sum up, PMI achieved very strong first quarter results by a number of measures. EPS growth was 29%. Net revenues excluding excise taxes increased in all four regions and were up 5.4% excluding currency. Operating companies' income was also up in each of the regions and was up a strong 17.5% excluding currency, acquisitions and U.S. duty-free. Our innovation pipeline is beginning to generate encouraging results, with more to come in the months ahead. The acquisition of Interval and other OTP trademarks will strengthen our position in a growing and profitable category and will provide us with an attractive economic return.  We will begin our two-year, $13 billion share repurchase program in May. While we expect our marketing and promotion spending notably behind new initiatives will be skewed towards the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver the 2008 EPS growth rates outlined in our revised guidance today.  We have in place the strategies, the brands and the people to deliver against our commitment to achieve superior returns for our shareholders.  That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  Hi. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer : Good morning, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: My first question is just in terms of your operating growth behavior in the first quarter. I mean, clearly we saw a huge operating leverage with constant currency revenue up 5.4% but operating profit up close to 17%. Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that, whether it's the timing of some of the cost savings? You've mentioned the promotional spending being more skewed to the back half of 2006 of the year. Can you just quantify how much that really affected the first quarter and how we think about that for the remainder of the year. 
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. It's of course, I mean, as you said, I think it's a combination of all of the above. Yes, we had pricing in the quarter. We had, most importantly, improving business fundamentals in our overall business, I think in all of the four regions, as you can see by the growth in both net revenues and also operating companies' income.  There is some cost skewing towards the remainder of the year - spending skewed towards the remainder of the year. Our cost measures that we have taken essentially all across the cost categories are bringing results in as well.  So it's all of the above, so it's an extraordinary quarter but also if you take it for the year as expressed by our new guidance, we are set for strong growth for the year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Okay. In following up on that just in terms of what is embedded in your guidance as far as the currency is concerned, how much impact are you looking at now for the remainder of the year and does that assume that the currency stay at the same rate today or how are you thinking about that number?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, let me - I think it's best if I describe to you a little bit the elements that went into our new guidance, what did we consider in there. It's actually four elements that went into our consideration.  The first one is, of course, the currency and the favorable currency tailwinds that we see. However I would also like to say it's just April 23 right now and there are a couple of months to come throughout the year. The second point really is our business momentum, improved fundamentals and our business momentum that we see really across our businesses, and we can go later into specific markets, how they are doing.  The third element is also that we want to do some reinvestments into some of our key markets. That is also an opportunity to do so, and we will do that in order to accelerate future growth. So there is an investment part going into the equation, if you like. And the fourth element is really some expenses, as I said, skewed towards the remainder of the year. And then we took all those four and this is how we come to 14% to 16% EPS growth for the year. So it's a mixture of the four elements.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then just my final question, looking at the EU region, can you quantify how much the trade inventory distortions in Czech and Germany impacted your shipment numbers in the first quarter. And secondly, you know, are you surprised at all by the magnitude of the overall market decline following the price increases?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. I mean, let me start there really giving some color on the EU market decline.  There is really one effect in there which is enormous which is the one of the Czech Republic. If you take out of the total market decline of 5.5% in the EU the Czech effect, then you're down to 1.9% and you are back to what we believe going forward in the midterm is a market rate decline for the EU region between 1% and 2%.  So the Czech situation, maybe I should describe a little bit what's going on there because it's such a specific and a bit strange situation. Total market in the Czech Republic in the first quarter is actually down by a dazzling 75%. I mean, this is a strange situation and it's actually what I would call a prime example of undesired effects of assembled inconsistent [policy] in a country.  You don't have efficient forestalling regulations in the market, which means that you can have old tax, old price product in the markets with durations anywhere between six and 12 months beyond the date of an excise tax change. That doesn't make a lot of sense. It, of course, also has competitive consequences in such a market. The smaller you are, the higher your durations tend to be because you have smaller volumes so on your brands you can have longer durations. You're at a certain disadvantage if you're big like we are in the market. So these are all these distortions, but if something is distorted at such a magnitude, I think that also can give us the confidence that this is bound to change. It might need a transition. It might not change in one go, but it's bound to change. So that is really the most important point to get back to the EU market decline. It really has had an impact there. 
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Filippe Goossens with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse:  Yes. Good morning, Hermann, and congratulations for a blowout quarter. We really were very pleasantly surprised here. 
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you very much, Filippe. 
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: A couple of housekeeping questions first, if I may, Hermann. The first one, do you have any color in terms of what Capex and free cash flow were for the first quarter?
Hermann Waldemer: We are on target for our free cash flow targets for the year, so there is nothing unusual. We are perfectly within the guidance that we have given before.
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Okay. And can you give us how much of the cost cutting was already realized in Q1?
Hermann Waldemer: They'll come in -- we, of course, see the benefits of our measures -- administrative, procurement, operations productivity, everywhere. Going forward, I mean, what we intend to do is actually, I mean, to give an update on our cost program, say, once a year, not really every quarter. That probably would be just too much of a detail, and you have the swings between the quarters. But really, to the essence of your questions, are we on target for our cost savings and profitability improvements? Yes, we are.
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then my real questions here, Hermann, number one, in terms of the reinvestment that you referred to later on this year, can you give us a little bit more specifics in terms of what you plan to do and the dollar impact?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. I mean, of course I have to be a bit careful here for competitive reasons. Let's agree that I give you one example which is a pretty obvious one which is Japan. We all remember the situation in Japan, that we had the Marlboro take back at the time, we had the distribution focus of our company at the time. There was tremendous profitability increase at that time also driven by that. We somewhat missed out on the marketing part. We have a new management in place that is really focused on the marketing and on the refilling of the innovation pipeline. So that's really what we want to support. So if you like, in Japan I would say we have put both the human but also the financial resources to correct the situation there, and we will invest where we have our issues. We have our number one issue in Japan, which is Lark. There, there are two things right now and there is more to come. There is the launch of Lark Classic out in a part of the market, but that's bound to be rolled out to the entire market. There is the support by a really new campaign for the entire franchise. There is Marlboro Menthol X launch out there, which is performing well.  As you know, the menthol segment is a key segment, a key growth segment in the Japanese market. We are out there also in the Marlboro side with Marlboro Ice Mint. We have more to come there. This is a very competitive segment, so I, of course, won't say yet what exactly it's going to be, but there is more to come on our franchise. So I think these are the areas - the problem areas, if you like - and this is, of course, also where the money goes.  A last point maybe to mention, which is that the implementation of age verification on the vending machines, that certainly will trigger some changes in the consumer purchasing pattern, and that also needs support in terms of sales force distribution but also in terms of money. So that will be an example of where that reinvestment money goes.
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Maybe just as a follow up on Japan, then, Hermann, given these secular threats and consumption declines, do you see any opportunities on the smokeless side over there?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah, look, I mean, as highlighted by our acquisition of Interval, we consider ourselves to be a tobacco company. We always look at all alternatives. But I think for now we rather should concentrate on the problem at hand, which really is the decline of Lark and the missing growth - Marlboro is stable - the missing growth of Marlboro in Japan. That's where I would say we should focus and we will focus on now. 
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Okay. The next question, Hermann, if I have my numbers correct using your $0.46 in dividends for the quarter, if I annualize that and I look at the share price, obviously, the share price will be up this morning, but I'm coming out with less than 4% dividend yield, which puts you at the lower end, particularly compared to the U.S. players out there. When can we expect the dividend payouts to go up, particularly if you look at your very strong balance sheet even after the share buybacks?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, I think there we have to stay with the facts. The facts are that we have an annual rate of 184. We have $0.46 cents for the quarter. The other fact is that we have a payout ratio of 65%. And the rest is entirely up to the Board and it is a Board decision, including the timing. 
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: When is the next Board meeting, Hermann?
Hermann Waldemer: There are seven Board meetings throughout the year, and if you refer to the Altria [inaudible], they had that in August. But that doesn't mean anything on PMI. This is a new Board, and the new Board will decide that question in its entire discretion.
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Okay, then just my final question if I may, Hermann. Obviously you have been a big beneficiary of uptrading in emerging markets. Now, let me be for one second a little bit more skeptical. If people are concerned about the weakness in the U.S. spilling over to other markets and you would see a slowdown in the growth rates in emerging markets, is there risk that this whole uptrading trend may slow down or, in a worst-case scenario, you would actually reverse?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. There are two elements in here, I think, in your question. I mean, the first one is that I believe we are in a wonderful position with our premium-secured portfolio to benefit from uptrading in emerging markets. That is a positive for the entire company.  Now, of course, I mean, driven also by the question of raising food prices and so and so forth, could that have eventually some impact on the disposable income of consumers in emerging markets? Yes, that cannot be excluded. I mean, that is happening as we speak in Indonesia. But I really have to tell you we don't see any impact on our brands, on our sales from that right now. 
Filippe Goossens - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thank you so much, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer:  You're welcome. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  Thank you. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Hi. I just had a couple questions for you, and my first one was just to kind of go back to a question I think Filippe had asked about cost savings. Is it reasonable to assume that you - in the year - was about a third of those, what you outlined for the three-year program?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, it is a three-year program. We have thought it, the activities which are the basis the ability to generate those savings already last year and the year before, so these are ongoing programs. Overall, yes, we will deliver that at a constant pace over the years. It's coming in. The programs are on track everywhere. 
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then just to go back to I think a number you gave in your remarks. I think you said that Marlboro volume outside of the EU was up 3.7%. Is that correct?
Hermann Waldemer: Yes, that's correct. 
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: That's obviously a very big performance. I'm just curious within that is there - you've got a lot of new products focused on Marlboro. Are you seeing a lot of benefit from those new products or is this more just sort of base business growth with a little kicker, if you will, from the new products?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, the new products and the refilling of the pipeline are really key to the innovation strategy. So if you talk Filter Plus, if you talk Intense, Ice Mint, or if you talk Marlboro Kretek in Indonesia, these are on one side new offers, extremely attractive for the consumers, that's one thing, but you also do have a halo effect driven by innovation on your entire franchise. So it's good from both perspectives. And if you look a little bit into the region or into the markets, well, go to Indonesia. There you have Marlboro Kretek doing very well. It's actually [inaudible] the process of expanding distribution to the entire territory of Indonesia. It's doing well. And at the same time, we see a renewed growth for what we call the MR [inaudible], i.e., the Marlboro traditional. Korea, a little bit the same thing, Marlboro Filter Plus. Marlboro itself also growing to 4.5% market share. Russia-Ukraine, I would again say, Filter Plus helping in that growth, but also again re-energizing the franchise.  You go to Mexico and here you have Marlboro Lights, which is doing very well in the market. So it is both. It is good, it is generating volume by itself as a line extension, but it is bringing news value, energy to the entire franchise, and that's how we go about it. 
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And then the last question I had for you was just on your marketing reinvestment, the incremental investment. Is that primarily focused on your problem markets or is it more about, you know, generating growth in some of the faster-growing markets? So are you trying to fix some problems or are you trying to sort of accelerate growth in some markets with that money?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, it is both. I mean, we don't only want to fix the Japanese problem, we also want to grow it. So it's both, and this is how you go about investment when you have problems. But also - and maybe even more importantly - where you have growth opportunities. And actually Japan is an example for both.
Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Adelman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.:  Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, David.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.:  A few things, Hermann. First of all, I think in '03 when there was a conscious decision to increase investment internationally the company quantified the spending. Are you willing to do that this year?
Hermann Waldemer: I'm afraid I'm not willing.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. Secondly, Hermann, broadly speaking, what's the risk that your incremental spending damages some of the competitive piece that's broken out in so many of these markets?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, of course, markets are always competitive, and our spending is there to improve our situation. And that's what we are really all concerned about, and this is what we are doing. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. But you're not unduly concerned about a response to your higher spending levels?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, we do what is good for our company and to think on our competitive position. I can't answer for the other companies. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. Also, Hermann - and this was asked before but let me ask it again - there's such a remarkable improvement in the operating metrics of the company looking at sort of organic volume growth versus local currency operating profit growth. Can you go through again sort of the major dynamics that are resulting in such better performance coming into this year than you enjoyed even in the second half of last year?
Hermann Waldemer: I mean, look, I think really we see here the key elements - oh, there is a beep now in the line here. Okay, can you hear me all right? 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: I can hear you fine.
Hermann Waldemer:  Okay, good. Okay, look, I mean, what we see here is really I would say the confirmation of what we have said during the road show, where we believe we are going and that we believe we can deliver and we will deliver. I mean, there is an overall improvement in the business fundamentals. We did not see really the disruptive type of excise increases that triggers all the undesired consequences that these do. So we see that governments are more conservative, if you like, or applying those increases in a more rational manner. So that's what's working well. That is an important element. On the other side, I would say whilst we still have a lot of work to do going forward and we are doing that work, you see that our innovation pipeline begins to be filled up. It is improving and we are getting things out of the gate here. Still room to improve and we will improve further, and you will see more. So I think these are main elements. And in the emerging markets, well, we are performing well. We are doing well in terms of market share. We benefit from uptrading in those markets, which is the strength of our portfolio. Look, we have, as we all know, we have seven out of the top 15 brands in the world. And even if you look at one of our problems that we clearly have which is L&M in Eastern Europe, yes, we have a problem there. And, you know, what we have done there - revamped the product, the pack and the campaign - and we are really positive that this is going to show results. At the same time - and here I come back to my seven brands out of the top 15 - you have a Chesterfield, another midpriced brand actually priced slightly above L&M in those markets, which is growing tremendously and helping there. So it's the broadness of our portfolio and the strength of our portfolio that also helps us.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Hermann, two last things. In Japan, with the vending change in that market, what's the risk that the business sort of relives the situation in Germany that you suffered through last year, being over shared relative in vending versus convenience stores?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. There are two elements to it. I mean, first our vending - we are not over proportionately present in vending share. Actually, our share in C-stores is higher than in vending. The second part of the answer is, of course, what will be the changes in consumer behavior, in purchasing patterns in the market. That's difficult to predict. We will see some changes and some skews towards C-stores in the market, to what extent that is difficult to see right now. But the specific problem we had in Germany we don't have in Japan. 
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, in Germany are you lobbying for an increase in the minimum tax size to 20 sticks?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, that is certainly something that would make sense. That is something that I believe the government is considering. It's, at the end of the day, a governmental decision. We certainly support it, but let's see what the decision is going to be.
David Adelman - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.: Okay. That would be a nice precursor to a price increase - my comment, not yours. Bye. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jonathan Fell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank :  Morning. 
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: First thing I wanted to ask about was some more of the reason behind the kind of outsized gain in operating income in the first quarter. Looks to me like first quarter the proportion of marketing, admin and research costs to net sales dropped by about 300 basis points versus where it was last year, so I'm just wondering how much of that is cost savings stuff and how much of it is just due to timing of your marketing budget. And what would you expect to happen for that figure for the full year versus last year? Are we going to see an ongoing decline in that line as a proportion of sales for '08 or is it going to be broadly similar?
Hermann Waldemer: Yeah. Okay, there are three things in there. I mean, of course, there is the cost saving part in there. There is the second part, which is, as we said, of some expenses skewed towards the remainder of the year. But there are also some favorable comparisons in there to last year where we had a couple of one-timers which we don't have this year. So it's those three things in total. And the cost and the cost skewing toward the remainder of the year will, of course, remain throughout the year or is just a fact.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And as a proportion of sales, would you expect that line to be broadly flat or can it drift down because of the cost savings element?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, our cost savings are in there. It comes back essentially there to the guidance question, I think. There are all these elements in there that are - our cost savings in there, our productivity in there - but there are also the reinvestments in there, and if you take it all together this is what brings us to the new guidance.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Second question just on your business model and the relationship of the 2008 performance to that, particularly as it relates to volume growth because, you know, I think organic volume growth in the first quarter down 0.8%. You flagged that '08's going to be a difficult year but that you would hope to be hitting your 1% to 2% volume target in future years. I'm just wondering how you see that as a business and what the reasons for that would be. Is it because you're going to slow down in the rate of decline in the total European market? Is it because you're going to accelerate share within EU? Or is it because you expect an acceleration in volume growth in other parts of the world?
Hermann Waldemer: Well first, I mean, the real - the organic number that you should look to is not minus 0.8. It's minus 0.5 because you really have to deduct also there the U.S. duty-free business which was in our numbers last year and is not in our numbers this year.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, fine. Yeah.
Hermann Waldemer: So it's 0.5. It is actually therefore perfectly in line with what we said previously, i.e., a slight decline still in 2008. Going forward, look, I mean, we spoke before on different questions about our innovation pipeline and what we are doing for our key brands - Marlboro, but not only Marlboro, also the other seven - and there also as you can see in the news release, I mean, we have nice growth rates on a lot of our other brands. Parliament is doing extremely well. Chesterfield is doing extremely well. Virginia Slims is growing. So there are good signs for our portfolio and for our innovation pipeline across our brands. That's what makes us believe that we can improve and will improve market share performance, and I would not just link that just to a region. This is on a market-per-market basis but, if you like, across the world.  The other part of your question is, of course, the question of the market declines in the EU. I mean, as I said, I mean, take Czech out - which is really a special situation - you are at minus 1.9. You're within the 1% to 2% market decline that we see for the European Union.  And I believe also if you go to Japan, the other important market where we see declines, I think it's going to be the 2% to 3% that we - as we said during the road show - I think that's what you see going forward there. A bit sharper right now; I think that's going to calm down. 
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: And the share loss that we've seen in Japan in the last quarter, I mean, it did seem to accelerate slightly from what we were seeing at the end of last year. Is there any particular competitive activity that is causing that or have you taken the case off Lark a bit in advance of re-launching it? What's the explanation for that, would you say?
Hermann Waldemer: No, really, I mean, to be very frank with you, Lark is a problem. I mean, our market share loss in Japan is principally related to Lark. Marlboro is essentially stable, so it's really Lark where we have the decline.  We are doing what we believe we have to do, which is skew towards two trends, if you like. One, menthol is very important in the Japanese market. That is Lark Menthol X. There we have done something. And then you also have to cover more of, let me call it, the more traditional, more conservative side of your smoker base, which is not menthol, which is full flavor. That is the Lark Classic.  And overall your performance in the market is also linked to campaigns. We've come up with a revamped campaign for the entire franchise.  So we focus very much on it, but, well, the situation is the situation it is. But we work on it; we work on it very hard, and we believe that driven by what I said before and more initiatives to come we can turn it around.
Jonathan Fell - Deutsche Bank AG: Thanks a lot.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  Thank you very much. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Christine.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Just a couple of quick follow ups, if I could. Your top-line growth, currency neutral, of 5.4%, if we look at your reported volumes of 2.2, suggest real price growth of 3.2. I just want to understand I'm looking at that correctly. Given fewer disruptions in the excise taxes, can you talk a little bit about, firstly, what the underlying price contribution was as well as the mix contribution or if that took away, and secondly, is that a good formula going forward? Should we see that kind of amalgamated price mix growth on the top-line on a currency neutral basis?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, okay, I mean, if you take currency out and really, I mean, you see that the improvement of the business performance is highlighted by the numbers that you see in the release is actually quite a bit higher than the currency variance, which is only 255 for the quarter. The business performance of course consists of various elements. It's clear that the pricing variance is an important part of that - and actually that's a positive, I would say - but it's also clear that it's not the only part in there. There is cost as a part in there, but there is also improved performance in there which is expressed by an improvement in the volume mix. I mean, volume mix is positive in three regions and is negative in one region, which, of course, is the one where it's down is the European Union region. So that's a bit of parameters in the game here, and they all play together. But look, I see improvements, if you like, in all of them. Pricing is important. That's good. That's normal. If you like, we're going to keep on looking at our costs, and we will work on our innovation pipeline across the brand, which is the volume mix. And I think we see some improvement there. We clearly see, actually, some improvement there in the volume mix.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And moving just to two market questions. Firstly, in Russia there was a nice pickup in market growth there and given some easy comps, I'm just trying to understand your perspective of what you think a normalized growth rate might be in Russia in the intermediate term.
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, the Russian market is actually very difficult to measure, to be frank with you. It is growing; to what extent it is growing is difficult. There is not such a precise measure, but it's one of the emerging markets that is growing.  What is more important for us in there, actually, is the operating potential that the market has where you clearly can see that, I mean, starting with Parliament, there's Marlboro, also there's Chesterfield, where this is, of course, a very attractive market for us and we are doing pretty well.  You are right, also, with your comment that there are some easy comps to the first quarter. In Russia, that's true. On the other hand, that shouldn't distract us from the point that Russia is a very good story.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And the final question, Hermann, is on China. Can you just update a little bit on the progress there and what you see in the remainder of the year in both the export business as well as Marlboro within China?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. In China we are really absolutely on track, also, compared to what we said during the road show. So we expect on the domestic market the launch of licensed-produced volume Marlboro in China actually the summer of this year. This is going to come. We are on track on this one. On the international venture, RGD has been launched in the Czech Republic. It's a very successful launch. We have done consumer off-take tests in some shops. We see consumer off-take above 1% market share. That's a very good result for that one. So we are on track there also on our plans to expand further into other markets in the Chinese joint venture.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Erik Bloomquist with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.:  Hi. Good morning, Hermann.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Erik.
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.: Just one question to follow up. I just was hoping you could discuss more the outlook in Germany. It appears to be still a market where there's pressure on the premium segment with the low-price segment continuing to gain share and OTP, as well, remaining strong. What are the prospects for that market to stabilize given that the taxes in East EU countries now have risen? Are we going to get to a point where Germany stabilizes and then perhaps see a recovery in premium as there's more innovation in that market? Any comments around that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Well, let me start by saying that Germany will always be a challenging market, and actually not just for the cigarette or tobacco category, actually for all consumer goods. That will always be the case.  That being said, let me also say that our operating company's income in Germany is actually stable, net of currency stable.  Then I would say that there are a couple of good indices in there, but I wouldn't say everything is beautiful already. It's not at all. There is still work to be done.  But there are good indices. The first one I would say the Marlboro decline clearly has slowed down. It's on the way to stabilization, I would think. L&M in the market is the fastest-growing brand. It's actually now sourcing from other low-priced brands and not just benefiting from downtrading. Order sales, I would say, are stable. There are some signs of decline. And if you adjust for the inventory distortions that you have seen in the market, then our first quarter share is up 0.9.  So yeah, what we do in Germany is focus on innovation, Mix full flavor, the new Marlboro version there, has been relaunched. Blend 29 additive-free version is coming in May.  On the OTP part we are out with the tobacco block, which is really innovation in that segment. It's the perfect make-your-own device if you like. We are selling about 20,000 machines per month, which means you attract 20,000 smokers per month.  I think these are pretty positive things and indices we see there. I really have to come back to my first point Germany as a whole will always be a challenging market, that's clear. 
Erik Bloomquist - J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.: Okay, thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Spielman with Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research:  Good morning. It's Adam Spielman here.
Hermann Waldemer: Good morning, Adam.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: First question very quickly, if I may, you said that your volume this quarter was down 0.8% but if you adjusted for the duty free it was really .5% decline. If we adjust again for the Czech inventory issues, what would the underlying figure be?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, I mean, the Czech situation is, of course, completely distorted there. I mean, the volumes in the Czech market are very low this year, this quarter, as we said before. On the other hand, our market share in the Czech market, then, correspondingly is very high.  So it's totally distorted actually. I didn't want to take that out because it's so much of a distortion. It would be clearly better again, but I think that would not be fair to do that.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: Okay. Much more important point, though - this quarter obviously volume has been weak, but your net revenue growth has been good, in line with your long-term guidance and your OCI much better. And particularly as your innovation pipeline comes through, is it possible just to pose that actually we'll continue to see the same pattern so volume, relatively subdued but actually the net revenue line doing significantly better, if you like, so price mix very strong given the fact that your innovation is mainly on premium brands which will inevitably not only help volume but even more help the net revenue line? 
Hermann Waldemer: Okay, I mean, you're right that the net revenue line is an extremely important line. And actually, we are happy and we are very satisfied that we are within the net revenue guidance nevertheless, although we are not yet, I would say, on our volume target of organic growth of a percent there.  So it shows that we are able to deliver on the revenue line even without yet meeting the target on the volume line, and in terms of operating companies' income, we are also perfectly in line with our longer-term targets as we have given them out. That, however, will not make us complacent to work not as intense as we do right now on the volume line. Of course, we focus on innovation on the premium side of it but also on the mid-price side of it as I think the best example of that one is L&M in Eastern Europe.  So we keep on working on all of them, but we are very pleased to see that we are doing well on the revenue line and on the OCI line. 
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: Just a very quick follow up. My understanding when you gave those targets in the road show was they were longer-term targets, and you said very clearly at the time you were unlikely to hit the volume targets in this year. When do you think it's - when does longer-term kick in, I guess is the question. When should we expect these targets to be applicable?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, as you rightly say that volume target, as we have said, for this year is that we will still see a slight decline. We are in the quarter at 0.5%. I think that is a slight decline. So that's the 2008 guidance on the volume side. We will see sequential improvement. That's our target, bringing it to stable volumes and go forward from there. To put the precise timing in terms of months on it, I think, is not possible. We want to do it as quickly as we can, believe me.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: Okay. And just finally, to come back to the question about the skew of the promotional spend, you said very clearly one of the reasons OCI was so strong this quarter is promotion is skewed away from this quarter to the rest of the year. Can you quantify what the OCI might have looked like had the skew - had promotion been evenly spread throughout the year? So instead of being 17%, would it have been, I don't know, 12% or something like that?
Hermann Waldemer: No. I mean, look, I mean, there's really - we come back to the guidance. I really would have to refer you to what we said.  What went into the new guidance, the four elements - which are the currency, the business momentum, the reinvestment and the expenses - so those four form, at the end of the day, the basis for the new number. 
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: And you can't give a sort of - a more underlying - 
Hermann Waldemer: I wouldn't want to go any further than that.
Adam Spielman - Citi Investment Research: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question is coming from Jonathan Leinster with UBS. Sir, please go ahead.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited:  Hi. Good morning. Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, just to clarify, on the promotional expenditure is it fair to say that as of now under the new guidance that the total promotional expenditure in dollar terms expected in 2008 is higher than it was when you sort of gave the original guidance at the end of January?
Hermann Waldemer: Look, I mean, the point is that you have a skew of promotional expenditures through the remainder of the year.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: But it's - 
Hermann Waldemer: That's one point, and the other point is, as you say, yes, we do reinvest in some of our key markets.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: Yeah. So the total should have been higher, whether it's skewed or not?
Hermann Waldemer: Well, as I say, two elements.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: Yeah.
Hermann Waldemer: It's timing on one side, but it's reinvestment on the other side.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: Secondly, with regards to the rapid rise of Chesterfield, Parliament and Virginia Slims, how much of that is a sort of geographic rollout or is it pure in-market growth for those brands?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Look, I mean, for example, take Chesterfield. I mean, Chesterfield is growing really enormously and doing extremely well in Ukraine and Russia. Just to give you a feeling for it, if you take the growth of Chesterfield in those two markets, then actually that growth almost matches the decline of L&M in those two markets. So this is not expansion, this is strength of that brand in the market. Chesterfield, however, is not only strong in those two. It is also showing good signs in Spain and in Italy, where it's growing as well.  So it is growth in existing markets. There of course can be more markets where a brand can be expanded to later on, but right now this is existing markets. And Parliament, you have key markets like Turkey or Russia where Parliament is doing extremely well. Again, it gives us the potential to expand further, but it's not just kind of pipeline effect that you see there. This is real growth.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: Okay, thanks. And also just lastly, with regards to the new product innovations, a lot of them seem to be very much skewed towards the emerging markets, so Indonesia - I don't suppose Japan's hardly an emerging market, but I mean there's quite a lot going on in Japan - but how many [inaudible] have been introduced into the EU, which seems to be the real core problem are for Marlboro over the longer term?
Hermann Waldemer: No, look, I mean, there will be - there is actually already innovation also in the EU. I mean, Marlboro Mix full flavor has been re-launched in Germany in the quarter. I said before that Blend 29 is coming as an additive-free version in May. We have had tobacco [inaudible] in Germany. So we are having really quite a number of innovations also in those markets. We don't forget about those. It's coming everywhere.
Jonathan Leinster - UBS Limited: Okay. Thanks very much.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from [Dennis Jonjac with Bessel Capital]. Please go ahead.
Dennis Jonjac - Bessel Capital:  Hi, Hermann. Dennis here. Just very quickly just a point of clarification. Are you expecting China to contribute this year to EPS guidance? And where does, you know, the China strategy fit in overall as you look at markets, emerging markets, is it a priority? And the other question I had is in terms of the buyback program, is there a set kind of buyback in terms of buying back share on more of an opportunistic basis or just more kind of automatic buyback? If you could just comment on that, that would be great. Thanks. 
Hermann Waldemer: Right. On China, I mean, meaningful EPS impact for this year, no. That's just too small to have an effect.  Look, I mean, the key point really is for China to be [inaudible] partner of the China National Tobacco Company there. That is really the key in there; it is building long-term relationships in China. And that has really two elements to it, which is the China domestic element - that is Marlboro licensed production for the summer - and that is then on the other side really doing business internationally with them. That is illustrated by the launch of RGD in the Czech Republic. These are the two elements in there which describe best the overall strategy for China. On the buyback there is, look, I mean, early May we will start the buyback. This is a two-year program, and we will not be there speculative. We will, of course, follow all the rules that apply to share buybacks. That's, I guess, what I have to say on that one.
Dennis Jonjac - Bessel Capital: Great. Thank you.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from Thomas Russo with Russo, Gardner & Gardner. Please go ahead.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner:  Hi. Congratulations, Hermann. Congratulations in particular with the described halo effect that you referred to around the world as you roll out innovations to meet the consumers' demand for Marlboro. That's a most positive development. 
Hermann Waldemer: Thank you very much, Tom.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner: You bet. A couple of questions. First, talk about the Interval acquisition and what the market is like in France for leaves. I think that's where you suggested that it was intended to serve your needs. And then what's the market like for fine cut in France?
Hermann Waldemer: Okay. Interval, actually, I mean, on that acquisition I would say we have said before that we are a tobacco company. There you see we mean that serious. Actually, Interval has a 14.8% share of the fine cut market in France. An estimated operating company's income of that would be some 25 million Euros. That's about the size of the business there. Important is actually this is the leading brand amongst young adults, legal age to 29. So it complements, I would say, our portfolio very nicely. We have been in that market in the entire EU region quite a bit, but we have been in there mostly with our cigarette trademarks and there we really have now a real grow-your-own trademark there, we have acquired there, so that's another positive of that acquisition.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner: And aren't there markets where they're in-market, 14.8% share in France. Where else do they do business?
Hermann Waldemer: Interval is very much concentrated in France.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner: Yeah.
Hermann Waldemer: It exists also in Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, i.e., the surrounding countries, but it is skewed towards France. That doesn't mean that it's just a French brand.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner: Yeah, yeah. And then you'd mentioned at some point during the road show there were questions about leaves, both availability of leaves and maybe the unusual cost of leaves. I'm wondering whether it's had any impact.
Hermann Waldemer: No, I mean, the storyline is exactly the same as we described it in the road show. I mean, simply the fact that leaf durations go well beyond a year, therefore it means that when you buy somewhat more expensive leaf at the beginning it only will hit your income statement over time, so you have very little effect of that in the first quarter.
Thomas Russo - Russo, Gardner & Gardner: Thank you, and thank you for the call.
Hermann Waldemer: You're welcome. Thank you.
Nicholas Rolli :  Well, thank you very much for joining us this morning. We ran a little over but we wanted to make sure that took all the questions, and we appreciate you joining us. That concludes our conference call. Our 2008 second quarter conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, July 23, so we'll continue to post updated information on the PMI website so please refer to the website for additional information.  Thank you very much, and have a great day.
