===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher : Thank you, operator and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2025 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the investor section of the VC properties website@www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our first quarter 2025 earnings release, our supplemental information and our other filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that I will turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning everyone. Over the next few minutes, John will talk to you about our exciting new relationship with Red Rock Resorts and our other growth activities, and then David will discuss our recent refinancing, our results and our increased guidance. To start, I'd like to share my thoughts on what we at VICI anchor to in all times, especially in periods of high volatility and low certainty, and that is working to ensure that we maintain our ability to sustain and grow the current cash income we distribute to our stockholders in the form of our dividend for REIT management team. That should, of course, be standard operating procedure. And because of that, one might think that the sustaining and growing of dividends would be top of mind for REIT investors as well. Again, one would think, and yet, when we meet with our investors, which we do at great frequency, many of them will end the meeting by asking, is there anything we didn't ask about that other investors are asking about? When we are asked this question, we often answer with, well, you didn't ask about our dividend. But don't feel bad, because very few investors do call the old fashioned. But I believe strongly that dividends should always be a top of mind topic, especially for REITs, but frankly, for most equity investments, as I'm sure you all know, over the long term, the last 100 years, dividends have contributed about 1/3 of the S&P 500 total return, and that's despite the fact that the long term dividend yields of the S&P 500 has averaged under 2% over the last 30 years. Given a greater dividend yield of REITs dividends, of course, matter even more to read total returns as of yesterday's close, the trailing five year total return of the RMZ REIT index was 54% of which 27% was price return and 27% was dividend return. Over that site, same five year period, which I should note, started in the spring 2020 COVID drawdown for stocks. VICI has generated 138 percentage points of total return, of which 84 points come from price return and about 54 points come from dividend return. I will also note that during that same five year period, the S&P 500 generated 106 percentage points of return, of which 91 points were price return and 15 points were dividend return. And as you can see, over that five year period, dividends were a major factor in VICI outperformed the S&P 500 by a margin of over 30 percentage points, or by about 30% over the last year two. Especially given the mag seven dominance of investor mind and market share, dividends didn't get a lot of attention, but it's been interesting in recent weeks, amidst the volatility of both equity and credit markets, to see dividends being talked about again. One of my favorite readings each week is Michael Hartnett's weekly flow show bulletin, which tends to come out late Thursday evening, early Friday morning, in the April 11 bulletin, in this admittedly, admittedly cryptic way, Michael made the following points, and I quote on portfolios, we say a own credit, eg, long dated, high quality, US corporate bonds, many yielding five to 6% B on equity income. 71 companies within the S&P 500 have a dividend yield greater than 4% 41 have a dividend yield greater than 5% buy stocks that can defend dividend unquote. Did you get that is you get Michael's point that as of his writing on April 11, only 71 companies in the S&P 500 had dividend yields about 4% and only 41 had dividends above 5% what's notable about those dividend yields, especially the greater than 5% dividend yield, is that those yields are comfortably above the current rate of inflation, and then thus generate a meaningful real return in a world where real return matters as much as ever. As a fellow VC stockholder, it gladdens me to point out that as an S&P 500 stock, VC currently offers a dividend yield greater than 5% and we believe that that dividend yield is, to paraphrase Michael Hartnett, a defended dividend. In the coming weeks and months, equity market volatility may die down or it may not. Who really knows, but whether market volatility dies down or not, a well defended dividend can, and I believe likely will be a significant contributor to total return for the market as a whole and for VC and its stockholders, everything we do at VC is ultimately about total return in all of its key components. And so now I'll turn the call over to John and David, who will talk further about what we're doing to drive total return over the near and long term through our growth activities and through balance sheet and cost of capital optimization. John?
John Payne : Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. VICI is very proud of our core ability to develop relationships and convert them into valuable long term investment partnerships. Not only were we able to successfully do this with Kane and Eldridge teams in connection with one Beverly Hills earlier in the first quarter, but subsequent quarter and we closed our first transaction in partnership with Red Rock resorts, connected to the development of a casino on tribal land in central California, as announced in our earnings release last night, on April 4, Bucha committed up to $510 million of a delayed draw term loan facility for the development of the North Fork Mono Casino and Resort, which will be developed and managed by Red Rock resorts. Red Rock is a premier gaming development and management company that operates productive assets in attractive geographies, and they developed over $9 billion of regional gaming and entertainment destinations. They are also an established leader in Native American gaming. Have developed and manage tribal casinos for over 20 years. Red Rock broke ground on the North Fork project in September 2024 and expects it to be completed by September of 2026 Upon completion, the casino is expected to feature 2400 slot machines, 40 table games, two restaurants, three bars, a food hall and a small retail offering the 305 acre site located in Madera, California, directly adjacent to highway 99 where 4.2 million people live within a two hour drive of the North Oak site. This transaction established a formal relationship between Vichy and Red Rock and represent Red Rocks first partnership with a REIT for Vichy. It represents our first gaming investment on tribal land and our second investment on tribal land overall, with the first being our Great Wolf Northeast loan announced in February of 2023 lending on tribal land in partnership with a high quality gaming operator in Red Rock demonstrates beaches ability to drive high quality opportunities for continued investment in the gaming sector. Another benefit of VICI relationship based approach is that it fosters close communication with each of our tenants. Having just 13 tenants and eight financing partners on our roster allows us to maintain consistent and frequent dialog with all of them, which is particularly advantageous during this volatile times such as these. We believe this level of communication, coupled with the monthly financial reporting received from the majority of our tenants, provides VICI with strong oversight of our portfolio, looking across our portfolio, we continue to be big believers in Las Vegas, as there are just so many unique demand drivers that continue to fuel the city's activity. For example, over the Easter weekend, Las Vegas hosted WWE WrestleMania at Allegiant Stadium, drawing nearly 125,000 fans and marking the largest gate for any event in WWE history, T mobile arena is also hosted, as recently hosted packed houses for Stanley Cup playoff games, and the musical talent at the sphere remains a compelling draw for the city. Additionally, during the first quarter, 10s of 1000s of guest attending conferences hosted by companies like Home Depot and Adobe, flooded the city with activity, while a potential international travel slowdown has come into question, we would note that only 12% of Las Vegas visitation in 2024 was from international travel, travelers. It is also possible Las Vegas may benefit from a domestic trade down effect if Americans forego international destinations in regional gaming, we continue to monitor the landscape, and based on prior periods of heightened market volatility, we expect performance to be relatively resilient. Property Performance will vary based on geography and asset. And at VICI, we focus on working with our tenants so they feel positioned to continue to successfully operate the properties we own. Like I said, partnership is at the core of what we do. It is one of the key factors underlying our success in building this company as it drives current and future opportunities and allows our team to consistently seek to create value for our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John, it's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time, starting with our Q1 capital markets activity and balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we very successfully addressed all of our 2025 maturities, and now we have no debt maturing until September of 2026 on March 26 we priced our bond offering, and at its peak, our order book was six times oversubscribed. We issue $400 million of three year notes at a coupon of 4.75% $900 million of 10 year notes at a coupon of 5.625% or a blended coupon of 5.34% including the impact of our hedging program. During the quarter, we also sold 7.8 million shares, raising 250 4 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward and as I mentioned on our last call in February, we recast our $2.5 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility and extended the maturity until 2029 providing us additional duration and an ample source of liquidity. We have approximately 3.2 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately 330, 4 million in cash, 620, 5 million under our standing forwards and 2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.3 times within our target leverage range of five to five and a half taking into account our recent bond refinancing activity, we have a weighted average interest rate of 4.47% as adjusted to account for our hedge activity, and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity, our proactive risk management of our cost of capital, of our balance sheet and of our liquidity profile through volatile markets, allows our team to stay focused on building relationships and our investment pipeline. This allows VICI to continue pursuing our sustained and sustainable return goals for our shareholders without having to go pencils down for any period of time. Just touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.58 cents for the quarter, an increase of 4.3% compared to $0.56 cents to the quarter ended March, 31 2024 our results once again, highlight. Our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $14.9 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, was only 1.5% which continues to be one of the lowest ratios, and not only the triple net sector, but across all leads. Turning to guidance. And as we noted in our release last night, we are raising our AFFO guidance for 2025 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis, AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025 is now expected to be between $2.47 billion $2.5 billion, or between $2.33 and $2.36 per diluted common share, compared to our prior AFFO per share per share guidance of $2.32, to $2.35 the raise represents an increase of a penny at both ends of the range. Based on the midpoint of our increased 2025 guidance, VICI now expects to deliver year over year, AFFO per share growth of 3.8%. Just as a reminder, our AFFO guidance, excuse me, does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income for many loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets, activity or other non-recurring transactions or items. With that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Sacra from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sacra : I guess I wanted to focus on the newest deal and maybe just get a little bit more color on, you know, kind of the, I guess, the draw of the property given the location, you know, it's reasonably far from, say, the Bay Area. I heard, I think, John's comments about the local population, but I guess, is it fair to assume that you're, you know, this resort is really being designed to just tapped at Central California market. Do you expect other kind of draws into the area? You know, just trying to get a better feel for kind of what's going to attract people there. And then secondly, given that it's on Indian land, how does the collateral work to the extent something doesn't work out? I don't think you can own, you know, property on casino land. So just trying to understand sort of the protections VICI has in the lending structure.
John Payne: Steve, John Payne, talking. Nice to talk to you this morning, we spent a lot of time over the years. First, we'll start with getting to know the operator of the business, Red Rock resorts. This first opportunity to work with them, but we've known them for years. We've followed what they've done in Las Vegas. We've watched their development, most recently, the Durango facility that's being built and is already being expanded. So we've been incredibly impressed with the way they operate their businesses, the way they run the facilities. And obviously you could argue they are the best developers in the gaming space. They've been working on this facility with the nation for over, I believe, over 20 years, and have studied how successful this can be. The catchment area, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is, is large, and I do think there is, what we've seen, is there the last move or advantage or new business can attract new customers and steal customers from others, particularly when you have a great operator who understands the way understands customers the way that Red Rock does, so we were very excited to work this opportunity and to announce this first deal with Red Rock. I'll turn it over to David here, who worked on a lot of the details of this deal. Yeah, Steve, good to talk to you. And just in terms of location, and the location is phenomenal, as John mentioned in his comments, is right off the highway 99 you know, four and a half million people go by the site. The competition in the area is, will be far, is far inferior to the quality of the build the Red Rock is developing here, and the draw that this facility will have in the area. And it's just in terms of, you know, other ways that we got comfortable with it this and this Red Rock went out to raise this capital, and we participated in the syndicate of large money center banks. So, you know, the total loan 725 million, were 510 million of that commitment and just given Red Rocks experience, as John alluded to, there is a guarantee from Red Rocks to complete the project, and we felt really good about stepping in and developing a relationship with Red Rock, who is just one of the best developers out there in gaming as well as travel gaming facilities.
Operator: The next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: I was just curious. You know if your view on tribal sale leaseback has changed at all? Obviously, you've done a lot of work on it, and this deal brings you a little bit closer, not quite there yet. So thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, I'll start and John and David can add in tribal tail lease backs continue to be for us, a complex subject we haven't entirely figured out. You know, [indiscernible] was right to ask about the collateral on a lending package of a casino on tribal land, but especially with the involvement of Red Rock, we have a high level of confidence that the asset can perform and that our collateral is good, and it's obviously in the interest of the tribe that Red Rock be able to operate the property successfully, and that our loan eventually be able to be paid off when it comes to a sale lease back, I would say we still haven't exactly figured out if we can get comfortable with the nuances of owning property on a tribal land, given the fact, as Steve alluded to, in the event of any kind of default, we As the owner of the building, would not have the right or the opportunity to operate the gaming, which is obviously the economic engine of the asset. So I would say at this point, we are still very much in a learning phase, but very, very glad to be to be partnering with the tribe and with Red Rock in this opportunity. David or John, anything you want to add?
John Payne: No, you covered it all.
Barry Jonas: Great. And then, just as a follow up, you know, given the macro environment, I'm just curious if you're seeing tariffs impact any of your partners in terms of their construction budgets or timing. You know, any impact to maybe draw on top schedules or else future discussions for pipeline? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, no, it's a very good question. Barry, and you know, as a general principle, there are obviously general conditions across the construction landscape. And you know when it when it comes to dental conditions you really want to be able to understand. Are you partnering with a development company that is very experienced in development, through thick and thin, or are you partnering with an operator with a deep and successful track record of development? So whether it's Kane at one Beverly Hills, which is a dedicated development company, or Red Rock, which is an operating company with a very proven track record as a developer, as John pointed out, a $9 billion development track record. We're very confident in their ability to manage the variability associated with tariffs, and in particular, get in front of them. And David has been very close to Kane as it's gone through the planning and costing of this project on every land they call her on how resourceful and anticipatory they have been when it comes to the whole tariff.
David Kieske: Yeah, they're obviously understanding the magnitude of what they're building, getting ahead of the tariffs, as best they possibly as best as they possibly can. Even developing hedging strategies around being a little bit kind of groundbreaking, around hedging potential future purchases, around raw materials, but knowing that they have the right contingency and the right development experience in place to ultimately get this bill gives us comfort.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan
Anthony Paolone: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about what the pipeline has looked like lately in the face of just the macro volatility, and whether there have been any changes in the types of things that you're seeing, types of deals that folks want to do or don't want to do, geography so forth.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, I'll turn it over to John in a moment here Tony, but you know, I feel a little bit like we're living in Groundhog Day, because I think at beachy, we've been talking about volatility for a while now, and one could say, Vici are ever going to stop talking about volatility? Going to see. Should have been a reality of our life now for at least a couple of years. And I think we would be foolhardy to have a house view at BG that is going to die down anytime soon. It certainly affects, I think, on a most fundamental level, Tony. It certainly affects animal spirits around M and A, and the growth ambitions that usually drive M and A, I would say, across the gaming spectrum and narrowly and the experiential spectrum more broadly, these volatile conditions and the uncertainty around both economic conditions and capital financing conditions have somewhat diminished. Animal spirits around growth and growth by operators is, we believe, the biggest driver of the demand for our kind of capital, and the role our capital can play in operators, either developing new assets or through M&A, growing their store count, and having summarized sort of the general conditions. I'll turn it over to John for more specific color.
John Payne: Well, Tony, Ed answered that very well. Really, quarter to quarter, things don't change that quickly in the spaces that we look at is my opening remarks talked a lot about relationship based approach, and my colleagues are always tired of me saying, you don't do a deal at the first lunch. So we continue to spend time with operators, not only in gaming, but in other forms of experiential we educate them on our how our capital can work. And you know, we continue to see if there's opportunities where we can be valuable during this time, ensuring that it's accretive for us and valuable to them.
Anthony Paolone: Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow up on the guidance, how much in committed capital for various projects and loans, etc, is not in the guide, because there's not a draw schedule just wondering, like, how much, like, you kind of have, but just didn't put in at this point.
Ed Pitoniak: In the guidance Tony it's about 130 million of committed capital I'd have to get back to you outside of that, I just kind of know what's that, and that comprises finishing up Great Wolf, Northeast Homefield, Kalahari also starting up, as well as, obviously, the North Fork investment that we just announced. I think Tony, it would be fair to say a lot, but we will come back to you with a more precise answer than a lot is outside.
Operator: Next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: First, maybe a follow up on that last question, and congrats on the new relationship with Red Rocks. Can you give any details on why you think they came to you for development funding? I think you mentioned that it is part of a larger syndicate. And then, do you have any insight on how the timing of the funding could play out, which, again, I feel like is what just was asked. And maybe the answer is no, but confirming
John Payne: Caitlin, it's John, I'll start and then turn it over to David. That seems the rhythm of this call right now. But look, we have, we have followed with great respect, I guess, of the Red Rock since we started the company, even before my time, when I was a former casino operator for 23 years, I watched Red Rock and watch what they they've operated, and really watch what they've developed. So as then I started the company, back in 2017 he asked me the companies that I had great respect with and one of them was obviously Red Rocks, and went out and started to be build a relationship. It's it is started that far back, and there just hadn't been any opportunity for us to work together. And so as they, as we talked through the years about this opportunity coming to them, developing this opportunity, we obviously were in the loop from the start, and had a good conversation, and we're excited to be a part of it. And then Caitlin, in terms of just the funding cadence, this is a construction draw schedule, you know, we put an initial 75 million upon closing, but it'd be a little bit more regular cadence between now and, as John said, September 26 when it opens up. So we're excited about the ability to deploy capital on a consistent monthly basis.
David Kieske: I will just add Caitlin that for those who don't follow gaming our read and. Center read investors to understand Red Rock, you really need to understand and experience, moreover, the quality of what they build and the quality of their operation. I think John, it would be fair to say it is strip level quality, even when it is off strip as most of their assets, as all of their assets are. And if you were in Las Vegas, I think we highly encourage you to visit their assets, like the Red Rock sort of anchor in Summerlin, or their new asset, Durango, which is, as John says, very comparable to what you can expect them to be building with their partners involved for
Caitlin Burrows: Got it, and I know that there's limited detail you guys can give us on future, but I know that when you guys establish these relationships, it's not with the intent of doing a single deal. So considering that and all the development Red Rocks has done in the past, I'm wondering how you think about that future opportunity with them. Are you thinking it would be more development? Are there still lease back opportunities something else?
Ed Pitoniak: Okay, right now, there's no other opportunities. It's a one, one transaction with them. I think the question you're asking is, in the future, if Red Rock was growing their business? Would we be interested in helping them grow in a variety of ways, whether it was sell the real estate, whether it was another opportunity to develop the answer is absolutely yes for the right opportunity, and obviously it's got to be accretive for us and work for them. But I hope you hear from our remarks, we have tremendous respect for how they run their company, how they develop their projects, how they build partnerships with tribal nations. We really like all of that, but it's to be clear, this is one opportunity, and only one opportunity today, but we would hope or we would love the opportunity in the future, but no commitments.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Hightower from Barclays.
Richard Hightower: Thanks for taking the question here, just maybe a little more of the nuts and bolts on the tribal side and the deal with Red Rock. But just, just to be clear, Red Rocks, the borrower, the collateral package that VICI would have an interest in, it sounds like has really nothing to do with the land itself, but it really would be just the construction that sits on top of the land. Just help me understand kind of what that is, and you know a little more about the security of anything you know might ever go wrong. And obviously, you know, doesn't sound like it ever would. But just help us understand that. And then you know, secondly, it does sound like tribal lending. Is this, you know, much bigger opportunity than maybe any of us sort of appreciated, you know, sitting here 12 months ago, and just help us understand how that landscape has evolved and changed. You know, now that GLP eyes announced the deal you guys have now have announced, you know, this, this deal, you know, just help us understand the moving parts there as well.
David Kieske: Yeah, right, it's David, I'll start and then chime in the bar is actually the tribe north, north. Providing the construction guarantee, or completion guarantee, to get the project built, the oversight, the expertise that we talked about, that they bring to the table. And so the collateral is the building. But obviously we talked about in this call and other calls, you know, taking that back is very difficult, and given the fact that the tribe is the only entity that has the right to operate gaming so we've got Full Faith and Conviction around Red Rock and their buildings, the fact that they're putting up their they've put up their balance sheet to provide the initial funding, this loan will complete the funding. And as I mentioned, there's a whole host of money center banks that have come into the syndicate to provide the financing for the development here.
Samantha Gallagher: Yeah, just one other thing to add. This is Samantha, with respect to the collateral package, we also have a first priority security interest in the future cash flows and revenues from the gaming activities and answers, but includes, inclusive of the gaming, and that's an important port point. And also when we think about lending, tribal lending, versus a sale, lease back, it's also thinking about the LTV or the LTC, which is different than your percentage interest when you're looking at what your quote, unquote collateral, when you already own the building and can operate. And so we view them as different when you think about where we are on the risk spectrum. And I think when you're COVID, when you reduce it all to -- was just going to say, when you reduce it all, go ahead. Yeah. This is all. This is all dependent on it, ultimately operating successfully. And again, the involvement of a proven operating partner, proven. Across the gaming landscape, broadly, but specifically in tribal gaming, and specifically in California, gives us a lot of comfort. And I really would not minimize the importance of that completion guarantee either from Red Rock.
Richard Hightower: Okay. And then I guess the second part of the question just, you know, maybe more broadly about the tribal lending landscape, and, you know, maybe help me understand too, if there were other traditional lending sources for a lot of these projects historically, you know, what has other than pricing, you know, maybe there's more to it. You know, what has caused the reach, you know, to kind of have an opening in the way that we've seen in the last, you know, few quarters here.
Ed Pitoniak: It's definitely something we continue to look at, Rich. I'm not here to say that there's, you know, 20 opportunities out there, but it's definitely a part of our business that we're studying better understanding, as Ed just walked you through, not all deals are the same. Not all deals have an operator, like Red Rocks running it, but it's something that we're looking at. I don't think you should say this is something the REITs have been looking at just the past two quarters. I think you're what you should know is, at least from a Vici perspective, these are things that we study for years, and it doesn't mean that it shows up and we looked at it for three months. So this is something we've been studying for years. There have been others that have been involved, been involved in this type of lending over the decades that tribal casinos have been developed all over the United States, but it's something that this particular opportunity was one we were quite excited about. And obviously we announced, announced that investment here over the past coming days.
John Payne: You know, just to kind of reiterate what I said to Tony, Rich, you know, growth creates a demand for capital. And you know, as you look across the US gaming landscape, California is still a relatively young gaming jurisdiction. I think John gaming has been in California now for maybe 28 years, and it is only tribal gaming in California, so there is still white space on the California gaming map. Tribes are gaining the opportunities to put new stores onto that map, and that's creating a need for capital they don't necessarily see everywhere else in the country at this point.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's [indiscernible] you could touch on your expectations for the century casino lease. I know it's a small part of rents overall, but do you feel comfortable that the recent CapEx investments that those properties will help improve coverage?
Ed Pitoniak: Very good question. And I'm smiling here because we had part of our organization in the assets, actually, two days ago, visiting the assets, visiting with the teams, looking at the new construction, looking at the new casino that was put in place, and talking about the great numbers that are coming out of there in my opening remarks. You know, one of the things that's great about beachy and the way that we're structured is that we have constant communication with our operator. We also get, for the majority of our operators, we get monthly results. We have conversations with them about how the business is working, how they think about capital. So a century is one of them, but you'd expect, are you? I think you'd hope that we're having conversations with our large operators and MGM or Hard Rock or others that that we have assets with. But it is exciting to see the new development we helped finance really take off down in the Missouri, Missouri properties, and we'll continue to see if there's ways, over time, we can put money to work with, with Century, as well as with some of our other operators.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. And then I guess just one other partner you, you didn't mention there was Caesars. And obviously we've received some questions on the regional casinos, and I know there's 10 years remaining on that lease, but you know, how are those conversations going? If they are, you know, just given current coverage.
John Payne: Yeah, Nick, good to hear from you. I wouldn't say there's any burning conversations of any kind between us and seizures around. A regional Property Performance, we obviously continue to be pleased at the magnitude of capital that seizures has been and continues to invest in our assets, both on the Las Vegas Strip and in the regions. You are obviously seeing, we are seeing the benefits in real time of the 300 odd million they put into New Orleans, John, obviously, a couple 100 million into Atlantic City, the recent announcement of 160 million of their capital into Lake Tahoe, we think, is pretty strong evidence of Caesar's willingness to continue to invest in these properties and drive this kind of performance, that ultimately should lead to rank coverage we're all happy and satisfied with.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz: So with respect to the Red Rock arrangement, I don't know if you're able to sort of characterize what the capital structure you know of that property is, you know, setting up to be and or, you know, any comments around pricing you know, on the loan that that may be helpful, and as a part of that, you know, bigger picture, you know, how you look at, you know, opportunities and the risk profile of them, you know, relative to sort of where you were, 123, years ago. Is it, you know, still the same. And, you know, is there some progression in kind of risk profile as you look at stuff today? Thanks.
David Kieske: Good to talk to you. Let's start with the loan. You know, as we talked about the 720, 5 million odd total facility comprised of two term loans, Term Loan A and Term Loan B are blended all in yield is so for right around seven that includes some incremental fees and whatnot, on the capital that we committed the 720, $5 million away draw term loan will be, will be the development funding for The project, and then we are comfortable with the capitalization and the support that's coming from Red Rock and their expertise around getting this open and really the location. And you look at the competing product in the area, it's far, far inferior to what the Durango esque style facility that will be built here in the dairy California. And in terms of our risk appetite, I think we continue as we talk about it, VICI, we have a table of learning. We continue to learn internally and study different opportunities. And as we've noted on this call, we've looked at tribal for years and partnering with the right operator in the right location, and doing things with the right guarantees and right structure we get comfortable with that and the ultimate return that we earn on that capital that we deploy. So, you know, I think we spend a lot of time ensuring that we put our capital out in ways that make sense. And as I talked about protecting the dividend, but also ensuring that we get that capital repay.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, and I'll just add David that you know it investing in any category, but in particularly in our investment category, general principles only take you so far, and so any kind of general principles we might hold about tribal gaming are just not that useful in us ultimately making investment decisions, and we make investment decisions based entirely on specifics, not generalities. And the specifics of this investment opportunity were very compelling the involvement of a highly proven, highly successful developer, then also happens to be a highly proven and highly successful operator. Those specifics were incredibly important to making this particular decision, and any future decisions we might make, whether around tribal or commercial, will always again be made on the specifics.
Operator: The next question comes from [indiscernible] from Mizuho.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, good morning. I guess I'm curious if we should also be reading into the Red Rock construction loan that perhaps you'd be more comfortable being a construction lender more broadly, under the right circumstances and with the right partners. So perhaps can you talk about your appetite and doing more of that type of loan activity going forward, and also some thoughts on the underwriting of the loan and the required return that you have there. Thanks?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, I would really reiterate what I just said in response to David, that it would be, it will always be highly specific. We do not have a general strategy around construction funding. We have a general strategy around relation develop, relationship development and identifying experiential partners we would like to have a relationship with and grow over time. And if helping them finance a development opportunity is the way to start the relationship, we will certainly look at that energetically and yet rigorously. And you can see in both the cane and the Red Rock situation, we are being driven by the opportunity to establish relationships, and not really specifically being driven by a desire to become a construction financier.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate that, and maybe a follow up here, just speaking of relationships, curious, if there any room for opportunities with any of your other partnerships that could be attractive to you here? Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: I didn't hear exactly the question, but I think that it was, are there opportunities to grow with our current set of 13 tenants and eight financing partners? The answer I'll give you is, I hope so. I think that's always been the way we have talked about this and why we don't have 100 tenants right now. We have 13, and I'm sure over time, they'll go to 14, 15, 16, but part of our strategy that we we've talked about since we started the company, was to find the best in the business and help them grow over time, while also adding new tenants as well as New financing partners to grow the business accretively.
Operator: Next question comes from Daniel Guilherme from Capital One Securities.
Daniel Guilherme: Thank you for taking my questions. The March and April trend commentary for your big public partners in Las Vegas have has been very positive this earnings. Can you give us a sense if you're hearing the same things from the non-public partners on the strip? So I guess the Venetian Complex [ph] and then maybe Fountain Blue investment book.
Ed Pitoniak: We're very excited. Nice to talk to you, Daniel. We were very excited. Obviously, we see some of the numbers before they become public at times, and we're very excited to see Las Vegas continue to be quite successful and growing. As you heard in my comments. We like Vegas so much because there's so many different what I call cash registers for and reasons for consumers to come to the city. MGM and Caesars were talking about their business. The Venetian has a robust business. I was just out there myself, and I know Ed was as well, enjoying our time at the sphere and watching how that brings in a whole bunch of new consumers to not only the Venetian but really brings a new consumer set to Las Vegas, which is great to have a city like that. So Daniel, the answer is, Vegas seems to be continuing to have to have a very good run. Part of that the credit goes to the operators, because they continue to find different ways to attract not only their existing customers, but new customers. And there's no better group than the group that runs Las Vegas. So we're excited to be so invested there and owning those assets, because I know that the people who do will continue to find ways, no matter what the economic conditions are to grow their business.
Daniel Guilherme: Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And I did like your point on the potential trade down more people to Las Vegas, and then on the second one. So you all have a wide range of partners. Sean, I think you mentioned 21 both big and small with very different risk characteristics. And given the confusing macro, can you just talk about the team's approach to risk, and if there's a formal risk process in place to flag and work through any issues that you see developing over the next few years? Thank you.
Gabriel Wasserman: Yeah. Hey, Dan, it's Gabe Watson here. I can take the first part of that question, and others can weigh in as well. But you know, since we founded the company in 2017 we've had a pretty rigorous risk management process. We meet as a management team every quarter. There's two separate meetings. One is to go over the performance of our tenants and our tenants and the lease investment. Programs, and there's a separate meeting to go over our borrowers and the performance of our loan investment. So as a management team, a lot of visibility into the performance of our investments and a lot of discussions and rigorous underwriting and monitoring.
Operator: The next question is from Ronald Camden and Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Jenny in for Ron. Thanks for taking my question. I think my first ones regarding the Caesars Forum Convention Center call options you have later this year, what is your latest thoughts on the deal? And if you would like to exercise on that?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, very good question. That call becomes live here later in the fall. It's September of this year. I don't have the exact date, but I believe it's late September of this year. I think your question is, do we like the asset? Is it a beautiful asset? How is it performing? It is something that we'll continue to evaluate as that time comes. Caesar's built in just a beautiful place and is using it effectively, as I my last comments of driving new business and new meeting business there. So we are aware of that opportunity. We've got a window that's quite wide, and we'll study the opportunity that when it comes.
John Payne: I'll just Jenny, I just going say, before you ask your second question, that our decision making is always guided by solving for total return, as I, as I spoke of in my opening remarks, and as we look at the building blocks of our total return, those building blocks are dividend yield, same store, NOI levered into AFO per share, and then external growth. And we try to optimize our timing around any kind of opportunities like that, such that we are solving fundamentally for sustained and sustainable, superior total return. So that really is the calculus that guides so much of our decision making around not only what we invest in, but when we invest in it.
Unidentified Analyst: Makes sense. I think the second one is regarding the strategic relationship with K International. I'm just curious if there's any incremental conversation this quarter we've done, like, what other kind of experiential investment opportunities are you looking to pursue together beyond the Beverly Hills project?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, well, there they are involved in a lot of experiential categories we are fundamentally interested in, and I will just say one example, and that is their investment in a facility called the St James, which is just outside of Washington, DC, and is very much like Chelsea Pierce. They've been very open and energetic about their growth ambitions for the St James as ultimately a network of facilities across the country, and we've enjoyed very much the conversations we've had on, I must emphasize a very preliminary basis on how we might ever be of service to them in growing that network.
Operator: The next question comes from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. [Indiscernible] recently had a deal with star in Australia. You guys have interest in participating in that, or maybe in Australia more broadly.
Ed Pitoniak: If you've been following us for a while, David and I spent some time down under About two years ago, visiting Australia and New Zealand and understanding the landscape, obviously the market in Australia, particularly where the assets are for the star has gone through radical change, not only structure, balance sheet, structural issues, but the regulators and the regulations of those businesses have changed and have had a real put, a real hurt, I guess, is the best way on the business right now. I think your question was, would we be involved in an opportunity with the star in laws in Australia? The answer is no.
John Payne: Sorry, Max, I was just going to add really one key predicate for any investment we ever make is having as high a degree of visibility and confidence around what the future earnings profile of a given asset will be. And right now, given the turmoil on the in the regulatory landscape and its impact on the economic performance of gaming assets in Australia, it is very difficult to have any visibility or confidence around what kind of money these assets are going to make over the longer term.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you for that, and maybe zoom out and take it at a higher level, other than economics and accretion, could you talk about some of your top strategic priorities in your current opportunity set, whether that might be tenant diversification, geographic diversification, or maybe something else?
Ed Pitoniak: You know, I would say there's really a couple of key result areas we really focus on. I've already talked about, obviously, our ceaseless dedication to building total return on a sustained and sustainable basis. But as well, it's obviously doing what we can, all we can, to weatherproof the business as best we can. No business is obviously ever absolutely weather proof. But I am so glad and so proud of the work David and the team did, for example, in getting the refinancing done when we got it done, and against this backdrop of volatility and low visibility, a paramount focus of management will continue to be being highly anticipatory of what is potentially coming, and being as ready for it as we can and Protecting our capital and the cost of our capital,
Operator: Our final question today comes from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one for me. There was some news regarding New York gaming, I'm curious what your latest thoughts on the New York gaming license processes and what VICI will be doing from now till decisions ultimately made.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, exciting, exciting times and some of the news that's out there. By no means am I going to predict when a license will be granted or the three licenses will be granted. It does seem like there's momentum moving for the RFPs to be put in by the end of June, early July. I think you know that one of the bidders is going to be MGM at the site that we own, the real estate in the buildings. There are other very exciting opportunities that are in the news that could win one of the licenses. But we are standing by better understanding the circumstances. Obviously, we're a big fan of the MGM bid, simply because the asset is one that is ours, and we would hope that we would help our current tenant and MGM grow that should they win one of the three licenses. So like you will continue to watch and continue to read the paper and better understand as it gets closer you
Operator: I will now hand the floor back to Ed for some closing comments.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. So we know that all of you, whether your analysts or investors, are incredibly stretched in right now given the volume that companies reporting. So we cannot express deeply enough our thanks for your time and attention this morning and your continued support and bye for now.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 21, 2025. I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, Operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the investor section of the VICI Properties website, viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects, or other similar phrases and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, our supplemental information, and our other filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and William McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Over the course of the next few minutes leading into our Q&A session, you'll hear from John Payne on our growth activities, and you'll hear from David Kieske on our financial results, financing activities, and initial 2025 earnings guidance. I'll start the call with a few words about the announcement we made Wednesday morning, initiating a new VICI strategic and financial relationship with Cain International and Eldridge Industries through an initial investment in the financing of the One Beverly Hills development. Like most of VICI's growth activities, this VICI investment is a result of our growing and new relationship. This relationship began last May when on a trip to London, I spent time with Jonathan Goldstein, the founding CEO of Cain International, a diversified global real estate development and investment company. By the end of our hour, Jonathan and I agreed that we should find ways to work together. Our urge to work together grew out of the recognition that we share convictions, and we share values. We share conviction in the secular strength for years to come, of experiences. We share cultural and ethical values around partnership. Put another way, the meeting of Cain and VICI is a meeting of minds, and a meeting of ambitions, particularly the shared ambition to invest in differentiated place-based experiences, whether those experiences are entertainment, hospitality, wellness, or sport-based. Excuse me. For those of you not familiar with Cain, which as of year-end 2024 had nearly $18 billion in assets under management, it was founded in 2014 by Jonathan and his partner, Todd Boehly, and it's affiliated with Eldridge Industries, an investment company founded and led by Todd Boehly. Cain and Eldridge have made investments in iconic experiential brands that include Aman, Delano, St. James Sports Clubs, Cirque du Soleil, and Flexjet. Todd is an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Lakers, and both Todd and Jonathan are owners of Chelsea FC in the English Premier League. As 2024 went by, Jonathan asked if the development at One Beverly Hills might be our first opportunity to work together. These discussions enabled Cain, Eldridge, and VICI to get to know each other better, and over the last few months, we all came to believe that our shared conviction around place-based experiences could yield as many compelling opportunities to work together in the years to come. And that's why, as well as announcing our One Beverly Hills investment on Wednesday, Cain, Eldridge, and VICI also announced our joint signing of a letter of intent expressing our intention to work collaboratively to identify and pursue experiential investment opportunities that meet our respective investment objectives. As you would have seen if you reviewed the investment deck we posted to our website, One Beverly Hills stands to rank among the most compelling American luxury hospitality, retail, and residential developments in recent history. The development is currently rising out of over 17.5 of the best-located acres in Beverly Hills, a triangle bordered by Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and the LA Country Club. This development is centered on the Aman brand, among the world's most venerated luxury hospitality brands. One Beverly Hills will be the largest realization of Aman-branded hospitality, wellness, and living to date with an Aman hotel, an Aman wellness spa, an Aman Club, and two Aman residential towers. The development will also include a full renovation of the legendary Beverly Hilton, longtime host site of the Golden Globes and the Milken Conference, as well as ten acres of botanical gardens and open space with high-end retail and dining offerings. Capital is a key fuel for ambitious placemakers and experience creators. Cain stands among the most ambitious placemakers we have come to know, and yet Cain balances that ambition with what we've seen to be strong capability in development risk management. We believe multi-generational, multinational demand for the differentiated experience within the differentiated place will create abundant opportunities for Cain and Eldridge in the coming decades, and we're excited about the prospect of becoming a long-term partner in their growth. This announcement of our new partnership with Cain and Eldridge represents our first new venture in what we hope will be a year of new investment ventures in both gaming and non-gaming. For more on that, I'll now turn the call over to John.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. I'll start by reiterating Ed's enthusiasm around the new strategic relationship we formed with Cain and Eldridge. As we said time and time again, deep relationships are at the core of VICI's investment strategy. Through the development of a new relationship with Homefield Kansas City and the strength of existing relationships with Great Wolf and the team from Venetian, we were able to commit approximately $1.1 billion of capital in 2024 at an initial yield of 8.1%. The quality and scale of our existing portfolio also accrues to the value of our platform. Since our last earnings call in early November, the VICI team attended the NAREIT conference in Las Vegas. The conference provided a great opportunity to physically showcase our Las Vegas Strip assets and convey the incredible scale of operation happening at these properties every single day. For example, the Venetian, to which we committed up to $700 million in 2024 through our partner property growth fund strategy, sprawls over 17 million square feet. It is being proactively reimagined across several business verticals, including convention, food and beverage, hotel rooms, gaming floor optimization, entertainment, and more to drive the continued growth of the operating business, as well as capitalize on the Sphere, which sits behind the Venetian. In R.J. Milligan's NAREIT recap note, he observed that, I quote, "With all the events in and around Las Vegas, it was hard to ignore the quality of VICI's real estate, which we don't think the market is giving them enough credit for. It's just so hard to comprehend that VICI was able to purchase the Venetian at the same cap rate as a well-located Dollar General." Well stated, RJ. Las Vegas tourism also continues to hit records. According to the LVCVA, 2024 saw record airline passengers through Harry Reid Airport at 58 million for the year, and visitation to the city increased 2% year-over-year to approximately 42 million. Our operating partners are reinventing experiences at our assets to capitalize on demand. For example, MGM Grand recently announced a $300 million remodel of all of their 4,200 hotel rooms, to be completed in December of 2025, and launched their Palm Tree Beach Club outdoor music and entertainment venue, which will open in May of 2025. Caesars New Orleans just opened following a comprehensive $435 million renovation, and the property hosted many Super Bowl fillers a couple of weeks ago. And in November of last year, Harvey's Lake Tahoe also announced a $100 million all-encompassing transformational project. Just since the fourth quarter, our operators have announced nearly $1 billion of investment in our real estate. That is reflective of our shared conviction around the value of high-quality experiences at high-quality properties. VICI believes that the quality and scale of investment opportunity in our existing properties, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain deep relationships with our partners, will provide springboards for future growth. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Let's start with our balance sheet. As we begin 2025, seven years after our IPO in 2018, I want to highlight 2024 and reflect on how far our balance sheet has come since going way back to our pre-emergence in the summer of 2017. VICI had total leverage of roughly 10.5 times debt to EBITDA. We were born with a very unnatural balance sheet early on, with short tenure, secured debt, second lien debt, and a $1.6 billion CMBS loan that matured in 2022, all instruments that we knew were not consistent with becoming the blue chip we knew we should and could become. After we emerged in October of 2017, we got to work on fixing our balance sheet. We started to chip away at the second lien notes with our IPO and retired the remaining $498 million in February 2020. In connection with the Eldorado Caesars merger, we retired the CMBS debt. With our acquisition of MGP, we were able to retire all of our remaining secured debt and received an investment-grade credit rating from S&P and Fitch in April of 2022. We were once regular at that time with Moody's. Through the leadership of Aaron Ferri and our team, we put our heads down and worked with Moody's over the next two years to educate them on American gaming, the resiliency of our tenants' business, and the quality of our balance sheet. That work paid off with the Moody's upgrade we received on November 18, 2024, giving us an investment-grade credit rating across all three agencies. The ratings upgrade should accrue to our benefit with improved access to and cost of capital over time. We believe our balance sheet and unsecured debt complex is one of the more liquid debt complexes across the REIT landscape, with total debt of $17.1 billion, of which we have unsecured debt of $14.1 billion. This creates liquidity in our unsecured notes. We saw this in our December refinancing, where we had several new institutional credit investors coming to our offering. The quality of our balance sheet was also highlighted during our recent recast of our unsecured revolving credit facility, which we closed subsequent to quarter-end with a new $2.5 billion facility. We had strong sponsorship from our bank group and want to thank each and every institution that committed to that facility and the conviction they all have in our balance sheet and business. We have approximately $3.3 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $525 million in cash, $176 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.4 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to annualized fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.3 times, within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.41%, taking into account our hedge portfolio, and a weighted average of 6.4 years to maturity. Again, thank you to Aaron and the entire team for the work that has been completed. But know that we are not done, with a continual focus on improving our balance sheet. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 3.6% compared to $0.55 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. For the full year 2024, AFFO per share was $2.26, an increase of 5.1% compared to $2.15 for the full year 2023. Our results highlight our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $20.7 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, was only 2.1%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs. Turning to guidance, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2025 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per-share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025, is expected to be between $2.485 billion and $2.555 billion, or between $2.32 and $2.35 per diluted common share. With 2025 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 3.3%, a very solid starting point as we begin 2025. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact of operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions or items. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on the telephone keypad. Our first question for today comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. I guess my first question is, from our side, we obviously just see the things that you close. But just wondering if you could talk about kinda what deal flow looked like in 2024 and what it looks like currently in contrast to maybe in prior years, you know, whether you're seeing a lot of stuff and it's just not making it past the finish line or you're not seeing as much as you'd like in terms of the outright property purchases. And so any color there would be great.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. I'll start, Tony, and then I'll turn it over to John. You know, 2024 for us was a year in which we did not see anything resembling a plentiful flow of compelling high-quality real estate acquisition opportunities. We did see a very compelling opportunity to further invest in one of our marquee properties, the Venetian. And what we also saw is that while high-quality existing assets don't appear to be widely for sale, or at least didn't in 2024, highly compelling high-quality developments were there. And a lot of the work we've done, you know, whether with HomeField at the very beginning of the year, whether our ongoing work with Great Wolf, our ongoing work with Canyon Ranch and Cabot, and now our new work with Cain and Eldridge is about identifying and providing capital to great experiential placemakers and getting very, very good yields on it, especially when comparing those yields to the incredibly high quality of the developments we're helping to fund. And beyond that, I'll turn it over to John. He can give you further color on what we saw in 2024, but maybe more importantly, what we believe we will see in 2025. John?
John Payne: Yes. A little bit, Ed. Tony, good to talk to you this morning. One of the parts of your question was how does it compare to years before. Remember when you started the company, David walked through some of that history. We were simply a casino triple net lease REIT. Today, with Ed's announcement and our announcement the other day, you can see we continue to diversify our portfolio. So the funnel continues to get wider of things that we look at. And I would say the beginning of 2025, I moved as busier than I've been in a very long time. And we continue to be very thoughtful with where we put our capital to work, the type of partners that we want to do business with, the type of growth potential. So that's a long way of saying we're quite busy. The funnel's wide. We're looking at a variety of things in the experiential and the casino gaming space.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Any comments on where you think cash yields would be right now for some of the various buckets that you're looking at, whether it would be, you know, where a high-quality asset on the strip might be versus regional versus some of the other categories?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. Not a lot of visibility into that, Tony, on the strip. We haven't seen any meaningful trades recently on the strip. And I think with the volatility that we've seen in the ten-year over, well, what are we now? The last three years, and this year has not really represented a meaningful change from that volatility. I think it's really a little bit hard to get pricing certainty on permanent assets. Whether on the strip. Regional, I think there's been more trading activity, John. So there's probably somewhat more clarity there. Though, again, quality for us is a key consideration.
John Payne: And remember on the strip, Tony, the world's pretty good out there. I'm not sure there's a market that had such great success again in 2024 after following a record of 2023. So operators looking to sell those assets on the strip is not likely at this time because the business continues to be strong across many of the different segments in Las Vegas.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just following up on the development funding talk. Ed, I know you mentioned that when you looked through the opportunities of 2024, it seems like that's what made sense at the time. I guess how do you think of that development funding that eventually gets paid back versus acquisitions and what that means for the future of the portfolio and, like, the recurring nature of income?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. No. It's a very good question, Caitlin, and it's one we talk about a lot at the management table at VICI. We, as a starting point, in this particular case with Cain and Eldridge, much has been the case with Great Wolf. We are not overly concerned about the money coming back because of the depth and time extent of the pipeline we believe we could have with Cain. And in this particular case, I obviously need to be careful here, but I do want to say that in the particular case of One Beverly Hills, we are working, we continue to work. Okay. And I should note the money for One Beverly Hills, that $300 million is already going out the door, but we continue to work with Cain as potentially participating in a larger and longer way with One Beverly Hills. But beyond that, to really get to the heart of your question, we see a pipeline of opportunities with Cain across their various verticals. They could enable us to continue to roll our capital into new Cain ventures. When they talk, for example, about the growth opportunity for Aman globally, especially across Europe in the coming decade, we see an opportunity to continue to be a funding partner in that particular example, much in the way David and the team have been now a steady partner to Great Wolf for how long, David?
David Kieske: Five years? Yeah. About five years.
Ed Pitoniak: Right. So we obviously are mindful of the fact that this money will come back to us at some point or could come back to us at some point, Caitlin. But we really do focus on relationships that we think could enable us to continue to basically roll that capital into new manifestations of a given partnership.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And then maybe more like a nerdy question. But on the share count, you guys have a lot of forward equity. So can you go through over what time period you're required to settle those shares? Under what condition? Share price are assumed in guidance?
David Kieske: Yeah. Caitlin, as we've done for many years now, we have outstanding forward equity on a quarter-by-quarter and an annual basis. And those contracts are typically one-year contracts, but they are extended and amended to go beyond that initial period of time, and that is very commonplace with banks and with the counterparties. And then in our guidance, in our share count, we use the treasury stock solution method in our making some estimates around reasonable projections around future stock prices and incorporating a level of dilution into our guidance range, but do not obviously take into consideration the entirety of those outstanding forwards because we use those to match funds, potential acquisitions, which are not in our guidance. So this is, you know, very common across the REIT land, and we've been doing it. I know a lot of other triple nets have done it for years.
Ed Pitoniak: And maybe I'll just add to what David said, Caitlin, by emphasizing that the way we did it for 2025 guidance is the way we have always done. Okay. There's been no change in the methodology.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
David Kieske: Thanks, Caitlin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas of Truist Securities. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. In September, you'll have the right to call the Caesars Forum Center at the same cap rate you had on the Indiana properties. Any thoughts you can offer on the puts and takes to exercising that option?
John Payne: Barry, good to talk to you. It's definitely an asset that you're well aware of. They built a great facility there. It anchors the empty acreage that we have in Las Vegas. So we'll continue to see how it's performing when that time comes up. Obviously, it also connects to one of our assets in the Harrah's facility that we own the real estate in the building and then lease it back to Caesars. So definitely on our radar. It's definitely something that we've been looking at over the years, and you're all aware of this opportunity that we could have, and we'll continue to study it in time period as it approaches.
Barry Jonas: Understood. Understood. And then just as a follow-up, you know, I'm not sure you've talked about this before, but, you know, you've obviously operated golf courses. But is there a scenario where you would consider operating casinos or other assets in a TRS?
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks. Well, as the starting point, any casino and Samantha and David helped me out here. Any casino that went into a TRS would have to be a casino with zero, repeat zero, hotel rooms. There is an intricacy or nuance of REIT legislation that would forbid the inclusion of a casino with hotel rooms in a TRS. Beyond that, I would say we don't see that happening. We would not seek to have that happen. I guess it's always a possibility that you we would be silly to rule out a priori with a hundred percent certainty, but not in our plans.
Barry Jonas: Understood. Alright. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis of Scotiabank. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinnis: Hey. Good morning. Given the nonbinding letter of intent on the new partnership with Cain and Eldridge, how would you describe your competitive positioning relative to other capital providers, especially as they consider more permanent financing options upon completion of that development?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a very good question to ask, Greg. I would say that in the case of One Beverly Hills, so, again, we shouldn't rule out anything ever a priori. We do not expect to become a permanent real estate owner of the assets at One Beverly Hills. But having said that, based on the discussions we've already been in with Jonathan Goldstein and with Todd Boehly, we see opportunities to work across a portfolio. For example, in the Cain and Eldridge portfolio, you will see that one of the investments they have is St. James Clubs. And, again, I really emphasize looking at that slide and the wonderful deck that Hayes put together. And St. James Clubs can represent an example of us to further capitalize on the knowledge we've gained through our investment in Chelsea Piers into these kinds of sports and recreation complexes. And absolutely, they will always have the ability to seek other forms, other sources of capital. But I will emphasize that there is a cultural union between or among Cain, Eldridge, and VICI that gives us a lot of confidence that we will always have a chance to be a partner of choice to them as they seek to capitalize the really compelling experiential investments they are making. And I will say, to that regard, Greg. So, Greg, I'll just say to that regard, it was Todd Boehly who proposed, hey, let's do an LOI. I mean, Samantha can explain why in a case like that, you kinda have to make it nonbinding. But it was a sign of Todd's commitment to the partnership.
Greg McGinnis: Okay. Good to hear. I guess thinking about, you know, investing in the assets that you already have. One, curious, you know, is Venetian kind of looking for more of the capital you've potentially committed? And then, you know, MGM guided slightly lower growth CapEx funding for this year. So it does appear they're allocating some funding to MGM Grand. What's your kind of general sense for how CapEx budgets are trending for casinos compared to the last few years, and what might that mean for your investment opportunities with them in Las Vegas and regionally? And then also, how does that compare to the contractually obligated CapEx?
John Payne: Yeah. Very good question. I'll start in Las Vegas. One of the advantages of our portfolio and having such a big presence in that market is the assets are absolutely incredible. Like, in my opening remarks, I talked about Venetian, and I said that it's over 17 million square feet. That's bigger than some companies' whole portfolio, and it's one of our assets in one market. Why I bring that up is that it provides opportunity for us to brainstorm with the operator about how to use our capital to continue to have them grow. And obviously, this past year, we announced the amount of money up to $700 million we've been putting in with the Apollo team into the Venetian. We have those same conversations with our other partners and operators. Obviously, Las Vegas has bigger boxes than the regionals, but we do have conversations with our regional partners about all their opportunities to build hotels, other opportunities to bring casinos that happen to be on riverboats on the land. So you continue to have those discussions. I think there continues to be an excitement about putting new capital into Las Vegas. In fact, there was an article I saw this morning about the Caesars Organization putting over a billion dollars in Las Vegas over the past couple of years. So that should get you and our investors excited about the opportunities that could be presented in that market. But I think 2025 is very similar to what we saw in 2024 and even 2023, that operators continue to reinvent themselves, and they need capital to create new experiences.
Greg McGinnis: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower of Barclays. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, everybody. And congrats again on the new partnership with Cain and Eldridge. Morning, Ed. Let me go back to the guidance really quickly, if you don't mind. David, I think you mentioned in the prepared comments that certain loan fundings are not included in the AFFO number as presented last night. Can you walk us through what precisely, you know, is included, dollars, cadence, timing, etcetera, just so we have a kind of a clear understanding of funding throughout the year as is currently contemplated?
David Kieske: Yeah. Rich, you mean, like, comments or the specific comment was we do not include in guidance any funding or development funding that does not have an identified draw schedule. As we sit here today, you know, we're continuing to fund Great Wolf, we're funding Canyon Ranch Austin, and Cabot Citrus Farms, and it's fifteen, twenty million dollars a month or so of that. You know, with Great Wolf Northeast, we're complete in May of 2025. Canyon Ranch is sometime in 2026. Citrus Farms is working through, you know, later this year, early next year. So there's not a specific number per month because it's all based on the timing of the draws and the amount of draws and then obviously, the installments are completed. You know, we have a construction loan full from the construction loan that's outstanding.
Rich Hightower: Okay. That's actually helpful. And just to be clear, Venetian, you know, PPG funding is kind of separate from that. Is that what's the timing on that one as well? If I have that correct.
David Kieske: Yeah. So we announced that the total commitment of $700 million. They drew $400 million in 2024. And that is all converted to rent and embedded in the lease. Now they have the option, but not the obligation, to draw an incremental $300 million of that significant over time. And they're both in the budgets right now and their plans, and as John talked about putting a lot of new, you may have seen a lot of new restaurants and a lot of new experiences in the Venetian. And so they're working through and when they would draw that incremental $300 million.
Ed Pitoniak: And needless to say, Rich, given that they have not firmly committed to using any of that, none of that.
Rich Hightower: Okay. That's very helpful. And then one last kind of small one, and I think you guys have addressed this on prior calls, but just so you know, we all have it clear. You know, you do see some pretty big swings in, I guess, the change in allowance for credit losses on the income statement. Obviously, a non-cash number, you know, most of the time. We hope there aren't any actual credit losses. But just, David, help us understand the drivers of that quarter-to-quarter swing?
Gabe Wasserman: Yeah. Hey. Gabe Wasserman here. I can take that. So in the fourth quarter, most of the allowance is really driven by Moody's, which is the service provider that we use to help us model out and project future losses. The fourth quarter, their economic scenario, which is a scenario condition and a requirement of the model and the bank are using similar forward projections. They were kind of forecasting, you know, higher for longer interest rates, potential tariffs, and some headwinds economically, and that was going through our projections. That was really the driver of the increase in the allowance in the fourth quarter.
Ed Pitoniak: Which, Gabe, would be another way of saying it is it was more general than specific to any senior credit, more macro as opposed to micro to any of those specific.
Rich Hightower: Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: And, Rich, you get an award, Rich, for asking about CECL.
Rich Hightower: I knew we had addressed CECL on prior calls, but I just think it's been a little while. So, again, appreciate the call. Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey. Yeah. It has. There you go.
Operator: Next question comes from Jim Kammert of Evercore. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jim Kammert: Thank you. Good morning. I know, David, obviously, guidance excludes new capital markets activities, but given the $1.3 billion that's rolling or maturing, I should say, of notes in Q2, how is VICI leaning right now? Repay a part of that or refund? And where what would the cost be?
David Kieske: I think I answered just your question to break it up a little bit. Yeah. We've got a May maturity and June maturity, and we only get in some guidance on those refi's, but we're seeing on a ten-year kinda one twenty, one twenty-five. So spread over the ten-year, which I know it was a four four eight a few, you know, early this morning, but obviously bounces around. So look at mid Yeah. Mid five five and a half to five seven five. Area for a ten-year refinance.
Jim Kammert: Great. Thank you. And then, obviously, early innings with the new relationship, how has his relationship or ownership of Chelsea helped give you a little insight into the tent kind of view as to how those owners and consortiums think about tracking additional capital and opportunity for VICI?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, certainly, you know, in the specific case of Chelsea, one, as is true with so many of the Premier League teams, they're very focused on making sure that they are doing everything they can to maximize game day revenue. And, obviously, maximizing game day revenue involves making sure you have the optimal stadium and to a great degree now increasingly, the right surroundings around the stadium. We've had, I would say, Samantha, very preliminary chats with Todd around their vision for what Chelsea FC can become in terms of its placement in London, but not much more than that.
Jim Kammert: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you if maybe you provide any sort of update on the licensing process that seems to be kind of lurching forward in New York for, you know, full-on casinos. And just kind of as part of that, if your MGM property were not selected for a license, does it just remain as a essentially, a slot-only facility, or is there some other change that would take place?
John Payne: Smedes, it's John. I probably should be asking you what you think about the New York process. Look, I think there's news almost every day. We're sitting here in New York altogether. I read an article yesterday about one of the groups that is potentially bidding on the license. It does seem like there's progress being made on all the different steps it takes to win one of the three licenses. It does still seem like they're shooting for a decision at the end of this year, but your guess is as good as mine. Same with the last part of your question you asked about the MGM property at Empire City. We're excited about that group has put together a very, very healthy bid for the full license. I don't know the exact answer to your question. Should they not receive one of the three licenses, how that ultimately plays out with the slot facility, but I think in this whole process plays out with the gaming commissions, how they make their decisions. We'll continue to learn more, but it does seem like there's more progress in Q1 2025 than there has been in a while, but it's hard to determine ultimately when the final stage is.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then in terms of the ones that really Hills, and maybe this can make any difference in terms of your loan to them. But I just wanted to ask you. I mean, Los Angeles has a lot of luxury retail readily available. It has a lot of housing, and it has a lot of luxury hotels. I guess, you know, from their perspective, you know, what I guess, is giving them confidence that there's incremental demand for, you know, more multimillion-dollar condominiums and more, you know, Chanels and whatnot and just don't know. Maybe that's sort of a dumb question, but I'm just kind of wondering how they're thinking about the demand in fact there.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. I think and I'm priming so Samantha. She's gonna need to speak here in a moment because she actually has experience with Aman. I think Smedes, to answer your question, we really have to do all we can to help everyone understand the brand power of Aman. Aman, obviously, is not a public company. There are no Amans within hotel REIT portfolios. But if I were you, I would just do a price check on the rates that Aman gets location by location around the world, because Aman is in a league of its own. Correct, Samantha?
Samantha Gallagher: Yeah. I think just to add to Ed's point, you're talking ultra-high-end luxury. It truly is above and beyond really what you see almost anywhere else in the world, and they've been able to do it in cities throughout the world. And I think that's what they'll bring to Beverly Hills, which I don't think they have up here.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. And, you know, it's so much to the credit of the Cain team. They were able to get entitlements and permitting for that 17.5 incomparable acres for incremental hotel supply in Beverly Hills, and some of you may have seen over the course of 2024, that LVMH was unable to get entitlements and permitting for a Cheval Blanc on Rodeo Drive. There is supply there. To your point, Smedes. But, again, I would we will do all we can to help everyone understand the very, very differentiated position of Aman in every market in the world that it operates in.
Smedes Rose: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz of Jefferies. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask a little bigger picture question. You know, first, congratulations on your announcement of the new partnership. But in that putting it all in context, the discussion we have, you know, with investors frequently is around, you know, thinking about underwriting the various aspects of your TAM. And, obviously, a deal like this adds to your TAM in some ways. Right. But to an earlier question about the duration of the capital you have out now and how we sort of think about that strategically. Then the, you know, potential expansions embedded in your current portfolio and how we think about underwriting those versus, you know, a new casino partner, you know, to be named later. So to speak. Right. They're across the spectrum, and I'd love to add your just your thoughts and comments around how we, you know, underwrite those or whether it's straight math.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a great question, David. And one of the ways in which I'll answer it is that when we think about TAM, we really also think about the I'm trying to come up with an acronym on the spot, and I'm not gonna do it, David. I was gonna say, like, the tar, the total amount of the relationship. That's not very good, is it?
David Katz: Exactly. What I'm getting at is on the quad.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. There you go. Thank you, David.
David Katz: Yeah. On the fly.
Ed Pitoniak: I'll do better next time. I promise. When we as we began to get to know Cain and Eldridge, we very quickly developed very high conviction that this has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar relationship over time. We do believe there can be opportunities within that relationship for us to ultimately own permanent real estate. But also the opportunity to continue as a, as my answer to Caitlin indicated, the opportunity to have numerous funding opportunities and thus opportunities to continue to roll our capital behind their initiatives. And so we are very, very focused on widening our TAM without diluting our quality. Our quality of relationship and our quality of investment. And, again, at a time like this, when the gaming deal flow is what it is, we believe we serve our stockholders very well by developing these kinds of relationships to give our stockholders participation in what we think is some of the most compelling placemaking taking place right now.
David Katz: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, David. Our next question comes from John Kilichowski of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe if I could just circle back on that last comment, Ed. You said that, you know, eventually owning some of the real estate in these deals with Cain and Eldridge could you specify specifically maybe what types of real estate you'd be looking to own here? Obviously, in this project, it's multi-use. We have the hotel, the residences, the retail, the food, and beverage. Just curious what you would be owning versus not owning.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. And just to be clear, and as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are not optimistic that we would eventually own any real estate within One Beverly Hills. This is real estate that if it if and when it trades, it will trade at stratospheric values. And, also, is real estate of a nature that doesn't exactly fit our investment criteria, which obviously mainly involves net lease. But beyond that, as you look across the Eldridge Cain portfolio, I think you will see, again, citing that really good slide in the deck, businesses current businesses within Cain and Eldridge that involve real estate. It's very, very much resembles real estate that we already own, and I would cite the example of Chelsea Piers as the type of real estate we already own and are very excited to continue to invest in.
John Payne: I have one thing to add to that as well. Creating partnerships like we have with Cain and Eldridge also opens other potential partners that are around the world that are seeing what we are doing with our capital to help other experiential companies grow. I mean, we've just made this announcement, and there are folks that are reaching out saying, hey, very interesting way that you are getting involved with that project. We'd like to talk to you about x, y, and z. So don't underestimate that as we continue to build these world-class developers and partners that it also opens new ones for us and doesn't keep us as, hey, you're just that gaming REIT, which we love casino gaming, but it really is open to funnel for conversations about other opportunities for us around the world.
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. And I just want to build on what John is saying too that there's actually another dimension of partnership in what we've just announced. And though it may not have been visible in our releases, this marks the fourth time in which we will have partnered with JPMorgan in participating working together on a capital structure for a very compelling development. And, you know, as you all know, we are a very small team. We have over 25% of the company sitting at this table, and that's seven people. And so we are always very focused on opportunities to force multiply what we are able to achieve at VICI. And we're really, really appreciative of the partnership that David and his team have formed with Brian Baker and his team at JPMorgan when it comes to identifying opportunities to work together and put our capital to work in opportunities that might not have otherwise been available to us.
John Kilichowski: Got it. I appreciate that. And then, you know, maybe jumping back to one of the first comments you made today was just on the pipeline really picking up. And I'm curious on the other side of that equation, how has the competitive landscape changed? I feel like across most of our earnings discussions this quarter, we've heard competition has certainly spiked on the private side. I'm curious if you're seeing the same.
John Payne: It's been the same since we started the company. You know? This is a space, particularly the casino space, where there's a lot of interest. There's great operators. There's great real estate. Buildings perform like no other in the experiential sector. So as we look at any opportunity, we go in with our eyes open if there's others that are looking at this, and that's why we pride ourselves on building deep relationships, strengthening the ties, and growing the company in that fashion. So I wouldn't say we'd see an increase in competition. I'd say it's always been there, and we want to continue to be out there as well.
John Kilichowski: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree of CBRE. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John DeCree: Hey, everyone. Took a lot of ground, but maybe got two more. One on the casino M&A environment. I think we discussed it a little bit earlier, pointing to the volatility in the ten-year, but, you know, Ed or John or David, curious if you have any thoughts as to what else is kind of influencing, like I said, I would say, the lack of M&A in the space, whether it involves real estate or not. It seems like it's, you know, still kinda quiet. So curious if you kinda see any other factors in there that are, you know, maybe causing that.
John Payne: I don't think John's nice to talk to him. You hit on a few. Again, in my remarks earlier while I was answering one question, I just talked about Las Vegas. And if you're an operator in Las Vegas and you're performing the way you're performing, you have to say, well, where else would I like to operate? And you land on, I'd rather own this asset. I can continue to invest in it. There are new customers coming through my door every day. And I'm gonna just make this a better place. I mean, the results that you saw out of Las Vegas, I mean, Wynn's results were incredible. We saw there's incredible results coming out of the buildings that we own. So, John, I don't see a lot of trading in Las Vegas at the time. It comes to the regionals, I think it's just a matter of they like operating those businesses right now. There could be some trades over time. And if so, we will see if there's an opportunity for us.
Ed Pitoniak: And, John, I'll just add to that, because I think when it comes to regional gaming, you know, we're in a period where investing in regional gaming has to be done with precision, market by market, asset by asset. We're obviously seeing supply growth across much of the US regional landscape. And I think if you're going to invest incremental capital in regional gaming, you want to be highly aware of new competition and new supply and what that would mean for same-store sales and existing assets. So, again, it's not solely a case of, well, what's available. It's also a case of, well, what do you really want to own? Again, we are very much in this for the long term. And thus, we are going to be, by nature, selective.
John DeCree: Thanks, John. That's helpful. Maybe one more on the discussion of Aman hotels as a good example. You know, a lot of those ultra-high-end international hotels. I'm curious your thoughts on how you think about expanding a bit more internationally. Obviously, there's some in Canada, but, you know, would you go overseas? Kind of in an investment or lending capacity, like, you've done in California recently. So opportunities where maybe not real estate ownership, but, you know, M&A or however else you would structure it in some international markets or something like that on the table. How kinda far have you explored those kinds of lending in international market opportunities?
Samantha Gallagher: Yeah. So we definitely would, and we actually do have some lending activity in the UK, in Scotland, right now, with Cabot. And we've done our internal team has done a lot of work around really mapping the world and where we can invest both from a lending perspective as well as an acquisition perspective, understanding any tax leakage and really looking at what jurisdictions would be most compelling for us so that when we look at our TAM, we're really knowledgeable about it. So the answer to that question is yes. We absolutely can and would have.
John DeCree: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thanks, John. Our next question comes from Chris Darling of Green Street. Line's now open. Please go ahead.
Chris Darling: Thanks. Good morning. Question on the gaming side. Seems like there's been a lot more capital flowing into the historic horse racing segment of the market. A couple of projects, I think, have been announced in New Hampshire. Is this a segment of the market that's interesting to you, and how would you think about sort of the opportunities and risks involved?
John Payne: Chris, nice to speak to you. Yes. If you're asking, would we make an investment into a racetrack, particularly, most of these investments are adding some form of new gambling to that investment. So whether it's historical racing machines that are being added in certain markets, other markets are adding just simple class three slot machines and some, as we heard today, talking about Empire City, the ability to turn a casino into a full-fledged casino. So to answer your question, they're all areas that we would have interest in placing investments if we have the right partners, if we have the right structure along the way. So we continue to study the markets that you mentioned, and other markets that could, as Ed mentioned, there could be some new markets that open up over time, and we'd be interested in those as well.
Chris Darling: Alright. Fair enough. And then just one more quickly for me. Curious if you could walk through the rationales from a pure gaming standpoint to sell the Canadian operations to IGP. And then I think it'd be helpful as well to understand a little bit more about who IGP is, kinda their scale, where they own, future ambitions, anything that you could add.
John Payne: Yeah. We were very excited. We had a great relationship with the management team and the owners of Pure. But we are excited to form our new relationship with a few tribes that have come together to form this group. We're learning more about their interest, their capacity to grow their business. That was one of the things that we were excited about, not only them acquiring the operations of the assets we own in Canada, but also our ability to continue to partner not only in Canada, but there could be opportunities all over the world. So the more we learn about each other, this is our first opportunity to work together, the more I think you'll see us grow with them over time should the right opportunities come about.
Ed Pitoniak: And, Chris, just to make sure I understood your question clearly, I want to clarify that we didn't sell anything. The prior owner of Pure, Onex, a Toronto-based PE firm, sold the OpCo to IGP. And not only are we excited about IGP being our new partner on the Alberta assets, it also signifies that OpCos are marketable. That there are buyers for OpCos, which I think there has been some questioning around, but this is a clear example of gaming OpCos and OpCos having value.
Chris Darling: Got it. And yeah, that point was understood, Ed, but I appreciate the clarification. That's all for me. So thanks for the time.
Operator: Thank you, Chris. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Ed Pitoniak for any further remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Alex. And thanks to all of you. We know many of you have another call coming up here just momentarily. So wish you the best and thanks again for attending this morning. Bye for now.
Operator: Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, November 1, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the investor section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2024 earnings release, our supplemental information, and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer, John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer, David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer, Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer, and Moira McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. It's an interesting world we're currently living in, isn't it? I wish this was a video call so that I could ask for a show of hands on how many of you predicted that the Fed would lower the Fed funds rate 50 bps in mid-September and over the next six weeks, the U.S. 10-year yield would rise 70 bps. If you work at a hedge fund and bet that prediction, let me know if you need help spending all the money you just made. At VICI, we never tire of trying to make sense of the times we are living through so that we can be situationally ready for the future that may arise out of the present. To tell you about one of the means we use to make sense of the times we're living through, I need you to please grab that old-fashioned thing called a pen or pencil and that old-fashioned thing called a piece of paper. Draw a horizontal or latitude line on the paper. This axis will represent consumer economic conditions. At the left end of the latitude line, put lousy, and at the right end of the line, put great. Now, through the middle of the horizontal line, draw a vertical or longitude line. This axis will represent REIT capital market condition. At the top end of the latitude line, put great, and at the bottom end of the line, put lousy. You now have one of the key maps we use at VICI to determine at any given time where we are located latitudinally and longitudinally in relation to consumer economic conditions and REIT capital market conditions and where we might be headed. Over VICI's seven years of existence, we have operated in every quadrant on this grid, and we have successfully generated earnings growth and dividend growth during our journey through all these quadrants. Given 2024's volatility, we have operated in or verged on almost all of these quadrants year-to-date. We like where we currently are, in a good position to fund the opportunities we are working on, but as always at VICI, we remain situationally ready for whatever lat-long position we may be in or headed toward. We've worked hard to develop a philosophy, strategy, and practice of capital allocation that enables VICI to allocate capital no matter which quadrant we find ourselves in at any given time. We achieve the sustained and sustainable capital allocation through two key means, internal funding capability through all cycles and investments that fund over time. When access to or cost of capital is in a negative quadrant, we want to be capable of what we've come to call capital markets independence, meaning that we have internal capital resources available to us that we can use to generate accretive external growth. At VICI, capital markets independence is funded through both retained cash flow and what we call regained cash flow, meaning repayments of loans we've made through VICI experiential credit solutions. Depending on the loan repayments received in a given year, our annual internal cash resources available for allocation can be anywhere from $350 million to $500 million. When levered with debt, this can give us $500 million to nearly $1 billion of investing power, even when, again, overall capital market conditions are not positive. VICI's ability to fund external growth no matter what quadrant we're in builds off our foundation of same-store NOI growth that, thanks to our leases, rent escalation rates, and 100% occupancy is far superior to conventional net lease REITs as documented by Green Street. We capitalize on this sustained funding capability by developing investment opportunities that enable us to put capital out the door in a regular sustained cadence, with Q3 2024 being an example of a quarter in which we announced no new transactions but nonetheless put nearly $250 million of incremental capital to work through our property partner growth fund and lending initiatives. Sustainable capital allocation is integral to a subject that we are religious about. At VICI, we are religious about the power of compounding, the compounding of earnings growth, the compounding of dividend growth, the compounding of total return. One of the keys of compounding is not go backwards, not in earnings, not in dividends, not in total return. A key to sustained forward momentum is the ability to generate earnings and value growth through all cycles in all quadrants of our BG conditions map. We don't know what the coming quarters will bring in REIT capital market conditions or consumer economic conditions, but we work every day to be ready for what may come. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John and David, who will talk about our growth outlook and current performance. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning to all of you on the call today. We're often asked where we spend most of our time and energy, and while we've built a team that can assess the wide range of opportunities across experiential sectors and various geographies in tandem, I have said many times that casino gaming will continue to be a major driver of our growth. The size and scale of gaming assets is one element contributing to this focus, and we also like gaming because of how experiences at these assets continue to evolve, specifically in Las Vegas. We believe the tailwinds around gaming in Las Vegas will continue to create investment opportunities for VICI, similar to the Venetian Partner Property Growth Fund investment we announced during the second quarter. A recent Financial Times article exemplifies our view of the future opportunities in Las Vegas. In the article, Barry Dillard, the Chairman of IAC, shared his thoughts on his company's stake in MGM Resorts. He said, you can't disintermediate a physical experience, which is why we are betting on Las Vegas. He then goes on to say, the amount of entertainment, sports, live performances, and every possible variety and combination in Las Vegas is unequaled anywhere in the world. This quote underlies the merits of VICI's experiential real estate strategy, as well as our significant ownership of Las Vegas real estate. VICI is positioned to be a prime partner of our operators as they seek to invest further in this one-of-a-kind city. An example we have often cited is the opportunity presented by the Sports Triangle at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, with our ownership of all six MGM assets contained within and alongside Allegiant Stadium, T-Mobile Arena, and the potential A's Stadium on the former Tropicana site. Given the increased densification and foot traffic in the area, our partners at MGM may seek to reinvest in those assets over the coming years. The scale of investment opportunity within assets VICI already owns provides us with a very unique advantage. We have also utilized our partner property growth fund with regional tenants, including Century, who this week is hosting the grand opening of their land-based casino in Caruthersville, Missouri. In 2022, VICI announced an investment of $52 million to fund development of this new casino resort at Century Caruthersville to replace the last remaining Riverboat casino on Open Water in Missouri. We have taken great care in the selection of our partners and investments to ensure not only a best-in-class portfolio with quality income, but a portfolio of investments and partners we can grow with. This ethos is foundational to our capital allocation strategy and sets VICI up well for future pipeline opportunities and consistent capital deployment. In the third quarter, we deployed $230 million of capital through various loans and partner property growth fund agreements. This has been our 13th quarter of consecutive capital deployment. VICI has built a legacy of getting better as we grow bigger, and we believe our disciplined strategy will allow us to be situationally ready to continue to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?
David Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'll touch on our balance sheet, liquidity, results, and our updated full-year guidance. Subsequent to quarter-end, we settled 7 million shares and received approximately $201 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds contributed to funding the Venetian Capital investment we announced in Q2. We currently have approximately $2.9 billion in total liquidity comprised of approximately $160 million in cash and cash equivalents, $430 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized third quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5x to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.3 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 4.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $16.5 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance, we are updating our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to now be between $2.36 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.25 and $2.26 per diluted common share. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions or items. With that, Adam, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. Barry, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Barry Jonas: Wanted to start with Tribal Gaming, see if you had any updated views there. Maybe you could spell out any parameters you would look for to execute any loans or sale leasebacks. Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, good morning, Barry. I think the starting point for us, VICI, is that over our seven years, led by John and the team, we have developed very positive, powerful relationships with American tribal nations. We currently have four tribal relationships. As you know, Barry, they all obviously involve partnering with tribes in commercial gaming opportunities off of tribal land. And when it comes, again, to doing business with tribes, we love doing business with them. They're commercial, they're collaborative and great to do business with. When it comes to doing business on tribal land, it is, again, not about tribes being idiosyncratic. It's about the structure that applies to tribal gaming on tribal land that is idiosyncratic. And when you have an idiosyncratic situation, it's sometimes useful to create a counterfactual that enables you to better understand the idiosyncrasy, the risks associated with the idiosyncrasy, and perhaps a better understanding of how to price the risk of that idiosyncrasy. So to create a counterfactual, I'm going to ask you, Barry, to imagine a scenario in which we announce that we've done a deal with a commercial gaming operator on freehold commercial land. But in that deal, we tell you that that commercial gaming operator is the only party in the world entitled to operate the gaming floor at the center of the asset and likely the economic engine of the asset. And moreover, that same operator owns the land underneath everything and thus would be the ground less sore to us as the ground less sea. So that is by definition a sandwich lease. And from everything we've been able to learn, that is what applies to the transaction you're implicitly referring to that got announced last week by our peers and colleagues at GLPI. We give full credit to GLPI for announcing this, for doing the work that went behind it. But I would say we are still coming up the learning curve when it comes to understanding the risks associated with that structure and how to best price the risk. At VICI, we spend a lot of time focusing on tail risk. And in fact, there may be moments when some people feel both externally and internally, maybe we spend a little too much time focused on tail risk. But in this particular case, the tail risk, again, is so idiosyncratic and so unique to this situation that we're not at a point where we can say with any confidence, okay, the code has been cracked and the idiosyncratic risks that have always applied here have either been eliminated or have been minimized to a degree where we can confidently price the risk.
Barry Jonas: Great. I really appreciate that. Maybe just for a follow up, I wanted to touch on Vegas. I'm curious if you looked at Caesars sale of the LINQ, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you had a roofer there. And then with that sale, wondering if we could see anything happen with those 26 adjacent acres that VICI owns. Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, just to be clear, Barry, we did not have a roofer on the LINQ promenade. The assets, we have a roofer on our casino assets and not the promenade, which is a distinct property unto itself. There is an idiosyncrasy. Well, I shouldn't call it an idiosyncrasy. The LINQ promenade is not technically a net lease property. But we're very glad to see TPG and especially [indiscernible] at Acadia led by Ken Bernstein go in there. I think there's a lot of potential to continue to make that a corridor that exactly to your point can become a very powerful corridor to the land that we own in back of the promenade in the area in and around Ceasar's Forum Convention Center.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Anthony, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: John, you mentioned in your comments, just a lot of opportunities for things like, you know, reinvestment into properties and such. So I mean, can you just talk about just as you look at the pipeline, how much of it is now, really focused on on those types of investments versus, new acquisitions and whether that's changed much in the last quarter or two?
John Payne: Yes, Tony, good morning. Very good question. I don't think it's changed. What I like about what we've done is created these pillars of growth. We've got opportunities to continue to have real estate acquisitions, as you referred to in my comments, the ability to grow with our property partner growth funds with assets that we already own, particularly in Las Vegas. Although, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some opportunities in our regional assets because they're large as well. And then we have this opportunity, as Ed mentioned, in his marks with VICI Experiential Credit Solutions, our credit book where it's open doors for us to come in, provide a credit solution and then over time, hopefully flip it into real estate ownership. So Tony, I wouldn't say we're focused more today on the property partner growth funds than the other two. I like the fact that we're spending time and I've got a team now that are spending time on all three of these, which will provide growth for us for the long-term.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just the follow up there, maybe for you, John, and also, Ed, you commented about the 70 basis point move in the 10 year over a pretty short period of time. Do you think that's had any effect on just the propensity of your counterparts to want to transact or on just where pricing might need to be?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Tony, I wouldn't say that move over the last over the last month has necessarily by itself been highly impactful, but it's all been part of a period of volatility that has just been frankly, it's been kind of nauseating. And I do think it's led to a level of indecision and inaction that is reflected certainly for us and what we've been able to come forward and tell you about. And needless to say, we very much hope that this period of volatility will soon start to pass, just to dramatize that volatility, Tony. Back in 2018, the number of days in the trading year when the U.S. 10 year moved 10 basis points or more was three. In 2019, it was seven. In 2020, it was 16. In 2021, it was eight. In 2022, it was 46 days. It was 39 days last year. And given the volatility we've seen, crikey, even this week, I think we're in the 20s now. And this is really just an example of how a lot of people have really, a lot of people on both sides of the transaction table have just been trying to figure out where am I today and where the hell am I going to be next week? And, needless to say, we are among those many in both America and globally who hope things really kind of calm down next week. And that the kind of volatility we've especially seen in the move index starts to quiet down because it has definitely led to all kinds of different behaviors by investors. And I saw where NFL ratings are down over the last month and that's attributed to the election. It's like, man, people are just so distracted and stressed out that they can't even summon the time and focus to watch NFL games for crikey's sake.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Darling from Green Street. Chris, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Darling: Maybe for Ed, can you talk about the potential opportunity to acquire gaming assets in off-strip Vegas locations? And to the extent there's opportunity and interest on your part in pursuing that, it'd be helpful if you could elaborate maybe on what you look for in terms of yield coverage, but also how you think about partnering with the right operator in that sort of scenario.
Ed Pitoniak: And just to be clear, Chris, when you say off-strip, you're referring to the locals and downtown markets in Las Vegas?
Chris Darling: Yes, exactly.
Ed Pitoniak: Or are you speaking about regional gaming?
Chris Darling: It could be either, honestly, but I'm more so referring to within the Vegas metro area itself, just off-strip.
Ed Pitoniak: I see. Yes, good. John, John and team are doing a lot of work in that area. John, over to you.
John Payne: Yes. Chris, nice to talk to you this morning. If you've been following us as you have for the past couple of years, you've heard us talk about our love of Las Vegas. And obviously, we've got great assets on the strip, but we've been spending years meeting with operators, not only in the local downtown market, but as you said, in the regional market, where they're just some fabulous assets. And you ask what we do, we obviously spend time to understand the operator's quality, the asset quality, the credit quality, what a structure of a lease could look like, how we could potentially help an operator who has assets in the local, downtown or regional market grow, not only in their current assets, but if they have a plan to grow the number of assets, how our capital could help them grow. So it's definitely been a focus of me and my team, not only recently, but also over the past couple of years. And there really are some neat places that we would love to be partners with great operators there.
Chris Darling: All right, helpful thoughts. And then maybe just one more, and this is more so focused on the regional side, outside of Vegas.
Ed Pitoniak: This was given to me by a guy, some of you know, named Mike Simanovsky, the Founder of Conversant. And it's a book by Edward Chancellor, in which he collects the essays, sorry, not the essays, the investment memos of an asset management shop out of London called Marathon. And one of Marathon's main investment theses is to identify categories that are at lower risk of excess capital being invested in the category and creating excess capacity. And I think one of the things we are mindful of right now in American regional gaming is making sure we understand market by market, the degree to which a given regulatory regime is at risk of authorizing the creation of more capacity than the market really should be able to sustain. And I think there are areas, and I would say in particular, areas like Illinois and Indiana, where I think we all have to be mindful of, okay, when is enough, enough? But in terms of the current tone of the market, regional market, I'll turn it over to John.
John Payne: Yes, Chris, and Ed hit on this very well, just about, as you underwrite regional gaming, you should understand some of the history of it, places like Pennsylvania that added new [licensers] [ph] or Illinois that added BLTs. You start to see new states add historical horse racing machines that now look very similar to slot machines. So to your point, as we look at regional assets, and in our lifetime, we will continue to buy real estate and buildings and regional assets, but we're very thoughtful in understanding the best we can at the time, the competition that is in the market that could impact the asset that we're buying, and then potential new markets that could open up. Because as someone who's been in the business, I don't like to date myself, but I'm almost going on 30 years, I don't think there is belief that states like Nebraska or Virginia or Kentucky, which has HHR machines, would really have gaming at the moment that they do now, the magnitude that they do now. So to answer your question, we are being thoughtful and disciplined in our underwriting as we look at regional assets.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Roans from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: On your last call, you talked a little bit about some of your tenants were seeing weakness, especially on the lower end of the consumer spectrum. I'm wondering if you can [indiscernible] here that kind of feedback, and if you think that might impact their propensity to kind of reinvest or to participate in your funds that you've talked about previously.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you this morning. Probably the first part is a better question for our great operators that have extensive details on their databases and where they're seeing positive growth and where they're seeing some weakness. I think you've seen the earnings that have come out, and some have talked, particularly in the regional markets, that they are seeing a little bit of slowness in the lower segments of their business. But we continue to, this is the beauty of having great partners and having quite a few of them. We continue to meet with them, talk about how they're thinking about growth, and is there a way that our different pillars of capital that I talked about earlier could help them grow, and whether that's with a property partner growth fund, whether they have a credit opportunity, whether they're building, would like to build a new hotel, whether they'd like to build a casino on land instead of on a boat. Those are all type of conversations we'd like to have and are having with our partners, and we hope that leads to growth for us with all different types of our partners.
Smedes Rose: Thanks. And then maybe just kind of bigger picture, I need to think about coming into 2025, would you be giving a reasonable on the external growth side to think about maybe you do more frequent deals with smaller scope, or are you guys still maybe chasing the big deal, maybe in the non-gaming space that will more meaningfully drive their earnings growth next year? I guess I'm so touched about the opportunity set now that you've had more time, I guess, to think about kind of non-gaming and gaming investment opportunities and how it might play out here.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I mean, it's something we think about every day. We have set forth goals and strategies at VICI that, like any goals and strategies, have trade-offs, and anyone who thinks their strategy doesn't involve trade-offs either doesn't have a strategy, doesn't understand it, or it is not truly a differentiated strategy. And in our focus on experiential and our dedication to experiential, both gaming and non-gaming, we have to accept the trade-off that it is not a category of real estate transaction that has an endless stream of marketed processes. So we've got to do a lot of work every day, and John and the team and David and the team do work every single day, and Samantha and the team, to identify and chase down opportunities that usually are not marketed, or if they are marketed at all, it's quite quietly. As we look ahead to next year, John and David and Samantha and the teams are working on some very exciting stuff, including bigger assets in gaming, and only time is going to tell if we can bring these to full fruition. We wish, again, there are times when we wish, geez, it'd be nice to have one of these stamping machines where we just stamp out every week a few deals where maybe we bought car washes or dry cleaners or convenience stores or whatever, but that's not what we focus on, that's not what we invest in, and we have to accept the trade-off that our deal flow will be more sporadic. But as we look at 2025, and given what we're working on, we remain confident that we are going to be bringing to the table both gaming and non-gaming deals, big and small. It will continue the growth profile we've had over our seven years.
Operator: The next question comes from John Dave from CBRE. John, your line is open, please go ahead.
John Dave: Ed, John, I wanted to go back to your response to an earlier question because it's something I've been thinking about a lot, and I apologize if your answer is going to be the same, but I wanted to talk about the regional gaming landscape and the trend where we're seeing maybe some new openings and some areas where there's been a lot more unit growth, some cannibalization or same-store sales declines. You mentioned you're being very cognizant of that, but I was curious if you could go into a little bit more detail about investments and some of the things that you'd consider in underwriting. Is it higher rent coverage? Is it unique or certain operators that perhaps have a competitive scale advantage? Would you maybe only consider larger assets that have a couple larger barriers to entry? I'm just curious how you think about deploying capital in regional gaming where maybe the markets, the regulatory environment, I think is a bit more predictable given history, but John, you pointed out some markets that have casinos today that we weren't thinking about before. So I'm curious how you underwrite some of the criteria you might look at.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment, John, but I'd say as a starting point, you really have to look at every situation market-by-market to understand what the competitive marketplace is? And for a given asset and for a given operator, what is their opportunity to carve out a profitable position in that marketplace? It won't necessarily always be the big assets. It could be small assets that in the hands of the right smaller asset operator who knows how to compete and make money with smaller assets in a given market. Those can still be very attractive to us. But it really comes down so much to the degree to which a given operator has a really, really healthy competitive response function. That's something obviously we've always valued, but I think to your implicit point, John, at a time like this, you really want to understand a given operator's ability to compete profitably for market share. John, do you want to add to that? John Payne?
John Payne: Yes, I will, John. When Ed and I started VICI back in 2017, one of the things I asked myself as I left my operating career was would the views from an operator make a difference inside a REIT in the way we underwrite our real estate? To your question, this is where my old job actually has some value in underwriting the business. We can dig into the business and the beauty of our operators is they have great detail on the consumer and where the consumer is coming. If we're looking at an asset that potentially gets their guests from hundreds of miles away, the chance of impact from a new casino is probably greater than an asset that gets their consumers from 15 miles away. That's just one example of how we are going to be disciplined as we go into regional markets. Of course, we'll weigh asset quality, operator quality, credit quality, structure of lease quality, those types of things, but we can also, with our operations background, go in and better understand could it get disrupted should the landscape change? Because remember, about being disciplined, we're not investing just for the near term. I think anyone could invest for the near term and look good. Our mission is for the long term, and I think you need to be disciplined in the environment we're in and understand what could ultimately impact the business, maybe it's not this year or next year, but over the next decade.
John Dave: Thanks. I appreciate the incremental color there. That's helpful. And maybe a quick one. We talked a little bit earlier also about maybe some gaming investments and opportunities in the Las Vegas locals market off the Strip, but the city is just kind of thriving in all ways. I'm curious if some non-gaming stuff outside of the Las Vegas Strip but in the Las Vegas metro area is something that's on the radar and opportunities that are starting to maybe bubble up. I mean, it's becoming a massive sports town, and so thinking about some of the other assets in your portfolio, youth sports, et cetera, is that an area of focus, non-gaming in Las Vegas off the Strip that you're paying attention to or looking at in a meaningful way right now?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll turn it over to John. Yes, I was just going to say it's interesting you bring that up. We've gotten to know Jose Bautista, Joey Batts, as some of you may remember, who is now the owner of the Las Vegas Lights, the soccer team in the USL. As he looks at how he gives his team a really good home in the Las Vegas basin, one of the things we've talked about is the degree to which projects like the Homefield project we've invested in in Kansas City make so much sense in an environment like that in terms of the demand for those kind of youth sport facilities, John would agree. But, John Payne, go ahead, please.
John Payne: Yes, John, it's an excellent question, and when you spend as much time as we have not only on the strip but in the locals market, downtown, and the regional market, many of the operators are entrepreneurs. They're involved in things, not only casinos, which we love casinos, but other experiential assets, and so you're right on point. Ed's right on point. Not only are we studying the opportunity to own great real estate, casino real estate, in these locals regional market of Las Vegas, other opportunities have opened up, and we'll study them and see if there's something that we can get involved in in the near term or even in the long term. Great question.
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Kammert from Evercore. Jim, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jim Kammert: Ed, reflecting on your earlier comments, the rates backing up and obviously a lot of volatility, I would have thought naively, does that not potentially help the Experiential Credit Solutions book, given your ability to close certainty and scale of available capital?
Ed Pitoniak: It does, Jim. It does, and I would say we've got a lot of lines in the water right now on the lending side, but the uncertainty on a week-by-week basis can cause us and any potential borrower to just wonder, well, what is market this week, right? What's my spread this week? But if I commit to this spread, what's that spread going to look like next week? So again, I think it's all part and parcel of capital markets, consumer markets, and just about every other market having been here in a state of flux and volatility that has made decision making more challenging. Jim, I'll just share with you that we began preparation of our annual long-term goals and strategic plan on July 1. We ended up presenting it to our Board at Canyon Ranch in Lenox in mid-September. Over that 70-day period, our stock went from a point that was in two percentage points of our 52-week low and then went to a new 52-week high. And over that period, the U.S. 10-year went from 4.5 down to, I think, as low as 3.6. So again, now we're talking about a period of four months, July, August, September, and October, that have just been really tumultuous. And I think it definitely has affected deal flow and it's affected how we and everybody else underwrite. But I think we all have to hope and believe that things will calm down to a degree where everybody feels a bit more conviction in the visibility and certainty of what they can commit to.
Jim Kammert: That's fair enough. Good comments. And then back to your opening comments regarding the quadrant analysis, I would imagine VICI presumes we're in the top, above the horizontal line in terms of real estate and REIT capital markets. But where are you thinking in terms of the consumer sentiment, et cetera, and how is that potentially influencing how you're thinking about investing going into 2025?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I was hoping somebody would ask that question, Jim. Where do we think we are right now? I would say, yes, we're in the upper right quadrant. Obviously, the consumer generally looks good. But I think it was Smedes who asked a little bit earlier, what is going on across the entire consumer spectrum? And are we seeing signs of potential weakness, whether it be in credit card delinquency, car loan delinquency, footfalls into retail and other metrics? And it's a bit of a mixed picture, but I think overall consumer economic conditions are quite good. And I would say REIT capital market conditions have been generally good since mid-July, but they've certainly been volatile in the last few weeks. So I would say upper right. But what we always focus on, as I alluded to, Jim, is not only where we are, but what do we think the trajectory is in terms of where we might be going. Given the amount of time it takes us to pull a deal together, we need to know where we're likely to be in a period in the future as much as we need to know where we are today.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Last quarter, we spent a lot of time talking about the Harrah's Hoosier Park call option. And remind me if we've spoken about this before, but when I think about that asset and the forum, there's also put options attached to that that expire December of this year. How are you thinking about those put options? Is it likely or have you made any sort of commentary or have they made commentary to you about the likelihood of them exercising those put options? And does that keep capital sidelined as you wait to see what's going to happen there?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, actually, Caesars has stated very explicitly on a number of occasions they have no intention of putting the Indiana assets to us. So, no, that has not affected how we think about our capital and our funding capabilities.
John Kilichowski: Okay, understood. And then maybe on just on the election here, anything on the ballot as it pertains to regional gaming that we should be thinking about?
Ed Pitoniak: Not that I'm aware of. John Payne, are you?
John Payne: Yes, there's a couple things. I mean, there's Missouri, Arkansas and Virginia, New Casino, Virginia, Arkansas, Polk County. And then in Missouri, they are talking about online sports betting as well as in New Casino and Ozark. So, actually quite quiet for gaming, particularly when you compare it to other years.
John Kilichowski: Okay. And then maybe last one for me, the capital that you put to work in the quarter, there was 150 million that went to Venetian. But the other 80 you mentioned loan, and I don't know if I caught the terms of that loan or what fund that was in. Could you give us a little more color on that capital?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. Good to talk to you. Those are the incremental 80 odd million is incremental draws primarily under the Great Wolf loans up in Foxwoods and then the Homefield development as well as some smaller fundings for Cabot and Canyon Ranch. So, previously announced loans that have continued draw schedules.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Guglielmo from Capital One. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Guglielmo: It's been a tough earnings for some operators and Vegas softness seems to be on investor minds. In your experience, do Vegas trends like this impact cap rates for the casino real estate there, or is it too short term and just kind of the nature of owning those assets?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Dan, good to talk to you. I'm going to have John Payne just remind everybody what MGM's occupancy was on the strip in Q3. But when it comes to cap rates, I would say cap rates are probably much more dependent on real estate investment capital market conditions and general valuation trends than they are on operator performance quarter-to-quarter. John, you want to just talk a little bit about how to really understand what's going on in the strip.
John Payne: Well, I am a recovering operator, Dan, as you know. So, I've seen the comments about the performance of our two largest tenants, MGM and Caesars. And you look at some of the numbers and they ran, as Ed was saying, MGM ran 94% occupancy in quarter three. ADR was up some single digits. So, I know as you dig in and as they talk about what's coming up, you see some critical comments about F1, which again, long term F1 is great for the city and short term, it's great for the city. It's driving a weekend that was very slow. It's down a tiny bit from last year. It looks like we'll have to wait and see. But as Ed and I talk about, I'm not sure if a hotel company reported that they had 94% occupancy in quarter three, that there'd probably be a huge party thrown for them. So, it's interesting. It's hard to measure these large assets on an every 90 day period. And these are the best operators in the world. Every time something is thrown at them, they figure out how to continue to grow the business. When every casino was shut down during COVID, they came back and ran them more profitably than they've ever run them before. So, again, if they have a tough 90 days, they'll figure it out over the next 90, 180 next couple years. So, we feel really good about Las Vegas and the teams that are running their businesses there.
Dan Guglielmo: Thank you. Appreciate all that, color. And that makes sense. And just around the experiential partners, it's tough from kind of RC to get a view of how the Great Wolfs, Cabot, and Canyon Ranches of the world are doing in kind of this complex time. So, high level, when you all talk with those partners, what are some of the tailwinds and headwinds that they're thinking about?
Ed Pitoniak: David, you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes, sure. Happy to. Dan, good to speak with you. Look, when you drill into each of the partners, they have an offering that's very unique and part of the reason we partnered with them in the first place. And so, Great Wolfs is a casino without gaming. The performance continues to be solid, maybe a little bit of fall off in the weaker consumer, the lower end consumer, similar to gaming. But the drive to destination of that offering and the affordability of that offering, you can go for a day, you can go for five days, and you don't take vacations away from your kids. And so, their business continues to be strong. They've opened four assets, three assets this year with another one opening early next year up in Foxwoods. And so, the pipeline and the performance of those assets are great. And then we've talked about with Pilgrimage Golf and Cabot, the higher end consumer, the golfer is very, very avid of going out and trying new courses. Cabot does a phenomenal job of bringing in new guests and the marketing that they do for their assets and highlighting the quality of the golf experience that they're providing. And then we've talked about with you in the past around wellness and mindfulness and people's desire for longevity and better living. And so, the Canyon Ranches of the world are performing well and continue to attract customers and provide a level of service that is second to none.
Operator: The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Cohen: Hi, this is Jeremy Cohen for Caitlin. I know you guys mentioned that this was the start of the property growth agreement with the Venetian. Are there any other specific partner property growth opportunities in the pipeline you're considering or can approach by? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: We continuously look for opportunities to invest in our current assets, particularly the ones in Las Vegas. We don't have anything to announce, but as I said in my opening remarks, the Sports Triangle where we own six assets around an area of the town that is growing and becoming more dense, we hope over the coming years there'll be an opportunity for us to invest there, but nothing to announce at this time.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Jeremy, I was just going to add for those of you who don't follow MGM, I'd encourage you to go look at their Q3 earnings deck, which does have a few pages talking about exactly what John Payne just talked about, which is the opportunity to intensify, densify the assets that MGM operates and that we own in the area defined by Allegiant, T-Mobile Arena, and the forthcoming A-Stadium. We stand to be, together with MGM, the biggest beneficiaries of the intensification of that area of Las Vegas. In fact, there's a credit analyst out there who speculated that MGM will actually be the greatest beneficiary when the A-Stadium comes into operation.
Jeremy Cohen: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, one more question. As VICI continues to build relationships and explore opportunities to get recurring transactions and growth, would you say the majority of these new relationships are in the non-gaming space?
Ed Pitoniak: John or David, you want to take that?
John Payne: I'll take that. I wouldn't necessarily say it's more non-gaming at all. There's still opportunities on the gaming side. As we said before, the non-gaming and experiential transactions most likely will be of smaller scale than the gaming side. So, we may have more frequent smaller, and that may lead to more non-gaming partners. But there's still many opportunities with new partners in the casino space, not only in the United States, but all over the world.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. And let me just add that, and because nobody's asked about it in a little while, and that, of course, has to do with the New York gaming license approval process. But when, well, I should say if the day comes, and when the day comes, we hope, that MGM is granted a full gaming license for the property that we own the real estate of in Yonkers, that will be a major property partner growth fund opportunity for VICI.
Operator: Next question comes on David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Katz: I think you may have answered this in part, but I do want to just double back on the non-gaming opportunities, which today are small. And John, I think you touched on the fact that they perhaps remain small. If we look out a little longer term and start thinking three to five years, can they become something that is more or less than 10% or 15%, or I don't expect you to necessarily put a number on it, but give us a vision for how those could become much larger and longer term, please.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I think, David, the way we think about it is really in the context of how do we build our rent base on a year-by-year basis with an ambition to grow the rent base at a base level about maybe three odd percent a year, right? And so that would represent on our current rent base a run rate of about 90 odd million bucks of new rent every year. And so we evaluate every opportunity, including non-gaming opportunities on the degree to which they can contribute to growing rent by a percentage point or two or three. And so when we speak about these smaller non-gaming deals, they are small by the standards of VICI deals. They are actually really large by the standards of conventional net lease deals, which tend to involve buying stores that might have between $200,000 and $400,000 of rent per box versus us doing deals that generally are going to have rents of many millions of dollars of rent per box.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Jenny on for Ron, and thank you for taking my question. I think the first is I want to dig a little deeper on youth sports or recreational sports sector. Can you talk a little bit more on the outlook of this sector? And not only in Vegas, but nationwide, do you see more opportunities for growth? And do you look to do more strategic investment in this area in the next three to five years? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Jenny. Well, we definitely do. And I think you can see how this is manifesting itself in certain private equity firm investments in youth sport. Harris Blitzer is obviously a very good example, or I should say David Blitzer's family office is a great example of a company that's really focused on youth sport. And you see that in a number of shops. And they're all capitalizing on the way in which youth sport has grown as a key, key component of youth and family culture. And it's a little hard to tell exactly right now, given the data, what the youth population is going to look like over the coming years. But I can tell you anecdotally, there are a lot of little kids out there right now. Again, I'm not sure the data totally picks it up. But we were comparing notes on Halloween trigger treating participation rates last night. And I know, and Samantha was just blown away by how many kids were roaming the streets of Westport, Connecticut. And there's a lot of kids out there, and a lot of them are going to play sports at a high level. And we think that the need for facilities is only going to grow.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, I agree. The data side is a little bit tricky to get for youth sports. I guess my second question is, I want to know if you want to discuss more on the talent diversification strategy, like acknowledging VICI already have a pretty diversified talent base. But is there any specific sector that you think you want to broaden the current talent base? Any specific sector that you prefer going forward? Do you have more exposure?
Ed Pitoniak: John or David?
John Payne: Well, I'll talk. I think the question was about
David Kieske: Go ahead, John.
John Payne: Go ahead, David. No, go ahead. Go ahead.
David Kieske: Yes, I think the question, Jenny, just to make sure I heard you, is about Canada, right? And we look at Canada, we look at the globe internationally. And John touched on this comment about gaming operators earlier, that there's both gaming and non-gaming opportunities across the globe. We've spoken with a lot of you about how our team has really mapped the globe and tried to focus on where we can buy real estate. And that's a function of currency markets, rule of law, tax regime. Certain countries have very, very high foreign taxes on foreign real estate ownership, so that negates some of the competitive opportunity. But specifically in Canada, we've obviously made our first foreign investment into Canada since then. We've gone into Scotland, into St. Lucia. We'd like to do both more gaming and non-gaming north of the border. And we think there's great operators up there, great economies up there, great parts of the experiential spectrum that we'd like to go into. And so we don't have anything immediate, as John would say, but hopefully there's more to come up there.
Operator: I'll now hand the call back to Edward for some closing remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, Adam. Thanks to everybody for joining us today. And hey, guess what? Guess where NAREIT is, this November in, I guess it's just a couple of weeks. It is in Las Vegas. We hope we see many of you there. We've got a lot of great events that are going to help showcase what's going on in Las Vegas and reach out to some of our respective banking partners if you're interested in those events because they're going to be fun. With that, bye for now.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties' Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today. August 1, 2024. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Samantha, please go ahead.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties' website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, and our second quarter 2024 earnings release or supplemental information and filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Laurie McCluskey, Senior President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. As you may have figured out by now, I enjoyed putting my thoughts together for VICI's earnings call. I try to share through these opening remarks, not only what we've done, but what we're observing and learning from the marketplace. I may not always succeed in sharing anything genuinely fresh, but at the very least, I don't want my opening remarks to become repetitive. When I began putting these thoughts together in early July, the risk of repetitive remarks was high given that, until a couple of weeks ago, for REITs generally and net lease REIT specifically, not a lot had changed since last quarter's earnings call when I spoke of the big tech investing party that we REITs hadn't been invited to. In Bank of America's most recent fund manager survey, Michael Hart net showed that fund managers were underweight real estate at a level equal to and not being since the great -- the depth of the great financial crisis. Then came a welcome CPI print and REITs have begun to come back that we believe can endure. Before you hear from John and David, and before we field your questions, let me say a few words about the principles that guide us in a REIT marketplace like the ones we've been living through for a while now. We start by asking ourselves is what we're going through, whether for all REITs generally or net lease REIT specifically, cyclical or secular in nature. There are REIT sectors that have secular issues right now. Office is an obvious example of a sector with negative secular trends. Data centers is the obvious sector with positive secular trends. We strongly believe that experiential real estate is another real estate category with positive secular trends as evidenced by research recently published by McKinsey showing that indexed back to 1959, the share of consumer discretionary income spent on experiences has grown to an index level of nearly 160, while the share of consumer discretionary income spent on things has shrunk to less than 75. Capitalizing on positive secular trends is fun, addressing negative secular trends, not so much. Positive cycles for REITs are fun, negative cycles for our specific REIT sector not so much. But it's always key to remember that cycles begin and cycles end, almost always driven by factors that are beyond the control of a REIT management team and Board. In a period of lagging stock performance, driven by cyclical factors, it can be tempting for REIT management teams and boards to start deviating from the REIT's long-term goals and strategies in hopes that the deviation can somehow overcome the cycle. At VICI, we strive very hard not to deviate. Here's the strategic principle we strive to stay true to in all cycles. We dedicate ourselves to investing in experiential buildings that meet these three fundamental quality factors. Location quality, in other words, well located in markets that have sound fundamental demographics and economics. Asset quality, meaning designed and built to serve the distinct needs of experiential businesses that have high economic dynamism and economic durability. Operator quality, meaning occupied by an experiential operator that has high economic energy, ingenuity and expertise, and a strong balance sheet and credit profile. With every investment we make, we, of course, seek accretion as measured in AFFO per share. But that is not the only accretion we seek and measure. With every investment opportunity we evaluate, in addition to AFFO accretion, we ask, is a given investment opportunity accretive to asset quality. Is a given investment accretive to tenant diversity and tenant quality? Is a given investment accretive to geographic and potentially categorical diversity and quality? Finally, can it give an investment be accretive to balance sheet quality and, potentially, our credit ratings? We have not and will not grow for growth's sake, if that growth doesn't continuously improve the quality and intrinsic value of our portfolio and balance sheet. We will not, as some of our net lease peers do, tell you we spend x hundreds of millions of dollars and y percentage cap rate to generate z dollars of new rent, but then never tell you into what we invested that amount of money. We will tell you what we invest in so that you can know what you own. The very good news is that our business development team, led by John Payne, is identifying and developing opportunities to meet our broader accretion criteria. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. We acted on the investment criteria Ed just spoke of when, in the second quarter, we made capital commitments of up to $950 million in the highly differentiated experiential buildings that have indispensable value to their occupants, namely the Venetian and a collection of Great Wolf Resorts. These are investments that live up to our quality criteria, and at the same time, the $650 million firmly committed to those investments will generate a blended investment yield of 7.9%. Our conviction that we can continue to identify and invest in experiential properties that are accretive against multiple quality factors is a key reason that we have decided that we will not be exercising our call right to acquire Harrah’s Hoosier Park in Horseshoe, Indianapolis. We can and are making this decision because of our confidence and conviction that we are actively identifying and pursuing investment opportunities that enable us to generate future AFFO growth and accretion, while furthering the strength and diversity of our portfolio and tenant roster. At this time, we believe that we have the opportunity to create greater portfolio value by allocating VICI's capital to other gaming and nongaming opportunities the team is actively pursuing. This is an approach that we believe will produce 2024 AFFO [Indiscernible], bit higher in our net lease category. And with our newly [Indiscernible], we're in 2024 growth 2% at the midpoint is nearly 3 times the 2024 AFFO per growth rate guided into last week by our one gaming REIT peer. The factor that continues to accrue to our overall portfolio quality and structured tenant credit is the success of the dynamic city of Las Vegas, where VICI collects 45% of our rent from assets that we own. Over the years, I've cited on record-breaking [Indiscernible] in the first half of 2024. Harry Read International Airport had back-to-back record months reporting 5.1 million passengers arriving and parting in June. June was the third best month ever. Trailing May, the second best month ever. And October of 2023 was the best month ever. In May, international visitation of Vegas also jumped 23% year-over-year. And in June, it was reported that city officials are contemplating adding a second airport to Las Vegas, with executives from Southwest Airlines stating and I quote, "It feels like any flight we add in a Vegas gets filled. It's almost this insatiable appetite for people wanting to come and see Vegas." Our Las Vegas tenants continue to benefit from this momentum as evidenced by our up to $700 million capital investment to fund extensive reinvestment projects at the Venetian in exchange for increased rent. The size and the success of our gaming properties allows us a unique opportunity to put large dollars to work into assets we already own. There continues to be a variety of opportunities on the horizon [Indiscernible] to the growth of our portfolio. Casino gaming assets continue to present the largest opportunity, both domestically and internationally, inclusive of investment opportunities into the casino resort properties we already own. The magnitude and consistency of gaming cash flows and the creativity of our gaming tenants continue to drive conviction in this section, and have set the blueprint REIT to extend our TAM and other experiential sectors. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Based on balance sheet, liquidity, results and our updated full year guidance, which we are very excited about. As we work on the right side of the balance sheet, we are constantly focusing on VICI's balance sheet quality, bringing our leverage further down within our range of 5 times to 5.5 times, diligently working with the rating agencies to improve our credit ratings over time and ultimately lowering our cost of capital, balancing the right long-term leverage for the company, all while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our owners. In terms of dry powder, as of today, we have approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $347 million in cash and cash equivalents, $566 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding cohorts and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold 4 million shares and received approximately $115 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds were used to partially fund the Venetian capital investment John mentioned earlier. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled foreign equity is approximately 4.4 times -- excuse me, 5.4 times, within our target leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into counter hedge portfolio at a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 5.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We are very proud to deliver this continued consistent growth to our owners. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items, and we have the highest net income margin in the S&P 500 as noted in an article published by Barron's during the month of July. Our G&A was $15.8 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, it was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance. We are raising our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to now be between $2.35 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.24 and $2.26 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance range, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.7%. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we have mentioned in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis which was its inherent unpredictability leaves us enable forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of productivity on our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: Well, thanks for the update on the plans to not execute options that you have this year. I guess just as you think bigger picture, on deals you might do going forward and the options that you might create, does the way that this one ended up kind of working out or turning out, and your decision-making process have any impact on, I guess, how you structure options in the future, what the details might be, how far in advance they are? Anything like that.
Ed Pitoniak: John or David, do you want to take a first crack at that in terms of how we think about options going forward?
John Payne: Yes, it's a very good question. I do think it's important. I heard my comments were broken also a little bit. But it is important to understand that this was a strategic decision really based on capital allocation and portfolio management at this time. We have great conviction with opportunities that are in front of us that will further our tenant and geographical and category diversity. And as we continue to look at opportunities and we negotiate put calls or renegotiate [Indiscernible], we'll think about the length of those and the appropriate times of those. Again, it's important to understand that we have great conviction to continue to grow the business around the world.
Caitlin Burrows: And just as a follow-up on that geographic diversity point, I noticed the prepared remarks also mentioned international potential opportunities. So just wondering if you comment further on kind of what sort of international opportunities for this side type of you think could come up over the medium term or where?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. Another good question. We have been busy traveling, not only domestically, but internationally. And I think on other calls, we've talked about countries that we've been studying. We've spent some time in Australia, in New Zealand. We've spent some time in Europe and the U.K. and other parts of the world where it makes sense and our capital can work. I don't have anything to announce now obviously, but we see opportunities to continue to diversify not only in location, but with new tenants as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: As you look at that international opportunity set, just curious how that's split between gaming and non-gaming?
Ed Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that once again?
John Payne: It seems like I am answering the first three questions today, Barry, but it's all good. I'm not sure we'll have the exact percentage of what's going to come in gaming and non-gaming. But I think you can imagine when we travel around the world, we spend time in countries with legalized gaming and understanding the real estate of those assets, while at the same time meeting with experiential operators. In my remarks, and I've said this for the past 7 years, the greatest opportunity we see is still in casino gaming, both domestically and internationally. But we do spend time with operators in both the experiential sectors in gaming when we travel around the world.
Ed Pitoniak: And Barry, I'll just add that -- Barry, I'll just add that pretty much by definition and by logic, the dollar percentage will always tend -- whether domestically or internationally, the dollar percentage will very much favor gaming investment given the magnitude of the assets and the capital required to acquire them.
Barry Jonas: And then just as a follow-up, seriously how you're thinking about your strip land and just development these days. You obviously owned several acres on the strip and office strip, and then your -tenant caesars is now talking about maybe selling some noncore assets, which I presume include land.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. So Barry we -- as John talked about in his opening remarks, we are just great believers in the Las Vegas ecosystem, which is obviously got ganing at its center. But as we see with really almost each passing quarter, the amount of innovation that's going on in terms of the broadening and deepening of Las Vegas experiences truly makes it like no other place on earth. We obviously have a lot of exposure to Las Vegas right now as a percentage of our annual base rent. But we would -- we are and we will be very comfortable and continuing to invest incremental capital, much the way we did with the Venetian investment in Las Vegas, because it is, is truly one of a kind destination in the world. And that has implications, obviously, for putting incremental money into the assets we already own, with the Venetian, with our Caesar asset, and especially, obviously, given magnitude of MGM assets we own, particularly at the South end of the strip that's seeing more and more demand drivers. And then in addition to that, as you alluded to, we do have a vacant land that, over the coming years and decades, obviously represents further potential to invest capital and broaden and deepen our exposure to Las Vegas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.
Wes Golladay: I know you target full cycle investments with high-quality partners, but there has been some pockets of weakness in the consumer. Has this led you to change how you're looking at the current acquisition pipeline?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. It's a very good question, Wes. And obviously, whether it's the McDonald's earnings report or other earnings reports, you are starting to hear about weakness, especially in the lower end consumer. And even recently, there's been some talk among gaming operators about seeing some weakness on -- at the lower end in the regionals. I would not say at this point it's yet affected how we are thinking about our investments going forward. We focusing on the categories of experiences that we do, focusing generally on middle to higher end, it hasn't caused concern for us yet. Especially when, of course, you take in the existential fact that we as a net lease asset owner are not exposed to the variability quarter-by-quarter in consumer spending.
Wes Golladay: And then you do have a highly predictable business model, but you have the Caesars lease coming up in November. It does have a variable component. That's a little bit harder to model. Could you maybe put some goalposts on that, how we should think of that?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Wes. It is a good question. We're entering lease year 8 with Caesars. Hard to believe it's -- we're getting the lease year 8. So it seems like yesterday we started this company. But November 1 will be the start of that year and there does -- start of that lease year and there does become a variable component and a base component. And we are -- the way that the calculation runs for the Vegas lease, 80% is based, 20% is variable for the regional lease, it's 70% based and 30% variable. It's based on a comparison of net revenues for years 5 through 7 versus year 0 through 1. We are still collecting the data of Caesars because the calculation period actually runs through September of 2024. But based on what we're seeing, it should be relatively neutral to no impact to our escalation in November 1, 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE?
John DeCree: Maybe one on your decision today to say that you're not going to move forward with Centaur. So I thought you may have had until the end of the year to make a decision, and so we certainly can appreciate being decisive and looking at your pipeline. But curious if you could talk a little bit about why make that announcement today with still maybe several months ahead to consider that?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very, very good question, John. The reason we decided to announce this today is that the strategic factors that went into making our decision are of a nature that they were not going to change over the ensuing, whatever it is now left in the year, 5 months of the year. And so in fairness, obviously, to our partners at Caesars, but also recognizing our need to always be as ruthlessly efficient as we can be with return on management time, we decided -- again, because the strategic decision factors will not change in the next 5 months, decided to announce it today. So that everyone can understand, our team can understand, Caesars can understand, you all can understand that we will not be calling it, and none of us have to spend time wondering if and when wee might between now and the very end at the end of the year.
John DeCree: And that's probably but the last question from us get us on Centaur, although there's been many over the last 8 months or so. So I appreciate that. Maybe bigger picture, in terms of underwriting gaming assets today, so a lot has happened. We've talked about some of consumer trends. We've looked at where some recent deals have gone out. And just kind of curious if your -- any updated thoughts on how you think about full 4-wall coverage kind of cap rates in the gaming space now. There's a little bit more strict in how you think about 4-wall coverage and kind of where you think cap rates are going. And I know kind of every asset and transaction is a little different, but just high level, would be good to kind of get any kind of thinking on broad strokes.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Yes. So I think our starting point, John, is that we always want our capital investments to pass the test of if this was our last dollar capital, would this be the highest and best use of that capital. And as we have engaged in the continuous learning given at the heart of our creation of VICI is both a company and a culture, I think very much to the point of the question you're asking, we continue to refine our thinking on what will drive the strongest, continuous improvement in our access to and our cost of capital. And that really guides our decision-making in many different forms, including, obviously, tenant diversity, geographic diversity, tenant credit quality, strength of tenant balance sheet and, very much to your point, rent coverage. So as we look at that, that mosaic factors, we -- again, we feel very good about the discipline we've developed around capital allocation. And the degree to which it can, again, just to stress the point, lead ultimately to strongest comparative cost of capital advantage over the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi.
Nick Joseph: Maybe just following up on the [Indiscernible] question. Is this deal fully bedded? And I guess would -- is there any chance that the assets are put to you? Or is that all put to that as well?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: The way the contract reads, you are correct, that the assets could be put to us. But Tom Reeg at Caesars, I think, has been very vocal about this, at least over the past year, that they had no plans to put these two assets to us. But the contract does last until the end of the year, as we spoke about earlier today.
Nick Joseph: And then just as we look to November, I'm just curious if there's any legislative issues on any ballots that you're watching that could be important for regional gaming.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: We all take that -- yes, I'll take that, Ed. We continue to look not only, I think you mentioned regional gaming, but I think we're looking all over the world where there are changes happening to the good, and I guess it could be to the bad, but where are there going to be opportunities to deploy capital with new tenants and new locations, possibly in new categories. And there are some places around the world that are going through quite a bit of change that we're better understanding. We'll continue to watch opportunities in the United States as well. Every year, I think you know the state of Texas and the state of Georgia, state of Kentucky often come out with some form of gaming. And then obviously, with online sports betting, which is spread across the United States, there will be other states that think about that. And usually, in some deals, they talk about the bricks-and-mortar casinos. So not specifically, but we stay in touch to see if there ultimately will be some opportunities for us to invest. And then I'll finally say, we continue to monitor New York, where that process continues to proceed into 2025. And we'll have a better understanding when 3 licenses will be awarded and to whom they are awarded.
Ed Pitoniak: Nick, I would just add that -- Nick, I'll just add that we obviously do monitor continuous -- continuing legislative change and, in many cases, the associated emergence of new supply across American regional gaming. And I do think we obviously need to take care, as capital allocators, that as we allocate capital into regional gaming assets, which we will continue to do. They were doing so aware of the supply-demand trends on a mark-to-market basis. Because in regional gaming, catchment areas for regional gaming, obviously tend to be more confined than we would find in Las Vegas, because the catchment area for Las Vegas is global. As John said in his opening remarks, international travel to Vegas has rebounded stronger than any place else in the U.S., probably one of the strongest international travel rebounds around the world. And so while new supply will come to Las Vegas, it will come into a market whose catchment area, again, is global. And we obviously need to be mindful in regional areas that the catchment areas are somewhat infinite, and we need to weigh our capital allocation decisions based upon supply/demand trends on a highly localized basis.
Operator: And the next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Ravi Vaidya: This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Just had a couple of quick follow-ups here on the Indiana assets. Was the cap rate not attractive enough in the current rate environment? And did the emergence of Bala Chicago coming up the next 5 years' payroll as it could possibly impact casino operations throughout the midwest?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll let John take the second part of that. On the first part, the cap rate is perfectly fine cap rate. As we look across our array of investment opportunities and as we contemplated potentially investing more than $2 billion of capital or close to 5% of our total capital, we, again, wanted to be relentless in our scrutiny as what would this be the highest and best use of our capital both on a cap rate basis and the associated accretion, but also on the key, if you will, nonfinancial accretion factors of tenant diversity, geographic diversity and those secondary factors. So the cap rate by itself was not the gaining issue. And then I will turn it over to John for his thoughts on midwestern gaming.
John Payne: Yes. The question about will the facility that ultimately is built in downtown Chicago will impact the Indianapolis to casinos, the answer is now on that. To Ed's comments earlier about where consumers go to regional gaming and how far do they drive, the Indianapolis market is considerably far away from downtown Chicago. In fact, there's many other casinos between Indianapolis and Chicago that consumers can choose from as well. So that was not a factor in our decision to not call the to Indianapolis asset.
Ravi Vaidya: How large do you forecast the experiential credit solution strategy to become? And we noticed you have a couple of deals with Great Wolf here over the years, how important is that as a defense and entertainment option in this recessionary environment?
Ed Pitoniak: David, do you want to take the first part of that?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ravi. Roughly, our credit book today is $2.2 billion, it's 4% to 5% of total assets, and we feel good in and around that area. We developed a credit book as a way to broaden our means and to expand our relationships. And you've heard us talk about, at the end of the day, our capital is relationship capital. And the credit book allows us to develop new partnerships, develop new relationships, ultimately through some of the deals that have call options at our discretion. But along the way, we learn about new segments and new businesses, and we've learned things that ultimately we may not like, we -- our loan gets repaid and we move on. But if we learn things we like, we continue to want to grow in those areas through either real estate ownership or deepening the existing relationships. So it's been a very, very effective tool and it's been something we're excited about, and something that we continue to use in our toolkit as we expand both domestically and internationally.
Ed Pitoniak: And Ravi, could you repeat the second half of that question?
Ravi Vaidya: Sure. We've had a couple of deals with the Great Wolf over the years, I just wanted to hear your comments on how this is particularly defensive and important entertainment source as we go into a recessionary environment here where the consumer is stretched?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. David, do you want to talk about what we have seen historically on Great Wolf's durability through all cycles?
David Kieske: Yes. In the broader indoor water park sector or, broadly, Gabe Wasserman is in the room here and he did our first white paper back in '18 when we started looking at indoor water parks and the economic vitality of these businesses. When the original Great Wolf went public back in '04, '05, it was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday business. Now it's a 7-day a week business. And we call them casinos without gaming, because of the economic leverage they have and the multiple cash registers they have, both with the water park, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage, the lodging. And as an example, Perryville opened just earlier this year -- last year. And within 3 months, it was exceeding its initial underwriting and ultimately went into the broader refi package. So these things open, they open quick and they open producing a lot of cash flow. So we're excited about that. And hopefully, there's an opportunity someday to own the real estate of some of these indoor water park businesses.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz: So a little bit of a different -- great, a little bit of a different kind of question for John, which is through our window past couple of days, we've seen a pretty consistent outlook shift to something more moderate or even down, specifically around leisure transient activities across hospitality. And not that it will impact your earnings stream imminently, but John, I assume in your travels, you have a finger on that pulse as well. I just would love a little bit of insight from what you're seeing and hearing through your window, please?
John Payne: Yes, David. Nice to talk to you. And hopefully, I'll see you on the road while I'm traveling. Look, you are correct. We're hearing in some businesses some softness and hearing about the consumer, and Ed touched on this earlier in his comments, particularly around the lower-end consumer. I was telling my colleague, David, a story about I was in Scotland recently. And every person I met talked about visiting United States. And guess what city -- if they were only going 2 to 3 cities, they said they would have to go to, it was Las Vegas. And what's become so interesting traveling the world is that 10 years ago, that wouldn't have been the answer, right? Everyone has said, I flying to New York. When I hit Chicago, I'm going to go on to San Francisco and the West Coast, and you probably wouldn't hear about Las Vegas. The beauty about what our tenants have done is diversifying the reasons to come to Las Vegas. And no matter what sector, whether you're in the high-end sector that comes by private jet, or where you're a sector that, like myself, travels by Southwest Airlines, they continue to attract different folks to that city. So I'm not giving you a macro answer about the whole world of the United States, I'm giving you an answer about where we look to put our money and where our money is right now, and that's why we're so bullish on Las Vegas. As we study other sectors, as we study other parts of the world, we will definitely make sure we understand what the consumer is doing up and down with spending tree. But I will tell you, in my travels, I'm excited about where we have our money and continue to put money in because that people are traveling to that destination of Las Vegas.
Ed Pitoniak: And that -- operator, before we go to the next question, I'd just like to add to David Katz's question. In a time like this, where we could be potentially looking at a period of economic volatility as measured in consumer spending, it really highlights the value of dividend-paying stocks when it comes to reducing the volatility of the equity versus the volatility of the consumer economy. And that is why, again, we're so careful in what we investing because we want to make sure we're investing in assets and partner relationships that we believe very strongly can endure up and down cycles in consumer spending. We do not go seeking C guard but real estate, to use the old Benjamin Graham term. We are seeking real estate that we know can endure a cycle and cycle out and has positive secular trends, such that we can feel very confident in our ability to continually pay a dividend and steadily grow the dividend ideally at a rate that is equal to or exceed inflation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Herring from Green Street.
Michael Herring: My question on balance sheet. Your [Indiscernible] $2 billion in notes coming due in the first half of next year. How did that factor into the decision to not exercise those call rights, particularly as you look to potentially reduce your leverage and earn a better investment-grade rating?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn it over to David in a moment, Michael. But I would say it really factored in, virtually not at all. And not that we're not mindful of the obligation we have to refinance as effectively as we can in the coming year. But we, again, made the decision we made on those call rights because of how compelling our other investment opportunities are, which you should be hearing about in due course. And so that was not a constraining factor. And Dave, I don't know if you want to add anything in terms of how we're thinking about leverage and the ratings curve.
David Kieske: Yes. No, you touched on it, Ed. It's portfolio management around not exercising the book call. Michael, in terms of the balance sheet, we've got 3 maturities next year, February, May and June. And as you saw us actively and very successfully refi our 2024 maturity with a well, well, well oversubscribed refinancing that we did back in March, we're working and planning towards refi those maturities that, again, come due first part -- in the first quarter and then in late second quarter of '25. And then you saw our peer, GLPI, had a very, very successful refi or a debt offering 2 days ago. And being investment-grade rated, having a very deep liquid investment-grade credit profile accrues to our benefit. And we're -- we feel very good about our ability to refi those maturities and continue to extend and ladder our maturity profile. And ultimately, over time, my data the BBB curve, lowering our cost of capital being able to continue to compete for asset acquisitions across the globe.
Michael Herring: Maybe just one more, switching gears a little bit. As there's been some M&A chatter on the operator side, can you just speak broadly -- maybe this is more for John on just the practical protection that VICI has on its master leases in the event there is a change of control on the operator side.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's a very good question, Michael. It's a hard one to answer simply because we have -- we used to be a company when we started that had 1 or 2 leases, now we've got over double digits. But in all our leases, we do have protection. Samantha Gallagher, our General Counsel is on the line, that could add to that. But we feel good. We're staying in touch with our operators to better understand what's going on in the market. I think you used the word chatter, I think that's probably the best word out there right now. But we do have protection in our many leases that we have. Sam, I don't know if you would like to add anything to the question?
Samantha Gallagher: Yes, John, you did a great job. I think just to John's point, while we do have a number of different leases, all of our leases are mined. What happens in a change of control and have strong protections to ensure. And just as a reminder, we have gone through a change of control with one of our tenants already, where -- we see the Caesars Eldorado merger. So we feel very comfortable with how our leases are structured to address any change and control.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Kammert from Evercore.
Jim Kammert: David, was there anything in particular that led you to bump the guidance at this point? I mean the acquisition investing activity has been well disclosed and you don't include prospective activity and guidance. So I was just curious there are 1 or 2 factors that motivated to do it at this time?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: I mean, Jim, you touched on that. I think when we lapped our first quarter earnings call, the thing -- the funding timing and some of the -- how we were going to fund some of the announcements that we had previously made weren't finalized. And so as we talked about in our guidance, we don't project any unknown capital markets activities or any unidentified or unknown activities. So those announcements plus the continued funding through our loan book has led us to feel very confident about the increase in guidance and feel very good about achieving that guidance. And a lot of it came from the Great Wolf impact, which closed slightly after our earnings.
Jim Kammert: And then the second question, please. Ed, you almost get -- I've obviously enthused about you said your alternatives to invest capital other than the Caesar option properties. Obviously not going to give us a whole lot of color, but are they -- these future opportunities, is this a ramp in the tools of bucket or opportunity set in dollar value in your mind? What would the split maybe be between further credit book or more fee interest?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. It will very much predominantly be fee interested, Jim. And I think one thing you can expect is that as we continue to allocate capital it will be on a cadence that is not necessarily as heavily weighted to one single investment, as would have been the case with the Indiana assets. Again, that -- just to reiterate, that would have been almost 5% of capital into one deal. And I do think as a REIT from both a return and a risk management point of view, we will always be very happy to achieve a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, which, again, will be principally in gaming and principally fee over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo.
John Kilichowski: Kind of going back to the embedded growth pipe, maybe if we can jump down to the experiential side following the comments of Heros and Caesars. I'm just curious, and I know that these are a little less pressing in terms of time line, but how are you thinking about the call options for Canyon Ranch and Cabot and home field to market retail?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, John, I'm happy to start with that. And before I do, I just wanted to add one last comment to the last question that Jim Kammert asked. And that has to do with not only a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, that lends itself to a more sustained and sustainable funding cadence as opposed to the need to draw a whole lot of funding at one time for one deal. Anyway, to go on to your question about Cabot, Canyon Ranch and the others, we obviously -- we're talking here about assets that are under development or otherwise ramping. So we will obviously take the time we need and the time the operator needs to get the assets to where they can best sustain the opco/propco model, none of which at this point are immediately imminent. We were very excited about, obviously, what Cabot is doing in Cabot Citrus Farms. They have really created some session there. And I think, Samantha, we're pretty confident in saying that we look forward to the day when we can exercise our call right at Cabot Citrus Farms. But in the meantime, Samantha, do you want to add any color to what we're seeing in terms of mind share and market share.
Samantha Gallagher: Yes -- no, thanks, Ed. Just as some may know, when we follow and we talk about the Cabot relationship, they continue to expand their global portfolio. We're excited about that and we're excited about our opportunities in the future to exercise our call rights. No changes in our commitment there.
John Kilichowski: And then maybe just jumping quickly to your guidance. And there was a sentence there that reflects the dilutive effect of the roughly 90 million shares, under your for sale agreements. Just wondering what the -- like the impact of that dilutive effect for the rest of the year?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. Yes, it's very minimal. If we've got to account for the forwards under the treasury stock dilution method, and it's a very, very minimal impact to the share count that shows up in our guidance range.
Operator: Our next question comes from R.J. Milligan from Raymond James.
R.J. Milligan: I think John was probably a little early calling the last question on Centaur. I just have one follow-up. There was some overhang on the stock given the uncertainty, the Centaur assets. And I'm curious how much of an impact that had on your decision to announce today that you wouldn't be calling the assets? I'm just curious if we can interpret that as doing other opportunities between now and the end of the year that you may pursue and don't want this overhang on your cost of equity?
Ed Pitoniak: R.J., Good to hear be from you. That was not a deciding factor by any means. Obviously, we are aware, we're aware of the perception of overhang on the stock, and that was obviously -- it felt like a more significant factor through much of Q2 and even into the first couple of weeks of Q3 given the general state of the REIT equity market. But no, that wasn't a deciding factor and are deciding to announce it now. Again, the real driving factor was just to make sure everybody understood we've made a decision. And we're comfortable -- very comfortable announcing the decision. Very comfortable that we have very compelling other opportunities to allocate capital. And again, I would just go back to the point of our desire -- and we won't achieve it every time, but our desired capital allocation and capital funding strategies are based on being sustained and sustainable. We obviously spent a good number of our early years doing very big deals that had very big funding requirements, that generally needed to happen all in one day. And as VICI matures and as we achieve a sustained and sustainable cadence in AFFO growth, we want that to be driven by a sustained and sustainable cadence in both capital allocation activity, i.e., acquisitions and funding.
R.J. Milligan: Should we interpret that funding comment as you're likely to be a bigger user of the ATM going forward versus overnights?
Ed Pitoniak: I'll turn that over to David. But before I do, we obviously want to take care that the market never develops VICI ATM fatigue. And with that, I'll turn it over to David for any further color he wants to add.
David Kieske: No. Ed, you stole my line. That's exactly right. You've heard us say, under Mo’'s leadership, we have a balanced approach to raising equity, whether that be an ATM, blocks, overnights, smart deals in connection with larger transactions. So we want to ensure that we raise capital the most efficiently, but also ensure that we are not developing or becoming stale in our style and then developing fatigue out there with our owners.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Guglielmo from Capital One Securities.
Dan Guglielmo: Just one from me on the credit solution investments. Most of the recent growth has been in the mezz and preferred investments, which do historically carry more risk. How are you all monitoring those investments? And could you pull future funding commitments if the macro economy does get choppy?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Gabe is the envy of the VICI experiential credit solutions. He's here in the room, our Chief Accounting Officer. So for this Credit Solutions head on and answer that.
Gabe Wasserman: Dan, thanks for the question. So we're very and thoughtful with our underwriting. Even though those certain investments are structured as mezz and preferred equity, we're very thoughtful about where our attachment point is and our last dollar. Looking at the operating history of the property kind of future underwriting projections and strength and sophistication of the sponsor, so that all goes into our underwriting. We have quarterly investment loan reviews, where we're working at the property performance and discuss it as a management team. And then in terms of contractual rights, if there's something that went sideways in the macro economy, generally, that wouldn't allow us to have funding. But we certainly have protections under all of our loan agreements, that the borrowers have to meet certain conditions precedent in order for us to fund.
Ed Pitoniak: And Dan -- Dan, this is Ed. I would just add that we are always lending against experiential assets, that, in a worst-case scenario, would meet our strategic investment criteria. If again, in the worst case, the asset ever came into our hands, we would want -- we always want these to be assets that, in the worst case, we would be willing to own.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.
Chad Beynon: You guys a few times have highlighted the strength in Las Vegas, some of the stats in terms of visitation, which is obviously being driven by the casino assets, but also the growth in sports and entertainment that we've seen out there, that gets a lot of people who don't visit the casino to still come to the city. So with that in mind, you obviously benefit from the visitation. But has anything changed in terms of you looking to do deals with some of those live entertainment, concert event stadium types of businesses? And how do you think about the durability and pricing of that sector?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's a great question, Chad. And I think you've heard us over the years talk about the sectors that we're looking at. And obviously, we've made investments in Pilgrim's Golf, indoor water parks, wellness sports. I think you're asking us a question about would we make an investment in the live entertainment, real estate and facilities. I know you're asking that question about Las Vegas, but would we also -- I think filters out into the rest of the United States. It is a sector that we have been spending some time and better understanding. We love what has happened in the city of Las Vegas with the growth of sports and entertainment. We're better understanding the economics of what happens inside those big buildings. They're absolutely beautiful and the shows are great, but can they support our model. And we're continuing to study that. And could there be an investment over time? There could be. But we want to make sure that the cash flows are durable and that the operator is a tenant that we want to be partners with for a long time. But it sure is exciting how Las Vegas has diversified its revenue stream and attracting new consumers by adding sports and entertainment, not just gambling and food and nightlife.
Operator: And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand over to Edward Pitoniak for any final remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Carla. And we'll just thank all of you for your time on today's call. And wish you, once earnings season is over, an enjoyable rest of the summer. Bye for now.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 2, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. 
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
 Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.
 During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2024 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective companies' public filings with the SEC.
 Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. 
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter of 2024 was, shall we say, an interesting quarter in the American equity marketplace. A fair part of the S&P 500 packed into a house and held a magnificent party. One Wall Street shop went so far as to say the party reached the rarified state of euphoria. Euphoria, that sounds kind of fun. But to be clear, American REITs were not invited to this party.
 Those of us who work within REITs were out on the curb outside that party house. From the outside, one could wonder if this was a party in which new monarchs were being coronated for perpetual rule or the kind of party that eventually ends with ambulances and/or cops being called and a few of the partygoers fleeing naked down the street out of their minds like Will Ferrell in Old School.
 The first quarter of 2024 is now over. The ambulances or cops haven't necessarily showed up yet, but the party inside that magnificent house seems to be running out of steam. The MOVE Index, which measures U.S. treasury market volatility, was relatively high but relatively steady through much of the first quarter and even fell a bit in late March in a flight to safety, but in early April, started acting rowdy again. And it's much the same with the VIX equity volatility index, which having slept through much of the magnificent party, recently spiked almost 50% since the start of the year before settling back down.
 Amidst all this noise, the general investment marketplace is having a hard time focusing on the income and capital appreciation dynamics of good REITs. At VICI, we can deal with all of this. We don't spend a lot of time standing on curbs wondering or complaining about parties we're not invited to. We just keep doing what we do at VICI, and that's working within our resources and capabilities to keep improving and growing our company for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders. That's what we did in Q1 2024.
 The first quarter of 2024 was a quarter in which we produced 6.1% growth in AFFO per share over Q1 2023 and continued to flow our revenue growth through to the EBITDA line at what we believe is one of the higher rates among S&P 500 REITs. The first quarter of 2024 was also a quarter in which we focused on 3 key strategic imperatives: imperative number one, expanding our scope and TAM in investment with our investment in Homefield Kansas City, a market-leading sports training complex that will also soon feature a Margaritaville resort. This is an investment that builds on our initial entry into the sports and recreation sector with a late 2023 acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in Chelsea Piers, an investment that validates the use of our lending platform to ultimately acquire a real estate interest, in this case, 780,000 magnificent square feet of New York recreational and entertainment space on the Hudson River.
 Imperative number two, being ready to refinance our maturing 2024 debt at an opportune time, debt that would have come due on May 1; yesterday, in other words. During Q1, May 1st seemed a fair way off, but given the volatility of market conditions, we didn't want to wait too long. We went to market on March 7 and did so on what turned out the second lowest point in March for U.S. 10-year yields. Yes, our timing was fortunate, but our good fortune relied on us being ready to go.
 Imperative #3, which we've just announced, capitalizing on the scale and rarity of our existing assets by working throughout Q1 with our partners at Apollo to develop a property enhancement plan for The Venetian, which gives VICI the opportunity to invest up to $700 million of capital into this magnificent Las Vegas Strip asset.
 In a moment, John and David will give you more color on each of these 3 Q1 2024 imperatives.
 I'll close out my opening remarks by saying the obvious. The first 16 or so weeks of 2024 haven't been a lot of fun for REIT investors. It's not clear at this point when the marketplace will recognize what we believe to be the total return value that REITs can and do represent at this point.  Most, not all, but most REIT categories currently offer dividend yields that are materially in excess of current inflation rates. And REIT dividends, unlike money market or bond interest payments, have the potential to grow over time, as VICI's has, with VICI posting a dividend growth CAGR of 7.9% since the first quarter of 2018 following our IPO.
 We've been living through a period in the equity marketplace in which the power of compounding has been somewhat ignored or forgotten. REITs can be powerful compounding tools. As a VICI shareholder, I haven't forgotten or ignored that compounding dynamic and benefit. I look forward to answering your questions, but first, a few words from John and David. John? 
John W. Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Relationships are at the core of what we do at VICI and the quality of the relationships we have sets us apart. Our team works hard to strengthen existing ones and develop new ones so that we are best positioned for future growth opportunities, whether or not we are invited to what Ed has called the party. 
 Our focus on trust in finding mutually beneficial solutions with our partners multiplies the beneficial impact of each relationship and we believe lays the groundwork for future growth through both good and bad market environments. One of the best examples of this is our relationship with Apollo and the team at The Venetian. The opportunity to acquire The Venetian originated during the COVID pandemic, another period of uncertainty with a challenging market backdrop.
 Since that time, the team at The Venetian has outperformed all expectations as Las Vegas has continued to solidify itself as the entertainment center of the world. We are thrilled to further expand our close relationship with Apollo and announced our opportunity to invest up to $700 million at The Venetian through VICI's Partner Property Growth Fund. This capital investment will fund several projects that seek to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property.
 The impact of our increasingly dynamic Las Vegas has continued to accrue to the benefit of The Venetian since we acquired the property together with Apollo in 2022, particularly with the neighboring Sphere, events like F1 and Super Bowl and an active convention schedule. The Venetian is set to celebrate its 25th anniversary this Saturday, and we're thrilled to partner with Apollo once again in their efforts to maximize the economic potential of this amazing iconic Strip asset.
 Gaming remains at VICI's core with over 98% of rent coming from our gaming partners, and the sector remains broadly healthy from a tenant credit perspective. Las Vegas continues to enjoy healthy growth with GGR up low single digits following the Super Bowl this quarter, and that is on top of an already impressive baseline, given gaming revenue increased 12% in the first quarter of 2023 over 2022.
 Since the market emerged from the pandemic, there has been 12 straight quarters, I'm going to repeat that, there has been 12 straight quarters of GGR growth in Las Vegas. Additionally, Las Vegas visitation numbers were up 4.2% in the first quarter, demonstrating the continued diversity of the revenue streams and the vast array of consumers enjoying this amazing city. In fact, based on a recent study from the University of Toronto that evaluated North American cities pre and post pandemic, Las Vegas is the only city that has surpassed pre-pandemic unique visitation numbers.
 In the regional gaming markets, while we recognize idiosyncratic weather headwinds this winter, we believe fundamentals remain sound, and we see steady consumer discretionary spend driven by the middle and high-end consumers on the casino floor. Although interest rate volatility has impacted transaction volume in the gaming market, we are active in dialogue around real estate opportunities in the gaming sector. Outside of our embedded growth pipeline, our relationships and gaming focus put us in a strong position when transactions or opportunities to invest in our existing properties arise.
 We continue to monitor the performance of Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis, for which we have a call right to acquire the real estate and buildings of these unique assets. This call right expires at the end of 2024 and we continue to work through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies to gain the necessary gaming approvals should we elect to execute this option. 
 VICI is also well positioned for incremental opportunities outside the gaming space as we've continued to expand our scope and our TAM of investments. We are committed to ensuring that each experiential sector and potential partner meets our investment criteria of low cyclicality, low secular threat, improving track record of growth and favorable supply and demand dynamics.
 In January of this year, VICI expanded its investment in the youth sports sector with the announcement of the up to $105 million construction loan agreement with affiliates of Homefield Kansas City to fund the development of a Margaritaville resort that will be embedded within Homefield's broader youth sports complex. The youth sports training center hosted 115 teams this last weekend for a basketball tournament and the baseball facility is open and in use. The Margaritaville resort is expected to be completed in 2025. Having visited the area a few weeks ago, I can tell you all the facilities are truly amazing.
 The Homefield partnership adds to our youth sports investment, as Ed said, which we initiated with our 2020 mortgage loan to Chelsea Piers in New York City. And at the end of 2023, we acquired the leasehold interest in the property and converted the initial loan into real estate ownership.
 While REITs were broadly excluded from, as Ed put it, the party that took place in the first quarter of 2024, the effects of the transactions and relationships announced at the end of last year and the beginning of this year contributed to our 6.1% growth in AFFO per share. As I stated earlier, our relationships are at the foundation of our business and drive our growth. Our standard for prudent underwriting gives us confidence in our roster of existing partners with whom we believe we have many growth opportunities. We look forward to developing new relationships with best-in-class operators so that VICI can continue to grow its quality experiential real estate portfolio.
 Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? 
David Kieske: Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time. Starting with our balance sheet, as Ed mentioned, in the first quarter, we successfully -- I'll say, very successfully executed our first refinancing of the $1.50 billion May 2024 notes that came -- that would have come due yesterday.
 On March 7, we launched a bond offering and at its peak, we are 12x oversubscribed. We ultimately issued $550 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 5.75% and $500 million of 30-year notes at a coupon of 6.125%, for a blended yield of 5.9% before the impact of our forward interest rate swaps.  When compared to the coupon of 5.625% that we refinanced, we feel really good about the all-in coupon we were able to achieve and at the same time, extend the duration of our maturity profile.
 During the quarter, we also bolstered our liquidity and sold 9.7 million shares, raising $305 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $515 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, $683 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.
 In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we sit here today, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current macro environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital.
 In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into account our hedge portfolio, and a weighted average 6.8 years to maturity.
 Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, an increase of 6.1% compared to the $0.53 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong, in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.
 Our G&A was $16.2 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, and continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs.
 Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we originally highlighted on our Q4 earnings call, AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion, or between $2.22 and $2.25 per diluted common share.
 As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not yet closed, interest income from any loans that do not have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items.
 And as we have previously mentioned, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, and we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Caitlin Burrows at Goldman Sachs. 
Caitlin Burrows: I guess one of the ways for VICI to identify and complete deals is when your partners are growing and expanding. So can you give some color on how your partners are doing and to what extent they're in the position to be expanding right now? I guess we can see the opportunity with The Venetian, but what else should we consider? 
Edward Pitoniak: John, do you want to start? 
John W. Payne: I will start, and I'll start first in our portfolio in Las Vegas because I think that's been a real center of where we've grown our company, and we have great operators there. We obviously announced The Venetian today, and you heard in my opening remarks that I believe, and maybe I'm a little bit biased, but this is the fastest-growing or the best city in hospitality in the world as it continues to attract a wide variety of consumers. So that provides opportunities for our partners, whether that's MGM, Caesars, we announced with Venetian. We've got a partner in Hard Rock that owns the Mirage that are all studying ways to continue to reinvent their business and add additional amenities to these amazing assets.
 The beauty of the assets in Las Vegas is the magnitude of opportunities that they have and the magnitude of square footage that they have in these assets to continue to not only remodel, but there are large parts of these assets that are unused at this time that could be brought either back to life or have never been in life with new concepts. So I can't give you any details that we haven't announced, but our operators have all talked about the development of their Las Vegas assets.
 Outside Las Vegas, there are some regional markets that continue to grow. We own some of the best assets out there, and we continue to talk to our partners about how we could potentially use our capital to grow their businesses. And we've announced previously some opportunities with Century, and I think there'll be some opportunities with some of our larger and our smaller operators. So Ed, I'll start with that if you want to add anything to that answer. 
Edward Pitoniak: I would only add, John, and Caitlin, good to hear from you, that obviously, depending on the outcome of the New York gaming licensing process, were the MGM asset in Yonkers, which we own the real estate of, to gain one of the full licenses, that would obviously be an opportunity for us to invest substantial capital in the recreation of that asset. 
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. And then you guys were talking about the Homefield partnership. I was wondering if you could just maybe remind us the status of your current construction loan there, which I don't think itself is a huge exposure for VICI, but as we think about the potential growth and scope of that relationship, what it could be like? 
Edward Pitoniak: David? 
David Kieske: Yes, Caitlin, we started funding that upon an announcement. And so that's an 18-odd-month development builds, but it's really the proceeds that are going into the Margaritaville Hotel to use to build the Margaritaville Hotel, excuse me. As John mentioned, the team was out there a week or so ago and saw the sports facilities that are ultimately part of our real estate that we do have the option to call in the future once everything is up and running and stabilized. But they are a best-in-class youth sports operator, and while there's no immediate intentions to grow, they are realizing the benefits of what they're creating and may have opportunities in the future to expand what they are successfully building in Kansas City. 
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. 
Anthony Paolone: I guess my first question is, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking about return requirements and your cost of capital and any sort of spread? When I look at Venetian, it's obviously a tremendous asset and a strong relationship, and you talked about the importance of that. Then the flip is, I guess you got some flat term for a little bit, and it's also more of a CapEx investment as opposed to new assets. So maybe just help us with putting some dimensions around how you're thinking about the right levels of return in your own cost of capital. 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, good to hear from you. The starting point is that, over time, we are obviously solving for blended yield on our investments. When we have the opportunity to put capital into an asset as rarefied as The Venetian and still maintain an accretive spread, to the point of your note, not a vast accretive spread and not our targeted blended rate of return. But if we can match an investment like The Venetian with investments, whether acquisitions or property or lending investments that give us more substantial yields, more substantial spreads, we feel, on a net-net basis, we're creating a lot of value for shareholders. 
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just my second one, John, you mentioned on the Centaur assets going through some regulatory process right now. Does that mean that if you do exercise the option, the close would be pretty immediate? Is that what to read there? Or just wondering what that meant. 
John W. Payne: Tony, I don't think that's necessary. It's funny. First of all, it's funny we still call them the Centaur assets. It is Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis. We do the same the same thing. But no, Tony, I mean we're going through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies. And should we elect to execute this option, we will make sure that we follow all the rules and the regulations. But to your question about timing, really no position on that other than we're going through and spending the appropriate time with those agencies. 
Operator: Our next question is from Barry Jonas from Truist. 
Barry Jonas: I was curious, how deep is the pipeline for additional partner property growth investments? And then I guess, as we think about those investments like Venetian, how should we think about the potential for those ROI improvements converting to sale leaseback at some point? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So I think as a starting point, Barry, it's valuable to remember that from what we can determine, we are the largest owner of hotel room real estate in America. We're the largest private sector owner of convention space in America, one of the largest owners of restaurants, theaters, other kinds of entertainment spaces. What are we right now, David, about 130 million square feet? 
David Kieske: Just under that. That's right. 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So Barry, when you think about having 130 million square feet of existing property, 1% and 2% of that number as potential reinvestment opportunities is a pretty compelling opportunity unto itself. As John mentioned, The Strip obviously represents a very compelling opportunity. We're particularly excited about the opportunities that could be at the south end of The Strip. We're in partnership with MGM. We own 5 assets, I believe it is. And that is an end of The Strip that, as you know, Barry, has taken on a vitality in recent years that it didn't have before.
 The T-Mobile obviously added to the vitality at that end of The Strip, Allegiant definitely added a lot and the A's stadium could potentially add a lot of vitality. And so when you look at assets like MGM Grand, New York, New York Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and Park MGM, we, with our partners, MGM, who obviously reported a very good quarter last night, are excited about what the densification opportunities could be over the coming years. 
John W. Payne: Barry, can I add just one thing to that. Not only are -- do I agree 100% with Ed on the assets, it's also the operators that run these assets, that they are constantly looking at ways to attract more consumers and to generate more business. So you can have a great asset, but if the operator doesn't want to change it and wants to sit on their hands, the gaming operators, particularly in Las Vegas, are the best in the world in the hospitality space, and they are constantly looking at ways to build, reinvent their business. And so those 2 things combined, not only the assets are incredible, but having operators that want to change and grow and innovate is a formula for us to be able to continue to grow with the Property Growth Fund. 
Edward Pitoniak: And Barry, before we move to your second question, Samantha wants to clarify an assumption that you made in your question that, in fact, isn't quite right. 
Samantha Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Barry. So you asked if we will have the opportunity to convert that via sale leaseback. And we actually don't need to do that because we own the capital improvement and that reverts to us via rent. So it's not something that we need to then, in the future, convert via sale leaseback. That's one of the benefits we think of the Property Growth Fund. 
Barry Jonas: But do you have a chance, I guess, to -- I think like if you look at the predecessor MGP, there are instances where they acquired an additional improvement and that drove increased rent. Does that opportunity exist, just so I'm sure I understand? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I mean it's in essence what we're doing, yes, exactly. We're investing incremental capital and in return for incremental capital, we get incremental rent. 
Barry Jonas: Okay, okay. Understood. And then just quickly as a follow-up, curious as you're looking at deals if the competitive environment is the same or if you're seeing kind of any new spaces at those parties, as it's called? 
John W. Payne: It continues to remain -- it's the same, Barry. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE. 
John DeCree: Maybe one to start on Las Vegas. John, I think in your prepared remarks, you've mentioned what a great hospitality market Las Vegas is, and we certainly agree. Curious how you guys think about your net exposure to the market following The Venetian investment. And in the context of -- if you could remind us if you have officially committed to anything at the Mirage yet. Obviously, Hard Rock is considering a pretty big rebrand there. And you've mentioned a number of partners possibly considering activating space. So when you think about all the potential opportunities, are you kind of comfortable with that? Do you kind of have a ceiling in which you'd like to go to and how much capital you deploy to Las Vegas, how do you kind of think about your exposure to that market over the near to medium term? 
John W. Payne: Ed, do you want me to take that? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Yes, he was asking you, John. 
John W. Payne: Yes. John, so let's talk a little bit about all the different areas of Las Vegas. So today, we have an incredible amount of assets in -- on The Strip. We have 10 assets on the Las Vegas Strip that we're very excited about. Where we do not have any investments yet, where we see potential for growth is in the regional market of Las Vegas and in the downtown market of Las Vegas. So you could see VICI continue to grow in the Las Vegas market, and it could be on The Strip, but it also could be in these other areas. And those are great segments of the business that we simply don't have real estate or partners yet along the way.
 So -- and then I think you also asked about the Mirage and our work with -- we continue to speak with the Hard Rock team who's running the Mirage on ways that we can help them grow, but we have not made any announcement on that yet, John. 
John DeCree: Got it. Maybe a high-level follow-up for whoever wants to take it. It's kind of an observation first that a lot of the casino industry, your partners and others' preference for development or project CapEx right now. We see that with The Venetian. Interest rate volatility is probably a part of the answer to the question, but why do you think we've seen more capital deployed in existing properties or new development relative to M&A, assuming your kind of cost of capital as a financing source for casino industry participants is still pretty competitive? So we would think M&A could still be a logical option yet we've seen kind of all developments. So just curious if you guys have a view why that might be other than maybe just interest rates. 
Edward Pitoniak: And just so we're clear, John DeCree, here's being about M&A among the gaming operators themselves? Are you speaking more narrowly about the trading of assets? 
John DeCree: Yes. I guess it's probably more amongst the strategic buyers of your partners, buying and selling, which would maybe pull you in as a financing source. So the casino industry developing and investing in properties rather than acquiring. It seems like we're in a different part of the cycle. Presumably, if we saw more M&A amongst your partners, that would create more opportunities for you as well. 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Yes, you're right. And honestly, you probably have -- you'd have to ask the operators as to why they believe there isn't more M&A right now. I could speculate, and that's all I'm doing. Obviously, the operators, so many of them are trading so cheaply right now, bafflingly, bafflingly so, however you want to measure the valuation, including obviously, free cash flow yield. And so it could be a time when people say, I'm not going to sell, not at this point. 
 But again, you really have to ask them. And it could also be the fact that the economic performance of the operators has been so strong coming out of COVID. I think one open question could obviously be okay, are these peak earnings? Are we going to sustain them? We believe that the earnings power of our operating partners is going to continue, but one could reasonably ask, okay, I don't want to be the guy who buys at what turned out to be a peak only to see economic performance normalize as the COVID effect wears away. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. 
David Katz: And I wanted to just get your take on some of the non-gaming initiatives and pursuits. Obviously, they're exciting in terms of TAM. But can you just talk about the -- how you view the durability, the long-term durability of those asset classes such as Bowlero or Canyon Ranch, et cetera, and how that compares with your initial core in Las Vegas? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very good question, David. And it's an essential question we're continually asking ourselves as we investigate new experiential categories. And you've heard us talk in the past about our 4 key criteria of healthy supply/demand balance, low to no secular, threat the durability of the end-user experience and lower-than-average cyclicality.
 I would add to that, that we're looking for businesses that have an economic dynamism to them, which tends to really center on a certain amount of revenue complexity, or as we've come to like to say, cash register intensity. And we want that to be coupled with an operator who knows how to make the most of that economic dynamism. They're energetic operators and they're very economically astute operators.
 And I would say that one of the key criteria among those is the durability question. Is it an asset class that has been around for decades? Has it proven itself through every economic cycle and through all the different demographic cycles? And I will give you an example right now of a category that we would be nervous about. And that is the -- I guess if you want to call it a category into itself, that would be pickleball, right? It's an incredibly popular sport right now. It hasn't been around long. And the supply/demand balance question is very much an open one because it's not hard to put pickleball courts just about anywhere, public parks, parking lots, you name it.
 And I am old enough to remember a sport called racketball, which was a very popular sport in the '70s and the '80s. And I don't know about you, David. I don't see a lot of racketball courts around anymore. I have no idea why they're not around, it was a fun game. You didn't have to be terribly highly skilled to play it and have fun, but it's kind of gone. So we take very, very seriously the question of durability. And there is really no better evidence of durability than durability, that it has been around a while and it has succeeded through all cycles. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. 
Bennett Rose: John, I wanted to follow up with something John said and you -- I think you said in your opening remarks that in the regional market, revenues are being driven by the middle and the high end of the market. And my question is, is that kind of always the case? Or are your operators starting to see some weakness with a lower-end consumer? And do you have any concerns about that, I guess, as you sort of think about the portfolio overall? 
John W. Payne: Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you. Probably a better question for the operating side of our business or the operators, but I'll give it a go here a little bit. In my comments, we're about in the regional markets, like you said, the middle and the high-end consumers are still coming in their frequency based on the information from our tenants. I think you're asking or do we believe that those lower segments will come back. I think that really depends on the operator. Is the operator pulling back incentives to those consumers and they've elected not to come because they find more ways to spend their marketing dollars in a more efficient way? So again, more an operator conversation.
 But Smedes, again, you're asking how does that affect VICI?  As I always like to say, and you know this well, even with every casino closed in the world during the pandemic, VICI collected 100% of our rent on time and in cash. So if segments of the business see a little bit of a downturn, not even negative, VICI is going to collect our rent or historically has collected our rent. 
 So we monitor these things. I stay on top of it because I'm a recovering operator, but in the core business of what we do, those downturns, upturns don't have a huge change in our look at the business. We look much more big picture, longer-term, years out. Does that make sense, Smedes? 
Bennett Rose: Yes. No, absolutely. I just -- it sounds like maybe it's more of a strategic goal from the operator side. And just -- we're just hearing on other calls, there just seems to be a sense that maybe consumers are starting to pull back a little bit. There's some weakness in different leisure segments. So I'm just kind of curious if you guys had insight there.
 I wanted to ask you as well, there's been press reports that MGM Resorts is looking to I guess, sell their operating rights at the MGM Springfield. And whether or not they do or not, I don't know if -- you probably can't comment on that, but I'm just -- could you talk about sort of what VICI's role would be in that process and how you guys are thinking about it from your perspective, if that were to move forward? 
Edward Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that? Or do you want Samantha to take that? 
John W. Payne: Samantha. 
Samantha Gallagher: Yes. As you know, obviously, we wouldn't comment on any of our operators' sale transactions. But to the extent they were to sell an operating business, we obviously retain the asset and would enter into a lease with any transferring of that asset. 
Edward Pitoniak: And you've seen that happen in a few -- yes, and Smedes, I'll just add that you've seen that in a few instances with our assets, Southern Indiana being one, Gold Strike being another. So we have definitely figured out how to work through those processes with existing tenants and new. 
Operator: Our next question is from Daniel Guglielmo from Capital One. 
Daniel Guglielmo: You all have a diverse group of partners and tenants, both large and small. This earnings season, there have been some questions around the health of the U.S. and Canadian consumers from a risk perspective. And just acknowledging that you all are well fortified at the lease level, but are there certain areas of the portfolio you're thinking about more trying to understand better in this environment? 
Edward Pitoniak: I wouldn't say, Daniel, it's so much about particular assets or even particular geographies. But I do think it goes back to the question Smedes asked a moment ago, which is what kind of behaviors you're seeing for consumer segment and their income and their spending power. And I do think one of the more -- one of the elements of cognitive dissonance right now is this disparity between lower-income consumers and higher-end consumers and the degree to which you are seeing some degree of stress and/or at least less liquidity for these lower-end consumers than you might have a year or 2 ago when we were seeing the benefits of so many of the stimulus plans that came out of COVID.
 So we obviously -- we monitor it closely. We monitor it for the impact it can obviously have on our partners. But we also monitor it as part of our overall monitoring of the economy and the credit markets. And the degree to which the remarks that Jerome Powell made yesterday when he was kind of nice Jerome as opposed to scary Jerome, I think there's a recognition even at the Fed that despite a lot of our macro measures appearing to be very robust, there are some tensions in the economy right now. 
Daniel Guglielmo: Great. Yes. I appreciate the detailed response, and that makes sense. And then just real quick around some of the development financing in the loans and securities bucket. I'm sure you all talk with those teams on a regular basis. Can you just give us an idea if there have been any recent headwinds or tailwinds that you're hearing about from them? 
David Kieske: Yes, Dan, it's David. Good to hear from you. No, we have a very thorough asset management loan administration process and we monitor both our tenants and our loan investments very closely. And we talk to, as John mentioned, we talk to the operators and we also talk to our borrowers, and they are not seeing any headwinds in terms of development completion or asset performance where we do have these loan investments. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Herring from Green Street. 
Michael Herring: Just looking at the Venetian deal, it obviously looks like a win-win from our perspective, at least just in the sense of Apollo's cost of finance and then the yield that VICI gets to invest on The Strip in Vegas. I was wondering, could you guys walk through maybe how those negotiations kind of transpired and how you came to that final yield number given that it is favorable or it looks favorable on both sides? And how that might look for future similar investments on The Strip with other partners that you guys have? 
Edward Pitoniak: Sure. Yes, Michael, good question. John? 
John W. Payne: Michael, it's nice to talk to you this morning. And we agree that this is a win-win for both companies. You initially asked when did these discussions started. They actually started when we initially did the lease back in -- during the pandemic. And when we bought the real estate with Apollo or we bought the real estate and they bought the operation of Venetian, we knew that they were going to grow the business. We didn't know they were going to grow it as fast as they hadn't been so successful there, and we're very, very proud of them. But we talked about the Property Growth Fund and where there could be opportunities for us to grow.  So the discussion started, and we do this often when we're doing deals to not only think about the deal that's in front of us, but where there are opportunities for us to grow, particularly with great assets like The Venetian.
 And then as it comes to the pricing, like anything, we -- since we started the company, we tried to create beneficial deals for both sides. If one side kind of wins, it's not great for a long-term relationship. So I opened up my remarks today and I -- someone may have rolled their eyes about that this is about relationships, but it really is about relationships. And when you can look across the table from a good partner, you get to a price that they feel good about, we feel good about and the transaction happens. And as you said, it's been a win-win, and we're just excited to help them add these great new amenities and upgrade the amenities that they have. 
Michael Herring: Got it. And just sticking with the Venetian deal. Obviously, you laid out the terms of the initial disbursements and the $400 million [ tallied ] can be up to $700 million. Is the entire scope of the project that Apollo is looking to take on, is that included in the initial $400 million? Or will they eventually need that $300 million eventually, it's just whether or not they want to use that option? 
David Kieske: Michael, it's David. One of the things you should look at is the Venetian press release that they put out yesterday where they, ahead of a 25th anniversary of the asset this Saturday, actually, where they have laid out extensive value enhancement plans well in excess of $700 million actually.  So it's just a little bit of timing on their side as they work through the initial $400 million this year. They've got a lot of things in the hopper and things that they've already done. And then just a bit of as that all comes together, what their pace of potentially drawing that incremental $300 million, where that falls in and how they use that capital going forward. 
Edward Pitoniak: And Michael, just to add to that, I believe you'll see the press release talks about a total of about $1.5 billion of total investment into The Venetian, of which we may end up being about half of that. But I want to stress the point that I don't know of another REIT category where tenants put more capital into the REIT's asset than ours. If you look across our portfolio, both our Las Vegas portfolio and our regional portfolio, any given year, our tenants are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars into our assets, making our assets more valuable. That obviously doesn't get captured in the models per se, given that obviously, the transparency around the exact capital that our tenants put into each one of our assets is not necessarily there. But we can tell you, based on what we know of their investment activities, that no other REIT that we know enjoys greater benefit from tenant reinvestment into our properties. 
Operator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. 
Greg McGinniss: So given that the Venetian deal originally had potential to be up to $1 billion, does that mean there remains another $300 million here down the line? Or does this exhaust that initial agreement?
 And in general, for the Partner Property Growth Fund, is there -- could there potentially be more concrete agreements ahead of time like in the case of The Venetian or for situations like you're talking about in terms of the south side of The Strip and MGM where there might be something? Is it more likely to just have an actual investment be announced as opposed to, again, the potential for one? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. David or John? 
David Kieske: Greg, I can start, and John can maybe chime in. Yes, potentially, there could be more than $700 million that comes out of our agreement here. The original $1 billion announcement back in 2022, we modified that as the team worked through and got in under the hood, so to speak, of the asset and realize what they wanted to do or what they want to undertake. So there's some tweaks to the original agreement on our side. And as Ed just laid out, the announcement that The Venetian put out yesterday has up to $1.5 billion or their plan is to invest $1.5 billion into the assets. So there could be incremental capital. But what we've documented and announced with our great partners at Apollo and Patrick and team and Rob into The Venetian is this incremental $700 million investment today.
 And to the second part of your question, there could be incremental dollars that we put in across the portfolio. It was because of the uniqueness of our assets versus any other REITs out there. 
John W. Payne: Yes, Greg, I think you should hear that we like these opportunities. And as Ed just pointed out a few minutes ago, there aren't many REITs that have this unique lever to pull to grow. I mean there aren't many REITs that are going to say, "Hey, we're going to put $700 million into an asset." There are some REITs that can't even say I want to put $700 million into my whole portfolio. We're talking one of our 93 assets. So we like this opportunity to help our partners grow, and that's one of the uniqueness that VICI has that we have the -- and we were talking earlier, we can go to M&A. We can help buy other assets, but we also have this lever that we've been talking about for years that is coming to life today with The Venetian. 
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And David, just on the maintained guidance real quick. Was there no additional drawdown on loans without final draw structure in Q1? Or is it just at an immaterial level to have no impact on the full year guide? 
David Kieske: No -- sorry, the first part of your -- around the draw schedules, Greg? I mean we still feel really good about our guidance -- sorry, go ahead. 
Greg McGinniss: Yes. So I understand that for loans without draw schedules, that's not included in future guidance. And I'm not exactly sure what was drawn, if anything. Assumption would be that there was. 
David Kieske: Yes, it's immaterial if there were any, so we feel really good about our guidance range where we sit here today. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. 
Ronald Kamdem: Just 2 quick ones. Just first, just looking for some qualitative comments starting with the annual letter about sort of higher rates and the impact of activity, just as you've seen sort of this recent spate of movements on the rate front, just qualitative comments on what that's doing to the pipeline, where the decisions are taking longer and so on and so forth, or if anything's falling out? 
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, it's a timely question, Ron. I mean it's definitely having a fairly chilling effect on trading activity really across most all asset classes. And that's why we really value having levers to pull or tools in our toolbox where we can generate growth during periods when it would otherwise be difficult to do through conventional asset trading activity. Those obviously include things like our property partner growth fund, The Venetian being an example, through our credit book, through our expansion of existing relationships. And then again, too, having the tool in the toolbox of non-gaming and being able to do things with partners like Chelsea Piers, Homefield, Cabot and Canyon Ranch when, again, the trading of assets would otherwise be difficult -- and is difficult, frankly. 
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then just the second question, just staying on the pipeline, is there sort of more activity on the gaming side, non-gaming side, all of the above? Just any sort of color there would be helpful. 
John W. Payne: We continue to spend time... 
Edward Pitoniak: John? 
John W. Payne: Yes, we continue to spend time in a lot of different sectors on the non-gaming side, whether that's wellness, indoor water parks, pilgrimage golf, youth sports, you've heard us make an investment. But at the same time, let's remember, as I said in my opening remarks, we get 98% of our rent from our gaming assets, and we continue to spend time with our current partners and others to grow. So for us, I know we get asked a fair amount about our non gaming, but it shouldn't be forgotten that we're also spending a lot of time in gaming. So the answer is both, spending time in both. 
Operator: Okay. We have no further questions on the call. So I'll hand the floor back to Ed for the final closing remarks. 
Edward Pitoniak: All right. Thanks, everybody. So I want to close out the call by just reiterating how much value we believe we're creating with the announcement we made yesterday afternoon of our investment in The Venetian with our partner, Apollo. And I'm going to actually read from somebody's note because, frankly, this note expresses it better than I ever could.
 And in this note, the author says we view the Venetian cap rate spread as attractive, especially considering how tight spreads are elsewhere in net lease. Bigger picture, we view this as VICI capitalizing on its relationships to double down on a winning hand. In parenthesis, The Venetian may be VICI's best acquisition to date, close parenthesis. Despite higher interest rates, there's just nowhere else in today's triple net lease market where you can put that amount of money, $700 million up to, to work into that kind of irreplaceable real estate at a 7.25% cap rate. Then in parenthesis, delusional sellers are still looking for sub-7 cap rates on their poorly-located Red Lobsters. I could not have said it better myself.
 And again, we just want to thank you for your time today and reemphasize that as noisy as it is out there and confusing at times in the marketplace, the VICI team is a team that continues to get good things done. Again, thanks for your time today, and we'll see you again in the next quarter. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all very much for joining.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 23, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to, Ed.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning with a few words about 2023 VICI accomplishments and the way forward. John Payne, will share our 2024 growth approach, and David Kieske will discuss our 2023 financial results and our 2024 guidance. Last night, we announced final 2023 AFFO per share of $2.15 representing year-over-year per share growth of 11.8%. VICI's 2023 AFFO growth will likely make VICI one of the 2023 income growth leaders among the 29 S&P 500 REITs that report AFFO per share. There are 30 S&P 500 REITs overall, representing approximately 90% of the U.S. REIT equity market capitalization at year-end. VICI's 2023 growth is largely the result of work we did in 2022, forging new relationships and new investments in both gaming and non-gaming both property acquisitions and property credit investments. I'm proud of our 2023 AFFO per share growth, but I'm also proud of what the VICI team did in 2023 to continue to produce growth for 2024 and beyond. Our investment activities in 2023 produce growth in our portfolio quality, geographic diversity, tenant diversity, and income. Indeed, when it comes to 2024 income growth, as David will discuss in a moment regarding our 2024 guidance, we expect our projected 2024 AFFO per share growth should put VICI well into the top half of the S&P 500 REIT 2024 AFFO per share growth table. It wasn't easy to produce future growth in 2023. It was tough to navigate in 2023. Most days in 2023 and frankly most days in 2024 so far remind me of my days living and working in Whistler, British Columbia, where our very challenging coastal mountain environment could result in days so foggy and whited out that we describe such days as skiing inside a milk bottle. But even amidst this low visibility, the VICI team kept pioneering in 2023. We invested in new geographies, including three new countries, and through our Bowlero acquisition in U.S. non-commercial gaming states such as Texas, California, and North Carolina. We invested in new categories such as family recreation and youth sports. We expanded our partnerships with pilgrimage brands like Cabot and Canyon Ranch. We acquired the primary leasehold interest in New York's incomparable Chelsea Piers. Through our position as the leading owner of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip, we continue to work with our Las Vegas partners to capitalize on Las Vegas' leadership position in global entertainment and hospitality. I strongly believe VICI's investment in Las Vegas is one of the most compelling investments in the current global commercial real estate investing landscape. As we set out in our earnings release last night, in 2023, we announced and closed $1.8 billion of capital acquisitions and investments within the year. Note that these figures do not include the $2.8 billion closing of our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture in early January 2023, which we announced in early December 2022, including our assumption of the remaining $1.5 billion of CMBS debt. A fundamental importance, our 2023 investing in gaming and non-gaming was accretive. Our announced 2023 capital investments were made at a blended initial unlevered investment yield of 7.7%. Our 2023 investing was also balance sheet enhancing. We funded this $1.8 billion of investment with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and equity and only about $200 million of incremental debt, achieving an equity-to-debt funding ratio on that investment activity of 8:1, demonstrating our commitment to our long range net leverage target of 5.0 times to 5.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we look ahead within 2024, despite the continued cloudy macroeconomic conditions and outlook, we begin 2024 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and forward equity resources to deploy into continuing accretive growth. Needless to say, in a macro environment of constrained capital conditions, we believe our capital resources can and will be attractive to gaming and experiential operators who want to grow and/or need liquidity. Finally, in 2024, we will continue to build a portfolio of quality. You've heard me say before that I believe VICI is the pioneer in bringing Class A real estate to net lease. By Class A, we mean real estate of great scale, great quality and high mission criticality. And VICI enables investors to own Class A real estate within the strong economic transparency and integrity of the net lease model. What we can, must, and will do is continue to enable existing and potential VICI investors to understand fully the scale, quality and mission criticality of our Class A real estate. To that end, we are proud to announce that we're launching today the VICI Properties photo book, a digital coffee table style book that brings to life the magnificence of the real estate owned by VICI. You can view this book online at our website, www.viciproperties.com. And I thank Hayes Honea of our team for her great work in producing and publishing this book. I strongly encourage you to give this book a good viewing. If you're a VICI shareholder, I believe the book will give you great pride in what you own. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to, John.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. In 2023, VICI was able to navigate a volatile broader market backdrop, particularly for REITs and consistently deployed capital in accretive manners throughout the year. Over the course of 2023, we deployed $1.8 billion at a blended yield of approximately 7.7% across investments that expanded our geographic reach domestically and internationally, broadened our investable universe across gaming, hospitality and family entertainment, and deepened our ability to invest creatively through property related credit investments. Our ability to transact successfully last year was due in part to the multi-year effort I've mentioned before on our earnings calls. Every day at VICI, our team shows up for work and focuses on developing and maintaining relationships with best-in-class growth oriented operators, while some REITs describes themselves simply as a landlord and position themselves to extract value from their tenants. We view ourselves as a long-term capital partner collaborating with our tenants to create value. This philosophy of serving as a capital partner and prioritizing relationships with operators who pursue growth energetically serves as our compass as we assess and underwrite opportunities in the current environment, an environment that is characterized by low visibility and fluctuating cost of capital. To that end, many of you have heard me speak over the years about our focus on growth and it's also important to understand that there have been numerous situations in which we elect to not pursue opportunities. VICI is in the very fortunate position to have created significant shareholder value over the years. For example, we've grown our AFFO per share at 8.5% CAGR from 2018 through 2023, while our dividend has grown at a comparable high-single-digit rate and we do not believe we need to pursue growth surely for the sake of growing. For those of you who may be newer to our story, I would like to touch on a few elements of our growth pillars that have allowed us to successfully complete $36 billion of accretive transaction volume in a little over six years. Number 1, we work collaboratively with operating partners investing in growth opportunities and funding high ROI capital projects in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Number 2, as the only S&P 500 REIT predominantly invested in the gaming industry, given 90% of our rent roll is derived from gaming investments, our team travels far and wide, visiting properties, studying new markets, assessing the landscape and meeting with operators across regional, Las Vegas and even international locations. Number 3, we are supplementing our gaming investments with opportunities in experiential sectors that we believe are positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds. We focus on sourcing transaction with operators who are positioning themselves for growth, including through roll-up in an industry much as you saw with our Cabot and Bowlero transactions announced in October of last year. And finally, number 4, we constantly keep our eyes open for opportunities where VICI can get better by getting bigger as demonstrated through the acquisition of MGM Growth Properties in 2022, which significantly expanded our footprint in Las Vegas, added Class A market leading regional assets to our portfolio, improved our balance sheet to investment grade and has positioned us for a long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, a world class gaming, hospitality, and leisure operator. As we dive further into 2024, we hold firm to the criteria that has driven much of our track record to-date while executing across our strategic pillars. In particular, we are adhering to prudent underwriting standards, ensuring your capital is appropriately compensated as we assess risk and pursue opportunities across different properties, markets and asset classes. And as I said earlier, we maintain a preference for growth focused operators with our entire team evaluating a partner's track record and importantly, their use of proceeds, which typically explains intentions behind pursuing a transaction. We ultimately believe the right partnerships lead to the right opportunities, which feeds the flywheel of value creation through collaboration. We believe our commitment to developing and deepening relationship with great operators of all shapes and sizes combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will afford us the ability to continue executing accretive deals during a time when other REITs may be stuck “skiing inside a milk bottle.” Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thank you, John. It's great to speak with everyone today and we appreciate your time. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2023 exemplifies the continued discipline we have maintained over our six plus years of existence by ensuring that we allocate capital accretively, have a balance sheet and liquidity profile designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. During the year, we raised over $1.6 billion in forward equity. In January of 2023, we raised approximately a $1 billion in gross forward equity proceeds at a $33 price per share. Those proceeds were used throughout the year to accretively fund our transactions. We utilized our ATM program throughout 2023 raising $643 million in gross forward proceeds. That amount includes $390 million which was raised in Q4 through the sale of 13.2 million shares via the forward and remains outstanding today. And subsequent to year-end in Q1 2024, we sold 9.7 million shares raising $306 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. This brings our total outstanding forward equity to just under $700 million bolstering our overall liquidity. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $523 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $696 million of proceeds under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we begin 2024, we believe we're extremely well-positioned to navigate the current environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital as we sit here today. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA annualized for a full-year of activity from our recent acquisitions and excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.5 times within our target leverage range. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% taking into account our hedge portfolio that we utilized in connection with our April 2022 inaugural investment grade offering in a weighted average 5.9 years to maturity. As of December 31, we've entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements ahead of our May 1, $1.05 billion bond maturity, which has an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. This portfolio has an effective treasury rate of 4.04%. Just touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 8.8% compared to $0.51 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the full-year 2023, AFFO per share was $2.15 an increase of 11.8% compared to $1.93 for the full-year 2022, and as Ed mentioned, making VICI one of the leaders across the S&P 500 REITs. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $15.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector but across all REITs. Turning to our guidance. And as you saw in our release last night, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion $2.355 billion or between $2.22 per share $2.25 per share. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4%, very attractive starting point as we begin 2024. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced, but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction or items. And as we've mentioned previously, we record a non-cash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Paolon with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolon: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I guess my first question is just whether or not you could put some dimensions around your deal pipeline right now, either whether it's skewed somewhere geographically, size and maybe yields?
Edward B. Pitoniak: I'll start, Tony, and good morning. Good to speak with you and then John and David can kick in. I would say that in the spirit of our opening remarks, we're obviously sober as you've heard from other REITs in recent weeks like [agri] (ph) and realty income. We're sober about the marketplace. We're sober about the capital markets and we're pretty sober about what kind of activity may be available to us. And yet having said that, John and the team continue to work the trap lines in such a way that we have a number of conversations going on both in gaming and non-gaming that have us very excited and John can talk about that in a moment. The other point I want to emphasize, Tony, is that the magnitude of what we own brings with it opportunities you wouldn't necessarily find in other REITs given the nature of the property they own, especially when we look at Las Vegas, where we've got, I think John, 40,000 odd hotel rooms. If you look just at an asset like The Venetian, which including parking is 17 million square feet, given what's going on there, given the impact of this sphere, the opportunity of Patrick and Nicole and the team to continue to asset manage, maximize the productivity of that asset is so, so strong. I mean, it's a magnitude of building. And again, this goes back to my opening remarks that we are going to continue to help the investment marketplace understand the magnitude of building such that there are 300,000 square feet inside the 17 million square feet that have never gone past the concrete stage, concrete floors, concrete walls, concrete ceilings 300,000 unfinished square feet. And with the job that the team at the Venetian is doing to maximize that asset, especially taking advantage of this sphere, that represents incremental investment opportunity or growth opportunity for us that you wouldn't likely find in most other REITs generally and certainly not in triple-net lease REITs generally which tend to have assets of 10,000 square feet not 17 million square feet. But John, you want to add to this?
John Payne: Tony, you can hear from Ed's comments. He spent some time in Las Vegas recently, which I have as well. You asked a question about what sectors and I also think what locations. We obviously have been spending a lot of time in Las Vegas. We're very proud of our partners' success there and it looks like 2024 is going to be a great year as well. And as you heard from my remarks, we continue to look at different target sectors whether in wellness and indoor waterparks, pilgrimage golf, family entertainment center. We made our first investment in youth sports, which we like the mixed use of youth sports. So, I continue to spend my time with my team and really the whole company looking at a variety of these and checking the boxes of which ones could make for long-term investments. And there are some sectors that we don't talk about that we've kind of checked off the list that says this is not right for our capital at this time. But we shouldn’t confuse that the casino business continues to be real focus of our company and one that we are just can't be more proud of the operators and what they've done in ‘23 and what we see in ‘24.
Anthony Paolon: Okay. Thanks. And then just I have one kind of detailed follow-up, maybe for David because I was asked this a couple of times overnight. Just in your guidance, like how do you, just remind us how you're treating like the forward equity in the guidance share count, like what goes in there or not?
David Kieske: Yes. Tony, there's no implied use of proceeds or drawdown. There's a little bit of impact from treasury stock dilution in the ultimate share count, but that's the only impact.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Okay. Another way of putting it, Tony, is we're not assuming any credit or horsepower from the funding and we're taking actually a marginal penalty by virtue of having it on our well, we technically, we don't have it on our balance sheet, but given the treasury stock method.
Anthony Paolon: Okay. Understand. Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. Wanted to start with the, the Caesars center call option. Can you maybe just walk through different considerations as you're thinking about exercising it and specifically timing of that? Thanks.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Well, clearly, Barry, we want to be as opportunistic as we can be within our timing given the inherent nature of a call option. And obviously, that timing will be predicated on what our cost of funding is. And I don't think it would come as any surprise to anybody that we certainly would not choose to exercise our call option if in doing so we were creating dilution, which we don't ever want to do. And so, going back to the theme of, skiing inside a milk bottle, the visibility through 2024 given its current state is such that it's hard to predict with any kind of exactitude exactly when the right time would be.
Barry Jonas: Got it. Got it. And then, Ed, maybe just more a higher level question. You've done deals with tribes, native American tribes on commercial land before, but I was hoping you could talk more about the puts and takes with doing some type of deal structure in tribal land. There's clear risks there, but it's something banks and debt investors have been able to overcome. And, I think it's a sizable market with clear financing needs? Thanks.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start and I'll turn it over to John. Barry, I read the notes from that recent session you had, which were really interesting to read. I know one of the participants in your session sounded rather, I won't say bullish, but seemed to say that there may be means to do it. I will tell you with complete candor, we haven't exactly figured out how that would work yet, John, right?
John Payne: But Barry, you touched on, we've been really excited to build relationships with three tribes in the commercial sector and it's something that we can continue to talk with them and other tribal partners that we've gotten to know to see could there be an opportunity to help them grow on their nation's land. But we have primarily been focused with our partners on the commercial sector and we'll continue to study that opportunity because as Ed said, we saw the study of the report that came out as well.
Barry Jonas: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess you guys have made it clear that a significant part of your business could be repeat business. So, can you talk about maybe the pipeline and if we should see some repeat business in 2024 and or continue to see new operator partners pop up?
John Payne: Yes. Good morning, Caitlin. Very good question you asked. No question that we continue to meet with our 13 partners currently in gaming and non-gaming and talk about how our capital can help them grow over the coming years. And as Ed alluded to, the boxes that are in I shouldn't even call them boxes in Las Vegas, the amazing resorts we own with partners in Las Vegas could provide with a lot of opportunity in the relatively near future and in the coming years as those partners look to grow whether that's in hotel rooms, new restaurants, new attractions. Ed mentioned obviously the sphere where that sits on our land. We weren't involved in the building or they're not our direct tenant. But we see that as a pillar of growth for our company over the coming years, not only in Las Vegas, but in our regional assets because there are large regional assets whether that's the MGM assets in National Harbor or in Detroit, there are opportunities to grow as well. And then I think your second part of the question is, are we looking to continue to expand our tenant roster? And the answer is, absolutely. Me, my team, Ed, David, Sam, anyone else in the company is out, forging new relationships to see if there's new sectors or new companies that we can use our capital to help them grow. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you see some new operators or new tenants in our roster over the coming year.
Edward B. Pitoniak: And Caitlin, let me just add on to that a little bit. Obviously, there have been questions understandably as to VICI, why don't you just do gaming and only gaming? And as we have emphasized in many, many occasions, we are still for all of the time remaining going to be intensely focused on gaming given what a great business within Wichita real estate. But one of the real benefits of investing in other experiential categories is well, first of all, comes with the fact that it's just fundamentally great real estate occupied by operators who offer very rich and profitable experiences to their end customers. So, that's the fundamental reason to invest in other experiential. It's fundamentally good real estate. The second dimension to that is that, it gives us a chance to grow when growth may not be available for gaming. And related to that, and this goes back to your initial question, Caitlin, one of the advantages we see in experiential operators like a Cabot, like a Canyon Ranch, like a Bowlero, like a Great Wolf, is they have network growth opportunities that are not as readily available to our gaming operators. The nature of growth in new stores and gaming is such that it is always subject to very strict regulatory control. For Cabot, as an example, on the other hand, they have a global growth opportunity that can be seized with great energy and does not suffer the restrictions, or the slowing down of cadence that tends to apply to gaming operators attempting to grow their network other than through M&A.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. No. That makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just back to the pipeline a bit. You guys were active with both sale leasebacks and lending over the past 12 or so months despite a quiet CRE transaction market. And I know you mentioned how you're sober to the current situation, but you guys continue to invest in ‘23. So, I was wondering if you could give some more detail on the pipeline today, maybe size, mix, and how that makes you think more specifically, maybe, like, the first half of ‘24 activity could end up being or what that could be like?
David Kieske: Yes. Caitlin, it's David. Great to hear from you. Thanks for joining today. Look, the nature of our capital is relationship capital and it's where we've been active both as you just mentioned on the loan side as well as the sale leaseback side. And it's as, John talked about in his comments, solving our partners objectives and being a source of growth capital. And sometimes that growth capital comes in the door day one, like you saw with our Homefield opportunity where they're building a facility and going to construct a very, very, very attractive experiential both sports and hotel asset, which will lead to a sale leaseback. So, it's we're always out talking about ways that we can help our partners grow and to kind of put it in a percentage basket of X amount of loans and X amount of sale leasebacks. That's just how we look at it or how we kind of parse our pipeline. It's about finding the great partners that we've talked about on this call.
Caitlin Burrows: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ravi Vaidya: Hi. Good morning. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Hope you all are doing well. Just noticed that the mezz lending and construction financing is becoming a larger proportion of your capital deployment strategy. How should we think about the sizing of that relative to your broader acquisition pipeline, and how are you underwriting those return requirements, and how that's changed over the last, six to 12 months? Thanks.
David Kieske: Hey Ravi, it's David. Good to hear from you. I didn’t, clear caught your question. It's how we think about kind of the spread on those mezz loan, especially around development. Look, we always there's a couple of ways that we look at it and it's a little bit more art than science at the end of the day. But what's the cost of the seniors? Is there a senior lender ahead of us? Are we achieving the right risk adjusted spread to the senior? Obviously, what's the duration of our capital? What's the funding cadence of our capital? And then ultimately, what most every lender looks at, what's the equity sponsor and how much equity is in the transaction and ensuring that we are protected from a credit standpoint at the end of the day and feel good about the project.
Edward B. Pitoniak: And then to go back to the first part of your question, it will always be a minor percentage of our assets under management and we will use it to forge relationships. We have an example obviously right in front of us of using lending to establish a relationship with Chelsea Piers that led to the acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in December. So, we will use it both as a strategic tool to develop relationships and a strategic tool to create a steadier cadence to our capital allocation. We're very proud of the fact that we got capital out the door every single month in 2023. And I can tell you in our early years, there were whole quarters that went by where we did not get capital out the door, given what was true back then, which was that the nature of our capital allocation was big and lumpy, tied to big lumpy gaming acquisitions. So, it is a tool that can generate growth and return on a very steady basis. It is a strategic tool to forge relationships. And again, given some of the spreads we've been able to achieve in recent years, it is very lucrative, very accretive in driving earnings growth. And again, we're about creating earnings growth that others may not be able to achieve if they're not as energetic and pioneering as we have been both in terms of how we grow the business in terms of asset classes and through the use of our balance sheet.
Ravi Vaidya: Got it. That's very helpful. Just one more here. Can you please discuss the opportunity with the Indiana assets? In your view, how attractive is the [7.7] (ph) call in the current market and how does it theoretically fund something like that? Thanks.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. Well, as I said in response to Barry, obviously, 7.7 is not as attractive as when it was struck a few years back when the call agreement was struck a few years back. And it will be a call opportunity. We will be excited about executing if it's an accretive opportunity and if it's not an accretive opportunity. If in fact there would be a dilutive opportunity at 7.7, we would not do it.
Ravi Vaidya: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Darling with Green Street. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Darling: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just going back to the Caesars call options again, let's just for argument's sake assume that you do exercise those options. I'm just curious. How would you think about the deal structure from a rent coverage standpoint? So I'm wondering, would you possibly structure tighter rent coverage on a standalone basis if it made sense within kind of the larger master lease?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Well, yes, Chris. So, the rent coverage, by virtue of the current call agreement is set, but, it is a subject to discussion, and one we have and would like to continue to explore with Caesars, such that on an overall basis, they and we are at rent coverages that everybody feels really good about for decades to come.
Chris Darling: All right. Fair enough. One more for you. Just touching on the Homefield agreement. Just hoping you can elaborate on the scope of the project, potential future expansion. So, I'm wondering what the total estimated investment is for the current development, how the team is thinking about scaling to additional locations over time and just trying to wrap my arms around what the scope of investment might look like for VICI over time?
John Payne: Yes, Chris, it's John. As when we made the announcement a few months ago, we talked about spending a couple of years studying the youth sports business and we learned a lot in that process. We've also found an amazing partner in Homefield. We announced our first opportunity with them in the Kansas City area and they're building not only the youth sports facility but connected to a Margaritaville Resorts. That's one of the things, I think you'll continue to see is if we place other investments into the youth sports spaces, having numerous cash registers, not just having the fields to rent or the stadiums to rent, but also having connected to one operator who controls the restaurants, who controls the hotel rooms and controls the sports fields. So, this is a $110 millionish initial investment with Homefield. We've not announced any further development not only on that site, which does have opportunity to expand over time, but also other sites around the Midwest or the United States. But as with any partner that we've talked about whether that's with casino partners or with Cabot or Canyon Ranch and now Homefield, we hope that it's not just our only investment with them and we purposely took so much time to study the business to find the right partner to grow.
Chris Darling: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. So, as you continue to invest in non-gaming assets, how should investors get comfortable with more opaque tenant financials there? And what sort of premium are you receiving from an investment yield standpoint as it compares to a potential gaming investment?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. So, you are right, Greg. If we're partnering with an experiential operator that's not public, the tenant financials are not crystal clear in the same way they're not crystal clear across a whole lot of net lease portfolios. And at the end of the day, we obviously have to exercise our fiduciary responsibility to the greatest degree possible in ensuring that the fundamental business is very, very supportive of the rent and the way in which our operating partners manage their balance sheets and liquidity is also of a strength that ensures that they won't be in positions where they're unable to meet the rent. We've got a very rigorous underwriting practice. We obviously can take advantage of history in many of the categories, experiential categories that we're investing in. And again, at the end of the day, it's up to us to make sure that they are of a strength, that's going to enable them to weather whatever should come their way. But I will also emphasize that our key criteria, our first of four criteria in evaluating all investments, gaming and experiential widely, is that the businesses be of lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, which we think is another risk mitigant when it comes to ensuring that they can cover the rent through thick and thin.
Greg McGinniss: Just to follow-up on that, in the cases where you're providing construction loans, where may there's not kind of in place cash flows to be underwriting or evaluating. What's the process look like there when you're trying to get comfortable, in terms of lending that money and the ability to recollect in the case that, maybe cash flows don't hit quite the targets that were expected?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Well, last dollar exposure is obviously one of the key criteria and ensuring that our last dollar exposure is at a level whereby if we did end up owning the asset that the operating economics are such that at the last dollar exposure level that we would be lending at, we're still in good shape.
John Payne: Yes, Greg, and then it comes down, as I mentioned, quality of the sponsors, the amount of equities, the overall loan-to-cost or loan-to-value and then the protections that are obviously ultimately documented in our agreements. But a lot of the sectors and we like our sale leaseback investments, we study the sectors. Indoor water parts, we studied for 18 odd months led by certain members of our team and went deep into that sector before we did anything. And so it's getting gaining conviction whether it be through direct real estate ownership or the lending platform that we have of who the operator is, the durability of the sector and then the ultimate protections that we can put in place.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, thanks. And just a final one for me. And I'd like to preface this question by acknowledging the great work that John and his team have done so far. We know that you've added some great members to the investment team as well. But given your sector low G&A, how do you balance that shareholder friendly expense line versus investing in a larger acquisitions team that could maybe help source and underwrite more investment opportunities?
Edward B. Pitoniak: No, it's a very fair strategic question, Greg, and it's a question we regularly wrestle with. I would say one of the ways in which we deal with, if you will, the underinvestment risk in G&A is by, I think, having forged some of the strongest partnership relationships of anybody out there. From day one, we have treated our advisors as best as we possibly can. This means the investment banks, the other parties, the real estate advisory firms, such that we are always the first they call when they think there's a compelling opportunity. They are a force multiplier for us. And we have great respect for them. We engage with them intensely. We reward them when they do great work for us. And in the event, we end up saving on G&A, which in an inflationary period has really two benefits, overall low G&A to begin with and less inflationary impact on our G&A load. If it ever gets to the point where we feel we're short changing shareholders by running too thin, we will certainly add resources in the way we've obviously added resources here in the last couple of years. Thank you, Greg, we’ll move on to the next question.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks you, Ed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I want to get your kind of commentary or thoughts on performance thus far for Fontainebleau. It seems like mainstream media has been favorable on it, but there's also local articles on some management changes there. Just wondering how performance is it?
John Payne: Nick, I won't necessarily talk about the financial performance, but what I will make a comment about is, what a beautiful asset, that was built by the team there, the Coke Industries, the Fontainebleau team, the operating team there that I haven't met anyone that walks through the place and says, oh, this is a, I mean I think most people walk through the place and say, wow, what an amazing place. And I think for those of us who have spent time operating in Las Vegas over the years, it takes time. It takes time to build up a database and it takes time, but they sure do have a facility that I think everyone is proud of and we sure are proud of.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And Nick, you've given me the opportunity to vent a little bit about how utterly weary I am around the negativity of so much of the media coverage, which regularly gets proven to be way overly negative. Oh my God, this sphere is going to be a disaster. I was in the U.K. earlier this week. I was struck by how many people wanted to talk about this sphere because they'd either already been or they're determined to go. And again, media coverage around that, oh my god. Oh, F1 is going to be a disaster. Well, guess what? It wasn't. The drivers loved it. The teams loved it. It was an amazing weekend of business for our operating partners. So Super Bowl, again, just a phenomenal event for Las Vegas and for the NFL. So, I absolutely agree with you. Some of the press coverage has been quite negative, but we know the people involved, we know how hard they're working, we know how challenging what it is that they've set forth for themselves to open an unaffiliated property on the strip. And yet again, that asset is utterly magnificent and they're doing the right things to bring business to it over time. And with the backing of Coke, you can be sure that the backing is strong enough that they have the patience, but moreover the firepower to make this work in due course.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just I know we've talked a lot on the pipeline and the investment opportunities, kind of the more sober environment out there. But if I just think about kind of the stickiness of cap rates, I mean, where are you seeing the most pricing power expansion where, probably makes a little more sense in today's environment, versus I would imagine some others where it's a bit sick here?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Nick, are you talking about cap rate variability across various experiential asset classes?
Nick Joseph: Exactly.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I don't know, John and David, I don't know that we've seen a tremendous amount of variability across asset classes. We're obviously not seeing a tremendous amount of trading. And yet you obviously saw with our unlevered 7.7% yield for the $1.8 billion we put out the door in 2023, that we have obviously been able to acquire income at higher yields. I would have a tough time generalizing, but David and John, I don’t know if you want to add.
David Kieske: Yes. I think you covered it well, but Nick, I mean, it's no different than any other asset class that you're in kind of the broader net lease. You have bid ask spreads and buyers obviously willing sorry, sellers' willingness to transact around in a backdrop where there's the volatility and variability that we've talked about. And so, there's opportunity out there, but it's a no difference in the broader CRE market. It's somewhat of a bit of a quieter environment and just an air of caution cautious on both sides until we kind of figure out where the tenure is going and where the broader economy is going.
Nick Joseph: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Now turn to Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jim Kammert: Good morning. Thank you. Obviously, VICI is going to remain very much a gaming focused investing and operating company. But you mentioned that you vetted thoroughly some sort of other verticals didn't pan out, which is all logical. But could you quantify, do you think that your total addressable market or investment opportunity set for new potential verticals continue to expand? Just trying to figure out if your overall catch basin is sort of winnowing or widening? Thank you.
Edward B. Pitoniak: It's definitely widening.
John Payne: Yes. Definitely widening. As there are a few that we're saying, hey, we ultimately not right for us today, there's other opportunities that come about that we study, learn who the operators are, we learn where their locations are, we spend time with them. So, no question the funnel is getting wider.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And I'll give you an example of that, Jim. When you really begin to know a category as David has spoken of, as you get to know that, if you will, the water experience category, which we first invested in through Great Wolf. What's really been remarkable over the last few years is the way in which really creative innovative operators are taking water experiences and continuing to innovate around them, not simply for kids losing their minds and spending their parents' money at Great Wolf, but also water experiences that are more focused on an adult crowd. And that's really exciting to witness because of the growth opportunities it represents within the category and across multiple geographies.
Jim Kammert: Okay. Thank you. And one small item, it's been in the press that there is some tax dispute underway at MGM National Harbor. It's obviously an important asset for VICI. But would that have any details around that and would it have any implications for you as landlord? Thank you.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes, that would be a tenant matter, so we wouldn't comment on that.
Jim Kammert: Okay. Thank you.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just looking at the photobook you sent out to everyone. More specifically looking at the Mirage in Las Vegas, is there anything that's going to go on in the next year on this asset and if so what would be the scope and time to build?
John Payne: Yes, Wes, it's John. It's nice to talk to you and probably a question for our great partner in Hard Rock on timing, but I think they've as you've probably been following the story, they acquired the operations of the Mirage a little over a year ago from MGM and have been operating, but have also been out getting approvals and designing the opportunity to change the facility from the Mirage to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. As it pertains to timing and budget and construction and that it's probably something that they'll lead that charge. But we, of course, as the owner of the property are excited to watch that asset get repositioned over time. It's obviously an amazing asset for a long period of time, but I think everyone would think of Hard Rock Las Vegas would do great on that site.
Wes Golladay: Thanks for that. And then maybe just one on the financing front. You do have the $1 billion in churn this year. You have the $500 million of swaps. Are you looking at doing an unsecured to take those out, or you can maybe a mix of term loans and unsecured? How are you thinking about that?
David Kieske: Wes, it's David. We will focus on continuing to access the unsecured market and extent our maturity tenure and increase the overall size of our investment grade basket those are legacy and MGP high yield note, so moving those to unsecured investment grade notes benefits our overall credit complex for the long run.
Wes Golladay: Thank you.
Operator: Now turn to Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Daniel Guglielmo: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just thinking about the credit opportunities in experiential, you all have been on the journey for some time now. And thinking about the opportunities in the process for closing on the partnerships, what type of competition is in the other room these days? And high-level, how has that changed over the last few years?
Edward B. Pitoniak: And, Dan, you're talking about, how is the competitive landscape of lending, evolved over the last few years?
Daniel Guglielmo: Yes, like the fund. Yes.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. Well, obviously, we're looking at a period over the last couple of years in which conventional bank financing has definitely diminished as a source of funding for experiential placemakers and operators. And at the same time, obviously, you've seen the upsurge of private credit of which we are part. And I would say that in many cases, we are being invited in to the funding opportunity because of our track record in experiential and the endorsement that our underwriting process brings to a project that we choose to be involved in. We obviously look at them really rigorously and we again, I would say, we get invited in a lot to processes as opposed to having to scour the landscape, and throw our hats in the ring.
Daniel Guglielmo: Great. Thank you. And then you all have such tremendous growth with some pretty big deals over the last few years. And thinking about kind of similar risk adjusted opportunities, are there areas that you see kind of, I would say, like big hitter opportunities or transactions out there, not just thinking next year, but maybe down, like, the line five years from now, that horizon.
John Payne: Dan, nice to talk to you this morning. I'll just go back to our assets in Las Vegas and I don't know how you're describing big hitter. But, if there are opportunities for us to continue to invest in assets that we already own and help the operator grow with accretive new projects, I'll consider that being a big hitting because I'm not sure there's a better place in the world to invest in right now than Las Vegas. Obviously, we've got a portfolio there, but there are some amazing assets Ed referred to the Venetian that has a lot of footprint to continue to be developed. So --
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And then I think John, we can add in obviously MGM, the MGM property in Yonkers should they be granted a full gaming license that will obviously that's property we already owned Daniel, that would obviously represent a significant incremental investment opportunity, but contingent, of course, on how the license award process plays out.
Daniel Guglielmo: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Jake Kornreich with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jake Kornreich: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning. As you look to expand the non-gaming segment, should we continue to expect loans on the relatively smaller side for you as a way to step into longer term relationships? Or would you be willing to take kind of a larger bite into either the real estate or debt and a new asset type in a much bigger way, say, over $1 billion?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Oh, boy. That would be a pretty big number, Jay. The check sizes you're referring to, they may look small in relation to our overall scale. But I would tell you in returns, they're pretty big checks. These are not small assets and they're certainly not small and economic productivity. And so, if we can do $50 million to $100 million and up loans on assets that we either have a direct path to ownership on or a potential path to ownership on, you add those up and you can get to $1 billion in aggregate. But obviously, by not having it all in one single investment, we are obviously spreading out our risk and amplifying our opportunities to develop new relationships.
Jake Kornreich: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on, I guess, the leverage. You're now at 5.5 times, which is in your, 5.5 times range. So, should we expect new transactions to be funded, I guess, with incrementally more debt capital at this point? Or do you intend to continue to over equitize new deals and get that leverage further down?
David Kieske: Jake, it's David. We will continue to migrate our leverage down. We're obviously within our target range. And just to recap everybody post MGP, we take the leverage up to 5.8 times and worked very hard to get that back down to 5.5 times at the end of last year. So, that'll continue to drift downward both from over equitization of transactions and then depending on the size leverage neutral transactions.
Jake Kornreich: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John DeCree: Good morning, everyone. I've been looking up for almost an hour here and I think only one mention of F1. So, Ed, to kind of go back to your sports triangle, in Las Vegas, and you guys have some land, near the [F1 Paddock] (ph). And, you talk about this every once in a while, but curious your thoughts on professional sports, stadiums, that type of investment, and maybe specifically in the context of Las Vegas given, all the development around professional sports that we're seeing there and your land and partners?
Edward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I would say, John, it's professional sports. It's obviously the emergence of this sphere. It's the overall growth of Las Vegas. And we obviously have the vacant land, but probably even more valuable is the land we already own. You referred to the triangle formed by A Stadium, T-Mobile and Allegiant. We own everything inside that triangle. MGM operates everything inside that triangle. If you think about where the A Stadium is going to go, we own three of those four corners in MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York, New York. I know MGM is very excited about the repositioning opportunities at Dallas Four Corners and it applies to so many of the other assets that we own up and down the strip, as well as you say that vacant land. I just can't again emphasize enough how incredibly valuable it is to have the position we have in Las Vegas, because Las Vegas is reaching a global critical mass that really no other place on earth right now rivals, not Orlando, not Macau, the way things have evolved there. Las Vegas is a category of one and we are very happy to be the leading owner of real estate in a place that is a global category of one.
John DeCree: Very good. Thanks. And maybe just one, since a lot of people are asking me, is the photo book going to be available in hard copy?
Edward B. Pitoniak: We actually have printed a few, and if anybody really, really wants one, they should give me a call at their earliest convenience.
John DeCree: [Indiscernible]
Edward B. Pitoniak: Thanks, John. Elliot, I think we're probably about wrapped up, right?
Operator: Yes. This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Edward Pitoniak, CEO for final remarks.
Edward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Elliot, and thanks everyone for your time today. And please, please do go to www.viciproperties.com under our Portfolio heading to view our brand new VICI Properties photo book. It's a magnificent book about your magnificent properties. Bye for now.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call is now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 26, 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today is Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Louie McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2023 is a quarter most REITs are happy to be done with. The REIT Index in Q3 2023 was down 8%, swinging negative for the year after not a great year last year, and October has only continued a negative trend. But while the REIT stock marketplace didn't have a great quarter in Q3 2023, the key question to ask is what a given REIT did in Q3 and now in October to improve its business for the future. At VICI, our answer to this question has a number of elements to it. We played offense selectively. We played defense. We capitalized on certain current conditions. We prepared for potential future conditions. We increased our dividend effective with Q3 2023 and an annualized rate that well exceeds forward inflation expectations and continued rate of dividend growth since 2019 and that is 3x greater than the largest net lease REIT over the same period. And if there has ever been a period in which one should value a solidly covered and solidly growing dividend, that currently exceeds the 10-year rate. This is it. Finally, in a year in which REIT earnings growth has generally been difficult to come by, VICI's AFFO per share earnings in Q3 grew 10.7% year-over-year. VICI announced within and subsequent to quarter-end, about $1.1 billion of new capital commitments. While most of you have seen the strategic and economic merits of these investments, we know there are some of you who feel that we should have left that capital in a stockpile. Some of you feel understandably that volatility is too high and visibility is too low. We agree volatility is high and visibility is low. And with the market movements of especially the last few weeks, we are sober and cautious about what the market conditions for capital allocation could be from here for how long, no one knows. But I can tell you that we continue to have high conviction about the commitments we've recently made with Century, with Canyon Ranch and now with Valero. These commitments represented immediately accretive investments in real estate that should have positive impacts on 2024 earnings. These commitments also represent investments in relationships that can and will be the answer in future years to, okay, now that things are back to normal, how are you going to grow, VICI. Again, none of us know when the all-clear signal will sound, but it will in some way and REITs that continue to invest in relationships we'll be best positioned to resume growing when market conditions and values have stabilized. That's what we at VICI did in the recovery out of COVID. Our situational readiness put us in the position to acquire the Venetian and MGP, investments that are a key driver of our 2023 earnings growth, and we made these investments and many other would be made [technical difficulty] hadn’t been fully readying themselves for recovery. We have been able to undertake our recent investments because of the astute and agile work of Moira McCloskey and the VICI Capital Markets team. Going back to our nearly $1 billion overnight equity raise in early January 2023, VICI has opportunistically raised a total of approximately $1.3 billion of forward equity in 2023, giving VICI a cost of funds for our recent investments to drive the immediate accretion of which we've spoken. We also made defense this past quarter. During Q3 and subsequent to quarter-end, we played defense by using close to $1 billion of equity in cash and only about $55 million of debt to fund our new capital commitments demonstrating our commitment to our long-range leverage targets. David Kieske and the VICI Finance team also played defense by adding a further $200 million of swap protection since Q2 in anticipation of our 2024 refinancing of $1.05 billion of the legacy MGP 5.625 notes giving us a total of $450 million of swap protection. And while we did all this, our tenants continue to demonstrate the vitality of their businesses, as John will speak of momentarily. I'm very proud of the work the entire VICI team did this quarter against a volatile and difficult backdrop, the VICI team working within one of the lightest G&A loads of any S&P 500 REIT continue to create a culture of excellence and resilience that I'm confident will serve VICI's stakeholders well for years to come no matter what those years bring. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Payne for an operating and transaction marketplace update, and John will then pass the mic to David Kieske, who will give our financial and guidance update. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. While 2023 has been a volatile year in the real estate sector, as Ed just highlighted, we at VICI have put ourselves in the position on both a capital and relationship basis to not only continue our business but to expand it into new sectors, new relationships and new geographies. In the third quarter, we continued to grow with our partners at Century Casinos by closing our Rocky Gap Casino Resort acquisition in Maryland, and our sale leaseback of four gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, growing our international footprint. Subsequent to quarter-end, we were very excited to announce our entry into the family entertainment sector, through our acquisition of 38 bowling entertainment centers with our new partners at Valero, led by Tom Shannon and Brett Parker, the Valero team is a perfect example of a talented growth-minded operator that has a deep understanding of their consumer recreational trends and the value that a VICI relationship and our capital can bring to their growth strategies. VICI's tenants are not only continuing to show strong operating results, but are also continuing to invest in capital improvements all over the United States. Caesars is investing over $400 million into just one asset, Harrah's New Orleans. The Venetian just announced a $1 billion plan to further enhance our asset, including almost $200 million in just convention center space. MGM spends hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx each year on assets throughout Las Vegas and the regional markets. And even our smallest operators are investing millions of dollars each year on growth projects, thereby enhancing the quality of our assets and the productivity of their operating businesses. These reinvestment commitments add to our conviction that we are continuing to construct a high-quality portfolio of assets with the best experiential operators for our investors. This high-quality classification comes from not only the quality of the real estate itself, but also from the outsized productivity of these assets, productivity that is hard to come by in almost any other real estate sector. No place highlights the health and productivity of our tenants better than Las Vegas. After meeting with Caesar's CEO, Tom Reeg at G2E, which is the largest gaming conference in the United States, one analyst noted that Caesars is on pace for its best October ever. And this is against the backdrop of current macroeconomic uncertainty. Even during these tough times, Las Vegas continues to open new world-class attractions while diversifying its revenue stream and customer base. The opening of the must-see entertainment venue, the sphere world famous events like Formula 1 and the 2024 Super Bowl and a diverse and robust convention and conference schedule all helped showcase that there's no city performing like Las Vegas, that has clearly become the entertainment epicenter of the world. Outside of Las Vegas, regional performance has continued to be resilient, while many operators in our discussions have cited increased expenses related to items such as insurance or unrated play normalizing against tough comps, regional operations continue to run at very strong profit levels supported by loyal consumers with their respective database. Strategically, we continue to be focused on all fronts: gaming, nongaming, domestic and international to grow our pipeline for VICI's future. In gaming, Danny Valoy and I are in constant dialogue with new potential partners domestically and internationally, and we are just as excited by the ways we can potentially help our current tenants grow through additional tuck-in acquisitions or by utilizing our partner property growth fund in which we seek to fund our tenants high ROI opportunities at our existing assets. Meanwhile, Kellen Floral has been cultivating invaluable connections and relationships across the family entertainment, sport, wellness, leisure and recreation sectors as we continue pursuing our mission to be the real estate capital partner of choice to best-in-class growth minding operators of unique social infrastructure properties. During this most challenging time of market volatility for everyone, it is more important than ever for our team to continue to grow and deepen our networks and to grow our breadth of opportunities to best position for the years to come. This work is intended to position us to continue to deliver the growth our shareholders have come to expect from the VICI team. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today. The VICI team takes pride in what we've accomplished in 2023, acknowledging the year is not over, but the results we posted last night and last week's Bowlero announcement are exemplary of those accomplishments, as Ed said, we are improving the business, which should benefit VICI and you as shareholders as to 2024 and beyond. Highlighting the transaction we closed last week with Bowlero and we have spoken to many of you about, the deal was immediately accretive to our AFFO given we had prepared by raising forward equity for the transaction many months earlier generating an attractive spread to that cost of capital. From an economic standpoint, the deal is very attractive. But as John mentioned, it also builds a partnership with a market leader that we and the Bowlero team believe will grow together in the future. Subsequent to funding this transaction, we have approximately $3 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $430 million in cash, $250 million of estimated net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of net leverage, net debt to annualized Q3 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% accounting for our hedge portfolio and a weighted average of 6.1 years to maturity. Then as we prepare for our first bond refinancing in early 2024, we have entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $450 million to date. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 11% compared to $0.49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $14.4 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share or $1.66 on an annualized basis, representing a 6.4% year-over-year increase. Then turning to guidance. We are updating and increasing AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.18 billion or between $2.14 and $2.15 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11%, one of the highest expected growth rates across all REITs. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transaction items. And as a reminder, we do record a noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question today comes from Anthony Paolon with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Anthony Paolone: All right. Thank you, and good morning. My first question is we all could see kind of how your capital costs have changed over the last few months. But maybe can you give us a sense as to how you see your operators, capital costs changing and whether or not sale-leaseback has become more or less competitive over the last few months.
Edward Pitoniak: I'd say generally, Tony, it has become more competitive. I think as you look at, obviously, the stock trading values of the operators, but also the yield to worst on much of their credit or our capital has the potential to be very compelling in 2024, 2025, 2026. But that, of course, assumes that our cost of capital is in a place where we can generate positive spreads and accretion against that. And our confidence level in predicting or projecting our cost of capital a year from now is not high. If anyone does have my confidence in their projections, please call us immediately and let us know what we're missing.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You'd mentioned your operators putting a lot of capital into the assets. And I know you have the property growth fund to help with that if they so choose to participate. But would you all reinvest post this if they decided they wanted to pull some of their capital out? Or do you see yourselves just limiting it to being involved in the projects as they're happening.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. Tony, just to level set here, Tony, the capital that I went through in my opening remarks is being put in by the tenant, not by VICI at this time, just to - and I think that's what you were asking. The other point of the question is if there's opportunities for us to help them with larger projects in this property growth fund would we do that? We would be thoughtful in our analytics behind an investment, and we talk to our partners all the time about how they're thinking about growing their businesses and is there an opportunity for us to deploy incremental capital for incremental rent. And we do that on an ongoing basis.
Edward Pitoniak: Tony, if I understand your question correctly, I think you're asking us well, could there be opportunities downstream for us to buy incremental rent, if the operators' capital went into the creation of incremental real property. And yes, that could be an opportunity down the road should they want to monetize the value of the real property they created through their capital investments because it's all predicated, of course, on making sure we're buying good REIT income that is tied to the creation of incremental real property.
Anthony Paolone: Got it. Yes, that's what I was asking. So I understood, John, that those items you were listing those capital costs were being funded by the operators already. And so yes, it was a question of if you would go in later if they decided, hey, look, we put this in, and we may want some of that back. Would you help us with that?
Edward Pitoniak: Exactly right, Tony.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Ed or John, maybe we could talk a little bit about the Bowlero transaction and the cap rate that you've got to there. It's a little tighter than what we've seen in some of the last regional gaming cap rates show up that. I'm wondering if you could kind of speak to how you're looking at caps for family entertainment versus gaming and maybe more regional gaming than Vegas realizing Vegas is a bit of a different animal and other experiential real estate that you're looking at as well.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, John, and then turn it over to John Payne. So when you look at our Bowlero transaction, it represents a number of different strategic initiatives. It obviously does, as you've already said, represent our initiation into a new category, into that new category, we significantly expand our TAM, and we do so by investing behind a highly superior business model that Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team have created and the growth opportunity they have to consolidate a very fragmented sector is very compelling to us. It is also a sector that obviously other REITs have invested in and could continue to invest in. So it is a somewhat more competitive marketplace with a consequent impact on cap rates than you might see in regional gaming. So it - there are times when gaming investments and nongaming investments can be a bit apple and orange-ish, if you will, given that they do represent different marketplaces with different characteristics. I do think the point of emphasis needs to be that the 7.3% cap rate was immediately accretive and a very positive spread to the cost of capital. David Moore and the team have raised over the course of 2023, and we're very excited about the growth opportunity going forward. John, do you have anything to add?
John Payne: Yes, John, I just mentioned you asked about other categories that we're looking at. Obviously, we've already placed investments in indoor water parks, wellness with Canyon Ranch, Pilgrimage Golf, we made an investment in family entertainment center, as you said, with Bowlero. But we continue to spend some time looking for opportunities to develop long-term partnerships in wellness, leisure, recreation, some entertainment sectors and some sports sectors as well. And I think it's important. The final thing I'll just add is it's not an either or it's not a pay, you're looking at gaming, and that's what we're just focused on. And you're looking at wellness and that's what you've spoken on. We've got the capacity now to constantly look for these unique opportunities to place investments over time, as Ed mentioned in his opening remarks.
John DeCree: That's helpful. I think that made a good point about the capital raised previously for this transaction. So I appreciate the additional color. Maybe for a follow-up, John, you've kind of alluded on sports and other categories of entertainment, I guess, in the context of the MSG Sphere opening in Las Vegas and has certainly rave reviews and kind of looks like the epitome of experiential entertainment to us. So curious if that changes your thinking about the category, stadium, entertainment, mixed-use and maybe the bigger kind of business model is models that more rely on ticket sales perhaps than anything else. I'm not sure if your thoughts or thinking in that category has changed at all?
John Payne: It has not changed, but you hit on the sphere with what an amazing entertainment venue that was added to Las Vegas and sits on our land. It is truly - there's no entertainment venue like it, not only in the United States, but probably the world. But this is a category that we have looked at. We continue to study. We clearly have not made an investment, and we're trying to better understand the long-term economics and viability of certain projects. But boy, the sphere is amazing, John, if you get the opportunity, you should go to an event there.
John DeCree: Yes, absolutely. Thanks John. Thanks everyone.
John Payne: Thank you, John.
Operator: We now turn to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the questions on Bowlero, but more from me how you're thinking about value creation and capital allocation and risk holistically in the current environment. In the past, you talked about seeking a minimum 100, 150 basis points spread as an investment hurdle. I guess I'm curious if that's still the case in today's environment, or would you perhaps want to seek more?
David Kieske: Haendel, it's David. Good to talk to you. No, that is absolutely still the case in this environment. And as we talked about, obviously, we were fortunate to raise the capital this for the Bowlero transaction, specifically earlier in the year when, in fact, the Bowlero was in our pipeline back then things take weeks, months and time to come together. But we're not -- is not in the sand as we sit here today. If we look at the screen, see where the tenure is. We obviously see where our stock price is and still are on generating those types of 100 to 150 basis point spreads to our cost of capital. As we think about it, we think about the next dollar of cost of capital, where do we need to price something make it accretive based on the market that we are in and underwriting at that time and the capital that we have available to us.
Edward Pitoniak: I'll just add, Haendel. We've had a few questions along the lines of, well, geez, could you have used that money to buy 9 and 10 cap assets? And our answer to that would be today and especially during the period in which you were gestating the Bowlero deal, we don't see any really good real estate occupied by really good operators trading at 9 and 10 caps right now. The day could come when they do, but that day is not here right now. And in the meantime, with this capital volatility that we see, we will be very, very careful in recognizing that not only is the cost of capital volatile on a day-by-day basis, that has implications for any deals that have long gestation periods. So we will have to particularly take care any kind of deal making that requires longer gestation periods to account for the fact we do not have capital cost certainty by any means, and won't necessarily have it until the day we decide to do a deal, which means we will take great care in deciding to do anything against these market conditions.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it understood. And one more something else that was unique about Bowlero. It marked the first direct equity ownership in nongaming real estate on your part. I guess I'm curious if that's something you can expect more of going forward? And I know that deal is still a relatively small piece of ABR, about 1%, but you do have a ROFO for eight years. So curious how do you see there with either that partner and/or within that space going forward. Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So you're right. Technically, that -- these do represent our first direct investments, immediate ownership of nongaming real estate. What we should point out, of course, is that through our ventures with Cabot and Canyon Ranch, we have contracted for call rights that give us a direct path to real estate ownership in the future. So it happens to just be a difference between the nature of our acquisition of real estate potential acquisition of real estate with Cabot and Canyon's Ranch versus the immediate acquisition with Bowlero. And certainly, in this case, you had an operator with a very compelling opportunity to grow, a very compelling opportunity to put sale-leaseback capital to work, which led to our immediate acquisition of the real estate itself.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ronald Kamdem: Hi. Just two quick ones for me. Just going back to sort of the Bowlero transaction, and I appreciate all the details that you provided there in the partnership and so forth. But as you're thinking about sort of the family entertainment sort of space, Bowling is sort of an interesting one. Maybe a little bit more color on how the deal came about and what other sort of avenues or verticals and family entertainment that you entertain?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Ron, and good to hear from you. I do think one of the key characteristics of bowling is that it is a low barrier to entry experience, but it is an experience that you can get better at. And that's in contrast to some other experiences that can take place within the family entertainment sector, where people might do it once or twice, and they go, okay, fun. I've done that. I don't need to do it again. And Boeing is at its very heart recreation. And if you want to get philosophical about it, you can say, it goes back to our most ancient human urges to aim at a target and strike a target. And people tend to get pretty excited when they strike targets. And that energy exists within bowling. It's a recreational energy and not a passive energy. So we think that, that has resiliency aspects to it that are at the heart of why bowling has endured in various warrants for literally hundreds and hundreds of years, whether outdoor on lands or indoors and buildings. But I'll now turn it over to John, who can give you more color on how we develop that relationship. John?
John Payne: Yes, Ron, I was just going to add that you've heard me speak about times that relationships take time. And this is one that I think I looked at my notes in my first meeting was years ago with one of the top executives at Bowlero. And we just studied the business for this long. It's got scale. It's got healthy credit -- it's a business that has great margin with growth potential. The one other thing I'll add to Ed's remarks, as we continue to study the Bowlero business was the diversification of its revenue streams. It has many cash registers how the business can get into the consumer's wallet. It gets revenues from food and beverage. It gets a large percentage from bowling, it gets business revenues from amusement. So we like that diversification as we dug into the business and dug into the team. So we really took time years in this case to understand the business. And then I think your final part was are there other operators over time that we could buy real estate and be partners with. And we're going to continue to study the family entertainment center space. They're many good operators, but we think we started our journey in the family entertainment center with one of the best.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then just -- my second one was just staying on the pipeline of deals and so forth. So obviously, the tenure is much higher than I think most anticipated. And I'm just wondering, like when that happens, like how does that pipeline sort of evolve? Like do conversations stop? Do they pick up? Just trying to understand like what -- how is that pipeline evolving and conversations that you're having as PPR repricing capital?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start and then John and David can weigh in, but they definitely slow down, right? And anybody who doesn't slow conversations down against this backdrop of volatility clearly is not paying attention. A slowdown in terms of actual coming to any kind of fixing of value and price given the volatility of capital, but I want to turn it over to John because what we don't want to do is ever put all pens down -- not all pen out, but stop all conversations because there will come a day, as I said in my opening remarks, Ron, there will come a day when we begin to recover, and we don't want to have to call people and say, hey, you probably forgot about us because we haven't talked in months, quarters, years, what have you. We don't want to do that. So John, if you want to talk about the way in which we make sure our conversations continue even if they have to slow down a bit in terms of fixing value.
John Payne: Yes. Ed, you described it very well. We're constantly looking for opportunities to have conversations, learn more about certain sectors and businesses that we're not experts on today, develop long-term partnerships. But that doesn't mean we transact at this moment of uncertainty. It means that we're preparing for the time when they hopefully go from defense to offense and look at opportunities that we understand the sector of the company and we develop that relationship. So a little bit of a different time than the past couple of years, but we still are working to find opportunities for the long term.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. That's it for me. Thanks so much.
John Payne: Thank you, Ron.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on Bowlero and this is not intended to be a leading question in any way, but I know you do a lot of homework around the business and the underlying real estate. I wonder if you could just talk about the durability of that real estate value, what kind of it requires relative to the other stuff that you've acquired so far? And just sort of give us a picture of that long-term value durability, please?
David Kieske: Yes, David, it's David. Good to talk. I can start, and John, chime in. I mean one of the things we love about the Bowlero business model is the fact that they go in and reposition bowling outs that have been around not for hundreds of years like Ed talked about, but these assets are 10- to 50-plus years old that they buy and reposition with anywhere from $3 million to $5 million of capital and transform something that was dark and gray and a little bit dated into a very lively experience that, as John talked about, has multiple cash registers and as a draw for the local community. And they've done this now since the late '90s, and they have a portfolio of 350 assets across the country and some outside of the U.S., where they continue to see opportunity to grow in white space out there, a very fragmented mom-and-pop ownership industry, they see opportunities for another 500 to 1,000 centers into their portfolio over time. And that's what we like about it. But [technical difficulty] to your question, David, is they take a box that's very solid and make it even better and make it essentially brand new. And that's what we love about the business model. And then the cash flows that come out of that business, as John said, have very high margins and very sticky recreation aspect to the cash flows.
Edward Pitoniak: David, I'll just add to this. You and I talk a lot about my old days, way back in ski resort operations. And what I learned back in ski resort is to fall in love with businesses that respond that respond intensively and quickly to capital investment and management focus and intensity. And the difference between this and the ski business is you can make a great capital investment and operate the heck out of the business. I mean it doesn't snow you or. And what I love about this business is that it's very responsive to the investment of capital. You invest capital and you get pretty much an immediate consumer response it's also a business that responds really well to management intensity. And again, Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team are very, very trued at investing capital and know how to manage the P&L every single line, top, middle and bottom lines to drive -- to use that management intensity to really transform results through the transformation of the experience.
John Payne: David, the only other thing I would mention is just the detail of our underwriting. We went to all 38 assets in the 17 states. We got to meet not only the senior management team, as I talked about, but our team got to meet the people on the ground that makes these assets so productive. And it helped us in continuing to understand the durability of the business and the asset. So that just gives you a flavor of how we went about this investment.
David Katz: Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Todd Thomas: Hi, good morning. So first question, Ed, maybe, John, it sounds like the company may slow down on investments in the near term until visibility improves, which would make sense. But the ongoing conversations that you are having as you look to keep the lines open, with new and existing relationships on potential opportunities. Do you expect to see investment yields increase sort of commensurate with the increases in capital costs across industries?
Edward Pitoniak: Todd, I believe they will, but it always takes time. Sellers always tend to take more time to come to grips with reality than buyers would be sellers, would be buyers. And obviously, we've seen some cap rate expansion over the last year. And I'm very confident in telling you that a year ago, we would not have been able to buy 38 Bowlero assets at a 7.3% cap rate. Very confident that we could not have done that. These assets would have traded tighter a year ago as they traded considerably tighter a couple of years ago when Carlyle bought a large portfolio of Bowlero assets. So as we look over the year to come and maybe years to come, I think you can expect markets eventually to accept realities, but markets tend to take time to accept those realities, and we'll be patient for that acceptance to take place and enjoy the benefits of same-store growth that we, as a net lease REIT enjoy to a very rare degree thanks to our lease escalation and especially the CPI component of that escalation. Same-store growth is going to mean something in the net lease space over the next year if things slowdown in the way they might. And we'll cite a report from our friends at Green Street that showed that both VICI and GLPI enjoy same-store NOI growth that is about 4x the standard net lease REIT.
Todd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess within that context of sort of looking at potential investments, can you provide an update on the call right agreements and sort of current thinking on Hoosier Park and Horseshoe, Indianapolis, the potential timing there and how you're thinking about potential capital raising that might be required to the extent something were to happen there?
Edward Pitoniak: David take that first. The last half of that first and then John can take the first half.
David Kieske: Yes, Todd. And those who have been with us since the beginning, in the early days, we had call rights at a 10 cap. And as we talked about then, we said we'd use those to layer into our growth when the pipeline may be slower or there may be less opportunities in the marketplace. And we take the same approach with the call rights in Indiana. That runs till the end of next year, end of 2024, and we just have to call it by the end of 2024. So as we look into the future, we'll be very disciplined with where our cost of capital is, but also very kind of methodical about how we layer in into our future AFFO growth.
John Payne: And then on the operating side, we just -- like we do with our current assets that we own. We're continuing to monitor how the business is performing in Indianapolis. As I've mentioned on other calls, Caesars has put in significant capital to both the assets and those businesses continue to be rewarded based on those capital improvements. So we'll continue to monitor that.
Todd Thomas: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Greg McGinniss: Hi, good morning. Looking at the future opportunities with Canyon Ranch or Bowlero, is finding the incremental investment contingent upon the operator? Or is your team working with them to help find some opportunities. And then also for any potential ROFOs or investments, those cap rates will be negotiated in real time. So can we assume maybe those would be 50, 100 basis points higher than where you've invested previously?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Greg, it's a good question. And to take the first part of your question, we very much partner with our partners like Canyon Ranch at developing investment criteria applying those criteria to marketplace to figure out where the best opportunities may be. And I think I mentioned back when we announced our -- the expansion of our Canyon Ranch partnership back in late July, that John Goff and I share a conviction that the coming years, '24, '25, '26 and onward, could represent the kind of opportunity that John Goff and Richard Rainwater saw in the Resolution Trust days in the early 90s. There could be some very compelling acquisition opportunities that are born out of not necessarily operating distress, but what could be a certain element of financing stress. So we're excited about that. We're patient. We're willing to wait for the right opportunities to come along in that vein. And when it comes to figuring out pricing and ROFOs and call rights, I think what we're increasingly focused on is the degree to which we may need a certain amount of flexibility between us as buyer and any would-be seller account for the unpredictability of capital cost and resulting values. So we're going to be careful that we don't lock in to a cap rate for a future acquisition that may turn out at that time to be dilutive.
Greg McGinniss: And I guess in looking at those potential Canyon Ranch opportunities, is there a around the balance size on a per asset basis that they're looking at in terms of making investments? Obviously, that will change based on cost of capital and expect -- but just trying to understand the size of the assets they're looking at.
David Kieske: Greg, it's David, good to talk again. Thanks for joining the call. For our canning range, it's somewhere 120 to maybe 150 rooms, but kind of 30, sweet spot. One of the things is they want to insure asset utilization. So if you look at Lenox and Tucson in the room counts right around there, what they're working on and developing in Austin will be right around that size. And so as we think about potential other dots on the map, whether it be ski or beach or potentially even international one day, it's how do you find -- how do you focus on assets of that size? And given the economic magnitude or vitality that comes out of that business, you can take a conventional hotel that has similar room sizes and make the economics so much greater and so much better than what was out of a traditional hotel. And so that's part of the excitement part of the opportunity that we potentially see together in the future. And some of the distress or malaise that may be coming from that sector.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And just a final one for me. may not have an answer on this one, but have you guys been in talks with MGM about their perceived likelihood of receiving the license at Empire City and your potential investment there? Any updates?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. We -- well, first of all, MGM has been a great partner since we were able to acquire MGP and those assets. And obviously, the New York process is going on right now. There's some who believe, as you said, that the two current racinos will get two of the three licenses. And should MGM be one of those, and they're looking to build that business, and we see an opportunity to use our capital to build and get incremental rent. We'll absolutely talk to the partner about that. So we'll just have to see grain how this process plays out over the coming years.
Greg McGinniss: All right. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about how you think about the scope of the opportunity with Bowlero over time, I guess, against coverage levels, I think you said about 3.2x coverage. So a lot of cushion in there, but where would you sort of be comfortable, I guess, continuing to kind of buy up their EBITDA and converting it into rent relative to the coverage levels.
David Kieske: Smedes we studied -- as you heard us say, we studied the business in the company for a couple of years now. And the their ability to go into an asset with very low 4-wall coverage and transformed that asset into very high 4-wall coverage, gives us a lot of conviction in the business. And then obviously, with the master lease and the corporate guarantee that we get out of the -- incremental protection we get gives us a lot of comfort. So that's the area that we target, how kind of high 2s, 4-wall coverage, low 3s and then obviously, the corporate guarantee. And they're a growth-minded operator who understands the merits of a sale-leaseback model and ensures that they have the capital available to grow their business and the way shapes or forms that they want to do and they want to size the rent in a way that gives them protection to make sure that they're creating and benefiting from all the upside that they generate, given their business model and the economics that they do produce.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask about the balance sheet. Leverage just ticked up slightly to 5.7 from 5.6. And you still have the split rating between S&P and Moody's. What do you think are kind of -- what's the kind of the path, I guess, with Moody's? I mean did they want to see continued diverse diversification away from gaming? Or -- and I guess, kind of what's the sort of leverage metric that you think that they would need to see in order to move into investment grade?
David Kieske: Yes, Smedes, just to hit on your first point. I mean the leverage ticked up quarter-over-quarter really good cash went down, right? If you look at our supplement quarter-over-quarter debt only went up $55 million. That was the fund of Century Canada asset and cash went down $230 million. As Ed talked about the equity and the cash out the door to fund the acquisitions that we closed during the quarter. So really a de minimis move in leverage Look, in terms of Moody's, it's a continual education and it's just -- it takes time, all right? We've been around for six years. We're educating the agencies on the gaming net lease model educating Moody's in particular, on gaming tenants. And as we've talked about, I think with many of you in the past, they took our rating up two notches when we did our inaugural investment grade offering back in April of 2022, we've been in touch with them consistently, and we will -- for an agency to make a move, it often takes an event. So we're hopeful in the coming months or a period of time, there will be an acknowledgment of the sanctity of our cash flows and an upgrade coming. And it's -- there's really no real kind of black and white trigger. It's a little bit of just do what you say, say what you do and continue to prove the merits of your business model, which we have been very, very diligent and working hard at.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Darling with Green Street. Your line is open.
Chris Darling: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Going back to the pricing environment, but thinking about traditional gaming real estate, specifically. It seems like there's been this dynamic over the past, call it, 18 months or so, where gaming real estate has been positively repriced relative to traditional commercial real estate. And I wonder if that dynamic is still playing out in your mind? Or if you think cap rates are maybe moving in a more commensurate fashion 10-year right now?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Chris, good to talk to you. I think the honest answer would be, we don't know. The most recent trade in big box gaming, obviously, was a realty income investment in Bellagio, where I believe it took place at - 
John Payne: 5.2%.
Edward Pitoniak: 5.2% cap rate. So exactly to your point. There's not a lot of the real estate categories covered by Green Street, where you're seeing those kinds of cap rates right now, perhaps outside of industrial and maybe data centers. So there is resilience there. But beyond that Bellagio investment, I don't think we have a lot of data to point at. But I do think, going back to what John has been saying, about the vitality, especially of Las Vegas, where so much of our capital is invested. There's really no other place on or like it. And it may sound a bit trivial, but I'll point to, for instance, PINK, having just performed last week at Allegion announcing, I want a residency in Las Vegas, and I want it now because she's recognizing as a global artist that Las Vegas is the place for global artists to situate themselves right now because of the drawing power that Las Vegas has on a global basis. So you're seeing a resiliency of economic activity that should constitute some degree of resilience of value that you're not obviously going to see in a lot of other sectors where you are facing either secular headwinds or supply-demand imbalance.
John Payne: Yes. Ed, the other thing that's unique in the gaming business right now than other businesses, right, is that the operating performance of a lot of these casinos, particularly in the city you called out in Las Vegas are doing incredibly well. right? So yes, there's a lot of volatility in the markets, but their core business is really performing quite well. So we'll see how this plays out.
Chris Darling: Appreciate all the thoughts. That’s it for me.
John Payne: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: We now turn to Nate Crossett with BNP. Your line is open.
Nate Crossett: Hi, good morning. Maybe just one quick one on the balance sheet. If you could just maybe remind us the guidance for your leverage band and then just address like talking about debt maturities for next year, I know you mentioned the swaps, but can you just tell us how you're thinking about addressing that maturity? What would the term be? And maybe where you think you could price money today?
David Kieske: Yes, Nate, it's David. It's a yes. I mean we've been very vocal and committed to getting leverage back to our 5x between 5x and 5.5x net debt to EBITDA Obviously, we ticked that up a little bit with the MGP acquisition and the agencies acknowledged that and understood we would work very hard to get that leverage back down and we've kind of exceeded the pace that we originally told the agencies in the summer of '21. And then in terms of our 10-year money, we do have a maturity that comes due May 1, 2024, the window opens on February 1, 2024. We talked about, as we've mentioned collectively, we have $450 million of notional forward starting swaps out there. We've been legging into a hedge policy to get ahead of that refinancing. That 10-year money today spreads somewhere 2.20, 2.30, give or take, 10 or 20 basis points over the 10-year. And so as we sit here today, with a 10-year 5, that's kind of low to mid-7s capital. But we'll assess the market is that a mix of 5, 7 or 10, is it all tens - we do have access to the term loan market that a lot of REITs do not have access to. So we'll be very focused on ensuring that we extend the tenor, but also take advantage of the kind of the best pricing and the best laddering of our maturities as possible.
Edward Pitoniak: And I'll just reiterate, Nate, that while it does not obviously show up in trailing leverage numbers when we invest $1 billion of equity against only $55 million of debt on our recent accretive capital investments, it will obviously have a forward deleveraging effect.
Nate Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one more on the Bowlero. I think it's about maybe 10% of their portfolio. Have they given you any indication how much they would be willing to do over time, just trying to like size the potential opportunity here?
David Kieske: Well, as we sit here today, Nate, almost all of their assets are in a sale-leaseback format. So it would be potential future growth opportunities as they find opportunities in the marketplace. And one of the reason we were able to build a relationship and develop this transaction over time is VICI's desire to grow, VICI's access to capital. And obviously, Bowlero desire to grow. And as you saw in our materials and the commentary. If you look at the Bowlero announcements, they're very - they're thrilled with the deal that throw the partner with VICI and the we're optimistic there will be more to come together, but there's nothing directly off the Bowlero balance sheet as we sit here today.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. And I can't remember the exact numbers. So hopefully, David or John might, Nate. But the thing to keep in mind is that Valero is the market leader in a remarkably unconsolidated category with Valero owning - do they even own 10% of the category, I think they own 10%. So their opportunity to continue to roll up assets can transform the assets, transform the experiences and transform the economics is where the future growth between Bowlero and VICI will take place And again, thanks to a basically a right of first offer. What amounts to an exclusive financing partner restate financing partnership, that we'll enjoy with them for the next eight years.
Nate Crossett: Okay. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: We now turn to Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Chad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me this morning. Different markets and countries are obviously going through different phases of economic cycles. And I know in the past, you've talked about growing outside of the U.S., understanding that these relationships take time - has anything changed in terms of how you're thinking about non-U.S. versus U.S. opportunities with respect to current cap rates, multiples relationships? Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. And I will point out as someone who carries both the Canadian Passport as well as U.S. passport, we have expanded internationally. Canada is another country and we're very proud to be invested there. And John and Kelyn and the business development team continue to research international markets as overall real estate marketplaces and then the categories of interest the experiential categories of interest within those markets. And again, those are situations where we will make sure to take the time and take great care to make wise investments given that they need to be based on deep knowledge of the market before we ever commit capital.
Chad Beynon: Appreciate it.
Edward Pitoniak: I think, Elliot, that will wrap things up, correct?
Operator: Yes, this concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Edward Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, Elliot. Thanks, everybody, on the call today. We really appreciate you being with us, and we wish all of you the best during this very, very volatile time. It is a time we will get through. And again, we thank you for your time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: [Abrupt Start] a detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial [indiscernible] results, prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our second quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC.  Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets, and and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk this morning about our Q2 2023 results featuring a year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11.9%, which we believe will be among the higher growth rates for S&P 500 REITs for Q2 2023, and yet at one of the lowest price to earnings growth ratios, PEG or PEG plus yield ratios among the S&P 500 REITs. For the course of the call, John will share with you what we're doing strategically to continue our growth, and David will give you details on our liquidity position, our Q2 2023 results and our updated earnings outlook to year-end.  I will now spend a few minutes on the exciting news we shared last night with the announcement of our significantly expanded growth partnership with Canyon Ranch, a legendary and leading brand in the place-based wellness sector. Indeed, I'm excited to say that the VICI team is conducting this call from Canyon Ranch Lennox in the beautiful Berkshires in Massachusetts. The key elements of our expanded Canyon Ranch partnership are BG making an up to $150 million preferred equity investment in the Canyon Ranch operating company to support the expansion of the Canyon Ranch operating and digital platforms as well as enhancements to the Tucson and Lenox assets. VICI also intends to provide approximately $150 million of mortgage financing secured by Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox to refinance Canyon Ranch's existing CMBS debt. With this refinancing serving as a bridge to enhancing VICI's embedded growth pipeline by specifically allowing for VICI's conversion of its existing purchase options on Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox, which are converting to call rights, whereby VICI can elect to acquire the real estate assets of Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox in the coming years, subject to certain conditions, with Canyon Ranch continuing to operate the assets under long-term triple net leases. This also includes VICI's previously announced commitment to provide up to $200 million of development funding for Canyon Ranch Austin, which is scheduled to open between 2025 and 2026 with a call right to own the real estate upon stabilization. And finally, the joint development of a strategy of identifying and potentially acquiring conventional resorts that have conversion potential to new Canyon Ranch resorts with Canyon Ranch operating the resorts and VICI owning the resort real estate under a long-term triple net lease.  Canyon Ranch has nearly 45 years of operating history. It serves a highly affluent clientele that invest vigorously through all cycles in medical and holistic life enhancement experiences and services. With only 2 established destination resort locations, we believe Canyon Ranch is positioned to significantly expand its clientele and its geography domestically and internationally. We are investing in Canyon Ranch to help fund and energize that expansion gaining through our partnership the opportunity to fund the acquisition and integration of new Canyon Ranch Resorts. Under the leadership of CEO, Jeff Kuster, the Canyon Ranch team is poised to grow its brand reach and network breadth, both programmatically and geographically. And of all the elements of our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch, John Goff, Canyon Ranch's [indiscernible] and I are most excited about network expansion in the years ahead. Both John Goff and I believe that the conventional resort sector could see elements of distress in the next few years, less to do with operating performance and more to do with refinancing constriction.  As we have pointed out in our transaction deck, which can be found at www.viciproperties.com, more than $37 billion of resort and hotel CMBS financing will come due from 2024 through 2028. And I should point out that, that's only a fraction of the overall mortgage financing on U.S. hotels and resorts during this period. We believe that within those billions of dollars, our resorts that could meet Canon Ranch's conversion criteria.  The conversion of a conventional resort to a Canyon Ranch Resort has the potential to be transformative thanks to the capital and operating dynamics of the Canyon Ranch economic model. The Canyon Ranch model centers on maximizing the guest experience of space, indoors and out, and maximizing the guest experience of time through Canyon Ranch's holistic wellness and life enhancement offerings. This maximization of experiences leads to a revenue intensity within the Canyon Ranch model that surpasses the economic intensity of a conventional resort, potentially giving Canyon Ranch and VICI competitive advantage in acquiring and realizing value out of resort locations meeting our criteria. I believe our growth opportunity with Canyon Ranch is a generational opportunity in multiple senses of generational. Wellness is a secular growth trend that is multigenerational in its consumer profile and generational in terms of its secular outlook and growth opportunity. And Canyon Ranch Resorts are real estate built to last for generations.  At VICI, we invest in partnerships and real estate assets that will preserve and grow value for many generations to come. As you look across the spectrum of S&P 500 REITs, ask yourself is the real estate of high-quality and generational durability? And does the real estate enjoy the benefit of cultural and demographic tailwinds that will sustain and grow the value of the real estate for generations come? With VICI, I believe you get high-quality enduring real estate occupied by operators serving multiple generations of customers for generations to come. We believe our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch is a superb example of this value proposition.  With that, over to you, John Payne.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Ed makes an excellent point on the quality enduring aspects of VICI's portfolio. Our tenants continue to prove their operational excellence and their ability to innovate and evolve their business. And importantly, for VICI, their assets as well. The results that continue to come out of Las Vegas speak to our tenants' operational quality and the operating credit, which we believe accrues to the value of our real estate. I will touch on Las Vegas in the gaming sector shortly. But I wanted to emphasize the type of portfolio we have built and that the team continues to build at VICI. These characteristics are a core focus of our strategy as we meet potential partners in gaming and nongaming experiential sectors, both domestically and internationally.  To recap our second quarter and subsequent activity, VICI continued its international expansion into Canada with our announcement of the acquisition of 4 gaming assets from Century Casino in Alberta. We also closed on the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland this week, again with Century Casinos. Our partnership with Century is a great example of the type of operators we look for as the relationship is a win-win for both businesses as we grow together. Canyon Ranch also exemplifies the type of growth-minded partner with operational excellence and place-based wellness. As as described earlier, we are very excited to deepen and expand the relationship into the future.  Growing with our partners as they look to enhance and expand their businesses is a core component of our strategy as we develop and deepen our relationships across gaming and the non-gaming sectors. This approach helps VICI continue to grow a more visible pipeline into our future with operators we value and we trust. It also allows VICI to build a portfolio of assets with each partner that we believe can meaningfully impact VICI's growth over time. In the gaming sector, we continue to be impressed by our tenants. They exemplify the operational excellence we seek to find as we expand into other sectors. In what other sector right now, can you find a headline that reads "Another all-time record result, but in line with consensus." Las Vegas has remained at or near all-time highs in terms of margins and results and is continuing to see record traffic. Regional casinos are performing well as the high-value consumer segment remains quite healthy. We continue to see many domestic real estate opportunities in gaming, including in markets where we do not currently own assets and as the industry expands its footprint into new areas of the United States. We also remain focused on international opportunities with the team traveling the globe this year, meeting new potential partners. As VICI's brand has ascended the funnel of opportunities has expanded in both gaming and non-gaming. We've added resources to meet the expanded funnel of opportunities. And as always, we work closely with our advisers and those in the VICI network to help force multiply our ability to create and evaluate opportunities.  For nongaming, we are intensely studying various sectors at a category level and operating level and at an asset level. Notably, in the family entertainment and sports categories, we're moving past the evaluation stage and into constructive discussions on how VICI's capital can fit best with our growing relationships. As you know, our relationships at VICI are at the heart of our success, and they take time to cultivate as we aim to find the best solutions that meet the goals of both sides, especially in an ever-evolving economic and capital markets environment. We're excited about how these relationships are developing.  The VICI team has been hard at work this year, building relationships and opportunities for a pipeline of growth across multiple sectors and geographies in the years to come. We are focused on partnering with best-in-class growth-minded operators with whom VICI can continue to grow our high-quality and generational real estate portfolio. We worked tirelessly to deliver results to our shareholders, evidenced by the last 5.5 years.  Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll keep my remarks brief as we want to leave as much time for everyone's questions, but I do want to touch on our liquidity and our updated full year guidance. We are constantly focusing and at times obsessing on the balance sheet as we work to bring our leverage back down to our target range of 5 to 5.5x, while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our shareholders. We are diligently working with the agencies to improve our credit ratings over time, lower our cost of capital while balancing the right leverage for the company.  At quarter end, we had approximately $4 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $740 million in cash, $870 million of net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we settled approximately $190 million in shares under our forward sale agreements to fund the closing of Rocky Gap.  In terms of leverage, net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.6x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.4 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 12% compared to $0.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are updating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.13 billion and $2.16 billion or between $2.11 and $2.14 per diluted common share. Just to reiterate, based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 10%, one of the highest growth rates across REIT brands.  And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we've discussed with you in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused and -- as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the product -- productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: Congratulations on Canyon Ranch. But -- my first question is actually on Bellagio and news around that, that was out around the quarter. Can you just maybe give us your view on how you would think about a transaction like that or the appetite to do something of that nature?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, I'll start and John and David can chime in as they wish. I want to answer that question at the level of general principles. We take great care in how we acquire and that care manifests itself in us not attempting to buy what we can accretively pay for. And so we evaluate every situation on the basis of can we create value for our investors straight out of the gate. Our net lease model is a model in which the yield we get at the outset is the yield we're going to live with. I mean, we'll obviously -- we can obviously get rent escalation over time and increasing yields based on that. But we are not a category where we can go in and accept a dilutive yield going in on the basis of having an underwriting thesis of asset management that's somehow going to magically transform a dilutive yield into an accretive yield. So we are very careful and very humble in understanding what we can and can't do, and that guides our investment decision-making.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one question on Canyon Ranch and the pref into the operating platform. Is that something that is currently going to make money, either from a cash flow basis or even from an earnings point of view? And then just also how you thought about making an investment into one of your partners operating platform as we think about could that happen going forward and more frequency?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So I'll take the second part of your question and the first, and then David can answer the first part of your question. In terms of will we be doing a lot more of this? I would say generally, no. I wouldn't rule it out, but I think there's idiosyncrasies, beneficialty of syncrasies to the Canyon Ranch situation, Tony, that gave us high conviction, this was the right thing to do in this situation, investing in the Canyon Ranch operating platform. Insofar as as we look across experiential sectors, we're particularly intrigued with the degree to which wellness is a globally magnificent business in terms of its economics and its scale. As we pointed out in our transaction deck, McKinsey estimates that wellness as manifested in the Canyon Ranch model is a $1.5 trillion global industry. And yet, we think it's one of the least consolidated experiential sectors, especially in relation to its magnitude globally. And so we believe Canyon Ranch has a growth opportunity, a unique growth opportunity that deserved a unique solution in terms of VICI providing growth capital into the operating platform in this particular situation. And then David, do you want to take the first part?
David Kieske: Yes. Tony, I mean, it goes to Ed's comments around, it's a holistic solution where we obviously provided the pref and then we'll fund the loan here in the not-too-distant future. But it all goes to the the opportunity that Ed and John talked about on CNBC last night that this was a much greater opportunity than just the pref. The pref itself is accretive to us. It does make money. We funded $90 million yesterday, and we will kind of a delayed draw funding schedule that will happen over the next 3 or 4 quarters. So it's a phenomenal tool to be partners with the organization and grow together.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Evercore.
Unidentified Analyst: Small technical question. David, what is implicit CPI in your guidance for the balance of the year? What are you assuming on lease escalations, I guess, on a blended basis?
David Kieske: Yes, Jim, we just assume the base rates. We don't -- if we had a crystal ball, we would predict CPI, but we don't have a crystal ball. So for [indiscernible] it's 2%, some of the regionals, it's obviously 1.5%, but it's just the base rates in guidance.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. what you do with that. And then perhaps just for John, quickly, you mentioned if you're adding resources. You said to study new verticals. And I mean, could you just elaborate a little further on that? Is that people or new -- what does that mean, I guess? And then what's the cost of that potentially?
John Payne: Yes. We've been adding -- it's a great question. We've been adding -- I think we brought on a new Chief Investment Officer a little over a year ago, and we've been adding staff under David and Aaron's team to get a little deeper in the segments that we've been studying. And it's important to do that. There's only so many places I could be and so many things that a few of us could study. We realized we needed to bring on some resources to be more productive.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.
David Katz: As we think about this growth beyond gaming in vehicles that are not the same kind of lease structures you have, right, loans, et cetera. Obviously, the risk profile on those are a bit different, but you're getting paid for that risk. If you could just update us or talk through how you think about that risk and the payment for that risk, it would be helpful.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So I think when it comes to VICI's credit activities, we do, as you suggested, David, we take great care in the underwriting. I think one of the key elements of our underwriting is that when it comes to absolute bottom line risk, it would be an asset we would be very happy to own if we ended up needing to own it, okay? We don't want to lend against stuff we would never want to own. That for us is absolutely existential. And obviously, we want to make sure we're putting money behind not only a really good asset, but a really good operator in whose credit we can be confident whether they are developing or operating. So in this particular time, I would also say that it is a very accretive deployment of our capital insofar as the overall real estate transaction market continues to be really depressed in terms of activity. I believe the last month that was reported on it was down about 60%, 70% year-over-year. So credit does give us an opportunity to deploy capital accretively in a period in which the transaction market is still somewhat stalled, especially based upon would-be sellers and would-be buyers not having high conviction around what assets -- how assets should be valued.
John Payne: Ed, can I add something to that to David...
Edward Pitoniak: Sure.
John Payne: Just because we've been talking a lot about nongaming, I think we'll probably continue -- it shouldn't be lost that we continue to travel the world in studying gaming assets. You shouldn't take that -- a lot of the conversation is about these great new partnerships that we've formed in the experiential sectors that somehow we've lost sight of how great the casino business is, we are continuing to do that and and put resources to studying unique opportunities all over the United States and the world.
Operator: We now turn to Smedes Rose with Citi.
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask, it looks like the Venetian Palazzo is going to unionize, and I'm just wondering, I know it probably doesn't change your rents, but do you think it meaningfully changes the tenant's coverage ratios as they move to that more structured workforce?
John Payne: Look, it's hard for us to quantitate that. That's probably a question for the operator. But I will remind you, and you know this well, and you've heard me say this many a time, whether the business is up 5%, 10% of the business is down 5%, VICI and its 5.5 years has collected 100% of its rent from all of its operators. So this is an operator decision that the Pallo team made, and I think they feel very good about the workforce there.
Edward Pitoniak: And Smedes, let me just add, while generally, we do not, for very good reasons, disclose asset level 4-wall rent coverage or EBITDAR, EBITDA before rent, the Venetian did go before the Nevada Gaming Board back in November and did disclose at that time what they expected to achieve for 2022 EBITDAR at the resort and they disclosed they are on track for $650 million of EBITDA before rent. And you know that in our first year, we were collecting $250 million of rent. So there is a lot of coverage at the Venetian.
Smedes Rose: Yes. Okay. Yes, fair enough. And then you just mentioned that the -- it sounds like there's a little more clarity on the family entertainment and sports area that you're exploring. I mean is that something where you would be -- you would hope to have an announcement in that arena sometime over the course of this year? Or you just -- just wondering if you could just follow up a little bit on those comments.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, Smedes, I -- clearly, I can't predict when we're going to make announcements. I think it's 2 sectors that were kind of past, a, are we interested in and that we're in the evaluation stage and then how can we structure or be constructive in using our capital to help family entertainment companies or sports category companies grow their business. I really can't tell you exactly when there will be a deal or if there'll be a deal. I just wanted to reiterate that we are digging a little bit deeper in those 2 sectors right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Thomas: First question, Ed, your comments in response to a previous question, the company is very focused on AFFO growth and investing on an accretive basis relative to your cost of capital. But how do you weigh asset quality relative to the initial yield and AFFO accretion that an investment may generate? And is there a situation where you could justify making an investment that commands a lower initial yield, but maybe meaningfully improve portfolio quality and it's relatively NAV neutral, but again, may weigh on the company's AFFO growth initially?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. It's a really good question to ask, Todd. And the way we think about it is that we absolutely do recognize the value of quality. And we can find ourselves in situations where we're willing to accept a lower yield on the highest quality real estate. We still want it to be an accretive yield. We can't accept a dilutive yield in the name of quality. But at the end of the day, we are solving for a blended yield across our investment activity. And so if we can buy great real estate at a thinner but still accretive yield, and match that with an investment in good real estate at higher yields and end up with a blended yield that creates real value for our shareholders, that's how we are, and that's how we will run the business.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then are you able to -- and apologies if I missed this, but are you able to disclose a little bit of detail around the pricing for the preferred equity investment and the mortgage financing announced with regards to the Canyon Ranch?
David Kieske: Yes, Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. We aren't giving out specific deals similar to how we've kind of operated in the past around the competitive nature of capital out there and the relationship nature of this capital. It's -- as I just talked about, it's all guiding towards a blended yield that's accretive to our cost of capital. So we feel good about the investments.
Edward Pitoniak: We do. And Todd, this is a great way of elaborating on the first question you asked. I mean we are sitting here in a mansion in the Berkshires. It is the definition of high-quality real estate built to last for generations. And you can be confident that when you put all this together, we are achieving accretion for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist.
Carlo Santarelli: Congrats on the deal with Canyon Ranch. Maybe this is for Ed. But longer term, what would you like to see the mix of rent between gaming and nongaming tenants?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Barry. I wish we had a really -- well, actually, I don't know if I wish that we had a really exact answer. The truth is we don't have a highly exact answer. It will very much obviously depend on what we're able to source globally in gaming and non-gaming. I do think the math is such that you can be confident gaming will still be the lion's share of our rental given the magnitude of economics that come out of gaming assets domestically and internationally. And we would not put an arbitrary line across our rent roll to say, okay, this much needs to be gaming, this much needs to be nongaming. We're not going to manage in terms of those kinds of numbers, we're going to manage in terms of achieving accretion and value and quality growth.
Barry Jonas: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, as I guess we think about the pipeline of gaming opportunities, you could kind of put it in 2 buckets or probably more, but for one, there are operators that you've worked with out there and have good relationships and opportunities for follow-up deals. But then there's also a number of large operators who really haven't done much sale leaseback or any. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the path or the catalyst from here to get some of those players over the fence.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I mean, we are following the same plans that we have since we started the company is continuing to build relationships, like you said, with our existing operators, and meeting the operators that we've not been fortunate yet to do business with, educating them on how our capital can work, how we can help them grow, once we're partners, how we can use a property growth fund to help them grow, traveling not only domestically as we started the company, but now as you can see, we've been in Canada and acquired some real estate in Canada, and we're traveling the world to find other unique opportunities that are out there. So it's just about building relationships and letting them know that should there be a time they want to monetize their real estate or they want to acquire another company or an asset that we're there to be a good partner.
Operator: We now turn to Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wesley Golladay: I just want to go back to the Canyon Ranch opportunity. You did mention there's a lot of room for growth, both domestically and internationally. I guess maybe looking at maybe the next 5 to 10 years, how big can this get? And what do you think is an average acquisition volume price? Would $100 million unit be a good estimate?
Edward Pitoniak: I don't think you'd be far off, Wes. You'd be in the ballpark. There's an optimal size for Canyon Ranches. Generally, I think John Goff and Jeff Kuster and the team would tell you generally between 100 and 150 rooms. And obviously, the room count is only part of the equation. Obviously, the facilities that go around the rooms are what really differentiates Canyon Ranch. But you did hear John Goff on CNBC last night, expressing his ambition that this be a $2 billion relationship in -- within the coming years. And we're very happy to hear him say that. And I do think when you look at this as a $1.5 trillion global industry that McKinsey estimates is going to grow at a compound rate of 5% to 10% a year for the years to come. We do think, again, that the Canyon Ranch brand has growth opportunities not only in North America, but internationally as well. And the other thing I just wanted to say, Wes, is that we -- and it goes back to the question Barry asked -- the second question, Barry asked that John answered. And that is the way in which we initiate partnerships. We don't initiate transactions so much as we initiate partnerships. There's no question that if Canyon Ranch had wanted to sell the real estate to a conventional hotel REIT, they would have gotten amazing pricing, amazingly low cap rates for real estate of this prestige and quality. But the reason we're doing the deal we did is because we took a holistic approach from day 1 at understanding Canyon Ranch's business and its overall capital needs and ended up coming up with solutions that go way beyond your standard real estate transaction.
Wesley Golladay: Got it. And then maybe one for the balance sheet. I did notice you settled some shares and you just carrying the cash balance. What do you thinking there?
David Kieske: No, as we settled 6 million shares, about $190 million to fund the Rocky Gap transaction that closed 2 days ago.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. But you still have like about $700 million, I guess, you want to carry a larger cash balance maybe over the near term?
David Kieske: The cash on specifically, right. That's a result. Remember, we got repaid on the Caesars Forum Convention mortgage back on April 1. So that elevated the cash balance a little bit, but -- so this obviously gives us additional liquidity and dry powder to continue to grow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem: Just quick ones. So all the leverage at the end of the quarter at 5.6 came down nicely. Where does that trend to at the end of the year? And sort of the corollary to that is maybe what's the updated thoughts on the -- who's your park in Horseshoe in Indianapolis? What are some of the things you're looking at to potentially move on that?
Edward Pitoniak: David will take the first part, Ron, and John will take the second.
David Kieske: Yes, Ron, I appreciate your notice on that. I mean it will continue to trend down to the 5.5 range, maybe just slightly north of that. But as I stated in my remarks, right, we're very focused on getting sub-5.5 and continuing to improve our credit profile.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: And Ronald, as it pertains to the 2 wonderful assets in Indianapolis, the owner of the assets and the operator Caesars continues to do a fabulous job adding capital to the facilities, implementing the table games that the law passed a couple of years ago and growing that business. We continue to monitor that -- those 2 assets with them. We do have a put call agreement with Caesars that last until the end of December '24, and we continue to evaluate that opportunity.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. My second one is just -- I think with $26 million, $27 million of student loans payments starting. When you talk to the operators and so forth, is that something that they're thinking about as a potential headwind and so forth?
Edward Pitoniak: Ron -- weyou start, John, and I got an added point I wanted to make.
John Payne: No, go ahead, go ahead, and then I'll jump in.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Ron, it -- Moira and I were talking yesterday or the day before about the magnitude of infrastructure spend that's going on right now in the U.S. Moira, I don't know if you have the figure handy, but there is so much economic growth and so much job growth, really good job growth associated with the magnitude of infrastructure investment that's going on in the U.S. right now that I would definitely look at the impact of student loan repayments being perhaps even more than offset by the economic vitality that's coming out of the infrastructure spending that's going on right now, and especially among the workforce that does have a higher propensity to game. So I think on a net-net basis, we'd be pretty optimistic as to what the economic vitality in the U.S. over the coming year to or more could mean for experiential broadly and gaming in particular. John, I don't know if you want to add to that?
John Payne: No, Ron -- and Ed, I was just going to add about Las Vegas. I mean we continue to get a large percentage of our rent coming out of the operators in the buildings in Las Vegas. Every day, I seem to open up an article and read this morning. I don't know if you saw this, Ronald, but all-time record June at the airport in Las Vegas, 48% growth in international business. So the industry in Las Vegas and the regional continues to see solid consumer acceptance and growth in many of these locations.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE.
John DeCree: Maybe big picture, Ed or John, you kind of addressed part of this a little earlier in some of the talent that you've hired recently. But as you push into new verticals and expand your tenant base, new categories, what are some of the challenges that you face or are facing as you grow in this direction. I kind of ask in the context of some of the early day challenges you've had in the casino space with educating investors or even just educating operators into using your source of financing. So curious kind of what you're facing now as you keep pushing.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, John, nice to talk to you. I actually wouldn't describe them as challenges. I'd describe them as being quite fun, particularly in the experiential sector where there hasn't been a lot of companies like ours, taking the time to explain how our capital can help these experiential companies grow. And it is, for me, having resources and folks around me that we're out again, traveling the world and spending time with these very unique and interesting operators, whether that's in health and fitness, whether that's in the events business or the many of the other things that we continue to explore, it has been really gratifying to explain how our company and our capital and help them grow. So I wouldn't as I describe it as a challenge. I just describe it as a way of we're helping them understand the different ways we can become partners.
John DeCree: Fair enough. And maybe a little easier of a question. Going just back to the Bellagio, potential opportunity as an example. Do you -- how do you consider owning whole or part of an asset? I think there was some discussion to me that maybe it would only be a partial sale or a minority stake. Is that -- would that be a consideration or how that factor into a decision for investment from VICI, whether it's the Bellagio or any asset that you make in the future?
Edward Pitoniak: Well, John, one of the strategic motivators for doing the deal we did back in late November, early December, was to consolidate what had been a joint venture with MGM Grand Mandalay Bay. So generally speaking, while we do not rule out joint ventures, generally speaking, we are obviously going to prefer complete ownership of our assets, both in gaming and non-gaming. Again, we're not absolutely dogmatic, but it is our preference, and I think there is significance and meaning in the fact that our most recent deal in Las Vegas was the consolidation of what had been a joint venture, not the creation of a new joint venture.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: John, I appreciate your commentary on the fact that you're kind of globetrotting here trying to educate and find new investment opportunities. Are you able to provide any context in terms of maybe with the investable global gaming market is, so meaning like the total number of assets that you'd even be willing to buy globally because I know you've talked specifically about certain countries you're willing to invest in. But just curious in terms of potential investable dollars.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. I don't have the specific numbers right now, Greg. We continue to work on that and look across, as you mentioned, all the different countries where we potentially could place investments. But I don't have a specific number for you right now.
Edward Pitoniak: Greg, I'll just ask given your representatives of Scotiabank, I'll give you a little Canadian data, and that is that the absolute size is not always as important and meaningful as per cap size. And so as an example, the GGR in Canada, the commercial GGR in Canada is about $12 billion a year, and that compares to combined Las Vegas and regional commercial GGR in the U.S., if I believe, $70 million to $80 million. So on a per capita basis, with Canada having about 1/10 of the population of the U.S., obviously, Canadian show a higher propensity to game. And so that's 1 of the 3 real characteristics we look at as we evaluate gaming globally. It's not only the absolute size of the market, but the propensity of the game and the degree to which gaming is woven into the consumer economy in those countries.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And then I guess just on domestically, what are your thoughts on Downtown Las Vegas? Are owners there just thus far resistant to sale-leaseback financing? Or is there just no need there?
John Payne: I wouldn't say that, Greg. I would say that, as you've heard me say a couple of times on this call, we're continuing to build relationships, we're continuing to educate how our capital can work. I think you're asking about is that a market that we would have interest in owning real estate. There's some fabulous operators in the downtown market of Las Vegas that we are not currently partners with that we'd love to be partners with not only on the assets they have in Downtown Las Vegas, but also is there a way that we could grow with them all over the United States or even the world. We're also not in the regional market of Las Vegas, where we'd like to own real estate over time. So some of these, as you've seen in our first 5 years, some of these happen quickly. Some of these deals move fast and others. It's -- we take the long game here. We get to know the owners. We get to know the operators and hopefully, over time, a deal will come our way.
Greg McGinniss: And just a final one for me. Just given the house view on the health and wellness sector, should we expect to see investments with other operators outside of Canyon Ranch?
Edward Pitoniak: I would say that we're very much focused on Canyon Ranch given their market leadership and their growth opportunity, Greg. I mean we obviously wouldn't rule out other investments along the broader wellness spectrum. I mean, in a way, somewhat see that already with -- Great Wolf as I think, John, you've put it. Great Wolf is kind of like Canyon Ranch for kids.
Operator: We now turn to Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.
Nathan Crossett: The slide in the deck that showed the CMBS maturities over the next few years, your potential to partner with Canyon Ranch to reposition. How many locations have you kind of identified that are real candidates for this? Have you guys gone through that process already? Just trying to get a sense of the sizing.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So Nate, we've really just begun that process. But I would point out that for John Goff, he's -- he feels like he's getting to do again what he did so successfully with Richard Rainwater in the early '90s when they built Crescent Real Estate to a great degree out of the whole Resolution Trust wind-up and created an incredibly compelling resort portfolio within Crescent Real Estate by capitalizing on the distress in the market at that time. So we've -- David has done some really good work already at beginning to develop inventories. I would say though that the filtering processes, which we're going to really starts with what regions of North America is Canyon Ranch not in that it could really benefit from being in. And then from there, we look for resorts that would meet the criteria of Canyon Ranch within those geographies, regional geographies.
Nathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And I know you mentioned it's accretive. I just -- what can you say like how accretive? Like is it in line with your average spreads that you've been doing over the cost of capital, historically? I mean I know it's sensitive, but is there any guidance there?
David Kieske: Yes. I mean Nate, good to talk to you. I mean, directionally, that's accurate. Again, it's $150 million. We funded a little bit $90 million this week to draw schedule that will future funding that they will pull down as they invest in the organization. So it's directionally that's in line.
Edward Pitoniak: And what I will tell you Nate, is that our blended yield for real estate of this quality is very compelling.
Nathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. I mean, is there anything other than the $300 million that you disclosed that we should kind of expect in terms of capital deployment from this partnership this year? Like I know there's a lot of puts and takes, but just trying to get a sense of what's in...
David Kieske: And then the last October, we announced the $200 million with Canyon Ranch to help them build Austin. So that's getting going. And as I mentioned in his comments, I opened in '25, '26 at some point. And so mean we had dinner with the Canyon Ranch team last night and they were extremely excited to embark on this journey of mapping and finding these assets. So nothing specific at this moment, but we very much hope there's more to come in the near term.
Operator: We now turn to Chris Darling with Green Street.
Chris Darling: Related to Canyon Ranch, can you give us a sense of the historic cyclicality of the business there, maybe relative to traditional resorts or maybe the overall hospitality business? And then assuming you do exercise some of the call options there over time, what do you think is the right level of rent coverage relative to maybe your gaming portfolio?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So Chris, Canyon Ranch has been in operation for just about 45 years. And what they have shown through all cycles is a resilience that is far stronger than conventional luxury resorts. And so much of that has to do with Canyon Ranch being for so much of its clientele a ritual, not even just necessarily an annual ritual but in some cases, a quarterly ritual. So the commitment to Canyon Ranch on the part of the consumer is stronger than the purely discretionary commitment that you get in most luxury resorts, which I know you cover. And so based on that, we do not feel we need inordinately high coverage. And yet what is very comforting is the fact that the economic intensity of these properties does create economic headroom above the rent that gives us very, very great comfort in the level of coverage.
Chris Darling: That's really helpful color. I appreciate it. And then maybe switching gears for a second question. When you announced Rocky Gap last year, rent coverage was pretty skinny at the time. I think it was about 1.7x, if I'm right. I recognize that property has been folded into the broader master lease Century now, but would still be curious to understand what current coverage levels look like, assuming you're willing to share?
David Kieske: Yes, Chris, it's David. Good to talk to you. And we did -- we did set the coverage lower on Rocky Gap because it was going into a very healthy master lease. Century is a phenomenal operator, goes into these assets and improves coverage from where they were, which they did on the 3 pack that we originally bought with them back in 2019. So we can't give out asset level coverage because they don't give out asset level coverage, but it's very, very healthy coverage coming out of those assets, and we're excited to add that as well as the Alberta assets into that master lease.
Operator: Our final question comes from Dan Guglielmo with Capital One Securities.
Daniel Guglielmo: Just one for me. Ed, in February, you mentioned that the debt environment back then could result in the greatest advantages to some of the biggest REITs with access to capital. I know a lot has happened since then, but is that advantage playing out the way that you thought? And do you still see that as an advantage continuing for the next few years?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I very much think so, Dan. I think that could be true in both gaming and nongaming as I think I might have mentioned on that call, Dan. We look on a weekly basis on what the yields to worst are on on gaming and other leisure credits, and you're still seeing yields to worse even with the recent tightening of spreads that make sale leasebacks a very compelling alternative when it comes to refinancing the debt that will come due in the coming years in both gaming and non-gaming.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A. I will now hand back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I just want to thank everybody on the call today, both the analysts who asked very good questions in all of our investors who are also on the line. We thank you for your time, and we're excited to talk to you again in a few months. Bye for now.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 2, 2023.  I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions.  During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today by telling you how I tend to spend my Saturday mornings espresso in hand. First, I grab the FT, the old-fashioned print edition, to see what Katie Martin has to say about the state of the equity and credit markets in her Long View column. Katie can be very funny. But the long and short of it is that the market participants she's quoting these days aren't having a lot of fun. Then I might grab my iPad and catch up on any of Rob Armstrong's unhedged FT columns that I fell behind on during the prior week. Rob's response to current and prospective market conditions is rather Hamlet in character: to be or not to be, to be a bull or to be a bear or to be neither. But who is he who is neither bull nor bear? That is the question. In my second espresso, I might see with the two Michaels and one Marko, among others, have had to offer a market commentary and forecasting in the prior few days, Hartnett, Wilson, Kolanovic. I could call them the 3 archdukes of doom, but that would be unfair. Well, actually not that unfair. And these folks are formulating a rational response to the current state of the macro economy, monetary and fiscal policy and the markets. Visibility is low. Uncertainty is high. In commercial real estate, asset pricing is murky and/or subject to dispute between would be sellers and would be buyers. As a result, there's not a whole lot of trading going on. Commercial real estate trading was down nearly 70% year-over-year in March 2023. And it's not like March 2022 was a barn burner for real estate assets or portfolio trading. What does all this uncertainty and low visibility mean for how we're thinking and what we're doing at VICI? Our thinking in doing starts with our current state of earnings growth and investment activity. As you saw on last night's VICI earnings release, for Q1 2023, we generated year-over-year AFFO growth of 18.6% per share, a rate that we believe will be among the highest for REITs generally and S&P 500 REITs specifically. And to take a broader view, so far in earnings season, year-over-year Q1 2023 earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of all kinds is running at negative 4% versus VICI's Q1 AFFO growth again at 18.6%. But it's not only about growth in current earnings, it's about growing our future earnings. Along that line and even amidst this murky trading environment, within Q1, we allocated a total of $1.6 billion of incremental capital to compelling and accretive experiential property and lending investments, which John will have more detail on in a moment. And even with that $1.6 billion of capital having been newly allocated in Q1, we have approximately $859 million of equity dry powder, thanks to our unsettled forward equity and approximately $650 million in cash. Combined that with $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, and we have the funding in place to seize on further opportunity if opportunity presents itself in this current environment. Most of all, during an uncertain time like this, we keep doing what we've done at VICI from the beginning. We are always working on our future, growing relationships that have the potential to grow our business. These relationships don't have to turn into deals tomorrow, as John has noted in the past. In that vein, think about the fact that the AFFO growth VICI expects to produce in 2023 is in good measure, the result of relationship building we did many years ago with those who would end up being our partners in our Venetian and MGP transaction, which we announced in 2021. Thus, it is, to reiterate, that much of the work we are doing at VICI in 2023 is about growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And yet I don't mean to suggest that we are not jumping on immediate opportunities when those opportunities are compelling, as evidenced again by the $1.6 billion of capital we newly deployed in Q1 2023. Finally, we are working intensely in the present and for our future with one of the lowest G&A loads in American triple net REIT management as a percentage of revenues or of assets. Think of our G&A as a form of asset management fee. Our asset management fee understood in this way, as measured by VICI corporate G&A, runs at about 0.1% of assets under management. That's a fee load you would expect from a passive manager of an index fund. With VICI for 0.1%, you get very active investment management that has historically produced significant outperformance. I'll now turn the call to John so that he can share with you what kind of activities we have been up to and are up to. John?
John Payne : Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. Ed quoted Shakespeare's Hamlet when describing current market conditions. So I thought it would be appropriate to quote another great, Ted Lasso, when describing how the VICI team has functioned through the last 5 years of a rather volatile market. Coach Lasso said, "The harder you work, the luckier you get." We saw the results of that work come together in 2022, which was a transformational year for VICI in which we doubled our size and scale, becoming one of the largest triple net REITs. 2023, as Ed just noted, is the year in which we are laying the groundwork for VICI's next phase of expansion domestically and globally across gaming and many other experiential sectors. In the first quarter, VICI closed on its first international transaction with PURE Canadian Gaming in Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's top gaming markets. We are thrilled that our first international transaction was in Canada as we believe the Canadian gaming industry presents a great opportunity for VICI as it is an established industry with many similarities to the U.S. gaming industry. This transaction will be the first of many international investments that the VICI team continues to explore across the globe. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% stake in our Mandalay Bay/MGM Grand joint venture with Blackstone. This real estate consolidation was a great example of our high functioning partnership with Blackstone as we both accomplished important goals with this transaction, and VICI now owns 100% of 2 additional Class A resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. To spend a moment on Las Vegas. In February, over 4 million people traveled through Harry Reid Airport for the first time ever, which is 25% above February of 2022. Our operating partners continue to set all-time records and volumes in all segments continue to remain strong. Our operating partners continue to see very strong hotel occupancy and are also experiencing a nice recovery in the group and convention business. These strong operating numbers are the result of tremendous innovation and capital deployment by our tenants and their work is making Las Vegas the gaming, sports and entertainment capital of the world. We're also proud to expand our relationship with tribal nations, adding Cherokee Nation businesses of Oklahoma to our tenant roster as they enter into the lease agreement related to the Gold Strike Casino and Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. We are also supporting our partners at Hard Rock in the redevelopment of Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada by purchasing a portion of the senior secured notes funding this exciting new project. The American tribal nations are some of the best gaming operators, and we look forward to continue to find ways to help support their growth as they expand in the commercial gaming across the country. Within nongaming experiential industries, the team is intensely studying sectors we believe fit well with our VICI Properties investment criteria. We continue to meet and build relationship with owners and operators in many sectors, including health and wellness, youth, collegiate and professional sports, various forms of family entertainment, theme parks, holiday parks and other destination-based experiences. The team is forging foundational relationships with the market leaders who have ambitions to grow and see VICI as a preferred capital partner for their businesses, similar to those we helped, Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch. For this quarter, we expanded our indoor water park presence with our fourth loan to Great Wolf Lodge to fund the development of their location in Connecticut and in partnership with the Foxwoods Resort. The VICI team will make the most of this year by continuing to build a pipeline of partnerships that we believe will help us achieve our future growth goals, while at the same time expecting to deliver at least 10% of AFFO per share growth in 2023. As you've observed over the past 5 years, our team does not rest very often as we're laser-focused on building the highest quality experiential REIT in the world. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?
David Kieske : Thanks, John. 2023 started off with several very exciting transactions. Our ability to move quickly and close these acquisitions at the start of the year as a result of the liquidity we have maintained and balance sheet that we have built over the years in an effort to be nimble and act on attractive opportunities as they come before us. We will continue to focus on the balance sheet as it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. As John mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the four PURE Canadian gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, the 49.9% interest we previously did not own in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. And we purchased $85 million of senior secured notes issued by Hard Rock Ottawa LP. This is an exciting transaction for VICI as we partnered with a large financial institution to provide Hard Rock with a complete financing solution for the redevelopment of what will become the Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada. In addition, we announced a $287.9 million construction loan for the development of a Great Wolf Lodge, which sits on land owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation next to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. This transaction represents our fourth loan with Great Wolf for a total capital commitment of approximately $550 million to support Great Wolf's development pipeline. In January, we re-bolstered our liquidity raising approximately $965 million of available net equity proceeds through the sale of 30.3 million shares via forward sale agreements. On April 4, we physically settled 3.2 million of these shares for net proceeds of approximately $101.5 million. As we sit here today, we have approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity, As Ed mentioned, this is comprised of approximately $650 million in cash, $859 million of net proceeds available from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of the leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x today. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement. AFFO was $528.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 73% over Q1 2022. AFFO per share was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% compared to the $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. As a reminder, the disparity between our overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from equity raise and shares issued to fund our acquisition of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay JV this quarter and to consummate our acquisitions of MGP during Q2 and the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As a reminder, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone : My first question relates to your discussion around building relationships for the future pipeline. And so I was wondering if you can comment on whether or not there's a certain type of deal size that's emerging as a sweet spot for the different things you're looking at or even a region perhaps in the world where sort of the deal flow seems to be pointing.
Edward Pitoniak : [Indiscernible]
John Payne : Do you want me to take that?
Edward Pitoniak : Well, John, I just want to -- what? Sorry, can you hear me now? If not, go ahead, John.
John Payne : We can hear you, Ed.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes, I was just going to say, Tony, I apologize for that. When we work on relationships, we're obviously working on new ones all the time. But we also work very hard make sure our existing relationships are strong and productive, mutually productive as they can be. And thus, we were rather honored that Jonathan Halkyard, the CFO at MGM, referenced in his earnings call last night to VICI being a fantastic partner of ours. So that's a very big focus in terms of where future growth can come from, which is to say with our existing tenants. But in terms of the other relationships we're building, I'll turn it over to John. John?
John Payne : Yes. Tony, I won't go into specifics about the relationships we're building. We are studying the industry, countries around the world. But I just use -- we've been asked since we started the company about when we look at something that's the size and how small. I mean, I'll just use the example of a Century gaming, we did one deal. We then announced the deal in Maryland with them. And we're just -- hopefully, over time, we'll continue to build that relationship. So we really think that there are times that a smaller deal by itself may "look small," but over the lifetime of a partnership or a relationship, that will get larger. And so we are chalking up miles, meeting folks face to face and traveling the world to find opportunities for our company and for our shareholders that are accretive.
Anthony Paolone : Okay. And John, just as a follow-up maybe. Capital markets have been volatile over the last few months or quarters. Like can you maybe give us a sense as to what the brackets are on yields for the things you're considering right now?
John Payne : Well, that would have been an easier question back 5 years ago, I think, Tony, when we were just looking at gaming opportunities domestically. We could probably take the rest of the call as we look at different sectors. But I'll let David talk about how thoughtful we are in understanding our cost of capital and getting spreads when we're making investments or creating term sheets. But we're looking at a wide variety of sectors, countries in gaming and non-gaming. So David, do you want to touch a little bit on that as well?
David Kieske : Yes, happy to, John. And Tony, good to talk to yet. I mean, as you saw during the quarter, we partnered with a large financial institution and put out some capital at an 11% rate. I'm not here to say that every deal we're going to do is going to be 11%. But we are focused on a blended spread to our cost of capital, and we've -- our share price has held in our financing costs, just to get ahead of that question, is for a 10-year piece of paper is probably right around 6% today. So we're very cognizant of deploying capital on a risk-adjusted basis that generates spread investing over the time while adding just phenomenal real estate phenomenal relationships and growth partners like we've done in the past with Cabot and Canyon. And we're confident there's more to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: It's actually Nick Joseph up here with Smedes. Maybe following up on that last comment. How do you think about the competitiveness of your cost of capital relative to more traditional sources of capital as you look to deploy it?
Edward Pitoniak : And Nick, good to hear from you. By traditional sorts of capital, are you referring to the debt and equity financing available to the asset controller?
Nicholas Joseph : Exactly.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. So clearly, a lot of the experiential landscape is made up of operators who tend to be high-yield credits. And as you well know, the high-yield market has been really quite dormant for quite a while now, going well into -- well back into last year and continuing into this year. So the access to credit is somewhat limited and the cost of it obviously has widened. And the cost of equity for many of them has at best on sideways. So as we look at the maturity walls that many debtors are facing 2024, 2025 and onward, we do think, as we talked about in the past, that we can be a virtuous source of funding through sale-leaseback structures when it comes to either refinancing debt or perhaps even more compellingly financing expansion for good operators who may have expansion opportunities, roll-up opportunities in the next few years should other operators come under any kind of refinancing pressure.
Nicholas Joseph : And then just on international expansion. Obviously, Canada is generally pretty similar to the U.S. But as you think about other kind of further expansion, how do you think about pricing regulatory and political risk from different geographies or countries?
Edward Pitoniak : David?
David Kieske : Yes. Thanks, Ed. Nick, good to talk to you. We're spending time across the globe looking where there -- where others have gone and where there's REIT friendly jurisdictions, favorable tax regimes, favorable political regimes, favorable currency, favorable funding markets. So you're absolutely right. I mean as we spent time in Canada and got our training wheels on, so to speak, with Canada, the team developed a lot of institutional learning and list a lot of institutional knowledge around how to set up structures, how to set up minimize tax leakage and ensure that we have the right protection for our income that we will potentially generate abroad. And so it goes into the black box, so to speak, and we would need to make sure that we generate significant spreads to that -- to the cost of capital because there is tax leakage. There is some risk. And so not every deal is the same. But we'll make sure that we are partnering with the right folks and underwriting the credit and the real estate quality and the future earnings growth of these potential opportunities that may come abroad.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz : Look, I think we've talked to a bunch of our companies so far. All of them over the past several months, looking for some perspective that may indicate some kind of a turn in the consumer economy or in the business economy. And I think you may have a unique perspective because you stay close to your tenants. And I just wonder what you're hearing and seeing. I know John travels around quite a bit. He was engaged on the gaming side. But if there's anything outside of gaming that we can talk about, what is your sort of economic view?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, we'll turn it over to John just to reiterate the strength we're seeing in gaming. But we can say, for example, that our partners add businesses like Cabot, like Canyon Ranch, like Great Wolf are seeing -- continuing to see very, very strong demand. Some of it, David, is obviously the COVID pent-up demand factor still exercising itself. But as you've heard us talk about in the past, we also believe we're seeing the evidence of the secular trends we've talked about at VICI, which is aging baby boomers moving into years in which they have more leisure time and millennials moving into family formation, which is obviously benefiting a business like Great Wolf. So I think, David and John, it's fair to say that our non-gaming operators are feeling everybody is confident in their outlook as we are hearing and seeing in gaming. Correct, John and David?
John Payne : Yes, absolutely. And I couldn't agree more with that. I did want to take the opportunity because David asked about our Las Vegas operators and are staying in touch with them as well as our regional operators, David, we're very blessed now today have 11 tenants, right? And so we get a really good view of the entire industry, and our tenants are willing to do what we would call informal reviews with us on a quarterly basis to share with us their views on how things are going. And it's not in our leases. They do this because we form these partnerships, and it helps us better discussions about how we can help them grow. But across the gaming sector, I mean, it's really amazing to hear the results MGM released yesterday or earlier today, 36% growth in same-store adjusted EBITDAR, right, in Las Vegas. And that's an incredible number. So when I do these meetings with our team, we ask the question, where are you seeing slowness in your business, in your operating business? And there's very little slowness in any of the sectors. In fact, there's still growth in almost all of them. So it's a really interesting business, and forward bookings are still robust in Las Vegas. And then the regional markets continue to show steadiness across many of their sectors. And so it's exciting to have these partners who continue to innovate, continue to deploy capital. Many of them have seen a really nice return on the capital that they're deploying, whether it's new restaurants mixing hotel rooms that needed upgrades, et cetera.
David Katz : Understood. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up. Just reading this morning and following very closely, some of the more regional lenders out there that account for, according to some of the press, 80% of commercial real estate mortgages. Is there any strategy or a way for you to approach and position yourselves to participate productively and pools of smaller deals or anything like that, given the circumstances, is there some opportunity for you to get in there and become an alternative lender?
Edward Pitoniak : It's a really good question, David, and we are digging into it and need to dig into it deeper. I would say that based on what we've seen so far, regional banks in their commercial real estate lending are generally lending to asset categories like office, like multi-res and other categories, retail, that we won't invest in. So I'm not sure that there's a direct opportunity to get involved in categories that regional banking lenders have tended to focus on. But I do think there's an indirect opportunity in that we are seeing evidence, as is everyone, of further tightening of credit. So I do believe there is going to be enhanced opportunity for us. I'm not sure it's going to be directly from the tightening of credit by regional lenders to the conventional real estate asset classes. But I do think, David, we're very confident that we are already seeing, as evidenced by the work David and the team have done in Hard Rock Ottawa, Fontainebleau and other credit opportunities, that we're going to continue to see both enhanced credit opportunity and enhanced real estate acquisition opportunities because of the tightening for credit. David Kieske, anything to add?
David Kieske : No, I think you touched on it perfectly. I echo that, that we are seeing opportunities to potentially lend capital. But when we think about our strategic lending book, we want to ensure it's with the right partners where it could lead to future growth opportunities. And I think at the regional level, less opportunity for us. But look, that will trickle up to the bigger banks, right? That will have an impact on JPMorgan's and the BofA's and the Citi's lending across the board, and so that could create opportunities for us around the experiential categories.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Thomas : First question, David. You mentioned that the company's incremental cost of debt today, I think, is around 6%. You said your cost of equity capital continues to improve and is in that range, depending on how you look at it, and the stock is up nearly 6% year-to-date, so that's improving. Does that change the way that you think about capitalizing new investments, vis-a-vis, rising debt costs in the near term?
David Kieske : Yes, Todd. Good to talk to you. And just to be clear, that 6% for a 10-year piece of paper. So obviously, different tenors have different rates. Post the MGP acquisition, we've been highly, highly focused on continuing to delever the; balance sheet. We obviously elevated leverage a little bit to bring in that phenomenal portfolio that we added to our company and to transform our company. But as you've seen us do throughout 2022 and into 2023 is going to over-equitize transactions. And as we sit here today in May 2nd, we have a maturity coming up in roughly one year. It's due May 1, 2024. And so we'll continue to use the equity, use our free cash flow to fund transactions and then things that potentially larger transactions look to add those to the balance sheet on a leverage-neutral basis.
Todd Thomas : Okay. And then as you look ahead at all of the various investment opportunities and different sort of categories and industries that you're underwriting relative to your cost of capital, do you expect that the spread that you're investing at will improve as you look out at the pipeline over the next few quarters relative to sort of the spread that you've locked in on more recent investments here over the last couple of quarters?
David Kieske : I mean I could start and others chime in. I mean, Todd, each deal is different. And obviously, we have this debate internally a lot. Sure, we'd love to say we can print a 300 basis point, 400 basis point spread to our cost of capital. But the intrinsic value of some pieces of real estate that just have -- will trade at lower cap rates and lending opportunities could be at slightly higher yields. And so as we look to balance our -- the overall yield that we generate for on our capital over the long term, we want to ensure that we are generating a 100 basis point to 150 basis point spread on a blended basis for -- based on the capital that we deploy on a quarterly and an annual basis. So while there's the hope that we can deploy capital at higher spreads, sometimes real estate is worth to get a deal done, it takes -- it might take a slightly tighter spread to ensure that we can build the partnerships and the relationships and the growth pipeline that we want to deliver over time here. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas : When you think about leaning more into new international markets, how do you think about supporting greenfield developments through, say, construction loans versus sale leaseback of existing assets?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. Barry, I'll take that at the start and then David can add in. I would say that our confidence around funding development internationally, it needs to be basically in line with the confidence that we need to have to fund development domestically. We've added caveats that if it is international, we need to have even more compensating factors in place to compensate for the risks associated with currency and tax. But at the end of the day, we're really underwriting the credibility and the credit of the developer/operating partner. So again, whether we're talking about Europe, Japan or other jurisdictions, we won't, by any means, say, April I know we won't do it. But the underwriting will have to be even that much more rigorous. David, I don't know if you want to add to that?
David Kieske : No, I think you hit it perfectly.
Barry Jonas : That's great. And then just as a follow-up. John, I appreciate the comments on the consumer and your tenants. But MGM did talk last night about seeing maybe more growth at its luxury properties. I'm just curious if you're seeing consistent trends from a coverage perspective across your portfolio? And then maybe to what extent does this or any other dynamic influence your M&A strategy?
John Payne : It's a very good question, Barry. Again, just kind of reiterating what I said about having 11 different tenants, so you get different views. And I think we've tried to build a portfolio where we have the luxury segment and then we have the kind of the middle sector and the properties that cater to them. They all seem to be continuing to perform quite well. Obviously, if a higher-end property, there's a seller who wants to move on that transaction, we're going to be prepared due to David and his team's work to go after that. If there is a regional asset that fits our portfolio where we don't have exposure, we'll be able to go after that as well. But as it pertains to the operating business, Barry, we continue to ask the questions, where are you seeing weakness and get most of the answers where we're seeing strength. And so it's -- we're going to continue to monitor. And I know we've been talking on this call a lot about nongaming and experiential and self, and Kellan Florio, who joined us as our Chief Investment Officer a year ago are out looking at these different sectors. But it is important to reiterate that we continue to love the casino business. We continue to be amazed each quarter with the results that are delivered by our partners and the -- hopefully, some future partners as well.
Edward Pitoniak : Barry, I'll just add on to that. Yes, Barry, I was just going to add to that. Clearly, you're seeing across so many consumer sectors the strength of luxury. Based where we are in Midtown Manhattan, our neighborhood effectively feels like it's being taken over by LVMH. And that's simply because there is so much spending happening globally in these luxury categories, and it's one of the reasons our partners like Cabot and Canyon Ranch are doing so well right now being luxury brands within their respective categories of destination golf and wellness.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Kammert from Evercore ISI.
James Kammert: When you think about looking into these other experiential real estate sectors, is it fair to say that there might be fewer providers of capital in debt equity side such as VICI compared to other mainstream real estate. I'm just curious if that gives you a little bit of an advantage in terms of risk adjustment and how you structure the lease, et cetera, for the benefit of VICI.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, first of all, Jim, welcome to Evercore. Good to be talking to you. Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment. But yes, you're absolutely right. What we're really undertaking is to prove out our hypothesis that there's a significant landscape of what we'll call experiential white space across the globe of really dynamic experiential operating businesses that have never been visited by a REIT before and have never considered before a REIT as a source of growth capital. And with that, I'll turn it over to John because he's having so many of these conversations in which he has told pretty much at the outset, wow, we've never talked to a REIT before. John?
John Payne : Yes. You nailed it, Jim. That's exactly right. In many of these areas, whether it's in health and wellness, youth, collegiate, professional sports, certain forms of family entertainment, we're the first ones that have come to them with a thoughtful approach about how our capital could help them grow in many different ways. And so we literally spend two, three, four different meetings a day explaining who we are, what we've done, how we can help them. And again, to our opening remarks, it doesn't mean a transaction has to happen at the first meal we have together. It's about building a depth of incredible operators and real estate that over a period of time, we can hopefully transact and build a partnership. But you've hit on it where there just haven't been a lot of others that have taken on this task because it's not easy work and it takes a lot of time and effort and calls and e-mails and all of that. But we're happy to do it because we see the incredible amount of white space, as Ed noted.
James Kammert: Interesting. And where were they getting their capital before? Or do you just think this is as they visit their growth and future plans, they're just thinking more constructively about how they can monetize real estate? I'm just curious how that plays in.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, maybe I can offer Canyon Ranch as an example, Jim, whereby when we began talking with John Goff and the Canyon Ranch team back in early 2022, the conversations they principally been having when it came to growth capital or with private equity partners. And what they were concerned about with those private equity partners was, number one, the cost of the capital, given the cost that PE funding partners tend to assign to their own capital; and number two, the investment horizon of perhaps only 5 to 7 years. And so when Canyon Ranch looked at our offering and looked at our -- both our cost of capital and the fact that we want to be their capital partner forever, it was a pretty compelling alternative to conventional private equity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.
Wesley Golladay : I just got a quick question about the VICI Property Fund. Do you expect more of those projects to kick off in a recessionary environment, being that Vegas is so strong? And more in particular, the focus I have on the question would be The Mirage project that was recently approved with the guitar on the Strip?
Edward Pitoniak : John?
John Payne : Yes. Good to talk to you, Wes. The Mirage project that the Hard Rock team is taking on is spectacular. I think we've seen the footage of it, not only the guitar tower, but the refurbishment of the whole properties. And you'd have to talk directly with the hard rock team, but I think you hear from them, they're thinking through different ways that they can finance the project with organize sits on our land and to our building, and we'd love to be a source of financing for that project longer term as they think through the details of it. And the fund in general, we've talked to many operators whether throughout our 11 tenants is how we can help them grow with larger projects on our existing assets or how we can help monetize certain assets and help them buy someone else. So we continue to have those conversations as well.
Wesley Golladay : Okay. If I could just get a follow-up. I guess the age is going to move a little bit down the street from you land parcel, at least that's what the reports are. Do you have any, I guess, updated plans for potential monetization of land parcel on the strip?
Edward Pitoniak : John?
John Payne : Well, it's exciting where the As are thinking about putting the stadium. I know that’s two exciting -- there's almost two exciting, the most exciting companies, I guess, when they heard to announce, was MGM and VICI and let it sit right across from many of the resorts that we own and MGM operates. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. But it sure is helping Las Vegas become the sports capital of the world now by adding another team. And Super Bowl's coming next year. F1 is coming later in the year. So we couldn't be more excited. And you're asking to make our land and our resorts more valuable, we think it certainly does and will provide opportunities were the current properties that sit next to the new stadium that's going to be built as well as the undeveloped that we have throughout the city.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE.
John DeCree : Good morning, everyone. Maybe just one for me. We've covered quite a bit of ground. David, probably for you. I think I read a footnote in the presentation that the Caesars Forum loan was repaid in May. I was wondering if you could confirm that? And does that impact the footfall on that property at all? And then I guess, part 3 is, can you let us know how much in commitments that you have unfunded outstanding for various loans?
David Kieske : Yes, John, good to talk to you. Caesars repaid that loan actually yesterday, $400 million principal. It doesn't change the footfall. We actually extended the outside date to 2028 when we could call the Caesars Forum Convention Center. This is all part of Caesars deleveraging. So that continues to make our tenants stronger, and we're happy to get that capital back. And then the total commitments, I don't have that right in front of me, but I'm happy to follow up with you or Gabe, if you have that handy. Otherwise, John, we can follow up with you.
John Payne : Yes, future funding commitments are about $970 million as of March 31.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste : First one is, I guess I like to know what the current house view on further investing in tribal today is and how you get comfortable if you can't own the land? And perhaps how much more meaningful could you get involved there?
Edward Pitoniak : John?
John Payne : Yes, I'll take that question. It's important to understand that today, our relationships with the three tribal nations are on commercial gaming properties, whether that's in Cincinnati, in Tunica and in Southern Indiana. I think your question is around is there ultimately going to be an opportunity with these partners or with another partner on their tribal land for us to make investments. And it's something we've talked to partners about before, and it potentially could be. But at this time, we've not made any of those investments. We really have enjoyed and will continue to build our relationships with tribal nations because they're amazing casino operators, and they're looking to deploy the capital that they've earned in their tribal nation casinos on to commercial gaming, and we're here to help them think through that if they're interested.
Haendel St. Juste : That's helpful. And yes, I should have made that distinction there. And one more. You read that MGM recently was approved to build Japan's first casino in Osaka. I guess, given the relationship there, what's the likelihood of your interest in getting involved? And what sort of risk premium perhaps would you require?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. We'll handle the -- it is a very big project. There's a lot of parties involved. They are obviously financing this in a credit market. Japan is quite low cost. Now we're always here to help them. If we can be of help, we will be. But I'd say we're a long way off at this point from knowing if we can help them. And if so, how we would help them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem : Two quick ones. Just one on the guidance. Can you just remind us what's the organic growth implied to get to that FFO growth number? And then on the balance sheet, I see the 5.9% debt to EBITDA. Where is that going to trend to by the end of the year or assuming no more deals?
David Kieske : Hey, Ron. It's Dave. Ron, it's David. Good to talk to you. In terms of guidance, we just have our base escalation. So 2% for Caesars, 1.5% for some of the other tenants. We do not make any assumptions around CPI bumps or other potential economic changes, if that's what you're asking. And then in terms of the balance sheet, we're actually 5.7% today since the cash that came in from Caesars yesterday. So we're 5.9% at quarter end. That was just due to a little bit of a lower cash balance at quarter end. And then that's trending to kind of about 5.6x, 5.5x by year-end based on where we see the business trending.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then just the last one, just a lot more questions on theme parks and as I sort of talked about being open to all experiential. Is there a way to sort of dig in deeper and just sort of highlight what is attractive, what is not attractive, what markets, geographies, deal structure, anything would be helpful.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. So I think when it comes to theme parks generically, Ron, what's appealing about them is what's, frankly, appealing about our large Las Vegas assets and frankly, a lot of our large regional assets as well, which is their big complex physical plants with big complex P&Ls that have high economic productivity in relation to the capital value of the asset. And we believe that theme parks tick the four boxes that we look at in any investment category we're looking at, which is lower than average cyclicality for consumer discretionary at large. Theme parks are very often an affordable luxury in times of recession. Not unlike ski resorts, which I used to work in. There is generally an absence of secular threat since people are not generally building rollercoasters in their backyards or having Amazon deliver them to them. There's a healthy supply-demand balance. People are generally not building a theme park. And then finally, number four, they've obviously proven their durability over, frankly, more than a century, going back to the big exhibitions and fairs of the late 1800. So a lot to recommend the category. John and Kellan and the team continue to work on getting to know the players, their needs or their capital needs and opportunities. And we'll hopefully some day be able to invest in that category.
Operator: Our final question comes from Chris Darling from Green Street.
Chris Darling: I recognize that VICI is focused really on growing accretively. But I'd like to better understand how you evaluate the long-term profile of some of your existing assets. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that aspect? And then when you look across your regional gaming portfolio, are there any markets or assets that maybe you're less comfortable owning for the long term?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes, Chris. So I'll have John answer the back half of that question because we have, since our beginning, even though our beginning is only 5.5 years ago, we have actually engaged in portfolio optimization in terms of disposals. But it's a really good question to ask because we've contended for a while now that we are the first REIT to bring the net lease structure to what is genuinely Class A real estate in terms of scale, quality of fit and efficient fit and finish and economic magnitude and durability. And so you look at, for instance, our first marquee asset, Las Vegas, just over 60 years old. And as John will tell you in a moment, it had its best year ever last year. We've got weighted average lease term of around 40 years. And when we look at our Las Vegas assets, when we look at great regional assets like the #1 regional asset in America, MGM National Harbor, we have very high confidence that these assets will be economically productive and grow in value, in part because of our same-store NOI growth, which Green Street has written about better than anybody. These assets will continue to appreciate and value for decades to come. But John, do you want to talk about the approach we take at making sure neither we nor our tenants or in assets we don't want to be in anymore?
John Payne : Yes, Chris, it's a very good question. And as Ed touched on, we constantly talk to our tenants, our operating partners about optimizing their portfolio. And as Ed alluded to, we -- since we started VICI five years ago, we've had a tenant come to us, [Reno] track in Louisiana that said, "Look, this doesn't fit our portfolio. You own it." And we've worked together to sell the asset. There's been other situations where the tenant want it out, but we wanted to keep the real estate and buildings, and we've transferred and found another high-quality tenant. So we'll continue to do that throughout our lives running this business. And if there's a tenant that doesn't want to be in the business, we should work with them either say, "Hey, let's sell this over a holdco or let's just find another tenant that wants to run the business." The other thing we do is continue to look in markets to diversify our portfolio. With cities, what states are we not currently in, in gaming as an example, where we'd love to own real estate and there's many markets throughout the United States we are not in. We have 50 properties today, but there is a lot of opportunity in markets we're not in. And then there's other markets where, boy, it would be nice to have another asset, and we continue to do that. So very good question. It's something that's top of mind that we have with our tenants, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio over the coming years.
Chris Darling: Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe a second question for me. Just curious if you've had any recent conversations with Caesars regarding the ground-up development, I believe, in Danville, Virginia. Just given that, that project, I think, has broken ground now.
John Payne : Yes, they just got approval. They'll be opening a temporary facility at that asset run by Caesars. It's also in a partnership with our other partners, the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, they're partners there as well. And so we do have conversations with Caesars about a variety of things. Could that ultimately -- would that ultimately be an asset we would be interested over time if the ownership wanted to monetize the real estate in the buildings? Yes, we would be very interested in that. And so we first look and get it up and running, get it stabilized, be incredibly successful, And there's a time that, that conversation, we look at.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for any final remarks.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, thanks for your time today, everybody. I'll go back to what I stressed on our last earnings call back at the end of February, and that is when you take the midpoint of our guidance for AFFO growth for 2023, which is 10%, combine that with our dividend yield, which is currently around 4.5, a little higher than that, you get 14.5 points of potential total return. And I would just compare that again to what you're seeing in REITs generally and even more generally, the S&P 500, which is certainly not shaping up to be a year combining 10% earnings growth and 4.5% dividend yield. So with that, we'll thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you again in late July. Bye for now.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 24, 2023.  I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher : Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our fourth quarter 2022 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties described on this call, please refer to the company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak : Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk to you this morning about our results in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. John will also give you color on our operating environment and business development activities. I'll start by talking about VICI's first 5 years. A couple of weeks ago, we reached the 5-year anniversary of VICI's IPO. I want to thank every single VICI team and Board member for the incredible work they've done over this 5-year period, enabling VICI, among other things, to become the first REIT to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in under 5 years. And I want to thank all of our operating partners in and outside of gaming for the amazing work they do in making our buildings, places a great experiential and economic value. In February of 2018, the time of VICI's IPO, I don't think any of you would have been very excited if I told you that the ensuing 5-year period from VICI IPO through year-end 2022 would be a period in which the S&P 500 Index would generate cumulative total return over that period of 48.5% or that their RMZ REIT index would generate cumulative total return of 27.9%. I want to emphasize those are not annual total return figures. Those are cumulative over the entire period. And that's exactly what the S&P 500 and the RMZ REIT indices produced in cumulative total return over that period. Over that same period since our IPO, VICI produced for its shareholders cumulative total return of 109.7%. I'll repeat that, 109.7%. This cumulative total return by VICI beat the S&P by more than 2x and beat the REIT index by nearly 4x. Over that 5-year period, no other REIT in the S&P 500 produced cumulative total return superior to VICI, zip, zero, none. Since 2018, VICI has produced an AFFO per share compound annual growth of 7.7% and a quarterly dividend per share CAGR of 7.9%. If we look at 2022 by itself, we see another year in which VICI produced significant outperformance. VICI was the only S&P 500 REIT that produced positive total return in 2022. And VICI's 2022 13% total return generated 31.1 points of outperformance versus the S&P 500 index overall and 37.5 points of outperformance versus the RMZ REIT index. Our stockholders have received the outperformance they've deserved over the last 5 years and in 2022, given the support they have been given VICI throughout our 5-year history of portfolio growth and balance sheet upgrading. What we're most excited about is the opportunity to continue to create value for our stockholders. In a moment, David Kieske will lay out for you our 2023 AFFO guidance. I don't want to steal all of David's thunder, but once David has shared that guidance with you, I encourage you to compare VICI's 2023 guidance to consensus 2023 S&P 500 earnings forecast which are generally trending between very low single digits and negative single digits. Compare VICI’s 2023 guidance to what you are hearing from other REITs, especially other S&P 500 REITs, which is generally 2023 AFFO growth guidance in the low single digits. And once you have made that earnings growth comparison, I encourage you to make a comparison between VICI’s multiple on 2023 AFFO and the 2023 AFFO multiples of other S&P 500 REITs. Once you've made those comparisons, I believe you'll find that VICI offers what we believe to be one of the more compelling 2023 price earnings growth or PEG plus yield ratios that you will find among all S&P 500 REITs. To help you along in that calculation, I'll give you this starting point. The AFFO growth represented by the midpoint of our guidance, plus our dividend yield as of yesterday, equals 14.5%. Compare that 14.5% figure to what other S&P 500 REITs are offering in 2023 AFFO growth, rates plus dividend yields, and I believe you will see VICI standing out. Finally, I'll give you one more comparison. With consensus estimates of S&P 500 2023 earnings per share growth running at 1% and the current S&P 500 dividend yield running around 1.6%, the combination of current estimated earnings growth and dividend yield would be 2.6% for the S&P 500. The combination of VICI's midpoint AFFO growth and our current dividend yield would be over 14%.  With that, I'll turn it over to John for his remarks. John?
John Payne : Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 5 years, our team has worked relentlessly to institutionalize our asset class and to deliver value for our shareholders by growing our portfolio accretively. During this time period, we've expanded our roster of tenants from just one at formation to 11 best-in-class operators who manage some of the most complex and profitable experiential assets across the globe.  Our hard work has also resulted in growing our portfolio from 19 properties at formation to 49 assets today with our portfolio encompassing, what we believe, are some of the most iconic properties across all commercial real estate classes, and our real estate now crosses into international territory. Now none of this would have been possible without the effort of our dedicated team who on many occasions end up working nights, weekends and unfortunately, holidays. For that, we, as an executive management team are very, very grateful. In some ways, 2022 was the hallmark of our achievements. Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, arguably one of the most iconic experiential assets in the world at a very attractive 6.25% cap rate. Those of you who have followed our story may remember that the Venetian was announced during the very unique time period. While decision to acquire that asset may appear simple today, the transaction came together in early 2021 when many believe the recovery of Las Vegas was uncertain. During our underwriting period, we allocated resources towards studying the market and performing in-depth due diligence. Throughout that process, we grew increasingly confident in our underwriting and ultimately confirmed our very bullish bet on the Las Vegas market. As we sit here today, we continue to see that the Las Vegas market is producing record results. Leisure business remains robust, meetings and conventions have returned and consumers continue to visit the city in record number. In essence, we believe consumers did not find a replacement for the experience offered by the Las Vegas market, nor do we believe they ever will. The Las Vegas economy continues to diversify catering to a broad array of consumer preferences, and the city continues to leverage vast infrastructure by hosting unique events and events of scale. We remain firm believers in the Las Vegas market and will continue to be vocal about our belief in the outlook for the city. Following our completion of the Venetian transaction, just a few months later, we completed the strategic acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, adding 15 exceptional assets to our portfolio and beginning a former relationship with MGM Resorts. These two transactions alone deliver growth that would satisfy many companies. However, as the year carried on, we supplemented those achievements with the pending acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino in Maryland and investment in our Property Growth Fund, the acquisition of Blackstone's interest in the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay joint venture, which we closed in January. We closed on the acquisition of two additional regional gaming assets with Foundation Gaming. And we invested in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas alongside the renowned Koch Industries. In addition to our achievements in gaming, we deepened our relationship with Great Wolf Resorts, during the year by financing certain growth projects and we announced partnerships with Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch, widening our university of growth opportunities for years to come. Last but surely not least, as the calendar turned to 2023, we announced our first international investment by closing on the acquisition of 4 casino properties in Alberta, Canada. We have talked about expanding our portfolio internationally on many of these earnings calls before and are thrilled to demonstrate once again that we do what we say. As we look ahead to 2023, we will be planting the seeds of growth for the next 5 years and beyond. First and foremost, we are going to continue establishing relationships that yield mutually beneficial outcomes. And as always, we intend to focus on opportunities that deliver accretive growth for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet, our financial results and our guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2022 demonstrated the continued discipline we have maintained over our 5-plus years of existence by ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This focus provided VICI with continued access to the capital markets throughout 2022 to support our growth and just to recap a few highlights from the year. In April, we achieved our goal of an investment-grade credit rating as both S&P and Fitch rated VICI BBB- allowing us to raise $5 billion of investment-grade debt across a series of three, five, seven, 10 and 30-year tenures to fund the acquisition of MGP. VICI's ability to access the 30-year tenure was a first for a first-time investment-grade REIT issuer, and we are thankful for the support we received from our credit partners in this transaction. In June, we were added to the S&P 500 Index, marking the fastest time line a REIT has been added to the index from IPO to inclusion, deepening our access to equity capital. In November, we raised $575.6 million of net equity proceeds through a 19 million share forward sale agreement. We utilized the ATM throughout the year, raising equity very efficiently for a total of $696.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of 21.6 million shares via forward sale agreements. Those amounts include $208.3 million through the sale of 6.3 million shares via forward sale agreements that occurred in Q4. Then subsequent to year-end, in January, we raised $965 million of net equity proceeds through a 30.3 million share forward sale agreement, which remains unsettled today and available to fund future transactions. Currently, we have approximately $3.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of $426 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We have the $965 million of net proceeds from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. As a reminder, in January, we drew down CAD 140 million or approximately USD 103 million under our revolver in connection with our PURE Canadian gaming acquisition. We will look to term out this revolver draw in the future.  In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues increased 100.9% year-over-year to $769.9 million in Q4 as a result of the transformative 2022 acquisition activity John mentioned. AFFO for the fourth quarter was approximately $488 million or $0.51 per share. Total AFFO in Q4 increased approximately 75% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 15.5% over the prior year. Just as a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and the AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raise and shares issued to consummate our acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO at year ending December 31, 2023 is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 per share and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance reflects the full year of 2022 closed acquisitions as well as the acquisitions we completed in January, the PURE Canadian Gaming acquisition and the acquisition of Blackstone's 49.9% stake in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 30.3 million forward shares sold in January of this year. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed with you in the past, we recorded a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone : First question is for David, I guess. In the past, you guys have been really good at matching your investments with the debt and equity needed to complete them. As you kind of think about '23 and looking forward, just what's the appetite to either reduce leverage or look out further on the horizon and address future maturities just to give yourself room as you think about what you may buy next.
David Kieske : Yes. Great to talk to, Tony. Just to level set, our first maturity or next maturity comes due in May 1, 2024, for the $1.50 billion of 5.625 notes that come due. So we have no maturities due in 2023. And I think we'll continue to focus on bringing the leverage back down to 5x and 5.5x. And just to remind everybody, when we consummated the MGP acquisition we worked with the agencies and help them understand the merits of the deal, and they were thrilled with the transaction, given the diversity and allowing us to take leverage up just north of our 5 and 5.5 guidepost.  And so as you saw us do at the end of last year and with the significant free cash flow we have in the business, we'll over-equitize some of the smaller acquisitions, use free cash flow to fund some of the smaller acquisitions and the loan fundings that we have. And then as we navigate potentially larger transactions, we look to match fund that as efficiently as possible. But again, with the goal of bringing leverage over time back down to 5x to 5.5x.
Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just a follow-up. As you speak with tenants and think about things like Property Growth Fund and more capital being invested in the assets, any change in the dialogue, either tapping the brakes because of the economic uncertainty or capital markets? Or just generally, what are those conversations like today? And have they changed?
Edward Pitoniak : John?
John Payne : Hey, Tony, good to talk to you this morning. We're fortunate to have tenants right now that are doing extremely well. I think those on the phone who follow the gaming industry are watching the results coming out of Las Vegas, in particular, or if they're not all-time records, they're close to all-time records. So we continue to be thoughtful in our conversations with our tenants, and they continue to look longer term about how they grow their business, and we're there to have those conversations and hopefully be part of their growth plans with, as you mentioned, our Property Growth Fund.
Operator: We now turn to Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa : Maybe sort of following up on the line of question as Tony had. I'm just curious, Ed, and John, like how are you thinking about the world today maybe versus six to nine months ago? And just how are you thinking about underwriting changes and potential issues down the road. Has that sort of colored your view on kind of yield expectations or how you think about coverage ratios or business lines that you may want to go into?
Edward Pitoniak : It definitely has, Steve, and good to talk to you. The lack of visibility right now almost equals opacity. And you just need a week like this one in the markets to be reminded, in case you need a reminder as to how uncertain things are. So as John spoke of, we really have so much confidence right now in our operators, and we believe our gaming operators are going to continue to do very well for a host of reasons, particularly having to do with the demand drivers that Vegas enjoys for at least the next couple of years. But when it comes to the access to and cost of capital, we have to be as silver as everyone else has to be about the fact that obviously, credit conditions have tightened, we have definitely benefited from a cost advantage on cost of equity given how well we performed. But we certainly need to be careful about underwriting yields that probably do need to be higher than they've been over the last couple of years. And we also have to be very mindful if we're in consumer discretionary, which we are as to what a tenant's performance might be under different operating scenarios, should we see soft lending, hard landing, prolonged soft, prolonged hard landing. We also have -- need to be mindful of inflation. But we obviously do enjoy versus many of our REIT peers, certainly net lease REIT peers, the advantage of some CPI protections that definitely benefit our investors this year in 2023.
Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then maybe circling back on the international deal in Canada. I'm just curious as you kind of look at the landscape and you sort of just look at the opportunities out there. I guess, are you seeing more opportunities internationally today? Or do you see more -- I assume the U.S. market is a bigger market, but if you kind of size it, do you see better opportunities outside the U.S. today or inside?
Edward Pitoniak : I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Steve. But the way we think about growth is we think about growing both categorically and geographically, -- and so as you watch us, as you actually see what we did last year and as you look at us going forward, we will always be looking for great opportunities to grow into new categories as we did last year with Cabot and Canyon Ranch. And we look to grow in new geographies as we do with Canada. But I'll turn it over to John for his thoughts on how to how to think about the way we look at the U.S. versus international. John?
John Payne : Yes, Steve, good to talk to you this morning. I'd say a little bit is we've gotten more mature as a company, and we talked to you all before about adding resources to our organizations, which then allows us to go out around the world and look at opportunities. I wouldn't say there's better opportunities internationally than domestically. I'd simply say we're able to learn more about different countries and the opportunities that are out there right now. As Ed started out this answering this question, we're being very thoughtful in anything we do right now in our underwriting. But again, we've got resources now that allow us to go and look all over the world for opportunities, not only in gaming, but in certain experiential sectors that we really like.
Steve Sakwa : Okay. Just a quick follow-up, and then I'll yield the floor. Just is there a yield differential when you sort of think about international and currency risk against the U.S.
David Kieske : Yes, Steve, that end of your question has the key, right? What's the currency risk and what's the tax leakage and then underwriting a yield that makes sense to take that into account. And we did that with the PURE Canadian transaction. And as John mentioned, we're learning about other parts of the globe and where our capital can make sense. I mean it's and then where we can efficiently structure transactions that work for both sides.
Operator: We'll now turn to Smedes Rose from Citi.
Smedes Rose : There was an activist proposal earlier around Six Flags that brought you guys in the mix. And I know you're probably not going to comment on that deal specifically at that proposal. But I'm just interested would you be interested in sort of theoretically big picture in that kind of owning theme park land or real estate? And how would you think about underwriting that versus maybe some of the other asset classes you're in?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. So you're right, Smedes, we won't comment on any specific situations. But we have talked in the past on our earnings call and in our investor engagements about our interest in the theme park space. We think it has an awful lot of attributes to remind us in very good ways of our gaming investments. These are very complex assets. They're very large-scale assets. They're very capital-intensive assets. They have proven themselves over decades. What we also find interesting about the theme park landscape in the U.S. is it is really an un-networked landscape. You have hubs, obviously, in the form of Anaheim and Orlando, and you have spokes in terms of the regional theme park operators, but they're not connected and that kind of puzzles us and can't help thinking, well, geez, what would the power be if you could ever connect these things? And we'll see if anything ever comes to that. But yes, it is a category and experiential category that we believe has real investment merits for us, both strategically and economically.
Smedes Rose : And then I was just wondering, John, I mean, it sounds like obviously, Vegas is all go, go go, but I mean are you hearing maybe just a little more specifics around sort of regular sort of leisure visitation versus return of corporate groups or any kind of thing you're hearing on your tenants kind of on the different drivers of business?
John Payne : Smedes, nice to talk to you this morning. I just spent time with all our Las Vegas operators over the past couple of weeks. And as you started out by saying the business continues to be very strong, robust. And the beauty of Las Vegas is that they're seeing growth and demand from all those different segments. That's what makes Las Vegas so special that they get the international gamer. They get the domestic gamer. They have the meeting business that's coming back. They have [FIT] business. And the operators there continue to add resources and add assets to their facilities. We just can't say enough about our tenants that are there and the performance that they're having, and they see -- they do not see a slowdown in their business. And then later this year, they're probably at one of the biggest weeks and weekends that they've ever had with Formula One coming and then they're going to turn the year in '24 and go right into the Super Bowl. So it's a city like no other, we talk internally is there a city performing better than Las Vegas in the world, and we're not sure we can find one. And all the credit goes to our tenants and the way they are marketing that city and their properties
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: I wanted to keep on the Vegas theme and maybe start with Fontainebleau. Can you talk about sort of your expectations for what this relationship could develop into down the road? Have they given any intentions around sale leaseback at some point? And then how should we be modeling timing of the full loan?
David Kieske : Yes. Barry, I can start, and John chime in with anything I missed. But look, we went in -- we've looked at this asset over a period of a number of years, and I think it's a phenomenal asset and even better backed by the equity support of the Koch Industries. And then the Soffer organization, we’ll have the vision and get it open towards the end of this year. So there's nothing formal in terms of our relationship in terms of a path to real estate ownership. But when you act as good partners, and you'll help support other partners' objectives. That leads to more opportunities and just the size and scale of industries and everything that they have and the size of their real estate book, especially focused in leisure and hospitality, we think there could be more things to come in the future, and we're excited to partner with them and be involved with that project.
Barry Jonas : Okay. Great. And then just -- maybe just spending a minute on Hard Rock and Mirage. What are the next steps there for potential redevelopment and also the Partner Property Growth Fund loan -- potential loan there? Is there a general time line for specifics to be worked out here?
Edward Pitoniak : John?
John Payne : Barry, it's John. Yes. Very good to talk to you this morning. really more a question for our tenant on that. But Jim Allen and the Hard Rock team just took the business over earlier this year. They're getting used to the property, understand their property, understanding demand, understanding how busy Las Vegas is right now, which is great. And the last communication is they're studying their plan, working through this year, and we'll be in contact with them over the next coming months, and we'll have a better idea of what the ultimate timing and what their ultimate plans will be. So nothing new than last time we talked about this.
Operator: We now turn to Wesley Golladay from Baird.
Wesley Golladay : I just have a quick follow-up to the last question. I wonder you set the rates for these projects such as the Mirage or the Hard Rock?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes, Wes, thanks for the question. David is best equipped to answer this. And I don't think David heard it quite clearly.
David Kieske : Wes, I think I caught it, you say when we set the rates for these Partner Property Growth Funds. Is that -- did I get that right?
Wesley Golladay: Yes. I mean we currently model say, around 8% or so, but I don't know if those are set at the time you mentioned the deal, at the time of the closing of the transaction, and there's always a future opportunity. But I don't know these rates are already locked in and when they can plan the project around a certain yield. Or do you get the scope of the project and then you set the terms?
David Kieske : Yes. The rates are not locked in, Wes, so it's part of the negotiation. When we obviously announced Hard Rock's acquisition of the Mirage, we said we'd be happy to commit up to $1.5 billion of our Partner Property Growth Fund or even more if they needed it, but that would all be subject to negotiation in terms of final terms, rate, structure, timing.
Edward Pitoniak : And related to that, Wes.
Wesley Golladay : For the consolidation of the joint venture…
Edward Pitoniak : Go ahead. Go ahead, Wes.
Wesley Golladay : No, no. Go ahead, go ahead.
Edward Pitoniak : I was just going to say, needless to say, the pricing of capital right now is an exercise that is not easy to carry out. Obviously, having a forward view of the cost of capital in the future and then pricing our capital to a borrower or a partner. It's not an easy exercise. And go ahead, Wes.
Wesley Golladay : My last follow-up would be the, for the consolidation of the joint venture for the Blackstone deal that you did earlier in the year, how are you going to handle the debt for that? Would it be a mark-to-market for just the JV portion or the whole portion and any sense of the magnitude?
Edward Pitoniak : Gabe?
Gabriel Wasserman : Yes. It's Gabe here. So I think we have some flexibility where we can either inherit our partner's existing basis on the debt or we can roll over that basis or we can choose to market to market. So still having that debate internally, and we'll start focusing on that in the month ahead.
Operator: We'll turn to John DeCree from CBRE Securities.
John DeCree : Maybe one big picture question, Ed, to push you on the spot a little bit. You gave a nice recap of VICI's first 5 years quite successfully in your prepared remarks. Wondering if you'd kind of venture a prediction or a plan kind of for the next 5 years?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. David just covered the ears of Samantha Gallagher, RGC. Yes, John. Well, we -- okay, so to be really forthright, if 5 years ago, if you had said, okay, I want your prediction for the next 5 years ahead, I would not have predicted what we had done. We always had a conviction that we had a wonderful opportunity to institutionalize the real estate asset class that had not really yet been institutionalized. And we think so much of the story of this first 5 years, so much of our outperformance, 2x the S&P 500, 2x the NASDAQ. I probably should have mentioned that as well as hot as the NASDAQ was during much of that period, crazily hot at times. The NASDAQ performance over that 5 years was dead on the S&P 500 performance, and we beat them both by 2x, right? So as we look ahead, we certainly cannot base our strategy on continuing that kind of outperformance because to base our strategy on that kind of outperformance might involve -- would likely involve taking risk, so we're not sure we should take in terms of creating and sustaining value for our investors. So what you'll see us do over the next 5 years is continue to grow categorically, continue to grow geographically, do accretive deals be willing to over-equitize in the way David spoke of at the beginning and answering Tony's question and just make sure that we never put the value we've created together with our investors at risk. One of the great benefits. Or I shouldn't say one of the great benefits. One of the great drivers of our outperformance over the first 5 years is we never went backward for sustained periods. We obviously had volatility as everybody else did over that 5 years. We never went backward and stayed there for a long time. And we don't want to start doing that in the next 5 years. So I think you'll see us be disciplined in how we allocate capital. And in order to do that, we'll be disciplined in how we underwrite. And always look to learn from REITs who have succeeded in doing what we want to attempt to do. So whether it's a Prologis in terms of how they've grown internationally, whether it's great ideas and how you grow categorically. Like full marks to Sumit and the Realty Income team for the deal they announced this week on Plenty. Like that kind of deal making on the part of our peers really inspires us because it is evidence of how to think creatively and innovatively in developing into new categories. So I think that's what you can expect of us over the next 5 years, John.
John DeCree : Makes sense. It's great insight on a curve ball there. Maybe a softer one as a follow-up. Last couple acquisitions you've made and maybe for John or kind of from maybe lesser known tenants, a little bit smaller companies. How do you think about kind of underwriting standards different from your large public tenants relative to smaller private companies? And then is that a trend you've kind of seen emerging more this year, a little bit more activity with smaller, maybe private companies? Or would you expect to see similar kind of deal flow from the larger public cos, realizing they probably have a bit more to do. But curious how you're thinking about those kind of two different types of tenants?
John Payne : Yes, John, a very good question. But it's not new to VICI, right? I mean part of what we're proud of is that we've taken the time to go talk to all the operators inside the gaming industry and hopefully, over the next 5 years and most of the experiential companies whether you're big, whether you're small, whether you're private, whether you're public, we take the time to understand how they're trying to grow their company. And is there a possibility for us in our form of capital to help them grow. And so that won't change as Ed just went through the next 5 years and what won't change. I think that's this curiosity that we have as a business development team to get to know it may be a small company, and it may be a small deal, but we're hoping that over the course of our time together with them, we take a small deal and we make it bigger, we help a small company become larger. And you're going to continue to see that. You've seen it since we started the company, and I think you'll continue to see us do deals with smaller private companies. And I believe you'll see us continue to do deals with large public companies, and that will allow us to continue to grow our business as we expect.
Operator: We'll now turn to Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just maybe a couple of quick ones from me. The first is just on the AFFO growth, almost 10%, which is pretty impressive compared to some of the other triple-net peers in the sort of flat to 3% range. I was just wondering if we could sort of get a breakout of organic versus external growth of that number. So how much of that is being driven by sort of the inflation escalators versus some of the acquisitions that were done in '22?
David Kieske : Ron, it's David. Nice to talk here. It's all driven by -- well, said differently the way, we modeled the escalator in November with Caesars is 2%. We do not make any predictions about the future. My counsel next to me would be very upset. And then -- so the acquisitions, as I mentioned in my remarks, are all baked in, including the PURE deal, which closed in early January as well as the reconsolidation in early January as well. And then it does not include Rocky Gap, which is still outstanding.
Edward Pitoniak : But -- and Ron, if I understand your question right, there is no question that the rent escalation that kicked in, in November for Caesars, and I believe it's January for Century definitely plays a role in generating that 10% AFFO growth. But to David's point, we obviously have -- toward the end of this year, we've only underwritten base level rent growth. We do not presume any kind of -- we do not make any CPI assumptions for forward rent, if that's of any help. And we don't include any unclosed acquisitions, just to be clear or on loans that do not have fixed draw schedules yet.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. That's helpful and clear. I can move on to sort of the pipeline. I think in past call, we've talked about sort of sizing the market, which we've sort of all have done. But I'm curious if you guys have any sort of quantifiable numbers on pipeline, the amount of deals that you're in talk with, if it's $10 billion, if it's $50 billion, whatever, I think that would be sort of a helpful information? 
Edward Pitoniak : John, you want to start?
John Payne : Yes, I don't have a specific number on that right now. I would tell you as I talked earlier in this call about adding resources to our organization, to our business development team. So what I would tell you is that we're active or more active in deal flow than we ever have done before. It's obviously an uncertain time. We have to be incredibly thoughtful in any type of deal that we do in the underwriting that we do. But we've been able to expand not only in gaming, and you heard me talk about public companies and private companies. But in many of the sectors that we've talked in previous calls about. So we're touching more companies, we're meeting more companies than we ever have done before. We're explaining how our capital ultimately can help those companies grow. But I don't have the exact size for you. I don't know if Danny is on the call and wanted to add anything to my answer.
Daniel Valoy: John, I think you covered it well. I mean we've talked about some of the opportunities that we look at within gaming and that ranging from anywhere from $40 billion to $50 billion of potential transactions. That's not an all-encompassing blue sky numbers. Those are opportunities that we think are actionable at some point in time. But as we've talked about a lot here, the universe of opportunities is growing, especially as we look internationally, as we continue to study and explore other experiential sectors. So it's difficult to give you a single number right now, Ron.
Edward Pitoniak : I would just add a little bit more to that, Ron. The last time we saw that the American commercial, I want to emphasize, commercial gaming sector was about 40% REITed that would contrast, say, with the mall space, which I believe is 70% plus REITed. The other thing to keep in mind is that we do have an American tribal gaming sector that is equal in size to American regional gaming. And we are now three or four tribal relationships, John and Danny. And that is a sector where those -- that sector is led by operators. We're very eager to do more business with in all the ways we can possibly think of. The thing I'll finally add is that there are obviously new jurisdictions opening up to gaming. And we just saw a headline this morning about Governor Abbott of Texas saying, if we're going to get gaming in Texas, I want it to be -- how did he put it, John? Great Wolf Lodge type of gaming. I can't remember exactly how -- yes. And we read that headline, we go that’s great because we're already in business with Great Wolf, and we definitely are in business in gaming. So you look at a market like Texas and needless to say, we get quite excited given the capital allocation opportunities, a market like that could represent
Operator: We'll now turn to David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz : You've covered an awful lot of detail and we don't need to sort of double back over those. But what I wanted to just throw out there is a question that's come up with investors in my travels, which is the next couple of years, we spend time thinking about potential capital raising and more so equity than debt for obvious reasons on our side. Can you just talk through what you have in front of you? And obviously, the Caesars pipeline as well? And what the prospects for you could be or having to go out and raise some more equity and under what circumstances you might do that?
Edward Pitoniak : Well, as a starting point, David, and I'll turn this over to John in just a moment. As a starting point as a REIT, you can be confident we will perpetually raising equity. But we will be perpetually raising equity for years to come as all good growing REITs do to fund accretive growth that benefits all shareholders. And that's been our track record to date. It's evidenced by the kind of AFFO growth per share we're producing in 2023 and have on a compounded basis since our beginning in 2018. But again, so we will raise equity when the opportunities are there to do so. And we will raise equity to fund accretive acquisitions. In terms of the pipeline, I'll turn it over to John because we obviously have opportunities like the Indiana assets in our future. John?
John Payne : Yes, David, good to talk to you this morning. And as Ed alluded to, in our view is the opportunity with Caesars to our put/call opportunity with two Indianapolis assets that are performing incredibly well. That put/call is kind of live right now, and we'll see how that ultimately plays out. But that is a really nice opportunity that we hope we can bring into our portfolio in the coming years. And then obviously, I've spent a lot of time on this call already talking about the numerous relationships that we're building in gaming and in non-gaming. And I hope part of our growth will be with our existing tenants, whether that's an opportunity as they grow into new jurisdictions like New York or as Ed mentioned, maybe Texas will break at some point. And I hope it's also growth with new tenants as well.
Edward Pitoniak : Hey, David, if I could just add one more thought...
David Katz : Please.
Edward Pitoniak : Yes. David, if I could add one more thought in relation to this, and it's something we haven't talked about on this call. But when it comes to being a growth-oriented REIT and when it comes to being a REIT, that will likely continue to access the capital markets, there is really no question in our minds and don't think there should be any question in anybody's mind as to the advantages of scale when it comes to access to the capital markets. And I think what you could see over the next few years is an increasing bifurcation or a barbell effect emerging across the American REIT landscape, where great advantages accrue to the biggest REIT with the most compelling value-creation stories because their access to capital in large volumes will be highly superior. You'll always have the small REITs that can produce significant growth in their early years. But the problem is you can reach a no-man's land of what we'll call mid-cap REITs, where it's really -- it's tough to access capital and high volumes and it gets a little bit tougher to produce material growth year-over-year-over-year. And we think at the scale we're at now, as I believe, the ninth largest REIT in the RMZ, it definitely brings advantages when it comes to access to and cost of capital. And sorry, I'll turn it back to you for your next question, David.
David Katz : Appreciate that. With respect to the Native American part, I know we've talked about this before, but building those relationships in a way where you can own hard assets? Or is it more building relationships by providing loans on reservation land that will enable you to sort of own real estate in other areas? Or are you trying to solve the code for reservation land?
Edward Pitoniak : We definitely worked on that, and we think there could be solutions down the road. In the near term, and I'll turn it over to John, our greatest excitement is helping them grow either off of tribal land or adjacent to tribal land. John?
John Payne : Right. That's exactly right, David. I mean, we continue just as we're building relationship with commercial operators we're getting out and meeting with many native American nations just to let them understand who we are, how we could help them grow in the commercial opportunities when if that's what their mission is to. So I'm spending a lot of time on the road doing that and letting them understand VICI and we already have partners with three native-American nations
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc.
Todd Thomas: I just wanted to go back to your interest in nongaming and following up on your comments about sensitizing underlying businesses and operators in various economic scenarios. Has your appetite changed around nongaming assets today just given the more uncertain macro and maybe sort of consumer backdrop? Or does it just require additional coverage and return?
Edward Pitoniak : I would say, Todd, that our interest in nongaming hasn't diminished at all even amidst this lack of visibility around the consumer economy because of our strong conviction around the secular tailwinds of experiential businesses. We have seen with COVID, finally, starting to leave the landscape that what had been in place for the prior 10 years or so, 15 years prior to COVID, which was the increasing consumer preference for experiences over things, has definitely reasserted itself. And we don't think that, that's going to diminish. We think the aging of the baby boom into their prime leisure years, we think millennial family formation. Those are demographic waves, together with this increasing preference for experiences over things, is going to give experiential operators across a number of spectra really compelling growth opportunities and very strong economic performance, almost no matter what cyclicality looks like.
Todd Thomas : Okay. And have you -- how have you increased your required returns as you think about underwriting investments going forward? I mean can you sort of quantify what you're seeing, what you're underwriting and also whether sellers are adjusting their expectations today?
David Kieske : Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. I mean as a net lease REIT, obviously, we're a spread investor, and we have to ensure that we receive an appropriate spread for the risk of the investment and to factor the location and the asset, the tenant, the business and taking that all into account in our underwriting. And the last part of your question there is spot on, right? And you've heard this from other net lease REITs, right? There's still a bid-ask spread for a lot of folks in terms of what they think the asset is worth and what we can actually acquire that with an appropriate rent coverage and generate an attractive return -- attractive risk-adjusted returns. So I would tell you we're being more diligent in terms of underwriting the business, the proof of concept, the longevity of concept, everything that we've talked about since day one of this company. Is there an enduring experience the consumers are going to go to over time. And so we're spending more time and going deeper on some certain sectors where we think there's some opportunities and larger growth opportunities going forward in those sectors.
Todd Thomas : Okay. Do you -- when you look out over -- during the course of the year ahead here, do you expect the spread at which you're investing relative to your cost of capital? Do you expect that to be wider than it was in '22?
David Kieske : So we expect that to be wide. I mean we always want to generate 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread to our cost of capital. It's kind of what we set as a preliminary benchmark, now that can be higher at times or it can be lower at times depending on the quality of the asset, the operator or a riskier asset and riskier operator or locations in the country.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Kornreich from SMBC.
Jay Kornreich : I guess I just want to start with a follow-up on the Fontainebleau Las Vegas that will be a great asset. And I guess providing construction loans is a riskier and higher return investment option that you had typically endeavor in. So just I'm curious if you saw this as more of a one-off opportunity? Or if you see providing casino and hotel construction loans as more of a path towards growth in the future?
David Kieske : Yes, Jay, it's David. I mean with our capital, we always want to find what makes sense at the right point in time with ideally a path to real estate ownership. And as I mentioned earlier, we do not have a direct path to real estate ownership with the Fontainebleau, but we developed a phenomenal relationship with Koch and Soffer that could lead to other opportunities. But as we've talked about with our Partner Property Growth Funds with other -- we talked with other gaming operators and non-gaming operators above ground-up development. We are doing that with Canyon Ranch. We're doing that with -- in a forum with Cabot in the golf opportunities. So the nice thing about our capital, it is flexible. It can come into different parts of the capital stack, so to speak. But again, ideally, we have a path to real estate ownership over the long term where we can continue to generate the types of returns and growth that we've done in our first 5 years.
Jay Kornreich : All right. And then I guess just on the non-gaming side with some of those partners that you just mentioned, that are quickly growing and they're looking for capital kind of fund that expansion. Do you have a sense of just how large that potential pipeline is in the U.S. for these types of quickly expanding non-gaming the platforms that you feel comfortable investing in?
Edward Pitoniak : Yes, it category by category, Jay -- and Elliot, this is just a heads up. This will have to be the last question. These categories, there are so many of them and so many of them run into the many, many tens of millions of dollars of growth opportunities, some larger, some smaller. But it is a landscape -- an experiential landscape that we feel represents decades of growth ahead for VICI.
Edward Pitoniak : And Jay, thank you for that question, Elliot. I think we will close things out now. And I'll just -- for those of you who haven't heard enough about VICI today, as just flash across the screen on CNBC, I will on Mad Money in the night, in case you haven't heard enough. And with that, thank you all for your time today and really appreciate your attention to VICI and we're very excited about the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. That's it for now. Thank you.
Operator: This call is now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company’s third quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.vicipropertys.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company’s SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company’s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to respective company’s public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions and Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning everyone. The third quarter of 2022 for VICI was a quarter of both realization and continuing activation. By realization, I mean that in Q3 2022, we realized the full magnitude and impact of our growth activities in 2021. And by activation, I mean that we continue to create incremental capital allocation opportunities for VICI, especially in non-gaming. The key benefits realized in Q3 2022 included growing our revenue by 100% versus the same quarter in 2021, manifesting the full impact of our acquisitions of the Venetian and MGP; growing our AFFO by 83% year-over-year; growing AFFO per share by 8.5% year-over-year; announcing a dividend increase of 8.3%, giving VICI a dividend compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since our emergence in October 2017. Our key growth activities in Q3 and early Q4 included announcing an additional $186 million of financings within our partnership with Great Wolf Resorts; announcing our $203.9 million acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort; announcing a $200 million real estate financing partnership with Canyon Ranch. In 2022, we have invested in relationships with high-quality partners operating in high-quality experiential segments. Our year-to-date capital allocation commitments, the ones I just mentioned, plus our Cabot investment announced in June 2022 are expected to generate a going-in weighted average unlevered yield on investment of approximately 7.4%, as this nearly $710 million of capital is deployed over time. Before I turn the call over to John Payne and David Kieske, who will talk about our outlook, growth activities and financial results, I want to say a few words about our new partnership with Canyon Ranch, which we announced just last week. When we announced our new partnership with Cabot Golf back in June, you heard me talk about our belief in the power and moat qualities of what we call Pilgrim’s experiences, many experiential categories, especially those with strong elements of expertise and/or knowledge accumulation are parameatal in shape. And at the apex of these pyramids are the purest rarest realizations of that category’s experience. These are experiences that tend to attract within that experiential category, the most valuable and loyal clientele, able and willing through all cycles to pay a premium for the purest realization of the experience to which they are devoted. At VICI, as real estate investors, our thesis is a simple, and we believe, powerful one. Places of pilgrimage are places of great value. We want to and we are investing in these places. Cabot creates and operates golf resorts that represent pilgrimage experiences in golf. We are proud and excited to partner with Cabot on the creation of Cabot Citrus Farms. It’s our next pilgrimage destination and we believe we can partner on many subsequent opportunities with Cabot. Of us note as well the Las Vegas Strip is also a pilgrimage destination for people seeking Apex experiences of all kinds. I was just there this week. It is the busiest place on earth. In the experiential category of wellness and personal performance, Canyon Ranch has been, is, and I believe will be for decades to come, the market leader, creating an operating resort that represents a definition of pilgrimage experiences and wellness. The Canyon Ranch brand was born in 1974. For nearly 50 years now, Canyon Ranch’s clientele has traveled to Canyon Ranch Resorts to make the most important investment they can make, an investment in themselves, in the betterment of their lives, body, mind and spirit. The Canyon Ranch clientele, in order to make this investment and trust themselves to the Canyon Ranch team, an active trust that the Canyon Ranch team takes with existential seriousness. Under the leadership of Chairman and Principal owner, John Goff, a legend in American real estate investing through his creation of Crescent Real Estate and CEO, Jeff Kuster, formerly North American Head for Ralph Lauren. Canyon Ranch has built a wellness and humid performance team of great strength and authority. This team includes by way of example, a former U.S. Surgeon General, a former Head of Sports Medicine Research and Innovation at the U.S. Olympic Committee; a former Head of Physical Therapy for the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team; a former strength coach with the Philadelphia 76ers; a nationally renowned behavioral therapists; physicians who have pioneered integrated and lifestyle medicine fields; former Chef Dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Committee; and a Harvard Divinity School appointed spiritual innovator. The Canyon Ranch clientele is able and willing to pay through all cyclicals premium for the experiences and life improvements they obtain at Canyon Ranch. As many of you know, I have worked across ski resorts, heli ski resorts, beach resorts, golf resorts and now casino sorts. I can tell you, based on my experience that the Canyon Ranch capital and operating economic model, is among the most compelling and productive I have seen in revenue intensity per dollar of capital invested, in margins and in the returns on invested capital. Canyon Ranch, we believe will benefit greatly for decades to come from highly positive demographic and cultural tailwinds. The growth opportunities for Canyon Ranch are manifold both domestically and internationally and we are very excited to be Canyon Ranch’s capital partner funding this growth. You can hear John Goff speak of the role he sees VICI playing in Canyon Ranch’s growth. If you watch the Mad Money segment that John and I did with Jim Cramer on October 17. That clip can be found at our website, www.viciproperties.com. Finally, we are particularly excited about our first investment with Canyon Ranch, because it enables us to invest capital into and ultimately gives us the opportunity to own high-quality real estate in one of America’s most dynamic metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, a region that, at least for the foreseeable future, we cannot invest in through gaming. Let me now turn the call over to John Payne, who will talk about our outlook and growth activities. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. It’s good to be talking to you this morning. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort in partnership with our existing tenant, Century Casinos. Upon closing, rent under our master lease with Century will increase by $15.5 million, representing a 7.6% acquisition cap rate. Given our relationship with Century, we were able to leverage our existing master lease and our combined cost of capital to structure a transaction that work for all three parties involved, that being VICI, Century and Golden Entertainment, the seller of the asset. We are excited about expanding our relationship with Century as we have witnessed their relentless operating focus firsthand since we jointly acquired three regional assets in 2019. And upon the closing of Rocky Gap, we look forward to adding another remarkable regional destination asset to our portfolio. Moving to the outlook for growth, we are often asked how the transaction environment appears in real time. I will repeat something I often say, which is that transactions do not come together overnight. Ed touched on our Great Wolf, Cabot and Canyon Ranch partnerships and I would simply point out that the transactions we are able to discuss today represent just a fraction of the effort we undertake behind the scenes. Throughout the third quarter, our team remained as busy as ever introduced in our company to potential partners and forging relationships across a variety of sectors. In fact, our entire company is actively involved in finding ways to position VICI as the capital partner of choice for gaming and experiential operators. As you can imagine, capital market fluctuations can make it challenging to pinpoint our exact cost of capital at any given time. However, I stress that remaining discipline is core to our underwriting process. The landscape for transactions remains competitive and it’s important to understand that seller expectations do not necessarily adjust in real time. With that said, at VICI, we focus on what we can control, which is one, our partnership approach. We encourage potential partners to speak to our existing tenants and believe we can position ourselves to ultimately win the ties. Two, disciplined and rigorous underwriting, we strive for accretion in every transaction and thanks to the work of our team, believe we can remain competitive. And third, finding ways to create our own success, the landscape for PropCo transaction is not zero-sum. We have learned to adapt to a variety of scenarios and believe we can uncover opportunities that may not be obvious to our competitors. Just a few weeks ago, we crossed the 5-year mark since we started the company. We wholeheartedly believe that our track record, which includes over $30 billion of transaction, speaks to our relentless focus and dedication to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to adhere to the approach that is responsible for our success to-date and will strive to grow the company accretively for years to come. Now, I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and access to capital. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation and rising interest rates are not only dominating the financial news, but also factoring into the transaction market requiring buyers and sellers to adjust to a market backdrop we have not seen in many years. As John mentioned, VICI turned 5 years old on October 6. And since our inception, we have been disciplined in maintaining a positive spread to our cost of capital. So even in an environment where the 10-year treasury rate is north of 4%, a rate that many younger investors have never seen in their lifetime, VICI is focused on maintaining discipline in everything we pursue. We are fortunate that we have built a balance sheet to weather these turbulent times with no floating rate debt, no maturities until 2024 and ample liquidity to deploy capital accretively with leading operators like we did with Century, Great Wolf and Canyon Ranch since the second quarter. In terms of VICI’s liquidity and balance sheet, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $726 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $490 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our outstanding forward sale agreements, $2.5 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw term loan. During the quarter, we sold approximately 3.9 million shares with an aggregate value of $135 million after fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.9 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement, as Ed mentioned, we doubled our GAAP revenue year-over-year, a feat we are very proud of and I want to thank the entire VICI team for all their efforts in delivering this growth. AFFO for the third quarter was approximately $471 million or $0.49 per share. Total AFFO in Q3 increased 83% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased 8.5% over the prior year. As a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count which increased primarily from the equity raised in shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of this year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $12.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance, we are updating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 is expected to be between $1.682 billion and $1.692 billion or between $1.91 and $1.92 per diluted common share. Our updated guidance reflects the uncapped CPI lease escalation of 8.1% that VICI will receive under our Las Vegas master lease and regional master lease with Caesars, effective for the lease year beginning on November 1, 2022. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 15.3 million forward shares sold under our ATM program during Q2 and Q3. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transactions. As we have discussed in the past with you, we record a non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO-focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Megan, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone. Your line is now open.
Anthony Paolone: Thank you and good morning. I was wondering can you talk about just your efforts to look at investments internationally and how that’s coming on and also just your appetite around that given what happening around the world?
Ed Pitoniak: John, do you want to start?
John Payne: Sure. Good morning, Tony, how are you? Nice to talk to you. So it’s definitely been something that we have been focused on for the past couple of years, you’ve heard us talk about this that we’ve grown, obviously, domestically in our first 5 years, but we always have positioned the company to grow internationally and we’re spending time not only in the casino sector but also in the experiential sector outside the U.S. and study in markets where we think we would like to own real estate, and we’re in the middle of that process and understanding the underwriting and understanding the countries where we would own real estate and their laws and we’re right in the middle of it, Tony. Nothing to announce at this time, but it’s of interest for us to grow internationally.
Anthony Paolone: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Can you hear me?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes.
Steve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. Ed, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about where you’re seeing more opportunities? Is it with sort of some of the public gaming companies that have seen a big change in their cost of capital and debt markets? Or is it more on the private side with companies like Cabot and Canyon Ranch where maybe cost of capital is even less available?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. It’s a good question, Steve, and good to talk to you. I would say we’re seeing opportunities on both sides. I would say the private side, though, to your, I think implicit point is probably even richer fishing ground right now. And that has to do really with the state of the credit markets. As most of you on this call know, bank credit, especially to real estate credits has effectively dried up and I was reading the transcript as the Blackstone call last week, which I always do because if you don’t listen to what John Gray is saying at any given time, you’re missing an opportunity to pick up a lot of intelligence, and I thought it was telling the degree to which John was emphasizing to read it, they believe a lot of their real estate capital allocation in the near to midterm is going to be credit-focused. And you’ve seen that from us as well. I would say that we’re at a point in the cycle where would be sellers have still not gotten the memo that the world has changed radically. And as an indication of how radically the world has changed, I’ve been trading e-mails with Mark Streeter at JPMorgan, the IG REIT credit analyst, and he sent me these graphs of the volatility of credit. And if those were EKG, that patient would be in a world of hurt. And then I saw last night from Hartnett that U.S. treasury performance this year is the worst since 1788 when the United States of America was a funky little startup. So the state of the credit market is, to your point, Steve, like it’s tough if you don’t have access to capital. And as David just emphasized, we’ve got over $4 billion of liquidity. We’ve got almost $1.3 billion of effective cash, and we are very excited to put that to work. We will put it in both with private operators and public. And in some cases, it will go into credit in the near to midterm with conversion to real estate ownership in most cases. in order to, frankly, capitalize on the fact that we have capital when a lot of other people don’t.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. If I could just ask one other question, I know you’re probably not giving individual yields on, say, Cabot and Canyon Ranch, but could you help us think about the yields maybe a broad sense for those development yields, which clearly carry more risk versus kind of stabilized acquisition yields and deals that you might get on your road for. So just how are you thinking about yields on development versus maybe stabilized acquisitions?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Well, clearly, Steve, we do need to be compensated for the risk that is associated with development. And I’ll just go back to the 7.4% unlevered yield for the nearly 700 some million of capital that we’ve deployed in Q2 and early Q3 and I think that 7.4% unlevered yield going in to give people comfort that we have been adequately compensated for our risk.
Steve Sakwa: Great, thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
R.J. Milligan: Hey, good morning, guys. Certainly, appreciate your comments on cost of capital and maintaining discipline and certainly, the track record that you guys do only do deals that are accretive but I’m curious how you view your cost of capital today, how do you calculate it? And I guess given John’s comments that sellers’ expectations don’t always adjust with the changing cost of capital. Do you expect a pause on external growth on more of the middle of the fairway gaming assets while the bid-ask spread remains relatively wide?
Ed Pitoniak: David, do you want to start on that?
David Kieske: Sure. Great, R.J., it’s great talk to you. I mean one of the – we have this debate every day internally, right? When you see the 10-year moving 10, 15, 25 basis points, and obviously, the stock market is doing what it’s doing, hard to price a deal on a daily basis. So we look at – but we do look at the spread to our cost of capital. And right now, look, we’re getting 10-year pricing at 7%. So the $5 billion that we raised back in April, 5%, net adjusted at 4.5% with our hedge portfolio looks really, really good. But R.J., we’re going to always maintain the spread to our cost of capital. Obviously, our stock has held up well. Debt pricing is what it is. As Ed just touched on, we have $1.3 billion of liquidity that is on the balance sheet, which does not include the term loan or the revolver. Being cognizant that cash is not free and that there is an implicit cost of that cash, we are going to ensure that we continue to do the deals that we’ve done in the past, maintaining that spread. And your comment around kind of middle of the fairway deals, I think you’ll see more of the Rocky Gaps of the world were a little bit smaller deals and some of the large mega deals will probably take a pause for a while just given the uncertainty around kind of where the world is ultimately going. But we feel good about our pipeline. I think it’s busier than it’s ever been, and the dialogue is greater than it’s ever been but we’ve got to be relentless in ensuring that we can continue to deliver consistent accretion year in and year out for our shareholders.
R.J. Milligan: Thanks, David. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up – go ahead, Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: I was just going to say, R.J. And while obviously, the cost of debt capital has been incredibly volatile. And for most REITs, the cost of equity capital has been very volatile or just simply negatively trending. We are in a unique position where our equity on a relative basis, has held up so well with us having been the best-performing S&P 500 REIT year-to-date through September 30, and I’m guessing as of yesterday, we still are. So we do have a strength to our equity price or equity cost that on a comparative basis does represent competitive advantage. Back to you, R.J.
R.J. Milligan: Thanks. Just as a follow-up, given that bid-ask spread for sort of the middle of the fairway gaming assets, do the call options that you guys have become a more attractive option to sort of bridge the gap until cap rates adjust?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: So R.J., it’s nice to talk to you this morning. When you’re speaking – I think you’re speaking more of the one foot call we have on the Indiana assets, and we continue to watch the great performance that our tenant, Caesars, has been handling these assets. They have capital still going into the two assets in Indianapolis. They have rebranded both of those casinos and they continue to grow. So we will continue to look at those. Those – the put call is active all the way through 2024. We sit here in October of 2022. So – we will monitor them. We love those assets. We really like what Caesars is doing with them and in growing that business. And like I said, we will continue to look at those over time.
R.J. Milligan: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you. David, I was just wondering, as you think about the positioning of the balance sheet and obviously 5.8x pro forma today and likely to go down in the absence of transactions. How much does the current rate environment change the parameters that you want to operate within?
David Kieske: It’s a good question, Carlo. Good to speak to you. I hope you’re well. Look, the current rate environment is it bounces around every day. And so we’ve got to run the business taking a long-term view, but being mindful of if we had to price something or if we had to close on something today or in the near-term, how that would impact ultimately accretion, right? We’ve got to drive accretive deals and be disciplined in what we’ve done since day 1. So it’s something we watch. We’ve got access to the revolver. We’ve got access to the late draw term loan. Thankfully, we have no maturities until 2024, where we have to go to the debt markets, but it’s something that we’re going to be monitoring and making sure that we continue to drive growth to the balance sheet – through the balance sheet and can maintain the balance sheet and position of strength and as you said, bringing down leverage over time through potentially funding deals with our free cash flow.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird. Your line is now open.
Wesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. You guys are having a good success with follow-on deals. You seem to be in a good negotiation position with good relative cost of capital. But you did mention sellers are a little bit slow to adjust to pricing. Are you looking to potentially get some exclusivity rights to their expansion as a way to maybe bridge the gap on the pricing at this point?
Ed Pitoniak: If I understand your question correctly, Wes, and good to talk to you. I would say that when we form partnerships with the likes of Cabot and Canyon Ranch and Great Wolf and others, we’re most interested in developing relationships for the long-term that give us a steady flow of capital allocation opportunities. Obviously, we want to be properly priced, we want our investors to enjoy the yields that they deserve to enjoy off of these investments. But I would say it’s more about developing a long-term pipeline as opposed to using any kind of negotiating leverage or anything else, frankly, to enhance pricing per se. I mean, we’re very satisfied with the pricing. As I noted in my remarks with Steve, a 7.4% blended unlevered yield across both development and existing assets, we think is pretty good, pretty good yield in this environment. In fact, meaning is a really good deal. I wouldn’t say that we necessarily use these long-term partnerships in order to acquire pricing as much as we do to acquire a long-term pipeline of growth.
Wesley Golladay: Yes, I think what I was looking at is, yes, you look at – it looks like you have some – you get the initial yield, which is good, that may be a little bit slow to adjust but then you will have some kind of other value, whether it’s your embedded options, maybe an exclusivity. I was just wondering if there is anything more qualitative or more structural than an initial nominal yield that you may be able to get and it sounds like it’s just more based we’re just going to have this good relationship and it’s going to naturally lead to more deals, which is currently occurring.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. And one factor, Wes, especially when you’ve got a team as small as our VICI team, where we’re still just a couple of dozen people with probably lowest G&A among all the big REITs as a percentage of revenue, is that one of the benefits of forming these long-term partnerships is that we create the foundational documentation that enables us to basically rinse and repeat as we continue to grow with those partners.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. Great, thanks for the time, everyone.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Wes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with SMBC. Your line is now open.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So some of these non-gaming investments you guys are taking on the role of a lone ranger, if I can put it that way, as a way to sort of step in on these things. And I’m curious, is there a situation where that sort of strategy of investing and sort of taking the pulse of these investments initially does it break down at all in this environment? And if it did, would you be willing to be a little bit higher or I should say, lower in the capital stack in any of these Great Wolf, Canyon Ranch, Cabot and so on. What’s your appetite for taking on more risk at the outset of these non-gaming assets?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I’ll turn it over to David in a moment, Richard, and good to talk to you. Obviously, when we go into these relationships, we really – we work hard to make sure that our last dollar exposure is a level of last dollar exposure we’re very comfortable with, such that if we ever did have to step in, we’re stepping into a situation that at that last dollar level of exposure for us is very well protected and means that there is still a lot of value left in the asset. Beyond that, I’ll turn it over to David for his thoughts.
David Kieske: Yes, Rich. Great to talk to you. The one thing that we like about these loan investments as it gives us a seat at the table. It gives us insight to the business. It gives us exposure to the operator and as you have seen with Cabot and Canyon a path to real estate ownership. And so things like the Great Wolf where we – our attachment point, as I said, is 75% LTC. I think your question is, would we be willing to go higher or potentially even provide a senior portion we would if it’s the right operator, the right sponsor and the right relationship and again, the overall cost of capital – return on that capital is commensurate with our capital. And I think the one thing to point out is, I know we refer to these as development, but they really build to suits and broader real estate parlance. And VICI is not doing the developing. We’re partnered with high, high-quality developers set GMP contracts and oversight by very, very experienced builders. So while our development pipeline is robust, I think you could potentially see it deviate, meaning we could go lower in the Captec or even higher depending on what happens with the credit markets and making sure that we are rewarded for that.
Richard Anderson: Okay. And then the second question is the U.S. REIT model is largely a function of focused strategies. If you’re a hotel REIT, you’re a multifamily REIT and so on. You guys are more of the Berkshire Hathaway model and you are understanding that there is a shared knitting of pilgrimage – what I’m saying – I can’t pronounce that word for some reason this morning. But a common thread to them all experiential. You said just before you have a couple of dozen people working for you, how do you avoid pitfalls where one or some of these investments don’t quite work out. Are you – should we expect to see a substantial increase in people with experience in these individual asset classes and so on? I’m just curious how the overall entity will adapt as you expand your horizons and experiential real estate?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Richard, it’s a very good question. It’s a very top of mind question for both us as a management team and for our Board. And we do have a small team. I would just say, though, this has nothing to do with your question. I would say in an inflationary environment where G&A is so screamingly low as a percentage of revenue. Inflation obviously doesn’t have an effect on our cost structure the way it will on others. What we do, Richard, in order to extend our reach is I believe we get more value out of our relationships with our advisers than anybody else we know of. From day 1, we have treated our advisers the best we possibly can so that when we go to them and say, hey, you know a lot about a category we want to learn a lot about, help us. They are right there for us. And so whether it’s experiential categories or geographies with which we’re not familiar internationally, we work with our advisers as if they are full members of the team. And that extends our reach in a way that’s very cost effective, but it’s also risk mitigating because we come up the learning curve on both categories and geographies very quickly.
John Payne: And Rich, if I can – this is John. If I can just add one other thing on this, it’s important to understand that when Ed and I started the company in October ‘17, we always position this REIT as an experiential REIT. In our first 5 years, we were more focused in the gambling space because we saw the opportunities there. But in the background, we were always spending time study in these different sectors that you now start to see investments that we’re making. So this is not a shift of our company strategy at all. It’s just you are starting to just see these new investments being made.
Richard Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Barry Jonas: Hey, good morning guys. Great to talk to you. Notwithstanding current capital market conditions and bid-ask spreads, I was hoping to get your thoughts on what inning you think you are in for U.S. gaming real estate deals? I guess just how penetrated is your addressable market here at this point? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. Well, it’s good to talk to you, Barry. We still think there is a lot of opportunity out there. I know we saw each other, you were in Vegas recently and you have heard me say we – there is no place. You have heard Ed say this. There is no place as busy as Las Vegas, and we obviously have great real estate on the strip. But there is many opportunities in the regional market in Las Vegas, the downtown market, there is other states that are opening that we do not own real estate. There is other locations that we do in own real estate. So, I don’t know exactly what inning it is, but I would tell you, we still see incredible amount of opportunity to grow our business in owning casino real estate.
Barry Jonas: Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. Do you think over time, gaming operators will or maybe should move to a full OpCo model? I mean I am assuming coverage is still the key question here, but curious if your thoughts here have evolved over time.
Ed Pitoniak: Barry, I think it’s up to each operator to determine what’s the best business model for them given the overall nature of their business. We think obviously, partners like MGM and Penn are demonstrating that they can be very successful in their capital-light, asset-light model. And at the same time, we have incredible admiration for the way Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker are running Caesars, where they maintain ownership of a lot of real estate. I think it will be interesting to tell over time. And I think the key question for anybody we partner with, whether in gaming or non-gaming, is if we do a deal, what would you do with the proceeds, right. If we do a sale leaseback with you, what will you do with the proceeds. And it’s having a compelling use of proceeds that I think is one of the key determinants when you are an asset controller, whether in gaming or non-gaming as to how attractive having a sale-leaseback relationship with us would be.
Barry Jonas: That’s a great point. Alright. Thank you so much guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Barry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the discussion around your cost of capital and investment spreads. Your cost of equity capital has held up relatively well. Ed, you mentioned that, and it has, but it’s also been volatile. The market has been volatile in general. And I am just curious how you manage deal flow and underwrite potential investments when that investment spread and your cost of capital may be volatile during that time that you are underwriting or negotiating deals? And I guess along those lines, is there any consideration? Clearly, you have liquidity which you have outlined. But is there any consideration for doing more on the ATM or issuing equity in advance of some potential transactions to lock in your cost of capital and provide even greater certainty of seller expectations might be gradually changing here?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. And I will turn it over to David in a moment. I would say one of the benefits of having the amount of liquidity we have, the $4.7 billion that David alluded to, and especially the $1.3 billion of basically equity capital, we already know the cost of is that we have a relative degree of cost certainty. I want to emphasize relatively. We will not have an absolute degree of cost certainty that a lot of others with much lower liquidity just simply do not have at this time. But I will turn it over to David for his further thoughts to your question.
David Kieske: Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. I mean I think the implicit conversation was – or your question, excuse me, was are we shutting down our pipeline or are we pulling back. I mean I would tell you, we are busier than we have ever been as you saw on June 1st, we added a CIO, Kellan Florio from Goldman Sachs, who were thrilled about and is focused on opening more doors in the non-gaming world and has been very, very active. And so we constantly look at opportunities. But ultimately, if the opportunity doesn’t make sense or the market backs up or there is a change, we will not pursue a deal that is not accretive, right. The minute we do a bad deal, that will be our last deal we do because we will not be able to raise capital going forward from our owners, our investors, both on the equity and the credit side. And we are living in a time that’s pretty unique. Obviously, this sort of interest rate environment has not been around for many, many years, as Ed highlighted in his remarks and some of the charts that we have seen. But we will continue to be focused on raising liquidity like we did in June and August on the ATM, where we cut a little bit of tailwind in the equity markets and bolstered our balance sheet. But in terms of our intentions going forward, I can’t talk about that. And we will see what tomorrow brings. But I think we have set up a balance sheet, we have set up a cost of capital that still can be competitive in this environment, but we are just going to be even more disciplined than we have in the past.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey Todd. I just want to add to David’s remarks and I think it’s pertinent to your question. If you look at the total liquidity that David outlined for you, about $4.7 billion, that represents – that is an amount, I should say, equal to about 10% of our current balance sheet, our $45 billion of enterprise value. I don’t know how many other REITs out there have total liquidity equal to 10% of their balance sheet, especially if they are anywhere near as big as we are. And that really does represent the amount of firepower we have at a time when firepower is otherwise very hard – either very hard or very costly to achieve. The last point I would make is of that $4.7 billion of liquidity. And David, please correct me if I am wrong here, only $700 million of that $4.7 billion is actually currently on the balance sheet, the cash and the cash-like instruments that David referred to. The ATM proceeds and the delayed our term loan and the revolver, obviously, are not on the balance sheet because they all remain undrawn or unsettled.
Todd Thomas: Okay. That’s helpful. I appreciate that. If I could just follow-up real quick then on the credit investments that you have made more recently here, you talked about Blackstone and clearly, there are other credit investors out there. I am just wondering if you could address the competitive landscape for these types of non-gaming credit investments and some of the transactions that you have announced more recently.
Ed Pitoniak: I will turn it over to David in a moment. But I think the fundamental issue that we are finding in anything that’s resembling a competitive situation in terms of a would be borrower or partner evaluating our credit is, I think we are a lot easier, a lot friendlier to do business with. David?
David Kieske: Yes. I mean Todd, that’s when it comes down to it. And I know that’s hard to understand in order to put in your report, but relationships matter. You have heard John talk about it for years, if you see the clip that Ed referred to with John Goff and Jim Cramer and Ed on CNBC. He was very bullish about the opportunity to do more together. These are relationships that we foster and build and spend time with when we did Chelsea Piers back in June of 2020, it was competitive. It was a bid process. But part of our ability to win that was. One, our long-term view, we are not a fund driven. We don’t have a fund life. And ultimately, our relationships mean a lot. And it’s how you treat as Ed mentioned with respect to our advisors, we treat our counterparties extremely, extremely well because we want to do more together. We want both sides of the table to win and feel good and come back to the table to do more together in the future.
Ed Pitoniak: And just to add to that, Todd. When we are in these lending relationships, we don’t see our partners to debt. We are not a GP that needs to pay our bills by seeing or would be credit partners to debt. And that not only makes an economic difference to them, it makes a relationship difference.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Greg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. Just first, a couple of quick ones here. So, given that we are four days away from November, are you able to disclose the CPI-based lease escalators that you are expecting release [ph]?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Greg. Good to talk to you. It was in my remarks, it’s 8.1%.
Greg McGinniss: My apologies. Thank you. And then also, given your current cost of capital, does the high 7% call rate on the Indian assets, can you make sense to you today?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I talked about this a little bit earlier that we continue to watch this business grow capital from the operator. Caesars, the owner today, continues to go into the business. This call – this put call is active until the end of ‘24. So, we will continue to monitor the growth of the business. We will see the capital go in and we will determine the right time for this call option.
Greg McGinniss: Alright. Thank you. And then just a final one for me, Ed, in the earnings release, you spoke about the multi-trillion dollar place-based wellness sector. I was just hoping you could expand on what concepts are actually included within that sector. And then broadly, where you think the best opportunity for investment might be and how you are thinking about structuring those investments that does sound like it’s likely on the credit side right now?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, it’s – well, to be clear, Greg, it’s on the credit side right now with Canyon Ranch with a very clear path to own the real estate of Canyon Ranch Austin and also on real estate potentially in places like Tucson and Lennox and elsewhere that we can go together both domestically and internationally with Canyon Ranch. Obviously, we are most focused on the place-based dimension of global wellness. And I would say that based on the research we have done, one of the really appealing things about place-based wellness on a global basis is that the model from continent-to-continent is really quite similar. That’s in contrast to gaming. The U.S., Singapore, Macau are notable for having great real estate intensity to their gaming models, but that real estate intensity is not found to the quite the same degree in a lot of other areas around the globe. On the other hand, again, place-based wellness is really very much the same kind of concept as you go from the U.S. to, for example, Europe and the UK where there are many operators operating very much like Canyon Ranch at the high end with a good amount of real estate intensity.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you. So, I guess similar then to the type of model that we are seeing Canyon Ranch and the other types of operators that you would be looking to invest with in this space?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. And I mean when you think about it, historically, think about the great European spot towns that started to become popular back in the 1700s. The spa tradition has centuries of history. And the modern spa experiences grew out of those more ancient traditions frankly, it goes all the way back to the enrollment. The – they were in the spa business, right. This is a business that’s actually now that they say it, it doesn’t go back century, it goes back millennia.
Greg McGinniss: So, you think it has the same power then, I guess is what you are saying?
Ed Pitoniak: I think that’s pretty safe. Anyway, thank you, Greg.
Greg McGinniss: Yes. Thanks Ed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
David Katz: Hi everyone. Covered a lot of ground, and so I don’t want to just pick up time on general principle. But one very specific question. As I talk to operators in gaming who I would have classified 12 months ago as kind of never counterparties for you? My sense is that there might be some softening to that end in those conversations. Would you concur with that?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Hey. Good morning David. I would. And I just think this is just a matter of time. We have been around for 5 years. And I think we have been out explaining why our form of capital can work for gaming operators, particularly as Ed said, when they have great use of proceeds to grow the company. And I think that many CFOs and CEOs of companies that said they would never do it now have spent the time to understand how our capital work and how we can be partners and are now thinking about it. Doesn’t necessarily mean they will transact. But I think if you are in the C-suite of any company, you should be thinking about all the different ways that you can work with your balance sheet and structure your balance sheet. So, not surprising at all, David, that we are hearing – you are hearing that, and we are hearing that.
David Katz: Both you and I know they should consider it until they do, that it sounds like they are. Apologies, Ed, please finish.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I was just going to say, David, to add on to John’s remarks. If you go back to October 21st, the yield to worst on gaming high-yield credit on a blended basis was 8.21%, right. Actually the blended yield to worst on leisure was 10.03%. So, whether it’s gaming operators or leisure operators, they are looking at current yield to worst on their high-yield credit and almost all of them are high yield, very few of them are IG. When they start to look at our cap rates, they realize that when they have to refinance this debt that’s currently yielding 8.21% or higher, our capital could look very attractive.
David Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, when you potentially have opportunities in smaller regional gaming markets where maybe they have refinancing issues coming up and you have – as we talked about, it’s a competitive cost of capital. But in a recessionary environment in smaller markets where potentially that demographic is more hit in a recession, do you think about how you underwrite your rent coverage in those? Would you expect to change that at all, or how do you kind of – I am just sort of wondering how you are sort of thinking about that as you look at these opportunities?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I will turn to John – John, just before I turn it over to you, I just want you acknowledge me that – we missed your friend and colleague, Michael Bilerman. We always enjoyed when Michael showed up on our calls, and we wish him the very best in his new role at Tanger. Anyway, over to you, John.
John Payne: Yes, Smedes, it’s a very good question, and we spend a lot of time in all the different markets with all the different operators as we look at deals, understanding the market, understanding their segmentation of their customers, what they are seeing. I think you know this because you follow gaming. It’s a unique time for our tenants. We have spent a lot of time on this call talking about the market fluctuations. But in the gaming business right now, depending on what market and who you are talking to, some are having – continue to have record earnings. And almost all of the operators are seeing strong – continue to see strong business. So, we are very careful in whatever deal that we underwrite and understanding the market, the dynamics, the type of consumer, how far the consumer comes from, all of those things when we underwrite. And we will be careful as we look at regional markets in Las Vegas markets. But our tenants have done an amazing job in operating their businesses and continuing to grow them during this very unique time.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then I just – I appreciate that. And just one thing I just wanted to ask you. I mean when we look at other triple net REITs. The transaction volume has come down a lot and cap rates aren’t really moving. There is – as you have talked about, Ed, sort of the standoff between sellers and buyers. But in recent deals in gaming, I mean there haven’t been that many, but cap rates have moved from prior announcements. So, I am just wondering, do you think this sort of asset class is more sort of willing to move? Are they in a position where they sort of need to move because they are financing issues, or I mean would you agree with that, that maybe things are adjusting a little quicker or not?
Ed Pitoniak: It’s hard to tell, Smedes. Every deal is so specific whether it would be the geographic location, the asset is in, the nature of the asset itself, the tenant and its credit quality, I don’t know. I would be – I would have a tough time saying that cap rates within gaming have moved considerably up, which is implicit in what you are saying, given the market backdrop. I think it’s still a bit too early to tell, because I wouldn’t generalize the fairly limited amount of activity that we and GLPI have engaged in over the last few months.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the conference back over to Edward Pitoniak for any closing remarks.
End of Q&A:
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you very much again. In closing, we simply want to thank you for your time with us today. We believe we are really well positioned at VICI to continue growing our portfolio during what may be – well, no, what is a very uncertain period while driving superior shareholder value. Again, thank you and good health to all.
Operator: That concludes the VICI Properties’ third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, July 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of the words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our second quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions and Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning, everyone. Q2, 2022 was a quintessentially VICI quarter. A lot happened, a lot of continuing transformation as we worked to build VICI into one of America's highest quality and larger scale REIT. Here's a quick recital of Q2's highlights. IG, in late April VICI was elevated to investment grade credit status by S&P and Fitch, IG fundraise. In late April, we conducted our inaugural investment grade debt raise and that $5 billion raise was the largest debut and largest single IG debt raise by any REIT in history. It was a debt raise conducted in conjunction with the funding of our MGP acquisition that proved the continuing energy and agility of David Kieske and the VICI finance team. As the treasury swaps and locks that David and the team had put in place in late 2021 and early 2022, significantly reduced the net coupon of net debt. MGP closure. In late April, we closed on our acquisition of the real estate of 15 MGM assets, magnificent examples of Class A real estate, thereby adding about $1 billion of new portfolio income and initiating our new partnership with MGM, a partnership we believe can grow substantially in the years ahead. S&P 500 inclusion. In early June, VQ was added to the S&P 500 making VICI the first American REIT in history to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in less than five years. Pilgrimage experiences. In June with Cabot Citrus Farms near Tampa, we announced what we believe will be the first of many capital and property partnerships with Cabot, a global leader in creating and operating pilgrimage resort golf experiences. Our third tribal nation partnership. In June, we also announced that Cherokee Nation entertainment gaming holdings will become in due course our new operating partner in Gold Strike in Tunica, giving us yet another dynamic partner to grow with. These accomplishments significantly strengthen VICI's growth resources, capabilities, and opportunities, but there's one other key Q2 accomplishment. And that accomplishment is the growth of our VICI leadership team. In early June, we added two very talented senior officers. Kellan Florio became our new Chief Investment Officer, Moira Mccloskey became our new Vice President, Capital Markets. Kellan significantly adds to our ability to grow VICI's relationships and transactional activity with asset controllers, especially across, excuse me, especially across non-gaming sectors and Moira significantly strengthens our ability to further develop and sustain our relationships with capital providers, both equity and credit. Additionally, in June, we established the VICI management committee to continue to broaden and deepen VICI strategic resources and reach. This committee of seven includes Gabe Wasserman, Jerry -- Jeremy Waxman, Danny Valoy, Elena Keil, Cameron Lewis, Kellan Florio, and Mario Mccloskey. The VICI management committee working with John, David, Samantha and me will play an integral role in developing and moreover ensuring the execution of VICI's cultural ESG portfolio and total return goals and strategies in the years to come. They will be integral to the development of our growth ideas and our growth relationships, and from the growth of our ideas and our relationships will come the creation of stakeholder value. In a moment, John will tell you more about our current growth activities, and David will talk about our financial results and our financial outlook. But first, let me say a few words about our current strategic outlook. As you will hear further from John, our operating partners are delivering outstanding operating results, especially along Las Vegas Strip, where we gather about 45% of our portfolio income, but you wouldn't know this from how the equity and debt of our public listed partners are trading right now. Granted trading values tend to be based on outlook rather than current performance and both the sell and the buy sides are understandably concerned about a possible recession in the quarters ahead. But let me offer these three points. Point number one, gaming consumer resiliency. As we have discussed in the past, the gaming customer has proven to be more resilient through both garden variety recessions, and full blown crises than just about any other discretionary consumer out there, that was proven through both the great financial crisis and throughout the COVID19 pandemic. Point number two. Gaming operator resiliency. A couple of you on the sell side have produced well reasoned analysis that show the gaming operators generally, and many of our partners specifically will be in very solid shapes in terms of both free cash flow and balance sheet strength, even under fairly draconian recession scenarios in the year or so ahead. Our operators are responsible -- responsive, and agile in dealing with changing conditions. Both gaming consumer and gaming operator resiliency give VICI confidence in our belief that a possible recession will not harm the credit quality of our operators. But in the meantime, and this brings me to my third point. There is absolutely no question that the relative attractiveness of VICI's capital to both our current and potential operating partners in both gaming and non-gaming has only strengthened in the last few months. With our investment grade credit status and our S&P 500 inclusion, VICI's access to and cost of capital has strengthened on a relative basis at a time when most experiential operators have seen their access to capital severely curtailed and the cost of any incremental capital significantly increased. As we've proved with our Venetian acquisition, VICI has the capability to move quickly and decisively in market conditions that may cause others to pause. Current and especially prospective market conditions could yield VICI, we believe highly attractive growth opportunities in the quarters ahead. And further the topic of growth, I'll now turn the call over to John Payne. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGP, expanding our portfolio to 43 of the highest quality experiential real estate assets under our triple-net model with a combined 58,000 hotel rooms, hundreds of food and beverage and entertainment outlets, and millions of square feet of high-quality meeting and convention areas. Thanks to the tireless work of team VICI. We've completed over $29 billion of transactions since our company's formation, less than five years ago. We're very proud of these accomplishments. And at the same time, we're excited that our work has only just started. One of our primary objective that a company is to work with our existing tenants to provide capital solutions that help meet each operator's strategic objectives. As many of you have heard me say before, our team does not take a break after announcing or completing an acquisition. Our development team remains very active, expanding our relationships and sourcing opportunities that we believe will continue yielding accretive outcomes for VICI. During the second quarter, we entered in a long-term partnership with Cabot, a leading destination golf operator, where we provide funding for the redevelopment of Cabot Citrus Farms in Florida, and convert a portion of our loan to real estate ownership under a long-term sale lease back. We're very excited about this relationship and will look to potentially expand with Cabot over the coming years. While many of you enjoy asking questions about on the ground operating trends, I would like to remind you that we are a triple-net lease landlord. We collect fixed rent streams with annual escalations over very long periods of time. Those who have followed our story will recall that we continued to collect 100% of cash rent when every one of our properties was forced to close due to the government mandated restrictions in response to COVID-19. There have been many questions about the outlook for consumer spending. And I would simply repeat that our income does not fluctuate based on monthly or quarterly trends. Now, with that said in Las Vegas, the Strip continues to produce incredibly strong numbers. For example, gross gaming revenue in May was 41% above 2019 levels. And Harry Reid International Airport just registered an all-time record for passenger traffic this past June. While the growth rates are becoming more difficult to surpass given the record activity levels, the gaming industry has proven its resilience over decades. And anyone who researches operator profitability will understand that the business models are leaner and more flexible today as compared to pre-COVID years. The gaming operator successfully navigated a very uncertain period at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and emerged on stronger footing with record breaking margin expansion as they've created ways to monitor consumer activity and adjust their cost structures accordingly. We are very proud of our track record to date and our relationships with stable, industry-leading tenants. We will remain disciplined as we evaluate opportunities and ensure future acquisitions satisfy our investment criteria. Thanks to our exceptional balance sheet, which David will touch on, we believe we're in a very strong position as we evaluate growth opportunities. In an environment where cost of capital fluctuates daily, we will continue to pursue transactions with appropriate underwriting and accretion for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thanks John. I want to start with our balance sheet and overall liquidity available to VICI to fund future growth. To recap the second quarter events. On April 18th, VICI was upgraded to investment grade by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20th, we priced $5 billion of investment grade senior unsecured notes, executing the largest REIT investment grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the notes was 5%, while the effective interest rate after taking into account our $3 billion hedge portfolio was 4.51%. On April 29th, we closed down the acquisition of MGP as well as the $5 billion bond offering. We used 4.4 billion of the proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. The remaining proceeds plus cash on hand were used to repay the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. The company also issued approximately $4.1 billion of aggregate principle amount of senior notes in exchange for and with the same interest rate, maturity date and redemption terms as notes originally issued by MGP pursuant to the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations. Following the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations, approximately 90 million of original MGP notes remain outstanding. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with a total -- with total debt of $15.5 billion inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 7.2 years to maturity. We have had many accomplishments in our short existence as a public company, but being added to the S&P 500 index on June 8th is a continued endorsement of our growth. As mentioned, VICI was the fastest REIT to be added to the S&P 500 index from IPO to inclusion. And we believe being added to the index will broaden our investor base and improve our access to equity capital. During the quarter we sold approximately at 11.4 million shares with an aggregate value of $367.4 million before fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement, and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. As of June 30th, with approximately $4.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $614 million in cash and cash equivalence, $360 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our forward sale agreement, $2.5 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw facility. In July, the revolving credit facility was amended to permit borrowings in certain foreign currencies up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.25 billion enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the second quarter was $430.1 million or $0.48 per share. Total AFFO in Q2 increased 67.9% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 4% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised and shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP. At the end of Q2, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM, which were received in the merger. A full reconciliation of the share count is included in our earnings release. Our results, once again, highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in a high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $11.8 million for the quarter. And as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.8%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We believe this represents the appropriate go-forward run rate when accounting for the increase in certain expenses related to the MGP acquisition I just want to touch on CECL or current expected credit losses, out of the $552 million non-cash charge we incurred in Q2, 80% or approximately $443 million was related to the initial allowance we were required to record upon entering into the MGM master lease. This allowance did reduce our GAAP net income for the quarter, but as previously noted non-cash CECL charges do not impact cash flow or AFFO. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars, as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions. The per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 11.4 million forward shares sold from our ATM program in Q2. And as we have discussed, we recorded non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO for the year ending December 31st, 2022 is expected to be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion, or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted common share. With that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question on the phone lines from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please go ahead when you're ready, Anthony.
Anthony Paolone: Great. Thank you and good morning. My first question relates to your efforts outside of gaming. So, you have four of these experiential relationships going, can you comment on where you -- when we might see some of these convert into straight up property acquisitions and also do you see more of these, or these growing over the next 12 to 18 months?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Tony, good to talk to you and I'll start out. This is Ed. And before I answer that question, I hope I don't preclude a second question you may be asking. I want to thank you for doing the math that you did in your note last night regarding the potential impact of CPI on VICI's run roll. To answer your question, I think, Cabot, the Cabot transaction is representative of the sort of transaction we wish to duplicate in many, if not all of our non-gaming transactions, insofar as the Cabot transaction is predicated on a period of lending into development with the lent capital converting into real estate capital upon stabilization of the development, that will obviously apply in situations where there is development. In other situations, we will obviously look for opportunities where we have the opportunity to own real property right out of the gate. But we're taking an approach in non-gaming that often requires pioneering. Insofar as one of the fundamental opportunities we believe we have at VICI is to pioneer the OPCO/PROPCO structure into experiential white space that has not seen the OPCO/PROPCO structure before. And in order to do that, and we're very happily doing it, we're willing to create structures like we did with Cabot.
Anthony Paolone: Got it. Okay. And then, with regards to the equity raise in the quarter off the ATM, any comments on the planned usage there, or how should we think about doing it or, why you did it?
David Kieske: Hey, Tony, it's David. Good to talk to you. It's really an opportunistic use of the ATM. And as I mentioned, we put it under the forward agreement. So, with the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, we saw elevated volumes in a level and a priced -- share price that we thought made sense to raise a little equity just for the -- given the current state of the environment and enhance our overall liquidity.
Edward Pitoniak: And I think you can take it, Tony, as a sign of our confidence that we're going to have opportunities to deploy capital.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks Tony.
Operator: Thank you, Tony. We now have the next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead when you are ready.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I'm wanted to circle back to your comments. You talked about sort of the downturn and obviously that doesn't really affect you, but it does affect the operators. And I'm just wondering if a pending recession or weakening fundamentals might actually spur more transactions in the near-term. And then I do have a second question. Thank you.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Steve, good to talk to you. The -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, what we do not fear is a recession having a harmful effect on our operators operating results and their overall credit quality. But I think one thing to be sober about is, the outlook for refinancing in 2023, 2024, and potentially even beyond, but especially in those two years. And one of the data collections I read most avidly every Monday is the credit trading data of our existing and potential partners. And when you look at the yields to worst of a lot of -- a lot of the experiential credit, both gaming, and non- gaming, you're looking at yields to worst right now that if they had to refinance at those levels, and then compare the cost of that refinancing to the cost of our capital through sale lease back structures, we can, frankly, in many cases, beat the hell out of that. So, I think, we do see it. I think, implicit in your questions, Steve, we agree with your implicit suggestion that there could be very attractive opportunities to, for us to support very strong operators who nonetheless could suffer from a refinancing marketplace over the next couple of years, that makes our capital that much more attractive.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. And then the second one, maybe sort of along the lines of development, I know when -- we were talking over the last few weeks, densification opportunities along the Strip are opportunities. And sort of similar, we talked about the non-gaming and Cabot and doing lending into development, would you use a similar structure for opportunities on the Strip, or would you just wind up, you think purchasing those upon completion?
Edward Pitoniak: I think it would depend on the circumstances, Steve. But just to make sure everybody understands that the basis of your question, we are very excited about the densification and intensification opportunities that we and our partners have along this Strip. We have 660 acres all told, and in due course, we're going to be mapping those 660 acres to identify either unoccupied acreage, or acreage that is otherwise not being put to its highest and best use. And we think we have the opportunity to support our partners in the intensification efforts in ways that could lead to billions of dollars of incremental investment opportunities. In terms of how we would structure the capital in those opportunities, where the opportunity is there to lend and then convert to real estate ownership, we might do so. But in many of the properties we already own, it could simply be a case where we are. We are financing the development of the real estate with our capital and effectively owning the real estate as it gets built, if you will.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from RJ Milligan of Raymond James. You may proceed with your question, RJ.
RJ Milligan: Yeah. Good morning, guys. So, security and investment grade rating, plenty of liquidity, stock is now trading near an all-time high. So, despite the macro uncertainty and volatility, it seems like the market's giving VICI the green light for growth. So, do you think it's time to get more aggressive on the acquisition front even more than you already have been? And why not call the Caesars assets now and lock-in pretty attractive accretion?
Edward Pitoniak: I'll turn it over to John, but the idea that we would exceed the velocity. We've transpired -- that's transpired so far $29 billion in a little over four years. That's a pretty strong pace, but I'm going to turn it over to John for his thoughts on potentially taking advantage of both our current cost of capital and market conditions. John?
John Payne: Yeah. RJ, good morning. You're giving me a heart attack already, RJ, for moving more than we've already -- more than we've already done. But look, RJ, I think your observations are good, but as good as we are doing right now, we need to continue to be disciplined in our approach to evaluating opportunities, and making sure we're meeting our investment criteria. I can assure you, and as Ed said in his opening marks, we've added resources to the development team. Not only our expertise in gaming, but we've added Kellan Florio as our Chief Investment Officer who is going to focus on non-gaming. So, more to come here, but we hear you and we're out there, turning over every rock of opportunity.
RJ Milligan: Thanks guys. And a follow-up question. And this is related to Steve's earlier question, but I wanted to focus more specifically on Caesars because we've gotten a lot of questions on Caesars and their balance sheet and sort of their plans. And obviously, the coming rent increases are positive for VICI, right? Given that it boosts your internal growth above most of the peers in the net lease space, but it also stretches coverage. And so, if you factor in a recession, maybe that stretches coverage as well. So, I'm just curious how you feel about Caesars right now, the current and future coverage levels? And then, specifically, and this leads to Steve's question about potential transactions with them in the future.
Edward Pitoniak: John, do want to start?
John Payne: Look, we feel great about Caesars, under the leadership of Tom Reeg. As you all know, we helped support them when they were El Dorado taking over the company. They had a business plan in place and they've executed it in a very disciplined way on the bricks and mortar facilities. Would we continue to do -- find opportunities to work together? We hope so. We hope that they continue to perform well, and we find opportunities to help them grow their facilities. And they've been very good partners to us, and I hope they feel that we've been good partners to them.
RJ Milligan: Thank You, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We now have a question from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. Morning. I wanted to ask just kind of specifically about the billion dollars of funding commitments that you mentioned in your Q, that's coming from the property growth fund. And just given, more recessionary concerns, do you feel like your existing tenants may be more likely to kind of pull back on those funding commitments, because it's -- I guess it's initiated from their end, correct? And I'm just wondering if you have a sense that maybe the -- their appetite for investing maybe slowing a little bit, just given maybe the need to hoard capital, if you will. There's any kind of thoughts around that.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Well, I'm going to kind of -- sound like I'm repeating myself here, but Smedes, it's nice to talk to you this morning. I mean, if you look at Las Vegas right now, Smedes, just where there could be a lot of this capital deployed, in my opening remarks I talked about the growth in Las Vegas. In May, it was 41%. GGR up over 2019 and then the June numbers came out this morning and in June grew 23% year-over-year. So, again, we have to be aware of the macro conditions going on, but there are some markets such as Las Vegas that are seeing tremendous growth. The consumer continues to visit. In my opening remarks I talked about the record number of passengers declining in Las Vegas in the month of June. And so, if you are an operator and you have a facility in Las Vegas, you can see it is a town that is growing and there could be opportunities to deploy capital creatively. And as Ed mentioned in his remarks as well, or in his comments about Las Vegas, it is a town that we have 660 acres and we'd love to continue to grow there.
Smedes Rose: Okay.
Edward Pitoniak: The other thing I would add, Smedes -- the other thing I would add, Smedes, is that, we could be -- it remains to be seen that the velocity of which this will rollover. But we're -- you're beginning to see -- beginning to see the beginnings of rollover instruction costs. And I think, if we continue to see a more benign construction cost environment, it could obviously create a stronger green light for development.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then, David, I just wanted to ask you, on the ATM, I mean, it looks like the growth raise was close to $374 million and the net was $360 million. That seems like a particularly high kind of fee. And I'm just wondering, is that typical, or was there something specific maybe to that?
David Kieske: The gross was $360 million 7.04? Sorry Smedes. The gross number was $367.4 million and the net was $360 million. So, these were market fees.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Gotcha. Thank you.
Operator: We now have the next question from Neil Malkin of Capital One Securities. Your line is open, Neil.
Neil Malkin: Hey, everyone. Thank you. Relative to the time, David, I'm still waiting for those VICI raises. So, we can talk off line about my address for [indiscernible] Kellan, I don't know if he's done that. I don't know if he's on the call. But obviously you brought him over to focus on non-gaming. I'm just wondering, maybe this is just a broader general question. You can take it however you want. What does he see, I guess, in terms, what do you guys see as the biggest opportunity, the biggest untapped segment, that has the most potential to be executed on over the next 12 to 24 months. I know you talked about pioneering and you guys have definitely done that on the different parts of the capital stack, for sure. But I'd be really interested to get some insight from you or from your conversations with Kellan and particularly again with a very strong stock price.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Kellan Florio is not on the call. So, John will answer this for you, Neil.
John Payne: Yeah. Neil. Good morning. It's good to talk to you. I don't know if I have a specific category you've heard us talk about, we love the indoor water park business, the theme park business, family entertainment centers. There's parts of sports that I think are quite interesting that we're studying and parts of fitness that we're continuing to study. And as you mentioned, we're really pioneering some areas here that have not traditionally worked with a REIT. And so, we're working on different structures as Ed talked earlier in his comments that will eventually turn into real estate ownership. So I don't have a specific area, but it is nice to have an additional resource, because it's clearly and Kellan short time being with us, a little over eight weeks, our funnel has gotten a lot wider and we have the -- we've had the opportunity to talk to more companies domestically and internationally.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe Ed or John, I don't know, but other follow up question would be along the same vein is, when you do these exercises, looking at new types of business models to put a triple-net structure on top of, can you just quickly like outline or -- how do you think about the risk, and how do you adjust, protect yourself from like unknown risks, because it's a new industry? How do you think about alternative uses replacement costs? All of those things that obviously offer downside protection, if something unexpected happens to that segment.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. So Neil, we use four fundamental evaluation factors when we look at any experiential category. Starting with lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, we -- what we really love about gaming is it does have lower cyclicality, and we generally want a trend toward segments that have that same characteristic. Number two, we want healthy supply demand balance. This usually means investing capital in assets that have a cost or complexity that tends to mitigate against unwarranted supply. We do not want -- number three, we do not want secular threat to be a big factor. We generally want the real estate to provide an out of home experience. That must almost by definition, be an out of home experience, and thus be less vulnerable to, as we say, getting Amazon by displacing the experience through putting it at a box or shipping it through a wire to your house. And then finally, number four, we want proven durability of the end user experience. Because the durability of the end user experience that constitutes the durability of the operator's business and it's the durability of the operator's business and ultimately constitutes the durability of our rent.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Neil. Yeah. Next question operator.
Operator: Thank you. We have the next question from Wes Golladay from Baird. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Wesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just have a question on the VICI property growth fund. How should we think about the trajectory of deploying capital? Will you expect to deploy capital in 2023 and will it ramp up 2024, 2025? And then, do you have a max exposure for the segment?
David Kieske: Wes, this is David. Good to talk to you. I mean, I missed a little tail end of that, but let try to just address …
Wesley Golladay: Max exposure.
David Kieske: Max. Thank you. So, well, it depends on the project. We are actively working with all of our tenants. They understand that, that we have the partner property growth fund and that we have the ability to invest into their assets, as we talked about on this call and this serves as an attractive source of funding for our tenants. So somewhat depends on the project. The Venetian, for example, we committed a billion dollar to the partner property growth fund, and that billion dollars could go into the -- or the continuation of the funding of the hotel that was stopped in 2008. It could go into some other expansion ideas and renovation ideas that the Apollo team has. And we hope that some of that may start later this year, but it's again, all up to our tenants and their timing. And then in terms of the deployment of that, the nice thing about the partner property growth fund, it's important that does not come all at once. If it's a new hotel tower or we take the Mirage where Hard Rock coming in and we've committed up to $1.5 billion, if they so choose to use that money, that's a 12, 18, 24-month redevelopment timeline where we get to -- going to deploy that capital on a monthly basis, not having to go to the market to raise large amounts of capital day one. So, it's a flow business for VICI, and attractive funding source for VICI. In terms of max size, that's -- we want to be cognizant of the development risk. At the end of the day, we are not the developer, but our capital obviously is going into projects that are being developed. And it'll depend on where that capital is, whether it's in gaming, non-gaming, if it's on the Strip or if it's regional. So, we're going to be cognizant of the total size, but right now I don't have a threshold for you. But we're going to -- we're excited to use it. We're excited to help our tenants grow.
Edward Pitoniak: Wes, let me just add. I'm sitting here with a team in our -- one of our New York conference rooms, and I'm looking at beautiful big aerial photos of a couple of our Las Vegas assets, Caesars Palace, and the Venetian. And I think one of the things we're starting to realize Wes -- and is that we need to do a better job of communicating the nature of the real estate we own, especially along Las Vegas Strip. And that when we describe it when we, or anyone else describes it as gaming real estate, we are not accurately describing it. As I look here at the Venetian, I'm looking at a complex of nearly 13 million square feet on what are we, 80, 90 acres, and gaming occupies, I think, less than about 2% of the square footage of that asset, right? And so, if you want to think about our Las Vegas assets and come up with a corollary, real estate corollary to our Las Vegas assets, I would encourage you to think of the correlate of being theme parks, right, because of the mass, the mass size complexity, layout, and development potential of these assets. And this is true of all -- 10 assets we own along the Strip or -- more true at some than others, but very true of many of them. And as an example, the Venetian -- and the photo I'm looking at, you can't even see where the MSG Sphere will go. And it represents a densification of the real estate that I think is among the most exciting development's going on in global entertainment right now. And for new music fans out there, it was just announced this last week that U2 will have the opening residency at the MSG Sphere when it opens in 2023. So, we hope in time for F1. Sorry, I got a little over excited there, Wes.
Wesley Golladay: Yes, Ed. You remind me F1. I'm looking forward to that as well. A real quick, speaking of sports, would VICI ever consider doing stadiums? I mean, company obviously has massive scale. Not anyone can do those. And it just seems like maybe an untapped market for you.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. So stadiums, stadiums are intriguing. But I do think we are mindful of the fact of obsolescence risk in stadiums. For every Fenway Park or Wrigley Field or Anfield or Old Trafford, there's a stadium that had proved to have about 20 years of useful life. And then -- and Atlanta, the Atlanta baseball stadium situations, an example. I will tell you that one area of pro sports globally that we're very interested in is the whole dimension of training facilities. And as you know, Wes, that's become a bigger beginning area focus of investment for pro sports teams. And we've been having discussions and doing a lot of study around being a virtuous capital provider as global sport obviously becomes more and more a focus of capital provision.
Wesley Golladay: Great. Thanks for the time everyone.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Wes.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question.
Barry Jonas: Thank you for that introduction. What percentage of the portfolio would you guys like to see non-gaming longer term?
Edward Pitoniak: John, do you want to do that?
John Payne: Yeah. Barry, it's good to talk to. I don't think we have a specific number. I think we've been clear that the magnitude of gaming assets and the magnitude of EBITDA that they generate are significantly higher than what we've seen in the non-gaming space. So, we may end up doing more non-gaming transactions, but they may not add up to the quantity of rent, so to speak of just one or two gaming assets. So, we're continuing to work on this. You can hear me talk and you can hear Ed talk, hear David talk in our remarks that we are spending more time in a variety of areas in the experiential space. But we don't have a specific number today of how large that will be or what percentage will be of our total portfolio. But I think as we refine this over the coming years under Kellan's leadership, we'll have a better idea of the segments of business that we'll go into and how big they can be.
Edward Pitoniak: The other thing, I just want to make sure, Barry, no one ever loses track of or sight of is that we are as excited about global gaming investment as we have ever been. And we believe our opportunities to continue to grow in American gaming and in international gaming -- represents our most exciting, compelling, large scale growth opportunity, but just want to make sure that does not get lost.
Barry Jonas: That's great. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up question. You've certainly highlighted the resilience of gaming on this call and in the past. But given the macro uncertainty out there, how does that impact -- how you guys think about transactions and credit quality now, especially as you're evaluating new OPCOs?
David Kieske: Barry, it's David. Good to talk to you. As Ed alluded to, and as we talked about a lot, right, the gaming customer will always game. And one of the things that's going on in our underwriting more specifically is obviously there's been a ramp up in EBITDAR over the last -- post COVID. EBITDAR is much greater than it was in 2019 and before. And so one of the things that we're working with, anything we evaluate is what is the true run rate? What is -- where does the margin settle out? And I think, we're all comfortable that EBITDAR is going to be greater than 2019, but is it really going to be double or triple, or is it more, one in three quarters times or two times. And so, we're spending a lot of time with the operators on their belief of the future -- the market, and it all depends on the market, the asset and the opportunity. And in terms of credit quality, that's of us -- a big focus of us and with our master leases, our corporate guarantees and knowing the operators, the way that John and Danny and team know the operators we're able to underwrite the overall opportunity. And we talked about the acquisition environment. We continue to believe our ability to put points on the board here as we go forward.
Edward Pitoniak: Hey, Barry, let me just add. The -- I think there's another dimension to this, that also speaks to the opportunity for gaming operators to continue to grow their competitiveness and consumer discretionary, and that relates to sports betting. And I feel like sports betting in the last, I don't know, six, nine months Barry, it feels like the dot com explosion, right, of the early 2000s when every baby got thrown out with the bath water. Right? And if in 2000 you said, okay, dot com blew up. I'm never going to own Amazon again. You just -- you don't even want to think about the value you missed out on. Right? And I think one of the things that's being missed here is that the gaming operators have made investments in increasing their bandwidth, increasing the bandwidth with which they can reach, activate, engage, and generate business from a much bigger, deeper consumer market in America. And I think we're going to see the benefits of that in the years to come, especially by the way, in which gaming, sorry, sports betting has enabled the gaming operators to activate the next-generation of customers. Again, I think the whole kind of cloud over the sports betting investments is, is really gone too far. And people are losing sight of the fact that it is going to be a key, key means by which gaming competes in the American consumer marketplace.
Barry Jonas: Great. Great. Thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. We now have David Katz of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Ed, earlier on, I think I forget exactly how you phrased it, but in reference to Cabot, you talked about the possibility or the expectation that that is a relationship that continues to grow and broaden over time. Would you mind coloring that in just a bit? Cabot is somewhat new on our consciousness for those of us that aren't pilgrimage, golfers.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, good to hear from you. I'm going to ask my colleague and partner, Samantha to offer her thoughts here, because she was our business leader on developing and creating our Cabot partnership. So Samantha?
Samantha Gallagher: Yeah. Thanks Ed. So, we are very excited about this partnership. And as -- if to the extent you have followed Cabot, they have opportunities and growth opportunities internationally beyond just the United States that we certainly would look at with them. If there's -- they've an asset in St. Lucia, they've just announced an asset in Scotland. And so, we think there's growth opportunities together there. And one of the things we love about what we've done with this transaction is we've created a template that we can really follow. So, as we discussed earlier on the call, this loan, because it is development, but it does convert into real estate ownership and we have the documentation already in place for that. So, we're excited to use that template to grow with them.
David Katz: So if I -- as my follow-up, you noted that there are two that are underway, is it fair to assume that they Cabot have a vision for, what eight, 10 long-term, and you would walk along that journey where it makes sense?
Samantha Gallagher: Well, I think they have great expansion and growth opportunities. I can't speak for how many, but certainly we would love to walk along that journey together. And we've developed a really strong partnership. This was a relationship that we've been working on for at least 18 months before we signed the deal. So, this is now a very strong relationship between our two teams and we look forward to growing together.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, I would encourage you and everybody else, they're just beginning to get to know who Cabot is, to go to their -- and I can't remember the corporate website for Cabot. Do you remember the address?
Samantha Gallagher: It should be Cabot links.com, but.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. And anyway, David, as you well know, having covered the depth and breadth of hospitality and recreation that you do, so much of the scalability of a business in leisure hospitality, recreation is based upon the scalability of the management team. And one of the things I think you'll be very impressed by is the caliber of the management team that Ben Cowan-Dewar, the founder of Cabot, has put together. Because that is the limiting factor, right? That is the biggest constraint for organizations like this in terms of the scalability of their portfolio, is the scalability of their management team. And they have built an outstanding management team, as you will see when you look at their website, which is …
Samantha Gallagher: It's the cabotcollection.com.
David Katz: Got it. Okay. I have probably five more, but I'm not allowed and I'll circle back. Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Give us a call, David. Give us a call.
Operator: Thank you. You now have Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead when you're ready, Ronald.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Just two quick ones for me. The first is following up on the non-gaming opportunities. Did a good job, giving us some examples of the verticals. But when you sort of put it all together in your mind, just how -- just broad strokes, how big do you think that TAM is as you guys are attacking that opportunity?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Ronald, it's a question we're working on. The thing we would most emphasize is this would be global TAM. These are categories of leisure, entertainment, recreation, that we see investing in on a global basis. And we are only at the beginnings of determining what that TAM would be. But I think you can be confident that when looked at globally, it represents a very big universe of potential investment.
John Payne: And Ronald, I'll just add that. If you had asked us this question last quarter, we've probably added two or three other categories that we're now studying. So, the TAM is going to continue to, to ebb and flow as we continue to find new categories that our capital could be put to work.
Ronald Kamdem: Excellent. And then my quick follow-up would be, you talked a lot about sort of international opportunities, obviously add into the TAM. But as their markets that are closer than others, you provide more details there, is it Europe, specific country, so forth would be helpful. Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yeah. We've been on the road for -- Kellan started, as I said, eight weeks ago in his first week, he was with me on a trip to Europe to look at numerous assets. We've spent some time in Canada as well. We like the country of Australia. So, we are out and about better understanding opportunities. Again, as Ed mentioned earlier, not only in non-gaming, but the opportunities in our core of gaming. So, we're active in these spaces right now and the funnel is just going to get wider as we've added more resources to our development team.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Spenser Allaway of Green Street. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Spenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just staying on the international theme. I'm just curious if you guys look at the Crown Resort sale in Australia, and could there be a potential to JV with a partner like Blackstone to eat some of the tuition costs that come with expanding abroad.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. John, you want to take that?
John Payne: Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. As you know, we never comment on specific deals that are out there, but I think you're asking us, are we aware of the Crown Resorts and do we like a market like Australia and would we partner with a company like Blackstone, which obviously we have in a couple different occasions in gaming and a non-gaming. So, the answer is, would we have interest in those areas? Absolutely. We think they're wonderful assets. We think that Blackstone is a great operator. But is there an opportunity for us today? I can't comment on that, but those are areas that we would've interest in.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Jay Kornreich from SMBC. Jay, your line is open.
Jay Kornreich: Hey, thank you. Good morning. As we look at gaming, you guys spend a lot of time during the first few years in the business, educating investors about gaming real estate. And at this point, I think generally everybody's a good understanding of the asset class and safety of flows. But as we now transition to the potential size of non-gaming, how do you guys kind of evaluate the opportunities to grow in that segment with the risk of investors needing time to digest and understand new asset classes and restarting that education process?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a good question, Jay. And the responsibility lies with us to explain the nature of the business we're investing in, the nature of the operator's business model and the credit worthiness of the operator. And we realize -- we own that responsibility and we'll exercise it very diligently. Obviously, helping people understand the gaming story was good training for what we need to be able to do and what we're responsible for doing in non-gaming. I will say, I think there's a bit of a mitigant, a positive mitigant at work, Jay, insofar yes, we have the obligation to help investors understand this new category, but with each new category, assuming we can convince them quickly that this is a category worthy of investment. It obviously also helps them answer the question, how does VICI continue to grow now that it's gotten so big? So, again, we won't shed the responsibility to educate, but we think with each new category we go in, we prove that there is a lot more we can do to continue to create value and growth at VICI.
Jay Kornreich: Okay. Understood. And then just as a follow-up with the potentials -- potential Caesars in Las Vegas sale, I know your product comment on that. But just in terms of the current marketplace with interest rates where they are, how do you guys kind of assess your willingness and ability to acquire Las Vegas real estate in an accretive manner at this point?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. It obviously needs to be accretive, Jay, that's absolutely the requirement. And I think that we're in a very interesting period right now. It's a period in which some people realize, it's not 2021 anymore, and other people haven't quite figured out it's not 2021 anymore. What I would say is that the marketplace of borrowers or those who need capital, has more quickly figured out that the world has changed. And with it, the pricing that goes with that change, and then there's others -- potential sellers, some of whom haven't really figured out, it's not 2021 anymore. So, it's really going to be highly circumstantial as to whether or not there's the potential to get a deal done. And it will only get done based upon mutual recognition that the world has changed and prices need to change accordingly.
Jay Kornreich: Okay. Thanks very much.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from John Decree of CBRE Securities. Please go ahead when you're ready, John.
John Decree: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question and all the questions. Maybe I'd just piggyback on your last response there about how the world has changed and to revisit your earlier discussion on cost of debt, the yield to worst of your tenants and potential tenants. You've often get compared to debt capital, but your source of financing is typically more permanent than debt. And we've had a recent conversation about your partners and how they should consider their overall cost of capital, given the longevity of your financing. I'm wondering in this environment, if you've seen partners and perspective partners starting to compare your capital to their overall cost of capital, or are you still competing with just debt capital at this point, how has that kind of education process gone and has anything started to change given the current environment?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. So, John always good to talk to you. It's our responsibility to educate, whether it be existing partners or potential partners and we're doing the work, as we speak of making sure that they understand not only the nature of our capital, which you're absolutely right, John, it is permanent, but also the cost -- the comparative cost of it to their, exactly your point, to their weighted average cost of capital. If you take their current yields to worst on their benchmark bonds, and then take their implied cost of equity, most of our would be -- and existing partners are looking at weighted average cost of capital that tend to be in the 10%, 11% range, right? And needless to say with good quality assets under the right leases, we can beat the hell out of that cost at the right cap rate, a cap rate that's very accretive to us, but representing capital that is very attractively priced for them. And that's again against their weighted average cost to capital. As I alluded to earlier in the call, John, there are situations where their debt in some cases is trading so wide and probably unfairly wide that in there will be cases where we can even beat the cost of debt, never mind the way -- the blended cost of debt and equity.
John Decree: That's a good point. Ed thanks. I appreciate the additional color on that.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Ed Pitoniak for some closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Thank you, operator. And thanks to all of you. We're sorry to keep you a little long, but it's great to engage with all of you and we look forward very much to talking with you again next quarter. Bye for now.
Operator: Thank you, all. That does conclude today's call. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 5, 2022.  I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel of VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of the words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak : Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Happy Cinco de Mayo. When we held our last earnings call in late February, we had just closed on our acquisition of The Venetian, one of the largest scale and highest quality single assets in American commercial real estate. As we speak with you today, we have just closed on our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, MGP, one of the largest scale and highest quality portfolios of Class A real estate in American real estate investing. VICI's story over the last 14 months since we first announced our acquisition of The Venetian, is a story of transformation. We have transformed the scale of our portfolio, our tenant and geographic diversity and very importantly, the character and quality of our balance sheet. We've also become the leading real estate owner on what we believe is the most economically productive street in the world, the Las Vegas strip. In a moment, John Payne will talk further about the transformation of our portfolio, and David Kieske will talk further about the transformation of our balance sheet. But let me first spend a few moments talking with you about what's been proven about our business model over the last 2 years and how timely our current transformation may prove to be from both offensive and defensive perspective over a coming period of economic uncertainty. Over the last 2 years, COVID-19 proved the resiliency of VICI's business model because COVID proved the resiliency of our tenants' business models. VICI collected 100% of our rent in cash and on time throughout the COVID-19 crisis because of the operating excellence and operating liquidity of our tenants. Our operators have shown their ability to operate through thick and thin. The economic outlook for the next year or 2 may be murky, but we firmly believe that our operators' prepared their operating revenue, cost and liquidity models for whatever may be coming. What about our view on VICI's ability to continue to grow in the coming period? There are 5 key capabilities as we see it to growing as a net lease REIT in all cycles, including whatever cycle may be about doing 2. Number one, same-store NOI growth based on key lease terms regarding escalation and CPI protection; number two, internal funding capability based on cash retention; number three, the capability and opportunity to invest incrementally in existing assets and return for incremental rent; number four, the ability to source acquisitions when the frequency and intensity of asset marketing processes lessen; number five, access to investment-grade credit when high-yield markets may be constricted or costly. Let me say a few words about VICI's growth capabilities in each of these 5 areas: point number one, same-store NOI growth. Green Street in the September 2021 analysis showed that VICI generates same-store NOI growth more than 4x higher than net lease rates on average. And in terms of higher -- in times, sorry, of higher inflation, VICI's same-store NOI superiority versus other net lease rates expand when factoring in the CPI owned into our leases. Point number two, internal funding capability. Pro forma for the annualization of VICI's net income and debt service, having enclosed Venetian and MGP, if we maintain a dividend payout ratio between 75% and 80%, that would leave between $400 million to $500 million of retained earnings available to us for investment annually, a competitive advantage during periods when market may be constricted. Point number three, investing incrementally in existing property in return for incremental rent. Our assets measure, on average, over 2.5 million square feet and sit on many acres of land. That scale of building and land enable us to invest incrementally in our existing properties in ways generally not available to net lease REITs whose stores generally average around 25,000 square feet, 1/100 the size of our assets. Point number four, sourcing acquisitions when asset marketing processes lessen. You've heard us say before that we grow our business at VICI and our portfolio by growing our relationships. As we pursue both gaming and non-gaming investments in the coming years outside of marketing processes, we are confident that our ability to generate new relationships with operators who operate in net lease white space will give us growth advantages. Point number five, in -- just to investment grade with high-yield credit markets tighten. Through the great work of David Kieske, Erin Ferreri and other members of our finance team, we achieved investment-grade status with S&P and Fitch about 2 weeks ago. We may be in the early stages of a challenging period for the high-yield credit markets and CMBS financing. We believe that the relative competitiveness and attractiveness of our capital could increase during the coming period as experiential operators look to refinance their existing businesses and/or fund their growth initiatives. To sum up, VICI has gotten bigger and moreover stronger at a -- we believe advantages will accrue to those REITs that are bigger and stronger.  I'll now turn the call over to John, who will talk about our new portfolio and operating conditions and to David, who will talk about our financial results and balance sheet upgrade. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. The first 4 months of 2022 were very productive for VICI. In February, we completed The Venetian Las Vegas transaction. And just last week, as Ed noted, we closed on the acquisition of MGP adding 15 Class A market-leading assets with over 33,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of convention space and hundreds of food and beverage outlets to our portfolio. As a management team, having the opportunity to acquire the MGP portfolio in a master lease structured where the cash flow is cross-collateralized with inflation protection beginning in lease year 11 and a corporate guarantee from MGM Resorts is something we are very proud to have accomplished on behalf of our shareholders. Our 43 asset portfolio is unmatched in size, scope and quality in the triple net sector, and we plan to continue to grow our asset base with our best-in-class tenant roster as well as new operators. As some of you may know from recent data that has been released, Las Vegas continues to be a top destination choice by consumers and the Las Vegas Strip remains one of the most economically productive streets in the world. Gaming revenue in Las Vegas in March alone came in at $746 million, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. I'm going to repeat that, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. Additionally, the outlook for room revenue is very strong as midweek business continues to normalize with convention business returning to the city. On their first quarter earnings call, both MGM and Caesars cited 90% hotel occupancy in March and Las Vegas room rate surveys published by the Sell Side have pointed to second quarter ADRs that are tracking 30% above 2019 levels. The City of Las Vegas with its diversified entertainment economy that is no longer just about gambling, but centered around business, sports, and entertainment, continues to prove to be the top destination in the U.S. and possibly the world. As a real estate investment trust in the business of owning and leasing integrated entertainment resorts within a triple-net structure, we are big believers in Las Vegas for decades to come and are incredibly excited to now own 10 world-class assets and a total of 660 acres along the Las Vegas Strip. Our regional casino assets with regional markets in general also remained extremely healthy. In case you somehow missed the first 4 months of 2022, I'll give you the cliff note version. In a nutshell, the casino industry is in amazing shape right now. Several operators, including Boyd Gaming, Churchill Downs, MGM and Caesars have made it quite clear with their quarter 1 earnings releases and conference calls that the reports of the decline of the U.S. regional casino margins have been greatly exaggerated. April results have continued the March strength and not only is the gaming consumer healthy, wealthy and wise, they are still choosing to spend money on gambling despite having many other entertainment options. As we think about what comes next for VICI, we are fortunate to have executed some of the largest and most complex transactions in the net lease industry, and we will continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver accretive value for our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results, our balance sheet and our guidance. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll start with our balance sheet. At the beginning of 2022, encapsulates the energy we have brought to transforming our balance sheet since VICI emerged in October 2017. We have discussed this relentless balance sheet focus with you over the last 4.5 years. We believe it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners to -- deserve. Not to spend too much time on 2021, but is a good reminder of how we take the long-term view to safeguard our company. We raised a combined total of $5.4 billion of equity at the time of the announcement of The Venetian acquisition and shortly after the announcement of the MGP transaction. These equity offerings derisk the equity funding well ahead of closing on our $21 billion of announced acquisitions and allowed us to repay all of our secured debt last September. These actions set us up for success in early 2022 and for years to come. On February 8, we closed on our new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. On February 23, we closed on the $4 billion acquisition of Venetian through the settlement of 2 outstanding forwards, bringing 119 million shares onto the balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We also drew $600 million on our revolver, and used cash on hand to fund The Venetian. On April 18, VICI's debt rating was upgraded to BBB- by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20, we priced $5 billion of investment-grade senior unsecured notes, executing on the largest REIT investment-grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the senior unsecured notes was 5%. The effective interest rate after taking into account our hedge portfolio, which was comprised of $2.5 billion in notional amount of forward starting swaps and $500 million in notional amount of treasury locks is 4.51%. On April 29, we closed on the acquisition of MGP as well as a $5 billion bond offering. We used $4.404 billion of the bond offering proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. Following the MGP acquisition, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM that were received in the merger. The remaining proceeds from the bond offering plus cash on hand were used to repay the $600 million outstanding under VICI's revolving credit facility. In terms of leverage, we ended Q1 2022 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.6x. This highlights the fact that we significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As we sit here today, pro forma for the MGP transaction, we have total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt on a run rate net debt to adjusted EBITDA -- excuse me, on a run rate, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 8.4 years to maturity. Just touching on the income statement. AFFO for the first quarter was $305.5 million or $0.44 per share. Total AFFO in Q1 2022 increased 19.8% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 5.1% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 26.3% primarily as a result of the regular weight portion of the September 2021 equity offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet, the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement last September, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet and the settlement of the March and September 4 sale agreements in February of 2022, which added 119 million shares to our balance sheet. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $9.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.3%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are updating our AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activities or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed in the past, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed MGP acquisition, including the issuance of 214.5 million shares of common stock to former MGP stockholders and the $5 billion bond offering we executed subsequent to quarter end. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022 will be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted share. With that, operator, we ask you to please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: Congratulations on everything you guys have gotten done recently. My first question is, just given everything that you've all done and getting past all that, what has it done to just the conversations you're having on future growth and opportunities? Has it expanded sort of your discussions and just increased the profile and stuff that you're looking at? And how are you organizing all those thoughts?
Ed Pitoniak : John, you want to start?
John Payne: Sure. Well, Tony, thanks for the comments, and it's always nice to hear from you. There's no doubt, Tony, that we've changed quite a bit as a company from when we started the company back in 2017 just due to size, scale, scope, magnitude of assets, and it has got the attention of folks that I think when we started the company, did not know exactly who we were and what we were doing. So the funnel is definitely as wide as it's ever been for us. There are numerous opportunities. You've heard us talk about, obviously, gaming opportunities, we'll continue to pursue in markets where we want to own more real estate or we don't own real estate. And then there are a lot of companies that have noticed what we've done in the experiential space. You've heard Ed and David and myself, Danny, others talk about making real estate investments outside of gaming and in experiential and we've been in contact with. And so as Ed in his comments, we build relationships, and we build relationships that we hope turn into real estate ownership. And so we are organizing, we're meeting, we're traveling. We're doing all that right now, Tony. And we'll see how it plays into our growth, but we feel really good about the magnitude of opportunities that we see in front of us.
Ed Pitoniak : Tony, I'll just add to that. I think sort of a truism across every real estate asset class that there are benefits in owning marquee assets that are well known to whatever category or well known within whatever category you're in because it increases your visibility. And we were fairly invisible when we got going 4.5 years ago. And there is no question that in owning assets like Caesars Palace Las Vegas, like The Venetian, like MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, like National Harbor, like Caesars New Orleans, we are teaming a visibility that is very, very helpful, as John points out, and giving us greater top-of-mind status when people think about who they'll call.
Anthony Paolone : Got it. Okay. And then with regards to the opportunities to reinvest in the asset base, including things like the Mirage. Can you talk about timing and around maybe hearing more about a project like that? And also, just does anything in the rate environment or macro volatility change the thinking or prospects for some of those investments? Or do the trends on the ground there kind of win the day right now?
Ed Pitoniak : David, do you want to start with answering the second half of Tony's question and then John can add.
David Kieske: Sure. We -- look, we're very cognizant of the macro trends, right? We were fortunate to get our bond offering off a couple of weeks ago just -- and execute what we were able to execute. Every day brings something new volatility with the Fed speak yesterday. So we're going to work to ensure that our partner property growth loan is ultimately what we're talking about here, delivers accretive returns. And that's -- I touched on that being able to invest in these magnificent assets of size, scale and complexity that rivals nothing other out there. We will make sure that the capital that we deployed generates an incremental return that's accretive to us.
John Payne: As it pertains to the Mirage, Tony, the Hard Rock team is going through the licensing process in the state of Nevada. They're amazing developers and operators. And we obviously are already partners with them in our Cincinnati asset. And so we're excited with what they are going to have planned for the redevelopment of the Mirage and the Hard Rock Las Vegas. But no timing yet as they need to go through that process.
Ed Pitoniak : Tony, I just want to add one more thing. And that is that we -- often in the early years, we're often told by would be partners that, oh, I can borrow money cheaper than your money, VICI. And we are very humble about admitting. We are learning every day how to tell our story better. And what we've really focused on of late is helping people understand that our capital and the cost of it should not be compared simply to the cost of their debt, but to their blended cost of capital, accounting for both the cost of their debt and the cost of their equity. And even before we saw the recent widening of credit spreads and before we saw the recent multiple contraction of many operators across experiential both gaming and non-gaming, our cost of capital versus their blended cost of capital is already very attractive. It's only grown more attractive in the last couple of months.
Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just last one very quick, I guess, somewhat related to that. Like what is your preference or thinking right now as you think about yields and contractual growth? Like do you want more inflation protection or more upfront yield? Or how do you think about the balance of that? Or are you solving for an IRR? What's the thought process there?
Ed Pitoniak : David, do you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes. Tony, I mean, ultimately, we're solving for a spread to our cost of capital. And like every deal is different. Obviously, inflation and CPI discussions are more relevant today than they were when we started VICI. But ultimately, as a net lease company delivering an attractive 100 basis points, 150 basis points, sometimes less, sometimes more spread to our cost of capital is what we strive for. We also look at our underwriting in terms of cash-on-cash returns and the IRR over a period of time to ensure that we are delivering incremental accretive deals to our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street.
Spenser Allaway: Maybe just going back to external growth for a minute. Just in regards to the ROFRs and other put-call agreements you have in place with operators, has there been any discussion on those eligible for execution? And how do you think about the relative attractiveness of these?
Ed Pitoniak : John?
John Payne: Yes, Spenser. As you -- as it pertains to the ROFRs, I assume you're referring to the Las Vegas ROFR. I'll just refer you to the CEO of Caesars, Tom Reeg, who during his earnings call was very clear on what is going on, which he said, look, Caesars has started the process in early '22. He expects there to be another update by the middle of the summer, and the sales process really is governed by the VICI agreement documents. And so that process is in the works. We're aware of the agreements we have with them. Today, as I said in my opening remarks, we do own 10 great assets on The Strip in Las Vegas, which make up about 600 -- we also have 660 acres that those assets sit on as well as vacant land. It is a market that is truly incredible. As I stated, when you have business up 35% gaming revenues is simply amazing, and it really is as their new ad campaign says the greatest arena on earth. And so that is a market that we are big fans of. We'll continue to study. Do we want to own additional real estate? If we do, it needs to come to us in a very accretive manner. And we'll continue to follow our process on that.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. That's great color. And I know you just mentioned, obviously, Vegas revenue has been strong, but just curious if in conversations with the operators, have you guys gained a sense of how regional and/or Vegas operating margins have held up with the inflation pressure?
John Payne: Yes. It's another good question, and many have released their earnings. I just -- a friendly reminder that for us, rent is paid with margin dollars not necessarily not margin percentage points. So, if you take a company like one of our tenants, Penn, which generated almost $50 million more in margin dollars year-over-year with the earnings that just came out. So the businesses continue to be incredibly strong, especially when you compare it to other businesses around the United States. So we couldn't be happier. As Ed said in his comments about our tenants, how they've adjusted their business, how their margins are up. Most importantly, their margin dollars are up. Many are seeing record EBITDA. I think Caesars announced that 18 properties set all-time records in Q run EBITDA. So Spenser, I could go on and on about our tenant's bit. It's exciting to see that the -- even with the macro issues going on, they are about continuing to perform very well.
Ed Pitoniak : One point answer that Spenser that I'd like to add -- Spenser I was just going to say one more point I want to add on top of what John just rightly said, is that with all the focus on inflation, I think it's important to note that, obviously, we, VICI, enjoy superior CPI protection in our leases versus other triple nets. But I also want to make sure everyone understands that our tenants are in the business of nightly leases, and in some cases, even hourly leases, and that pertains to their ability to constantly reprice in respect to demand and in respect to inflation. And I think that, going back to John's point, is a key factor in ensuring they continue to produce all the margin dollars they can possibly produce given their ability based on nightly -- the lease business to constantly reprice.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to ask just a little bit as you look at potential opportunities, are you seeing any change at this point in potential transaction cap rates just with the rising cost of capital, but kind of weighing that against the continued kind of institutionalization of this real estate space and improving operating trends that you pointed out? Or is it too soon to sort of see any meaningful changes?
Ed Pitoniak : Yes. It's a very, very good and very timely question, Smedes. In my experience, and I guess this is one of these rare occasions when it actually pays to get old, what I've seen over the years is it when you enter a period of tightening, when the cost of credit and/or equity go up, it usually takes sellers longer to recognize the change in reality than does it for the buyers, right? And so I think right now, we're probably in somewhat of a situation of a slack tide where there's really -- on the part of would be sellers or would be buyers a bit of hesitancy as to well, what is market, right? We are fortunate that we have a number of discussions going on that have a momentum to them that can carry both us and our potential partners past this hesitation regarding the future cost of capital. But I do think we'll probably see a period as we have in so many cycles where it will take some time for buyers and sellers to recalibrate. It will take some time to re-find equilibrium, but it's pretty axiomatic that if the cost and the availability of capital goes up, so -- sorry, the cost of capital goes up and the availability goes down, cap rates tend to go up accordingly. Now -- sorry to go on so long. In gaming, it may end up adding to somewhat of a more or less a stasis in cap rates because this is a category that as you were saying, Smedes, has been seeing cap rate compression, perhaps the velocity of compression slows or maybe even stops, but it may be a category where you won't see cap rate expansion given the increasing interest in the category as we've seen over the last year or 2.
Smedes Rose : Great. That's interesting. I just wanted to switch gears, John, again, switch and go through the transcript of operators. But I'm just wondering, it sounds like the leisure customer is still very strong in Las Vegas. Do you have any thoughts on how the convention business is lining up over the next year or so, I guess, or however you think about it?
John Payne: Yes. I mean based on what we've heard, we now have Caesars, MGM and The Venetian running assets in Las Vegas who run the largest convention business there that they are seeing that business planning to return later this year and very strong, as you've heard them say in their earnings in 2023. Smedes I was quoting the gaming revenue, but what I haven't quoted yet is another thing Caesars said in their earnings, their Las Vegas properties in the month of April had record room revenue. So that's pretty amazing in a place where they're also getting strong gaming revenue. So you can see the consumer, I mean, most importantly for our tenants, the consumer simply has not found a substitute for their entertainment dollars, that Vegas continues to be, again, the #1 destination in America. I've argued with my colleagues, it's the number one destination in the world right now. And not only is the customer coming who wants to gamble, but we're seeing that they diversified these resorts, and they're getting business travel. They're getting room revenue, they're getting food and beverage revenues, spa revenue, pool revenue. And it's the beauty of these integrated resorts. And all the credit goes to our operators and how they're running these facilities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: Given the scale and size of VICI to date, how many strategy or perhaps your minimum requirements change at all?
Ed Pitoniak : I would say generally not. And if I guess at what might underlie your question, given that VICI has gotten so big, will VICI sort of establish a red line below which we do not go in terms of asset size or NOI. And I think the answer is no. Again, as a triple net REIT, we enjoy rent per asset that's up over $50 million. The average triple net store produces about $250,000 a year rent. We will always evaluate the materiality of a given asset not unto itself, but really as part of a larger relationship with whomever may either currently own and want a sale leaseback that asset or an operator with whom we partner in the acquisition of that asset. So we will be much more focused on the long-term growth potential of a given category or opportunity or partnership than we would on individual assets. And that's how we believe over time, we'll develop a more sustained and sustainable business model of deal flow.
Barry Jonas: Great. Great. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up question, are you seeing a wider group of REITs out there now looking at gaming deals? And maybe to what extent are you competing with operators looking to do holdco deals?
Ed Pitoniak : David, you want to take that?
John Payne: I'll go ahead and jump in. I mean, obviously, we've seen with the Wind transaction in Boston Realty Income getting into the casino space. But for us, ever since we started the company, we always knew there was going to be competition in this space. Clearly, people have seen the resiliency of the model. They've seen the high quality of the assets. They've seen how it's performed in the toughest time ever, which was COVID with the business shutdown and rebounding with all the records that I've been talking about today. So that obviously has attracted more potential owners of the real estate or of the holdco as you mentioned. So we go into every transaction, expecting that there's going to be competition. And we are not surprised at all that there are more folks that are interested in this just incredible real estate space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Kornreich from SMBC.
Jay Kornreich: Thanks again for getting MGP done and everything else. Just going back to interest rates, but in a different question that as the rising interest rates are putting pressure on what was previously expressing cap rates, can you kind of walk us through how you think about the puts and takes in structuring new leads of such items like cap rate, rent coverage, inflation, CPI kickers and what opportunities there may be for you to potentially get more aggressive?
Ed Pitoniak : David, do you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes. Jay, thanks for the question. I mean as I mentioned a little bit earlier, each deal is unique and not every -- not one size fits all. So what is critical for us is that any transaction that we ultimately underwrite and ultimately announce and then sign up is accretive day 1, right? You saw some hotel REITs in the last day or 2 announced a 4 cap and they're going to turn it into an 8 or 9 yield. We can't do that under our structure. And if we ever did that, that would probably be our last deal that we ever did. So obviously, CPI is a very hot topic these days, but it's important for us to have escalators that are: one are reasonable for the market that we're in, whether that's regional, super regional, Vegas destination and then annual bumps that work for us and work for the operator. And we ultimately want to push for no CPI caps and the operators are pushing back on that a little bit. And so it's always a negotiation in terms of value, duration of lease the cap rate that we can pay. There's a few levers that we underwrite with to make sure that we are underwriting a strong credit and a strong operator that has conviction that coming into the market. But obviously, we want to -- our fundamental goal is to make sure that we -- what we sign up is accretive from day 1 because we live with that for 30 years plus.
Ed Pitoniak : Jay, I will just add that a bit of wisdom that one of our most important and valuable Board members, who many of you know, Craig Macnab, one of the first adages he shared with us is that gentleman, the rent should be as low as possible. And we absolutely believe in that. We want our rent to be as low as possible in regard to the economics of the tenant's business because the lower the rent as a percentage of their economics, the more successful they will be, the better at credit they will be and the more willing and able they will be to occupy the building for a very, very long time to come.
Jay Kornreich: Yes, absolutely. I mean certainly, the portions of the tenant accrued to the landlord. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess just as a follow-up, we previously spoke about the benefits of becoming investment grade and the lower cost of capital that comes with it, which may open up the door for more non-gaming opportunities. So just curious about how you're thinking about that at this time now that you've achieved the investment-grade status.
Ed Pitoniak : David?
David Kieske: Yes, Jay. I mean we're thrilled to be here, and we'll continue to, as we talked about on the debt roadshow and the debt marketing process, we'll continue to migrate up to BBB curve over time. We'll continue to diversify our tenants, bring our leverage back to the 5x and 5.5x that we've always been very focused on from day 1. Thanks to Erin's great work with the -- Erin Ferreri and her team. Thanks to her great work with the agencies, we're able to get that rating upgrade on April 18. But that does definitely broaden the funnel as another question that was asked earlier. At the end of the day, we're spread investing. So if we can lower our cost of capital, not only through the debt markets and as we migrate up the credit curve, obviously, the cost of capital can be reduced. And then with the index inclusion that has occurred with the MGP Class A shareholders being converted to VICI Class -- to VICI shareholders and then potentially one day S&P 500 inclusion, we can continue to lower our cost of equity capital to -- as you said, Jay, and frankly, so broaden that funnel and continue to diversify both in and outside of gaming.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz: I just wanted to talk about kind of the next phase, if I'm characterizing it right, where some of the acquisitions that you may pursue, come from internal -- or funded by internal capital sources or cash flow and the accretion that comes out of that. How big of a trend is that? And is that something we should be thinking about this year?
Ed Pitoniak : David, do you want to start? And…
David Kieske: As Ed mentioned, and we've talked about our free cash flow after dividends and that's true free cash flow is somewhere $400 million to $500 million of run rate. So you kind of think about levering that 1:1 up to $1 billion of buying power. And so small gaming deals like the Century deal that we announced in June of '19, $278 million that can be done with cash on hand. And so all that accretion dropped straight to the bottom line. And some of the non-gaming stuff that you see us do is obviously smaller just by the opportunities that were presented in front of us at the time. And so those -- that's free cash flow. We don't have to go to the equity markets and do what we did last year and raise $5.4 billion of equity for the transformations that we undertook. We're thrilled to have done them, and we wouldn't know looking back. But I think as we continue to grow, as Ed said, that's sustained and sustainable flow business as you'll see more of that going forward. Hopefully that answers your question, David.
Ed Pitoniak : David Katz, I would just....
David Katz: Just a follow -- please go ahead.
Ed Pitoniak : Yes, David Katz, I was just going to add that when we look at retained cash as a capital source. We are very cognizant that is the shareholders' money and our obligation to produce a superior return and investment spread on the use of that cash is every bit as strong as it would be if we're going out into the market raising equity.
David Katz : Right. And if I can -- just follow up. I think the last part of my question is, is there a landscape that you could see some of these kinds of opportunities happening next 12 months-ish?
Ed Pitoniak : Yes. I'd say, John, we're very confident of that. Are we not?
John Payne: We are. We are. Obviously, David can't tell you when our next transaction, Sam's smiling at me -- that I can't tell you when our next transaction will be. But in all seriousness, I -- we're as -- you've heard me say, we're as busy as we've ever been. The funnel is wider than it's ever been for numerous reasons that we talked about earlier of our size, our scope. And so I think that's very realistic within the next year or so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: So last night The Flamingo is currently being marketed by Caesars. There's also the information that some investors have not been interested at the marketed $1 billion plus valuation, which -- and it leads us to 2 questions. The first is the fact the property is being more widely marketed, I mean you also passed on that initial price. And then two, what kind of cap rate would you target for an investment of that size, given cost capital they imposed, leverage limits and your desire for immediate accretion?
Ed Pitoniak : Well, Greg always been good to talk to you, and you definitely get the award at least so far for asking the questions that we can and will not answer on this call. I think John did a good job of describing what Tom Reeg was on record saying the other day, and I don't know, John, I think we just -- we leave it there.
John Payne: Couldn't agree more.
Greg McGinniss: Well, I figured, I had to shoot my shot there. But maybe as a second follow-up.
Ed Pitoniak : You absolutely do. Full marks for asking.
Greg McGinniss: So separately then. So based on current inflation numbers, can you just give us some indication as to what's being -- assuming guidance for the escalators for the remainder of the year?
Ed Pitoniak : David?
David Kieske: Hey, Greg, it’s David. Similar to but not including unannounced acquisitions or dispositions or capital markets activities, guidance includes this, the base case escalators.
Greg McGinniss: So does that mean where it could be greater of 2% in CPI or assuming 2%? Or how should we think about that?
David Kieske: It doesn't include any CPI, estimates around CPI because that's a guessing game, and so we can't predict the future. If we could, we'd probably be doing something else. So the base rate in the leases that's in the guidance number.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And the CPI numbers...
Ed Pitoniak : And then Greg -- I was just going to say, Greg, the key period for CPI measurement for us comes in the early second half of the year, isn't that the right way to think about it, David?
David Kieske: Yes. For the bump in November, we look at September, August and July numbers and compare that to the prior year, and then that's what gets factored into the increase November 1. For the 2 Caesars leases, the Caesars master lease and the Caesars Las Vegas lease.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Tallman.
John Massocca : So given some of the kind of new stories or prints we've seen on Las Vegas land prices or even assets that maybe have more of a redevelopment component to them. How are you thinking about your landholdings in Las Vegas? And maybe can you kind of remind us what the process would be for either monetizing those or kind of turning them into development, if opportunities arose on that front?
Ed Pitoniak : John and perhaps Samantha, you want to take that?
John Payne: Yes. Just as a reminder, we have really 34 acres in Las Vegas that are underdeveloped, 7 are in front of Caesars Palace. Those -- that sits inside the Las Vegas master lease, and then there are an incremental 27 acres that we own. Caesars also owns some acreage next to our 27 acres. As it pertains to development, as you can imagine, as you -- and you are alluding to or as you mentioned, there have been some significant sales of real estate acreage on the Las Vegas Strip or near the Las Vegas Strip. It continues to make our land very valuable. And the process would work if we were to develop would be with Caesars on the land, particularly in front of Caesars Palace as well as the land that is behind The Flamingo, behind Paris and Bally's. We would work in partnership with them should there be an appropriate development. But we sure do like the prices that are coming out, if they are completely true. I think there was one that just took place, small acreage of almost over $30 million an acre. So we're excited to see that. And it's not that surprising when you heard the statistics. I went through in my opening remarks about this city and the success of these resorts and how the operators have turned them into incredible places of EBITDA generation.
John Massocca : Okay. And then in terms of the competitive set, you talked a little bit about public REITs in the marketplace. Have you seen any change in either private investors in casino real estate or maybe some of the kind of not publicly traded players that are out there, given some of the moves in cost of debt capital. I mean, has that competitive set changed at all? Any color there would be helpful.
Ed Pitoniak : Yes. So I think, John, there's actually 2 interesting things going on. One is the increasing institutional interest in net lease generally. Any of you who read PERE would have seen yesterday the publication of an article as to how new names like KKR and Aries and Carlyle are coming into the net lease space. And there's obviously been other PE firms and credit firms that are focusing on net lease generally. And then within that lease, there is exactly as you're saying, or suggesting increased interest from publicly non-traded REITs and net lease-focused private equity firms on what is, we believe, one of the most compelling forms of triple net real estate there is, which is to say, gaming real estate. And I think it's important to recognize, too, that in focusing on gaming -- actually I'm losing the point there. I think the key point is yet that absolute increased interest because of both the superiority of the net lease model generally and the incredible attractiveness of gaming real estate.
John Massocca : But I guess maybe over the short term, given what we've seen interest rate moves since the beginning of the year, has that demand change at all? I understand long term, you've seen kind of institutional capital gravitate towards this. Has some of that had to fade away because, frankly, their cost of debt financing has gone up?
Ed Pitoniak : Yes. Again, I think it goes back to the answer I gave to Smedes, John, and that is the degree to which there may be a bit of a slack tide right now because, to your point, as an example, the CMBS market has tightened up quite a bit. And there is probably not quite the gold rush fever as there might have been 6 months ago, but it has not gone away because these people are sitting on an awful lot of dry powder.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass back over to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for any final remarks.
Ed Pitoniak : Thank you, operator. In closing, we thank you for your time with us this morning, especially given how busy all of you are. It is insane how much earnings reporting is going on this week in the REIT sector. With your support, VICI has become one of America's leading REITs in portfolio scale and quality and in economic magnitude. We will continue to work hard for you every day. We look forward to connecting again when we report our second quarter results. Bye for now.
Operator: Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 24, 2022. I would now hand the conference over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties' website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties described during the call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, let me just say on behalf of VICI that our hearts very much go out this morning to the people of Ukraine. Today, I want to begin the call by addressing two topics: VICI's growth and total return over our first four years, and our closing of our Venetian acquisition and what it signifies about VICI and our asset class. I'll then turn the call over to John, who will talk about our ongoing growth initiatives; and to David, who will talk about our 2021 results and our financing activities. The year we just included 2021 constituted VICI's fourth full year of operations and growth. If measured from our emergence date in October 2017, a bit more than four years ago, we've accomplished following. We have announced $29 billion of acquisitions, establishing VICI as one of the most dynamic growth platforms in American REIT management. We have raised more than $12 billion of common equity, more than any other REIT in America over that period. Pro forma for our announced acquisitions, we will have grown our portfolio NOI by more than 4x. We have lowered our leverage from 8.5x adjusted EBITDA at emergence to 3.1x at the end of 2021, and moreover, transformed the right side of our balance sheet from entirely secured to substantially unsecured debt. And by transforming the magnitude and composition of our debt, we have put ourselves, we believe, on the cusp of investment-grade ratings. We've demonstrated the resilience of our assets and of our tenants through 100% on time [Audio Dip] to date. Most importantly, for VICI's stockholders, we generated from October 18, 2017, through December 31, 2021, a total return of 100.5%. This compares to the S&P 500 total return of 100.7% over that period and a total return for the RMZ of 58.9%, meaning VICI outperformed the RMZ over that period by 41.6 percentage points. Here is a simpler way of looking at it: $1 invested into VICI at the beginning of that period became $2, $1 invested into the RMZ over the same period became $1.59. An integral part of VICI's superior total return has been VICI's dividend growth over the period, with aggregate dividend per share growth of 37.1% since our first full quarter dividend payment in Q2 2018. We're proud of the value we've created over our first four years, but here's what we're really excited about today. We just closed yesterday on the acquisition of one of the most magnificent Class A assets in American commercial real estate, The Venetian. Let me reiterate the features we cited when we announced The Venetian transaction nearly a year ago. The Venetian is the single largest hotel complex in America with nearly 7,100 rooms. The Venetian is the largest private sector meeting convention trade show facility in America. At 13 million square feet of Class A quality, finding another building in America with more marble, we have brought The Venetian at a price per square foot of approximately $300, 82 acres of land that included an estimated 62% discount replacement cost. When we announced The Venetian acquisition in early March 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still heavily and negatively impacting Las Vegas visitation and resort performance. Apollo, our new Venetian operating partner, and VICI were both mindful of that. And in a period when most potential Venetian buyers were not willing or able to come out into the heavy weather, VICI and Apollo were able to craft a transaction that protected against continuing uncertainty, but was fundamentally based in the belief that Las Vegas and moreover The Venetian would eventually return to 2019 levels of performance. What VICI and Apollo did not assume when we announced this transaction in March 2021 is that Las Vegas and The Venetian would over the ensuing 12 months stage a roaring comeback, achieving run rate profitability levels that are beyond 2019. Over the last 12 months, Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont's team at Las Vegas Sands, led by George Markantonis, have done a magnificent job of managing The Venetian. As LVS reported on January 26, The Venetian produced these eye-popping performance figures in Q4 2021, 100% occupancy of The Venetian's nearly 7,100 rooms and doing so without the full return of meeting convention trade show business. For the fourth quarter, The Venetian generated $154 million of adjusted property EBITDA and a margin of 34.5%. This amount of EBITDA annualized would mean over $600 million of run rate EBITDA before rent or nearly 2.5x coverage of our initial Venetian annual rent of $250 million. As for value, I just want to remind everyone that we have acquired The Venetian, again, one of the most magnificent and majestic Class A assets in American Commercial Real Estate at a cap rate of 6.25%, which we believe makes this one of the most compelling Class A single asset transactions in America REIT management in recent years. And if it isn't, someone you need to tell me what comped it. And here, as much work as I put into preparing these remarks, I actually – I have to quote one of you who posted last night this date, which I think says better than anything I've said, what we did in buying The Venetian, to quote simply put VICI got a pretty sweet deal. By looking past the short-term disruption in Las Vegas created by COVID, VICI was able to get one of the most iconic real estate assets in the country for a cap rate that today couldn't even buy you a well-located Dollar General. Finally, not only did we buy Venetian at a 6.25% cap rate, we have leased the Class A real estate of The Venetian to Apollo on a triple net basis with the superior economic transparency and integrity that the triple net lease model generally provides. And that highlights the final point I want to make about our first four years at VICI. Over this period, one can say that we have brought gaming real estate into the triple net lease sector. But I think what's more important is that we have brought the superiority of the triple net lease model to Class A real estate. Triple net real estate is sometimes criticized for being commodity real estate in low barrier-to-entry locations bought at a premium to replacement cost. Here is what we've done in VICI in our first four years in real estate investment terms. We've built America's biggest and best portfolio of differentiated non-commodity Class A experiential real estate in high-barrier-to-entry locations bought at substantial discounts to replacement cost. And here may be the most important portfolio attribute of all. Our real estate is occupied by, we believe, the best experiential operators in the world as evidenced by their market-leading resilience during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic and their market-leading recovery to unprecedented levels of profitability. Thanks for bearing with me while I share my excitement for what we've done at VICI. And now I'll turn the call over to John Payne, who will share our excitement over what we're doing to continue to grow VICI. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone. 2021 sure was another successful and transformative year for VICI as we announced over $21 billion of transactions, solidifying our position as the number one experiential REIT in terms of acquisition volume, significantly increasing our scale and furthering our credibility as one of America's blue-chip REITs. As Ed said, we are very happy to announce that the acquisition of Venetian Las Vegas closed yesterday. And our acquisition of MGP remains on track to close in the first half of this year. Since we announced the acquisition of The Venetian, we witnessed cap rate compression in Las Vegas seemingly in real time, with City Center trading at a 5.5% cap rate and The Cosmopolitan at a 4.97% cap. Additionally, since our announced acquisition of MGP, regional cap rates have continued to compress, with Encore Boston Harbor, a large-scale, high-quality urban assets recently trading at a cap rate in the high 5s. We have been pounding the table about the quality of gaming real estate and its superior investment characteristics relative to many real estate asset classics – classes since our formation. We believe that in many ways, the most recent trading cap rates are directly applicable to the value of the assets in our portfolio. It is gratifying to see our thesis come to fruition. And we believe there is much more to come as gaming real estate becomes a mainstream real estate asset class. Upon closing our MGP transaction, we believe we will have a portfolio of assets with quality unmatched by any other leisure real estate portfolio. Our rental streams and underlying asset cash flow durability has proven through the – has been proven through the pandemic. We have tenant relationships with industry-leading operators who utilize extensive CRM capabilities to be engaged with the consumers. And as many of you know these capabilities, combined with our tenants' operational expertise, has led to record profitability in Las Vegas and across the region. Now as we think about VICI's future growth prospects, we see a long runway for growth within gaming. Many operators continue to study and understand how VICI's capital can be utilized in their capital stack and we have regular dialogue with a number of public and private operators that continue to own their real estate. Additionally, we've started allocating capital towards other leisure verticals, which we believe will round out our investments over time. We will approach additional leisure investments in a prudent manner by studying the opportunities and market dynamics in detail and perform an appropriate diligence and risk-reward analysis prior to allocating capital on behalf of our shareholders. One of our fundamental goals as a company is to grow earnings per share accretively on behalf of our shareholders. We believe this aligns our success with the interest of our shareholders and we do not approach investments blindly in order to just satisfy investment volumes or other arbitrary measurements. To that end, I will repeat the pillars that we believe will drive accretive growth for VICI and create value for our shareholders well into the future. We will strive to execute the compelling opportunities in our embedded growth pipeline. We will study and evaluate open-market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally. We will partner with existing tenants under our property growth fund through which we will seek to fund high-return growth projects at our existing properties and we will allocate resources towards studying leisure and experiential investments as well as large-scale M&A opportunities. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and our financial results. David?
David Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2021 continued the relentless focus we have maintained over our four plus years of existence on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This disciplined focus was rewarded during 2021 by: first, the depth of the support from the equity capital markets to derisk the equity funding for our $21 billion of announced acquisitions; and second, from the culmination of one of our most important objectives since emergence, and that is to finally transform our balance sheet into an unsecured borrower. As Ed mentioned, we believe we are on the cusp of achieving an investment-grade rating. To recap, as we look back at 2021, in March, we raised $2 billion of equity through a $69 million share forward sale agreement. In September, we raised $3.4 billion of equity through a 65 million share regular way offering and a 50 million share forward sale agreement. Raising $5.4 billion of equity is not something we take for granted, and we greatly appreciate the support of our equity holders to be able to derisk the equity funding and take advantage of two unique opportunities that presented themselves during the year. The September offering, in fact, was recognized by International Financing Review, or IFR, as the North America secondary equity issue of the year. We are thankful to our underwriters led by Morgan Stanley as well as a full syndicate of banks, for the support to be able to execute the largest common equity follow-on ever by a REIT. In September, we fully repaid our $2.1 billion secured term loan. This was a critical step on our path towards investment grade. Also in September, we announced the successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of default under the existing VICI indentures. In December, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into three additional agreements with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swap transactions, so far totaling $2 billion, are intended to reduce the variability in the interest expense related to the debt we expect to incur with the closing of the MGP acquisition. In addition, subsequent to year-end, we closed on a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing our overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. The revolver maturity runs to March of 2026 before extension options with grid-based pricing. Based on the company's current credit ratings, the revolving credit facility bears interest at SOFR plus 132.5 basis points, an improvement in pricing from 200 basis points over LIBOR under our prior secured revolving credit facility. Just to recap The Venetian funding, which we closed yesterday. We settled the March and September outstanding forward sale agreements, bringing 119 million shares onto our balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We drew $600 million on our revolver with the remaining proceeds coming from cash to close the $4 billion Venetian acquisition. I also want to highlight that the settlement of the two forward sale agreements will all but eliminate the outsized short interest that VICI has been subject to. As of January 31st, we had approximately 85 million shares of short interest, which the majority was from the mechanics of the forward sale agreements. To summarize 2021 and the events at the start of 2022 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are to maintain a long-term target leverage goal of 5 to 5.5 on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis; maintain an unsecured capital structure and an unencumbered asset pool; pursue a disciplined composition and laddering of fixed rate debt, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility; opportunistically accessing the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and ultimately achieving an investment-grade rating. We have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating and we believe the actions we took during 2021 and at the start of 2022 should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permitted debt required to redeem the MGM OP units at the time of closing the MGP transactions, all while continuing to maintain ample liquidity, flexibility and optionality to grow accretively. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $278.9 million, or $0.44 per share, bringing full year 2021 AFFO to $1.0474 billion, or $1.82 per share. Total AFFO in 2021 increased 25.3% year-over-year while AFFO per share increased approximately 11% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count and resulting temporary dilution from the March and September forward equity offerings. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 12.9% primarily as the result of the settlements of the June 2020 forward sale agreement in September of 2021, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet in the regular way portion of the September offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to repay the $2.1 billion secured term loan in September. We refer you to our press release where we've added two tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 5 of our release that was posted to our website last night. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenue was only 2.4%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Finally, I want to touch on our leverage. We ended 2021 with net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.1x and pro forma for The Venetian closing, our net debt-to-EBITDA is 3x. This highlights the fact that we have significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt required to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As I touch on guidance, this will be important. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions, specifically the pending acquisition of MGP or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As we have discussed, we record a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which is due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed Venetian acquisition and the settlement of the 119 million shares that were subject to the March and September forward sale agreements. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022, will be between $1.317 billion and $1.347 billion or between $1.80 and $1.84 per diluted share. The midpoint of our total AFFO guidance on an absolute dollars represents an increase of 27.2% versus our 2021 actual AFFO. On a per share basis, guidance reflects all of the equity raise to close the transactions we announced in 2021. And thus, the corresponding increase in VICI's share count without the benefit of the corresponding income from the pending MGP transaction. Accordingly, we expect to update guidance in the future to reflect the impact of the MGP transaction when we are in a position to do so. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Of course, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from RJ Milligan with Raymond James. RJ, your line is now open.
RJ Milligan: Good morning guys. I wanted to maybe ask a bigger picture question, Ed. What do you think of Realty Income's entry in the gaming asset class? What does that mean for VICI? Obviously, adds more competition. But you have a new operator embracing the sale-leaseback model. Pricing sort of implies that your stock is undervalued, but maybe lower cap rates hurt spread in the future. How do you think about those different puts and takes?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. RJ, always good to chat with you. Net-net, it is unalloyed positive to have an institution of the quality and stature of Realty Income come in and validate our category. Realty Income goes back to 1969. They've built an amazing company. Samit has obviously continued to drive excellence at that company and drive very judicious allocation of capital, both categorically and geographically. So we've been saying, as John spoke of in his remarks, RJ, we've been saying since the beginning that this is an asset class that we believe is the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Well, institutionalization does not happen if institutions don't come into the category. And the more institutions to come into the category, the further institutionalized it is. There are puts and takes. You're absolutely right. When there's more competition, we have to work hard every single day to make sure that our cost of capital over the longer term, leaving aside the volatility we face in this current situation like this, but over time, we're improving the cost of capital on both an absolute and/or a relative basis at a velocity equal to the rate of cap rate compression. So again, net-net, we see it as very positive. And I think in this case, especially validating of regional assets, with the MGP transaction, we will be become the owners, the very proud owners of assets like National Harbor right on the Potomac River in D.C. We will become owners of the Borgata, of MGM Detroit, of Beau Rivage. These are assets that are absolutely in the same class as Encore Boston. And as John also alluded to in his remarks, if you look through the cap rate of Wynn Boston and what we are acquiring in MGP in terms of preeminent regional assets, we're obviously very happy with the revaluation that we believe our shareholders deserve.
RJ Milligan: Thanks for those comments. And then my second question is just, can you be a little bit more specific on the expected timing of the closing of the MGP transaction? And then maybe, David, what you're seeing out there in the debt markets and expected pricing for the debt that's going to be issued?
Ed Pitoniak: Samantha, you want to take timing and then David can talk financing?
Samantha Gallagher: Sure. Just on timing, I'll just mention that we do continue to work through the process with all the applicable jurisdictions and [indiscernible].
David Kieske: Thanks. RJ, as it relates to the debt markets, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've built a $2 billion hedge portfolio to start to minimize the volatility that we're witnessing, obviously, real time today. One of the aspects – a couple of the aspects that we have going forward is when we underwrote The Venetian as well as MGP, we underwrote that in the high-yield markets. And with the work that our team has done with the agencies and as we mentioned in our remarks, we feel very confident that we'll be issuing debt into the investment-grade market when we can do so and once we're positioned through regulatory approval, which Samantha just alluded to. So our underwriting remains in line with what we underwrote originally even with the uptick in rates. And obviously, today is a unique day with the volatility going out on in the markets. But for 10-year pricing, we're getting quotes in the high-100, low-200 over treasury for 10-year paper. So on a blended basis, we still feel good about our overall accretion and everything that we laid out for you back in August of last year.
RJ Milligan: Thanks a lot.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you RJ.
Operator: Thank you RJ. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Wes, your line is now open.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. Could you talk about your appetite to buy more assets while MGP is still pending and you currently have a little bit higher cost of capital? I believe Caesars mentioned on their call that we were going to be looking to sell an asset over the near term.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll take the last part of that, and I'll turn it over to John in terms of our ongoing energy around growth activities. Yes, you did see Tom Reeg announced last week his intentions to bring an asset to market. And obviously, we will take full advantage of the opportunity we have to get that very full first look and to see what possible advantages the addition of another asset could have and the addition of other relationships. But I just want to emphasize the fact that given obviously, not only the volatility in the market, but what are the hallmarked practices of great capital allocators, as a good real estate capital allocator, you never want the answer to the question of why did you buy that to be, well, it was for sale, right? I want to focus on somebody who had a great adage, which is, spent every dollar of capital like it's the last one you have." So whatever the opportunities may be, we will only allocate capital if we feel versus our other alternatives, it is the best use of capital at a given time. And then in terms of our ongoing growth activities, I'll turn it over to John.
John Payne: Yes. Good morning, Wes. As you know, these deals don't happen over the first month. So we're very active, continuing to talk to the operators on the gaming side as we had since we started the company. And we're spending, as I said in my remarks, quite a bit of time in what we call the hospitality or experiential space, sitting down with C-suite executives of certain companies in certain industries explaining how our capital could help them grow and we could be partners over time. So we're very active. And as Ed said, we'll be very prudent in the way that we put out our capital.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then there is a strong bid for the regional assets. Would you entertain recycling assets, selling some assets if they're sees opportunity was something you like? Or would you look to lean in a little bit of leverage, maybe go over your, I guess, I think you mentioned, Dave, at 5.5% on the high end is where you want leverage. Would you be willing to take leverage a little higher than that? I guess how would you fund it if you were to find something?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Wes, I mean, we're going to look at alternatives that are in front of us. As it relates to recycling assets, I mean, that's not – we have recycled an asset in Atlantic City, asset in Reno, we just in our release, we sold Louisiana Downs. So potentially, there could be that opportunity. There could be potential JV opportunities. You've obviously seen MGP joint venture, some assets in the past. And then the attractiveness of a REIT and the ability to issue OP units that we are doing directly to MGM, GLPI is doing that to Cordis. So there's other avenues of equity. As it relates to taking leverage up, we're pretty disciplined with our dialogue with the agencies of our goal. We've gotten a path to take leverage up to six times. When you take leverage up and that's just financial engineering to drive accretion, and that's something that we strive to do. So we'll stay within our guidepost. But I think there's other tools in the toolbox that we can bring to the table to, as John said, pursue opportunities that we're in dialogue with.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks everyone for the time.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks Wes.
Operator: Thank you Wes. Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotia Bank. Greg, your line is now open.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. So just curious, it sounds like Realty Income was able to get kind of Boston Encore deal without any competing offers. So had you previously tried to acquire this asset? And any thoughts as to why Wynn did not run a bid process on that location? And I guess do you think you would have been competitive at the 5.9% cap with no CapEx minimums?
Ed Pitoniak: I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Greg. But you absolutely would have to ask Wynn why they did not run a process. Sumit Roy in Realty Income's earnings call yesterday, as you are implicitly referring to, clearly stated there was no process. And again, you're going to have to ask Wynn why did you not run a process. And above and beyond that, I don't know how much more we can or should say about the asset, given that we were not part of the process. But John, I'll hand it over to you to see what you might want to say.
John Payne: I think we've already said it. Look, it's a great validation of the value of our real estate, right? I mean if you take National Harbor, there's an asset as good a quality, I'd even say it's better quality, right? And so the cap rate that's put on that asset really just the validation of what we've been talking about for four-years when we started this company.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And I guess just two follow-ups on kind of potential investments. So thinking about the partner property growth fund, how are you guys viewing the likelihood of those transactions occurring? Or maybe the potential to reach the $1 billion and separately $1.5 billion max amounts?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Well, we're having active conversations with all our tenants about opportunities where they can use our capital to grow, we can gain incremental rent over time. I'm not a big guy who tells you, predicts what exactly we're going to do. But what I can tell you is this fund has been well received by our tenants. And I think there are some large projects, growth projects in the future that I believe will be a part of with our tenants. And it will be exciting to be – exciting to help them grow and be excited to help us grow.
Ed Pitoniak: Greg, I would just add in regard to our property – partner property growth fund is that when the projects achieve the needed return hurdle and of course, our investments will be contingent upon them, clearly demonstrating that they can achieve that hurdle, we are in extremely attractive source of capital for our partners based on the cost of our capital. Because when the given investments can achieve the necessary hurdles, the cost of our capital should not be compared only to the cost of the debt capital of our partners. It really, given that we can, in many cases, alleviate them, the need for them to put in any incremental equity, the cost of our capital should be compared not again to the cost of their debt capital, but to their weighted average cost of capital, inclusive of both equity and debt. And on that basis, we become, again, a very compelling source of low-cost capital.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. I guess just the final piece of the pipeline. So you got this potential ROFR, which you guys said you'll be evaluating this whether or not that's within the portfolio. But also the [indiscernible] the Indiana, Caesars asset you can potentially call this year. Can you just remind us how the pricing is determined there and whether the ease investment is part impact your desire to get something done in the near-term?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I'll let David talk a little bit about the structure. I'll talk about the assets. First of all, they're just great assets. They're big. They're growing. As you touched on, Caesars just rebranded the asset, one of the assets in Indianapolis to a horseshoe. They're investing large chunks of capital into both of the businesses there as table games was legalized at these casinos. And so these assets have not only grown under the Caesars' leadership, they will continue to grow as these assets get the capital and then stabilize. So we're continuing to watch it. We think these are going to be great additions to our portfolio. And then David can tell you a little bit how the deal was structured and how it would enter into our master lease. David?
David Kieske: Sure. Thanks, John. as you referenced, that put call started January 1 of this year. It runs to December 31, 2024. We can call those two assets at a 7.7% cap, or Tom and team can put them to us at an 8% cap. It's an LTM coverage ratio that was set at 1.3 times. Part of the reason we agreed to that within the broader funding of Eldorado acquisition at Caesars is that those assets will go into the regional master lease. And those are two very attractive assets, as John alluded to, and something that we'll assess how we sequence that into our growth and the cadence that we have internally with everything else going on over the period of time. But just given where cap rates have gone, we're very excited to potentially own those assets at some point here.
Ed Pitoniak: Let me just add in regard to the 1.3 coverage, as David spoke about, these will go into the regional master lease. But we got comfortable when Tom Reeg closed that coverage level to us a few years ago based upon our confidence that the new Caesars under Tom's leadership would achieve corporate profitability levels that give us very strong corporate rent coverage, making us comfortable with the 1.3. Well, needless to say, Tom's team have greatly exceeded our expectations in terms of the corporate profitability there and will achieve at Caesars. And thus, again, to re-stress the point, why in this case at the asset level we were willing to take on that asset level coverage given what is proving to be rather magnificent corporate level rent coverage, which is part of a corporate rent guarantee.
John Payne: And I just want to add one thing to what David said that I don't want to make sure it's lost. We have the right to call this at a 7.7% cap. And there was a transaction that just happened in the regional markets for a 5.9% cap.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Greg. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. Barry, your line is now open.
Barry Jonas: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. You guys obviously have and will have the largest portfolio in gaming right now. I'm curious if there are any geographies or segments of the market you're less inclined to expand on at this point?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I'll take that, Barry. I'll answer it more in there's areas of opportunity where we'd like to own real estate. If you think of the Las Vegas market, which I know, Barry, you follow closely, you look at the regional performers there, how well they've performed during before the pandemic and after the pandemic or as they were coming out of the pandemic. We don't own any real estate in Downtown Las Vegas. If you see how Circa has changed that market and the way people think about that market, Tillman and his team have done a great job there for years. So if there's an opportunity on real estate in the Downtown Las Vegas market, which is a big market. We don't own assets in Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island. We don't have Pittsburgh, like Charles, others. So there's still quite a few gaming markets that we don't own assets. And as we talked earlier, we've got a ROFRs here on another Las Vegas asset. So many opportunities for us. Haven't had opportunities where I'm saying I wouldn't go into, but I'm sure there's a few we feel like we've got enough real estate. But I really want to answer that where we see that there's continued opportunity.
Barry Jonas: That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, given the current macro environment we're seeing, I'm curious if that's impacted the timing or pace of any M&A discussions you may be having?
Ed Pitoniak: Barry, it's been a pretty wild four-years, right? I wouldn't bother naming the ball. But we had the interest rate kind of crack up of spring of 2018. We had December of 2018 which none of us hope we have to look through again anytime soon. We've obviously had March 2020. We have obviously learned to live and deal with volatility at VICI. And I think if taken one key lesson, it's that don't stop developing relationships in times of volatility because times of volatility will eventually come to an end. So to be honest with you, we just shut out the noise and we keep doing what we're doing. We obviously can't be heedless by any means of our cost of capital at any given time and have to take care to make sure we know where the money is going to come from and what the money is going to cost us. But again, I just want to re-emphasize the point that periods of volatility cannot be periods of dormancy in terms of our fundamental activity every single day, which is working to develop relationships, it will ultimately turn into deal flow.
Barry Jonas: That’s great. Thanks Ed. Thanks guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Barry.
Operator: Thank you, Barry. Our next question comes from Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets. Daniel, your line is now open.
Daniel Adam: Hi. Thank you and good morning everyone. Just to follow up on Realty Income’s deal for Encore Boston. I'm curious whether you guys think this sub 6% cap rate marks a turning point or call it new normal, if you will, for regional asset valuations in general or whether you see that as more of a one-off just given the quality and location of Encore?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Daniel, always good to hear from you. I may have mentioned this on prior earnings calls, but one of the things I am struck by within gaming, generally in gaming real estate specifically, is we have not yet come up with a widely accepted hierarchy of quality classification, right? As many of you know, I used to work in the hotel sector, where there's a clearly accepted – well, there's a few clearly accepted hierarchies of quality, whether it's based on Star five, four, three, two so on and so forth, or whether it's luxury, upper upscale and so on and so forth. Well, that categorization does not yet exist in games. Really doesn't exist so much on the strip. And it definitely doesn't exist in regional. So if you were to try to impose a hierarchy of quality on regional gaming, there is a highest level of regional gaming asset quality that would include assets like Encore Boston, National Harbor, MGM Detroit Borgata, Beau Rivage, Caesars New Orleans, especially after the Caesars team puts in the capital that they're about to spend, Harrah's Atlantic City. There is this higher tier of assets, and Encore Boston has set a new benchmark cap rate for the highest tier regional assets. And usually, when the top category in an asset class establishes a new benchmark in terms of lower cap rates, there can and usually is a slip stream effect on the lower quality – lower categories of quality. So I guess maybe your implicit question, does Encore Boston create a slip stream not only for the highest end regional properties, which we will be the market leader in owning, but will it also create a upstream for other regional assets? And we believe it would because again, you look at the resiliency through COVID. If you look at the indispensability of the asset to the operator, you look at the barriers to entry, if you look at all of the classic real estate valuation metrics and frameworks, you have to concede these are really good assets, and they are woefully underpriced.
Daniel Adam: That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned evaluating deals outside of the U.S. Are there any markets in particular that you're focused on internationally?
Ed Pitoniak: David, do you want to take that?
David Kieske: Sure. Dan, nice to talk to you. I mean as we look outside the U.S., we look most simplistically what's readable and what is a good rule logo, obviously, good real estate, but good tax jurisdictions and things jurisdictions like Canada, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Europe, UK. Less – maybe less so gaming in the Europe, UK, just given the nature of the "boxes." But we talked about realty income here a lot going into gaming. They've obviously gone into Spain and Europe and other jurisdictions. You've seen other REITs like Simon go abroad. So there are opportunities that we're looking at and assessing across the globe. And as we continue to grow, we've got the infrastructure and the expertise to do so. And we look to continue to develop those opportunities and ultimately bring those sorts of opportunities into our portfolio over time.
Daniel Adam: Okay. Great. Thanks so much guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Daniel.
Operator: Thanks Daniel. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes, your line is now open.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Ed, I wanted to come back to your opening comments and you spent some time talking about the last four years since emerging as a new public entity and the successes that you've had and the total return and the dividend growth, which has all been pretty strong. I wanted to get your sense of how you think about issuing equity in the future, just in the sense that if you were to break down the different periods of time in your total return, there clearly has been a little bit more of a lackluster performance since last summer, I think, driven in part by the overhangs that you've created with the equity issuances, but also the commitments that you have going forward and the fact that leverage levels are towards the higher end of where you want it to be. And then you look at the valuation of the company today relative to right before the pandemic, and it's actually widened relative to REITs as REITs have done a little bit better from that time frame point to point even though you've talked about all the positives that have occurred since pre-pandemic, including the fact that all your tenants pay rent, which no one thought going into any type of recession would have happened. So I want you to sort of step back and think about it more so over the recent time frame in terms of the performance and how you believe you're going to be able to drive outperformance from this point forward and how the sort of equity issuance ties into that.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Michael, it is a profound and extremely important question. It is one David and I especially have been wrestling with really going back to last fall, soon after we raised the equity for MGP, which we did use yesterday for The Venetian, but that's all because of the fungibility of cash. Yes, it's a profound question. And I would say that our strategy going forward, having done the transformative deals we've done, Venetian to a degree, but especially MGP is that having achieved the scale we've achieved, having in place some of the built-in growth elements that we do have, we really want to begin to develop more of a flow model. We want gaming and nongaming to achieve the cadence of deal flow that is both more sustained, simple. And accordingly, we want our fundraising activities to be, frankly, less gargantuan. You are absolutely right. It's been a slog since, well, especially since late summer. We actually won in late summer was pretty much the week of Labor Day, things will earn and then that happened to be we raised the equity for MGP. And we're glad we did it when we did Michael, and we do thank the Citi team for their help in doing so. And we realized that, that sheer amount of equity, $5.5 billion in 2021 did have a weighty effect on the performance of our stock. And we really appreciate the patience of our shareholders. We were very pleased to see the [indiscernible] how steady our core shareholders remain through the turbulence of Q4. And we're hopeful that, that is still prove to be the case here in Q1. Going forward, we do want to create a business model that is sustained and sustainable and lessens on these kinds of gargantuan equity raises. I hope that gets to the core of the question you were asking.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. And I think taking a step further. It still feels as though there is some level of overhang on the shares. Given all the positives and the accretive nature of the transactions that you've done, right, estimates have been moving up, yet the multiple has been contracting. And so I think that there's certainly amount of nervousness about a next gargantuan raise a, to finally deal with the funding of closing MGP, but also these other types of transactions, whether they be the ROFR. And I think that there's just this tension in the marketplace. And so that's where I was trying to get at is where your heads at now in terms of eliminating this overhang that appears to be on your shares? And maybe you need another potential to raise before you get into this more normal pace, and that's what I'm just trying to I don't know where your heads at in terms of financing this level of growth given this commitment to get to investment-grade as well.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. So just to be clear, we do not need to raise any further equity for MGP. We have raised all the equity we need. We will be raising only debt. We will obviously have a share exchange on a fixed exchange ratio with the MGP shareholders, including MGM. So there's no equity further needs for MGP. And when it comes to a ROFR or any other opportunity, again, just to re-emphasize the point, we're very mindful of the fact that we need to consider every possible way of funding such opportunities if and only if they're compellingly accretive for our shareholders. And it will be our bias to not have to raise our grants to an amount of equity because we're very conscious of the fact that we need to give our shareholders understood broadly a chance to realize that revaluation that they deserve, and it will be easier to achieve if we do not go out into the market and raise a little ton of equity to use the technical term.
Michael Bilerman: So are you having those discussions today in terms of joint ventures or selling incremental land parcels or assets outright to put yourself in a funding position so that when a pitch comes down, you're already been funded, getting to this point where you almost go below your target leverage levels and sort of eliminate that as an overhang?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. We are looking at all those things. And maybe I'll just turn it over to David quickly, and he can talk about the way in which we are going to very strategically use the amount of retained cash that we will be building up given our payout ratio, David?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ed and Michael, always good to talk to you. I mean even just taking a step back when we went into the MGP transaction in June, July, August, we assessed all options around how do navigate what is ultimately a significant capital raise, I mean, $3.4 billion of equity. And that's something we took lightly and something that we had a lot of other levers that we could have potentially pulled, and we were able to obviously execute that with everybody's help. But as we closed MGP here, and Samantha said the first half of the year and then is moving along very well, you get to kind of a run rate of roughly $2 billion of AFFO – feedback, take 75% of that out for dividends, you've got roughly $500 million of free cash flow. And that is true free cash flow. As you know, we have no CapEx. We have our G&A is our G&A. There's not a lot of other items that need to come out of that free cash flow. So if you lever that 2:1, that's $1 billion of buying power that we have internally to continue to deliver the growth that we've delivered since day one.
Michael Bilerman: Great. And then just second topic just in terms of Encore and the Wynn. How do you it obviously was a negotiated transaction between Wynn and Realty Income? I think when you look in to Wynn's peak, you obviously hear the desire of them to have negotiated items that were very important to their enterprise. And obviously, Realty Income had to get what they want to get out of it. As you think about these leases, obviously, the Encore didn't have a CapEx requirement. It had bumps that were below 2% for the first 10 years. How do you think about the structure of that transaction, put aside the pricing because you've made your comments that you thought it validated and was rich from that perspective, setting a new mark for these regional assets. But how do you think about the individual key terms? And what are the critical factors for you as you continue to grow in gaming real estate?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Michael, I think Realty Income and VICI are fairly different companies running different kinds of rent roles, running different kinds of risks. I think I saw in Samit's [ph] remarks that their weighted average lease term at this point is 14 years. Ours is 43.5 years. So given that delta in just, for example, weighted average lease terms, things that report to us like the magnitude of rent escalation, like the magnitude of CapEx, maybe more important to us than to Samit were Wynn will represent – I think Encore will represent 3% of its rent rule. I think we both have different levers. We both have – we both run different profiles. So what would be really important to us, maybe it's not important to him.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. And that's what I was just trying to get at, whether you're sort of non-negotiables in terms of when you go into these, what you're willing to accept and what you're not? It sounds like the CapEx side and a certain sort of growth rate given the longer lease duration are important variables for you. Is there anything else? Obviously, corporate coverage here was north of 2x, and that should grow given the performance of the asset. Just what are the other variables that are critical for you as you continue to embark down this road?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, obviously one right now that's very, very critical is some measure of CPI protection. And correct me if I'm wrong, but once we achieve CPI protection in our MGM lease, and Danny step in Europe of getting this call, 90% will have BPI protection built into it. And needless to say, we've always thought that to be important, Michael. But it feels really much more important right now than it did 1 year or two ago. I'm sorry, Michael, that broke up.
Michael Bilerman: You said you had a cap on that though, don't you? There's a limit to that inflation protection?
Ed Pitoniak: We do in some leases. We don't in others. The Caesars leases are uncapped, which is why we posted a 5.0-odd percent rent increase on November 1 out of the Caesars Las Vegas lease.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. All right. Thanks guys. See you in a week half.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes indeed. Looking forward to it. Operator, we will take one more question.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Todd, your line is now open.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Yes. Hi. Good morning. I appreciate the comments around the timing of the closing, being on track for the first half of the year with regards to MGP. But what are the primary hurdles to closing that remain? And then David, your understanding of the timing to achieve an investment-grade rating, what's the time line look there?
Ed Pitoniak: David, why don't you start with the time line and maybe Samantha step in with further process on MGP? David?
David Kieske: Yes, happy to. Good to talk to you, Todd. Look, we're in regular dialogue with the agencies. We started talking to them end of June, July of last year. And if it's not every other day, it's weekly or biweekly that we connect with the agencies to give them updates along the way. We updated them on the revolving credit facility. We updated them on the closing of the – or the consent solicitation of the shareholder votes. We've updated them on the closing of The Venetian yesterday. And they are waiting on final approvals, which Samantha can talk about. But they want a little bit of certainty that it's going to close. And we have no concerns that it will close, but the agencies just want to kind of be having a little bit more clarity around that. So it's a little bit of a chicken and the egg. But the body language of signals and everything that we've gotten is that it's all moving towards that date. The issue is none of us really know what that date is. And so with that, Samantha, I'll turn it over to you.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Thanks, David. I think just as we get into hurdles, not surprisingly, we won't speak about individual processes with the applicable jurisdictions. But we do continue to work through all jurisdictions. And again, I just want to reiterate that we remain confident in the first half closing.
David Kieske: Okay. Sorry, just to make it a little bit more clear. I mean we do believe that once we get the approvals finalized, the agencies will be in a position to act quickly. And then once we go to the debt markets after that approval, we will be launching with the upgraded rating.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Got it. And then regarding the future capital raising initiatives, the $4.4 billion of permanent debt that you expect to raise, can you just remind us we're you expect to be on leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis pro forma the closing? And also to the extent that – sorry, but just also to the extent that a Caesars asset or something else does present itself in the near term, do you have capacity to execute on something ahead of obtaining an investment-grade rating and closing MGP? Or should we assume that until that transaction closes, that there will not be any potential investment activity?
David Kieske: Let's start with the pro forma leverage for The Venetian and for the MGP transaction. That will be – on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, our run rate is 5.8x net debt to EBITDA. And that's inside of the 6x. Specifically, S&P has targeted. That would give them confidence in upgrading us. As it relates to the funding or timing around a potential ROFR or other opportunities, I mean, that goes back to the dialogue that we've been having around. We will assess every option if the opportunity transaction that we're underwriting makes sense and is accretive for our shareholders. So it's not an either/or. And we've got the team and the capability to do potentially do both.
Todd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I will now pass the conference back over to Edward Pitoniak of VICI. Ed?
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Amber. And in closing, we want to thank all of you for your engagement with us this morning. As you can tell, we're very excited about our present situation, our near-term opportunities and our long-term prospects. And we look forward to chatting with you again when we report our first quarter results. Thank you, everyone. Bye for now.
Operator: That concludes VICI Properties quarter one [ph] 2021 conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2021.  I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our third quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information.  Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2021 was the most active and transformational quarter in our 4-year history at VICI. The highlight of our quarter of our year-to-date, of our history to date was our announcement on August 4 of our acquisition of MGP's market-leading assets and our new long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, who're one of the foremost leisure, hospitality entertainment companies in the world. Together with our March 3rd announcement of our Venetian acquisition, 2021 has been a step change year for VICI. So far in 2021, we've signed over $21 billion of transaction activity, giving us nearly $30 billion of acquisition activity in our first 4 years. And to fund that growth we have over the last 4 years, raised more primary common equity proceeds than any other REIT in America. We have a strong conviction that our energetic and execution-driven strategy over our first 4 years will, over the long term, create significant value for our equity and credit owners. We believe that there are 3 key factors that drive and validate our strategy. Factor 1, invest before others do. As an asset class institutionalizes, investing earlier rather than later, generally will yield opportunities to buy institutional quality assets at pre-institutional pricing. While other investors have begun initiating their mapping of the gaming real estate investment landscape, VICI and I should note, Blackstone have been busy buying great assets at unlevered going-in cash flow yields that are superior in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms than can be found in already institutionalized asset classes. This isn't to say that there aren't compelling investment opportunities still to be had in American gaming real estate. There definitely are as the sector's real estate is still not yet even 40% owned by REITs. But while others are getting starting on their homework, VICI has built market-leading proprietary ownership positions along with one of the most economically productive streets in America, the Las Vegas Strip. And VICI will also have built the largest and by far the highest quality regional portfolio in American gaming real estate once we close our MGP acquisition.  Factor 2, invest when others are fearful or uncertain. We began our 2021 acquisition work in late 2020 when most real estate investors were still understandably unsure about leaving the harbor and going out on to the blue water to fish. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was stormy in late 2020 and stayed stormy well into 2021. But at VICI we're willing to venture out onto the blue water because of our conviction that COVID have proven the durability of our asset class and the market-leading resilience of our operating partners. We've announced over $21 billion of acquisition activity in 2021 because of that conviction and in doing so, preempted any risk of being incomparable Venetian and the best-in-class MGP portfolio being bid to the skies when everybody was finally ready to come out onto the blue water with us. Factor 3, invest alongside great partners when given the chance. Many investors understandably questioned VICI's strategy when in late 2019 we announced our intention to support Eldorado's acquisition of Caesars with what ultimately became $3.6 billion of VICI Capital. We were constantly asked throughout 2019 and well into 2020. Can the Eldorado guys really achieve that $500 million of synergies, can they manage so much bigger an organization? Can they produce sufficient free cash flow and rent coverage? Will they have access to capital? Well, when we put our money behind Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Carano and the rest of the Caesars team, we are very confident that they would deliver, and you all know by now, without question, as they appear to have delivered far beyond everyone's expectations.  Similarly, when earlier this year, we began competing for the MGP portfolio, our determination to win was greatly energized by our conviction that Bill Hornbuckle, Jonathan Halkyard, Corey Sanders and the MGM team are growing MGM into one of the most dynamic and innovative brand and operating platforms in the global consumer discretionary sector. Our nearly $30 billion of announced investments over our first 4 years have enabled us to partner with great operators across the U.S., not only MGM and Caesars, but also with Apollo on the Venetian, with Hard Rock, Penn, JACK, Century, The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and ClubCorp. All our current operators, every one of them is delivering top life performance in global leisure and hospitality right now. And the secular outlook for our gaming partners, if you're brighter, than one can find in almost any other category because of the audience expansion tailwind that sports betting represents. To repeat these 3 key factors that have driven our strategy in our actions, factor 1, grow fast in the early stages of institutionalization; factor 2, grow and others are uncertain, under willing or underfunded; factor 3, grow with great partners. VICI's activity in our first 4 years, driven by these 3 key growth factors distilled down to this. Before other institutional real estate investors are ready to do so, we've built a portfolio of Class A real estate of incomparable scale and quality and significant discounts to replacement cost and significant discounts to other institutional real estate categories of similar asset and income quality. And in doing so, we've created a network and partner relationships that will be a key source of growth for us for many years to come.  Now to talk about our growth outlook, I'll turn the call over to John Payne. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter of 2021, we continue to execute the market-leading growth many of you have come to expect from VICI. The announcement of our $17.2 billion acquisition of MGM Growth Properties brings our total investment, as Ed said, to nearly $30 billion in 48 months. As I'm sure many of you can appreciate, this degree of activity does not come without hard work, dedication and relentless desire to succeed. As a management team, we are incredibly thankful for the hard work of our exceptional colleagues at what we call Team VICI, without whom many of our accomplishments to date would not be possible. As I've said before, VICI does not go on vacation or wait for the phone to ring after announcing or closing a transaction. Our primary day-to-day operations consist of sourcing, underwriting and funding accretive acquisitions. To that end, we are as busy as we've ever been building our pipeline and meeting with talented business owners and management teams to discuss how VICI can be an efficient source of capital and play a role in funding their growth plan. As we look forward, we will strive to execute across the many growth pillars we believe will make VICI as a stronger company while driving accretive AFFO per share growth for shareholders. Those growth pillars include executing transactions within our embedded growth pipeline, open market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally, our property growth fund through which we will fund high-return growth projects at our properties for existing tenant partners and leisure and experiential investments as well as continued large-scale M&A. There's never been a more exciting time to be investing across the gaming universe and Las Vegas in particular. Operationally, fundamentals are strong, and the casino operators continue to have a robust outlook for their properties. Margin expansion remains sticky, and the industry continues to post very impressive financial results. For example, some of you on this call may have noticed that just last week, Las Vegas Sands reported a record third quarter at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, with adjusted property EBITDA of $132 million, 97% hotel occupancy in the quarter and robust forward group bookings from 2022 through 2027. All of these results occurred in the third quarter that had very limited convention and meeting business and almost no international travel. Since we've announced the acquisition of Venetian Real Estate for a 6.25% cap rate, we have witnessed cap rate compression firsthand on the Las Vegas Strip. First, with the real estate of ARIA and VDARA, and City Center trading for a 5.5% cap rate; and most recently, just about a month ago with the Cosmopolitan’s real estate trading just under a 5% cap rate or a 20.1x rent multiple. We have been among the biggest and the most vocal believers in Las Vegas since we started VICI and it's very gratifying to witness institutional capital enter the sector. VICI will continue to be at the forefront of gaming real estate, investing in assets in markets where we believe institutionalization is poised to occur.  In closing, we believe the outlook for growth is very promising and the transformation of our balance sheet, which David will touch on, positions us for continued success as we approach an investment-grade credit rating. And upon closing of our pending acquisition transactions, we’ll emerge with a pro forma enterprise value that is approximately $45 billion, which is significantly larger than most of our direct REIT competitors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and additional investments outside of gaming. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet and highlight what was our most significant quarter in terms of advancing our long-term strategic financial goals. As you've heard me say, since emergence, we have maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. The initiatives we undertook in connection with the MGP acquisition further strengthened our capital structure and position VICI for continued year-in, year-out growth. And in connection with the announcement of the MGP transaction on August 4, we received extremely positive feedback from the rating agencies and just to read a snippet from the report that S&P released. The acquisition will improve VICI's scale and tenant diversity such that it could support a greater level of leverage at a higher rating if the company finances the acquisition with a mix of equity and debt that leads to pro forma leverage of about 6x or below and we could raise our rating to BBB minus. That's great news, and I will touch on leverage in a moment. On September 14, we completed the largest REIT common only equity offering ever, issuing 115 million shares of common stock at an offering price of $29.50 for aggregate proceeds of $3.4 billion. 65 million shares were sold via regular offering, raising $1.9 billion and 50 million shares are subject to forward sale agreements. This offering derisks the equity funding for the MGP transaction and positions the balance sheet to be below the leverage ratios dictated by the rating agencies to migrate the balance sheet to an investment-grade issuer. On September 15, we were thrilled to eliminate all outstanding secured debt in our current capital stack with a repayment of the secured $2.1 billion term loan. We used $526.9 million of proceeds from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement on September 9 as well as a portion of the proceeds from the September equity offering to repay the term loan. In connection with this pay off, we also settled the outstanding interest rate swaps, incurring breakage costs of $64.2 million. This one-time amount is reflected in interest expense for the quarter, reducing net income and FFO but is added back to arrive at AFFO. On September 27, we announced a successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of defaults under the VICI indentures.  Our outstanding total debt at quarter end was $4.8 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.3 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. And as of September 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was 3.1x. We currently have approximately $4.9 billion in liquidity, comprised of $669.5 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. In addition, we have approximately $1.9 billion in net proceeds available from the March 2021 forward sale agreements and approximately $1.4 billion in net proceeds from the September 2021 forward sale agreements, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition. And since our formation just a little over 4 years ago, we have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating, and we believe the actions we took during the quarter should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permanent debt required to redeem the MGM Op units at the time of the closing of the MGP transaction. Now turning to the quarter. We once again, continue to expand our partnerships outside of gaming by announcing a strategic arrangement with ClubCorp, an Apollo portfolio company related to Big Shot Golf. On September 15, we agreed to provide up to $80 million of mortgage financing to fund the development of 5 Big Shot Golf facilities across the U.S. As part of the arrangement, VICI will have a call right to acquire the real estate assets associated with any Big Shot Golf facility financed by VICI in a sale leaseback. In addition, we have a ROFO on future debt financing, Big Shot Golf -- and future financing Big Shot Golf seeks for any multistate development of their extensive pipeline of facilities.  Over the past 2 quarters, we have announced strategic with leading leisure and hospitality operators and we believe our relationships with Apollo and Blackstone demonstrate our ability to forge mutually beneficial partnerships that enhance our diversification and growth prospects. We're thrilled to partner with Big Shots and expand our relationship with Apollo and continue to look forward to a great partnership with Blackstone and the team at Great Wolf Resorts. In terms of financial results, net income and FFO was $161.9 million for the quarter or $0.28 per share compared to $398.3 million or $0.74 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to a $333.4 million one-time noncash gain upon lease modification that occurred in the third quarter of '20, a $79.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt and interest rate swap terminations in the current quarter and the $168 million noncash decrease in the Q3 '20 versus the Q3 '21 change in the CECL allowance. AFFO was $257.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.9% over Q3 of 2020. And just as a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time the forward sale agreements are in place. During the third quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 15.7 million shares. We refer you to our press release where we have added 2 tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 6 of our release that was posted to our website last night. In terms of our dividend, on August 4, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which is a 9.1% increase compared to the Q2 dividend. The Q3 dividend was paid on October 7 to stockholders of record as of September 24.  And finally, we are updating our AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we have discussed, beginning in January of 2020, we are required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.40 billion and $1.45 billion, representing an increase of $20 million in total AFFO from the prior guidance midpoint. Our revised 2021 full year AFFO per share guidance is $1.79 to $1.80 per diluted share, which is approximately $0.05 below the midpoint of prior guidance on a per share basis and is below the current consensus of $1.83 per share, which reflects certain analyst assumptions on the timing -- around the timing and closing and funding of the Venetian transaction, which are not included in our guidance estimates. The reduction in guidance reflects the dilutive effect of the addition of 26.9 million shares from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement and the 65 million shares issued in the September 2021 equity offering and a dilutive impact as calculated under the treasury stock method of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreements and the pending 50 million shares related to the September 2021 forward sale agreements. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from Baird.
Wesley Golladay: Can you talk about what caused the pushout of the Venetian from, I guess, closing later this year -- or later this year until 1Q '22?
Edward Pitoniak: Samantha, you want to take that?
Samantha Gallagher: Yes. Hi. As you know, there's regulatory approvals that are required for the operator in connection with that transaction. So the operator, Apollo here is just going through the regulatory process.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. I guess is there any read-through to timing of the MGP transaction?
Samantha Gallagher: Did you -- I'm sorry, did you ask if there's any update to the timing? We can...
Wesley Golladay: Well, I guess, is there any read-through -- would there be any issues that are causing the Venetian to be pushed out with those things apply to MGP as well?
Samantha Gallagher: No. They are unrelated and we do not expect that to impact our previously disclosed timing for the MGP transaction.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then one last one. I guess, can you update us on the Las Vegas master lease, I think, is going to be set in a few days?
Samantha Gallagher: David or Danny?
David Kieske: Danny, go ahead.
Danny Valoy: Yes, Wes, in terms of escalations, we expect that to escalate in with CPI, which was about 5%, so of the 2% floor that's embedded in that lease. So starting November 1 for the next lease year, the Las Vegas master lease will escalate about 5%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan from Raymond James.
RJ Milligan: Can you talk about the JACK lease amendment that was just announced? And do you see any other opportunities for additional amendments dropping the variable rent component for some of the other leases?
Edward Pitoniak: David, or Samantha, you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes, RJ, I can start and Samantha chime in on anything. I mean what we're experiencing and witnessing is just continued -- somewhat of a confirmation or conforming aspect of the leases, right? This sector is only 8 years old with the formation of GLPI in 2013. But as each deal, we and the operators continue to get smarter and understand the best way to document and structure a lease. And so when some of these opportunities arise to remove some of the legacy component, so to speak, of leases that really don't make sense for you as the operator or us as landlord, we work collaboratively together to streamline the leases and continue to move forward to somewhat of a "industry standard". So it's a net-net win for both sides here with between VICI and JACK.
RJ Milligan : Okay. And then looking into '22, can you give us an update on your thoughts on executing some of the ROFRs or the put call options that you guys have?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: So we continue to monitor. I think you're referring to -- first, we have some ROFRs in Las Vegas. Tom Reeg, the CEO of Caesars has indicated that they would be looking to potentially sell one of the assets and we'll be involved in that process and we'll follow his lead on what they're deciding to do. And then the second one, I think you're referring to is our put call that we have that becomes live in January '22 with the 2 large assets in Indianapolis, and we'll continue to monitor those as well. Those assets continue to grow, RJ, since we did this -- created this put call table games have been legalized at the racinos in the State of Indiana, and Caesars has been working on expanding those facilities. And those so -- those facilities are continuing to add amenities, add some space, add table games. And so we'll watch how they continue to grow. And we know that, that put call is good for 3 years starting in January.
RJ Milligan : Okay. And then my last question is a bigger picture question. But Ed, it seems like there's still a disconnect for regional gaming assets in terms of pricing and we started to see the cap rate compression in Las Vegas for sure. When do you expect or what do you think needs to happen to start seeing cap rate compression in the regional markets?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, RJ. It is, I believe -- or I think it will prove to be a dynamic that we've seen in other asset classes that have gone through institutionalization as an example, a category that I spent time in final mile logistics. When there began to be an institutionalization of that industrial sub-asset class, the greatest amount of investment focused initially was in markets like the Inland Empire outside of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as the category really began to prove itself that as the secular trends behind the category continue to grow, what you began to see was a radiating out of investment activity from those epicenters. As an example, across the street from our JACK Thistledown asset outside of Cleveland, on a site that once how, I guess, a Class B mall is now an Amazon distribution center of amazing scale. And again, that's Cleveland. So you can see that kind of radiating taking place in other asset classes. I believe you're going to see it as well in regional gaming. There are, of course, certain friction points in some jurisdictions. The gaming real estate owner does require licensing. But we think at the end of the day, that will be a friction point that becomes less of a factor in how people make their decisions when they realize that some of these regional assets are so strong and have such a comparable scale and quality. And just to belabor the point in a moment, RJ, it was on this very call, the Q3 earnings call, I believe it was 2 years ago in 2019, that I made at the time that rather outlandish claim -- this was right after the Bellagio announcement, I made the rather outlandish claim that I would argue that National Harbor, which MGM obviously occupies and MGP owned at that point, deserve to trade at a cap rate at least as tight as Bellagio, given it's under scarcity as an asset of that magnitude of quality in a 24-hour city like Washington, D.C. So I do think it will come, RJ. It will, as is required in every other asset class it will take time, but it will happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: I -- look, you've had a lot of success diversifying the company over the years, but I'm wondering if there's any longer-term optimal mix you would target, whether that's tenant, geography or maybe gaming versus non-gaming?
Edward Pitoniak: John, do you want to start?
John Payne: Well, good morning, Barry. As we’ve been talking in the past 4 years, the key to it all is continuing to diversify our tenant base. And like you said, we've gone from 1 tenant to 8 tenants in gaming. As David mentioned in his remarks, we obviously have started diversifying into nongaming. I don't think we have an exact percentage of how much we're going to own in gaming and how much we're going to own in non-gaming, how many tenants we're ultimately going to have. But I think you've seen us continue to add high quality of, Ed said in his remarks, tenants to our portfolio, as well in gaming as well as in non-gaming. And so I don't have a percentage today. I think we've clearly said 45% of our rent after the MGP deal will come from Las Vegas and 55% of our rent will come from regional assets. So we still have a wide opportunity to diversify over the years, and we'll continue to look for unique opportunities with most importantly, high-quality tenants with great real estate. So no specific numbers today, Barry.
Barry Jonas : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of debate out there longer term, how iGaming will -- if it will cannibalize land-based gaming to any degree. I'm curious how you think about this and if it influences your longer-term strategy at all?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start, Barry. And obviously, we need to take care to distinguish as I know you are between iGaming and sports betting. And I think it remains to be seen the degree to which iGaming becomes its own ecosystem that does not create a new customer who also then acquires through iGaming, a desire to visit the brick-and-mortar casino. You've heard us talk before about how bullish we are about sports betting as being a very powerful secular audience expansion tailwind for gaming. iGaming remains more of a question. And I do think there are some very interesting points to be made as to the implications of iGaming in a manifest number of different perspectives. And I believe there was a panel -- oh, no, you wrote about it. The panel you wrote about Barry yesterday, I think, some people like David Cordish were making some very interesting points about the jurisdictions taking care that iGaming not end up sacrificing the jobs and the economic vitality that go with brick-and-mortar gaming. So again, we'll see over time. I would say, though, that I am much less worried about iGaming than I am excited about sports betting and the way sports betting is changing the marketing paradigm of American Gaming in such a way that American Gaming can participate in the Great American sports conversation. And if you had told me when I first started getting involved with VICI 4 years ago, which was my introduction to American Gaming, with Kenny Mayne and Trey Wingo of ESPN would join folks like John Payne and David and Samantha and me in the business of American Gaming, I would not have foreseen that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin from Capital One.
Neil Malkin: Ed, first off, I'm not sure you meant by that comment about the logistics facility in Cleveland. Cleveland is probably the best city in the United States. So we're talking about...
Edward Pitoniak: It is.
Neil Malkin: Okay. So first one from me. You talked about 45% of your rent comes from Vegas. And obviously, it's going gangbusters. It's fantastic. But given the Venetian and your pending merger of MGP, alongside the 2 ROFRs you have there and your land parcels, are you comfortable with your exposure there? Might we see a move -- a potential property sale just to kind of mitigate the exposure going a lot higher?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, Neil, and then I'll turn it over to John. But I think as a starting point, Neil, what certainly I have come to learn, I think, along with David and Samantha, those of us who the you are new to gaming, is that Las Vegas is almost unlike any other place on earth, the nearest place I can think of it is like Las Vegas is Orlando, right? And so -- and as VICI thinks about geez, how much exposure is the right exposure in -- sorry, in Las Vegas, it's like Disney thing about what's the right exposure in Orlando. Well, Orlando is an ecosystem unto itself. And it has an infrastructure that has taken decades to build and is unrivaled in the world in the way Las Vegas is infrastructure, tourism infrastructure is unrivaled. It's tourism, it's convention, it's conference, it's tradeshow infrastructure. So when you have an ecosystem as utterly distinct and one of a kind as Las Vegas. I do think you have to think about asset concentration or portfolio concentration in a very different way than you would in so many other asset classes in which not to be flip about it, but one 24-hour city is sort of like another 24-hour city. John, if you wanted to add to that?
John Payne: No, Ed, I think you touched on it. Neil, I mean we -- if you've been following us since we started the company, there are other REITs that weren't as bullish as we are on Las Vegas, but we are very excited from the day we started the company. We're even more excited today about what's taking place in Las Vegas. The operators are here in Las Vegas are the most dynamic creative operators. There are -- they'll continue to reinvent the business when something doesn't work. And what's also been made perfectly clear after the closing of the facilities due to the pandemic as they reopen, the consumer clearly has not found a substitute for Las Vegas. They're returning in record numbers, and that's without the amount of airlift, that's without international travel, and that's without necessarily MICE business that's going to come back as well. So we're excited today about it, and we're going to be even more excited over coming years as those segments of our customers return to Las Vegas, to our tenants.
Edward Pitoniak: And we [love even 2], Neil.
Neil Malkin: Yes. I appreciate that. The other one for me, maybe bigger picture, obviously, the move to iGaming or digitization, whatever you want to call that, is going to be a fulsome and wholesome endeavor by a lot of the big gaming guys, operators. I'm just wondering if you can comment on how you think about how the investments and dollars needed to make those moves and to add that to part of their ecosystem or platform, how will that have an impact on potential assets coming to market as they look to raise -- raise money either on the Strip or regionally and potential impacts for you guys or new operators coming in?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's a good question, Neil. Exciting time in the space. I mean, I'll just talk about what's taking place today with our top tenant Caesars. And I don't think it's either/or. If you look at their investment in the bricks-and-mortar facilities right now, and there's more than I know. I know about the $300 million going into New Orleans, the $400 million that's going into Atlantic City, the numerous hotel, Nobu Hotels that are being built around their facilities, the reformation of the entrance to Caesars Palace, I could go on and on about the massive investment that our top 10 is putting in their bricks and mortar. At the same time, you can obviously just turn on your TV or your radio and see the large investments that they're making into Caesars sports book. So the beauty of this is their strategy as well as our other tenant strategy of connecting the dots or building a world-class omni-channel marketing capabilities where they can talk to consumers, not only digitally, but they can talk to consumers at their bricks-and-mortar facilities and continue to attract people across their platform. And that's what's so exciting about the gaming space. And again, if someone is who's old these days and has been around for over 25 years, there has not been a more dynamic and exciting time in the casino gambling space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: You all mentioned opportunity...
Edward Pitoniak: Stephen, you cut out.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: So John, I appreciate you highlighting VICI's pillars of growth in your opening comments. But I think one of the key questions from investors is how to think about how deep those pools are given the diminishing benefit to earnings growth from each sizable deal that you guys are doing. Would you be able to provide some context on the potential size of each of those buckets?
John Payne: I can do sub of it, and Danny can do some of it as well. So Greg, we've laid this out a couple of different ways. But the short answer is there are a lot of opportunities still out there. When you just think of -- I'll take gaming and then Danny or David can jump in on nongame. And I'll take 1 of the 6 pillars because we -- I don't want to take up the rest of the call going through all 6 pillars. But I'll take one of them, which is the expansion of gaming. And just domestically, I want to even touch on the international opportunities that we see in Canada and Australia, potentially in Singapore, potentially in Japan. So just domestic gaming.  If you think of our opportunities, Greg, we still have -- do not own real estate in any downtown facility in Las Vegas. We still don't own real estate in Las Vegas in the regional markets, which are both very healthy and growing markets. We don't have Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island, Pittsburgh, [like] Charles, parts of Massachusetts. So we have an analysis that shows the depth and the amount of rent and the amount of EBITDA that is still available with assets that are not necessarily in the REIT pool right now. So that's 1 of 6 pillars. We see tremendous opportunity to grow in gaming domestically as well as the other 5 pillars that I don't know if David or Danny want to touch on quickly as well.
Danny Valoy : Yes. I'll just add. This is Danny. On the gaming side, Greg, we still continue to work on transactions in any given week or month where the total value exceeds well over $50 billion. So that's not necessarily a TAM, but hopefully, that just gives you some insight into the number and different sizes of opportunities that we continue to work on, discuss, evaluate and target. Another piece going forward is going to be the VICI Partner Property Growth Fund. If you think about the size of our assets, a little over 2 million square feet on average at each property. There are high ROI projects, where we're partnering with our existing tenants and funding those pretty efficiently in exchange for incremental rent. Hard to say exactly -- hard to quantify that because it ultimately depends on the individual operator strategies, but that's something that could reach into the hundreds of millions of total investments. And then international, it's really hard to size or quantify, it's dependent on the jurisdiction, the individual assets within those jurisdictions. But as we talked about, we've spent a lot of time understanding the tax implications, currency risk, regulatory hurdles. So that is an area where you'll see us expand over time.
Edward Pitoniak: I would just add, Greg, this is Ed, that we have a certain amount of confidence that we can figure out how to do what others have successfully done before us. When you crystallize the issue as you just did very well, which is once you get to a certain size, the math obviously does become more challenging. But at the same time, strategic resources can become more ample. So we look at what companies like Realty Income and Prologis have done in facing the mathematical challenge of growing, when you get really big. And we get full marks to meet and the Realty Income team for what they have done as an example, in the U.K. and now in Spain when it comes to increasing their exposure to European grocery. European grocery is not a category that we'd be interested in. But there is European experiential we'd be very interested in. And in fact, categories in Europe, they don't even really exist in the U.S., experiences like center parks, as an example. So we would look at what Realty Income has done. We would look at what Prologis has done internationally and domestically and especially through their strategic capital activities. So we're confident that if we learn from the best, we stand a good chance of achieving at least some of what they have done, and we're very excited about that opportunity in the years to come.
Greg McGinniss: All right. Shifting gears slightly here, just regarding the call right on the big shot facilities. Have you worked out how you'll be valuing the real estate in the event that you're able to turn that financing arrangement in the permanent property ownership? And also, if you could provide any context on what you view as the opportunity or growth potential within this kind of entertainment base driving range space and maybe big shots specifically, that'd be appreciated.
Edward Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes, Greg, it's David. Good to talk you. The financing is -- will be done at a 10% interest rate. And then the call rate will be at competitive 8 cap if we elect to enter into a sale leaseback on any of those facilities. We're excited to partner with the ClubCorp team, the Big Shot's team. They've got a very good development pipeline. They're going to mimic going to secondary markets, some markets where we can't -- don't currently -- or can't own gaming real estate just because it's not legal in those jurisdictions and they're invigorated to grow that pipeline to grow that platform, and we're thrilled to partner with them. So we'll see what the future holds with that opportunity between VICI and Big Shots.
Edward Pitoniak: Operator, do we have Stephen available again?
Operator: Yes, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: Great. Can you hear me?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes.
Stephen Grambling: So you mentioned opportunities to fund high-return growth projects for existing tenant partners. How much the economics of these types of investments compare and contrast versus the traditional sale leasebacks?
Edward Pitoniak: They should mirror them very closely, Stephen. Obviously, they need to be a sufficient return such that you could take the incremental return on the incremental capital and divide it in half at least, and each party is getting what they need and deserve. In other words, we would get a sufficient return through incremental rent on our investment, and the operator would get a sufficient return on the brand and intellectual capital and operating investments that they have made. So it should very much mirror our conventional economics. And again, if we can get growth capital out the door in whatever form we get it out the door as long as it's in the proper risk framework, we're going to be very happy to do so. And I will just reiterate what Danny said, our assets are of a scale and of a quality fit and finish level that you really only find an office and a mall. And as an example of that, our average asset is over 2 million square feet. It sits on dozens of acres. That's in contrast to your conventional triple net commodity box, which is 17,000 square feet and sits on an acre or [2], right? Our assets present incremental investment opportunities that really are hard to find in almost any other asset class.
Stephen Grambling: That makes sense. And maybe 1 more for you. Just on reconsolidation, obviously, with MGP, you made a first-mover advantage there as well. How do you think about scale and index inclusion like influence the potential for future REIT consolidation perhaps beyond just gaming.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I think, obviously, 1 key determinant would be the degree to which we would not only be getting access to property with getting access to talent to a management platform that could be of great value to us in helping us grow not only beyond the acquisition of the portfolio of properties that might come with the M&A, but with the talent and the operating experience and reach that would come with it. We don't see that as an immediate priority. We think we have enough in front of us in terms of our existing categories that frankly represent triple-net white space that we believe we're uniquely qualified to pioneer in. But we are certainly mindful of the way in which adjacent M&A can be an effective way to continue to grow value.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Thomas: Just first question, in terms of expanding on the non-gaming side, you completed loan programs or established loan programs with Great Wolf, Chelsea Piers, ClubCorp now. Is that the path toward ownership that we should continue to expect as you look toward adding exposure to non-gaming? Or could we see you move into non-gaming in a more meaningful way without sort of establishing an initial loan program? And then also, how important is it to have an investment-grade rating to invest more meaningfully in nongaming and expand the portfolio towards some of those other types of assets?
Edward Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Todd, good to talk. I hope you will. Look, I wouldn't say that the path that you should expect. The situations with Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and Big Shots, called for financing, each of them were somewhat unique and specific and why they call for financing. But as you saw with Big Shots, we do have a call right to enter into a sale leaseback, so we do have a path to ownership, and you hit the nail on the head. These all lead -- ideally lead to a path to ownership. There may or may not be a sale of Chelsea Piers that may or may not be a sale of Great Wolf where we have the opportunity to buy the real estate. But if there is a transaction, we'll have a seat at the table and be able to compete for that opportunity. Ideally, our -- if we had -- if we could dial it up on a whiteboard, we'd have -- we'd entered into a sale leaseback day 1. But just again, the niceness of these circumstances is why there's they are mortgages today. And then in terms of the path to investment grade, ultimately at the end of the day, our cost of capital is what matters and allows us to compete. And so as our cost of capital goes lower, we feel that the funnel widens and we will be able to compete for more things, both within gaming and outside of gaming. So we're thrilled to be on the doorstep of achieving an investment-grade rating here in the near term.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then just circling back to the discussion around asset pricing. Ed, one of the pillars you discussed was the importance of being early investing at pre-institutional pricing. And we've seen pricing improve on recent deals and cap rates have come in quite a bit. John, you touched on City Center and the Cosmopolitan pricing. But is there still room for cap rate compression in gaming and in Las Vegas on the Strip in particular and which might have implications on sort of regional asset pricing as well? Or do you think that assets are more fairly valued on a risk-adjusted basis today? How do you just think about valuation in the current environment, I guess, more broadly?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Todd. So I think the quick answer is yes. I think there's more room to run. I think one of the key things to keep in mind -- and this came up in a conversation that I was having with our partner at Blackstone, Tyler Henritze a few weeks ago, which he said, I think we should stop talking about cap rates, when it comes to gaming real estate. If we could just talk about unlevered cash flow going in unlevered cash flow yield because that's what we're getting, right? When we -- VICI buy at a 6.25% cap rate on the Venetian, we're getting 6.25% unlevered free cash flow yield out of the gate, right? And a number of you have written about the transparency and the predictability, the integrity of triple net cash flows versus so many other REIT categories where the supposed cap rate really is only a notional number that hardly ever resembles actual reality once you account for all CapEx and other forms of leakage from net free cash flow. So I think as investors look at gaming, they will look at the fact that you're getting true free cash flow in what you buy. And I think that could have a compressive effect. When you look at what other Class A categories, life office like every other category that is so big disguise right now, industrial and others, you're often looking at cap rates that don't actually reflect true free cash flow. In gaming, that's what you get and I think it will have a continuing effect on the compressing of our cap rates. And as long as our cost of capital continues to improve and a velocity equal to the velocity of cap recompression, we can very much stay in the game and David and his team and what they're doing with their balance sheet are making sure we do keep pace.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich from SMBC.
Jay Kornreich: As 2 of your nongaming investments have been with portfolio companies of PE funds that you also have relationships with on the casino side upon pending those closing just curious how important you feel those PE relationships are for nongaming investments and the opportunities that they provide?
Edward Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes, Jay, good to talk to you. I mean part of it just stems from the magnitude of capital these institutions have, right? The amount of companies that private equity is investing in. And if we can play a role alongside some of the best real estate leisure hospitality investors in the world, we are thrilled to do that. So we look at a lot of opportunities. We have a lot of opportunities, and we continue to work with and understand other sectors out there, but these just happen to be with 2 folks that are also invested in real estate because they have institutions that are invested across all asset classes. And again, if we can find ways to partner with our existing partners and future partners in private equity, we will absolutely do so.
Jay Kornreich: Sure. And then there's a lot of -- there's several credit and liquidity enhancing opportunities in front of you, like we have discussed. Is if you can provide any sort of time line when you expect them to occur, such as the credit rating improvement potentially getting listed on the S&P 500, refinancing debt, such that you're incurring from MGP, any sort of time line when all those things kind of fall?
David Kieske: Well, it all stems around the timing of the MGP closing, as Samantha alluded to, that's still on track for the first half of next year. And we would expect to issue the $4.4 billion of debt that we need to fund, again, the MGM Op unit redemption into the investment-grade market. We've worked very closely, led by Erin Ferreri on our team with the rating agencies to highlight the timing, highlight the transactions, highlight our funding and make sure that they are a lockstep with us. And so as S&P alluded to, if we keep leverage below 6x, we'll get a BBB minus rating. Well, with the equity raise that we did in September, and we are a pro forma balance sheet being projected to target, we're below that number. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve that investment-grade rating sometime in the first half of 2022, again, connection with the MGP transaction. And then the other part of your question was the refinancing of the MGP debt. That will occur at or near the time of those maturities. The MGP bonds are all bullet bonds, but we feel very good about the incremental accretion that we'll pick up from the interest expense savings as we start to refinance that debt, which I think the first one comes due in 2024, if I'm not mistaken, in 2025. So over the years, we'll have incremental AFFO pickup from that -- from those refinancing opportunities of the MGP bonds as well as the VICI bonds that are in place today.
Jay Kornreich: And if I could just sneak one more in. Just when we think about potential external growth internationally, do you see an opportunity to partner with your new MGM relationship to consider opportunities in Macau or the potential MGM Japan Casino development?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Jay, I would say that Macau not likely, but Japan would be very intriguing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: Question for John, putting your operator hat on, John, you mentioned earlier how well the Venetian did in the third quarter, $132 million of EBITDA. Any updated thinking about long-term performance of that tenant?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. So Thomas, I apologize. John had to race to the airport to get to Cincinnati for the grand opening of our Hard Rock Cincinnati asset in partnership with Hard Rock. So between me and Danny, we'll do our best. But we're obviously very excited to see those quarter 3 results without international travel, without the convention conference and trade show having fully come back. And I'll now turn it over to Danny, who I think can give you a quick summary of our confidence that this is the kind of performance that Apollo can inherit and continue to grow upon. Danny?
Danny Valoy : Yes. Tom, as we've talked about, there's a lot of opportunity there in the existing asset. One of the things we found interesting was just the margin differential between the Venetian and then other assets on the Las Vegas Strip. We can't speak for Apollo and their strategy, but we would expect the existing team to run forward and execute on a lot of the projects and initiatives that they've created and have been evaluating for a long period of time. So look, I still think it's really early in the Venetian in their trajectory. I think there is a lot of opportunity there. Some of it's low-hanging fruit, some will take a little bit longer to execute on, but we're really excited, and we're looking forward to closing on that asset.
Thomas Allen: Perfect. And then just on -- well, first of all, respecting that you've done a ton of deals, I'm still going to ask a question about future deals, even though it's a little unfair given how much you've done. But most of your more experiential focused deals have been on the smaller side, are you prepared to do like a much larger deal? Or is the interest to kind of continue to kind of eat into that sub space?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. I would say, Thomas, there's nothing that would prevent us strategically or financially from doing bigger deals outside of gaming. You are right, so far what we've done has been on a generally smaller scale. Although I will say that assets like Chelsea Piers do qualify as we like to say, as casinos without gaming. The P&L at Chelsea Piers is actually very significant. So that's not entirely borne out. Obviously, when we only do a mortgage loan. But these assets do have some heft to them. Great Wolf Resorts, also have heft to them. So while our participation so far is only on the financing side, when the day comes when we're successful as we believe we will be, in becoming real estate owners of assets like this, we will be buying assets that have a lot of economic throwaway.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Daniel Adam from Loop Capital Markets.
Daniel Adam: Just one for me on the anticipated funding requirements for the $4.4 billion cash consideration to MGM. In the 10-Q that was filed last night, I noticed that you expect to fund that portion of the deal with long-term debt, not equity, am I correct in thinking that you initially intended to use a combination of debt and equity when the transaction was first announced? And if so, does that change your accretion expectations at all for MGP?
David Kieske: Dan, it's David. Good to talk here. Our intention from day 1 was always to fund -- our attention and our requirement, frankly, was to fund that $4.4 billion in debt. There's tax reasons why that has to be funded in debt and why that has to be funded really at the time of all conditions to the merger being satisfied. So the punchline is no. The accretion doesn't change. We'd always anticipated issuing equity, paying down the term loan and then essentially relevering at a point in the future once we go to the market to raise that $4.4 billion of debt.
Daniel Adam: Okay. Great. And the timing around the funding of that? I imagine that will be close to when you expect the deal to close?
David Kieske: Yes. We're often asked if we would put that into escrow, we take advantage of the markets ahead of closing. And again, the way that the agreements are laid out, the way that the tax requirements, what we need to satisfy for tax reasons. Again, we will not issue that debt until all conditions to the merger are satisfied, and we have a 30-day window under the agreement to issue that debt sometime in the first half of next year, we'd expect.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference back to Ed Pitoniak.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, operator. So let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We believe our shareholders are going to be very well served by VICI growing quickly and energetically in a newly institutionalizing asset class with great partners during what has been an uncertain period. We believe as well that we are well positioned to continue growing our portfolio accretively while driving superior shareholder value. Again, thank you, and good health to all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, July 29, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found on the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our second quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We're excited to talk about our quarter. John will provide an update on the environment for our operating partners, and David will summarize the outstanding growth that our second quarter results represent and briefly address our exciting new financing partnership with Great Wolf Resorts. But first, I want to address the topic. We've talked a lot about at VICI since VICI's emergence in the fall of 2017, and that's the topic of real estate asset class institutionalization. At VICI, we've been saying since day 1 in October of 2017, the gaming real estate deserves to be and we believe is proving to be the next great institutionalization story in American Commercial Real Estate. When we talk about real estate asset class institutionalization, we're talking about the process of institutional capital determining that an asset class is or isn't worthy of their investment. Worthy based on the quality and demand characteristics of the real estate worthy based on the quality of the occupants business and its credit. This determinization process requires learning and learning takes time and hard work. Most active asset management shops do not have a lot of excess analytical capacity or excess time to dig deep on new asset sectors. And there's no question that it's active managers who pioneer investment in the listed equities of new real estate asset classes where active managers go index managers follow. Active institutional real estate investment capital has had to do a lot of new learning over the last 10 years for real estate investment sectors as varied as cell towers, data centers, final mile logistics, single-family rental homes, manufactured housing, medical office and labs and of course, gaming. In some of these asset classes, institutional investors have the advantage of already knowing the underlying tenants either because the tenants already occupied other well-established real estate asset classes or because the tenants included America's biggest and best-known companies. In the case of gaming real estate, many investors, especially dedicated REIT investors were starting from square one in understanding gaming operators as tenants and ultimately, as real estate leasing credits. For that reason, our first few years at VICI were largely focused on helping investors, both dedicated REIT and generalist investors, understand our tenants' businesses, their marketplaces, their economics their balance sheet, their outlooks, their resilience and their overall creditworthiness. The very positive news that gaming operators as real estate tenants have proven themselves to be highly resilient place-based leisure operators through the COVID-19 pandemic and beneficiaries of the secular tailwind that sports betting represents. With our operators fully validated as an institutional quality tenant, as we believe they are, I want to turn the focus to the other key dimension of gaming real estate institutionalization dynamic. And that's the quality of our real estate assets as real estate, as physical construction. And let's start with scale. Our assets are big, really big. Pro forma for our Venetian transaction, VICI owns 63 million square feet of built real estate. And with 28 properties, our average property measures 2.3 million square feet. Compare that with the largest conventional triple net REIT where the average owned store measures 17,000 square feet. So again, that's 2.3 million square feet compared to 17,000 square feet. And why does scale matter? Because large scale tends to correlate to spatial complexity, multifunctionality, abundant reprogramming capacity and higher replacement cost. All of which adds to mission criticality. Gaming operators can't simply relocate to the nearest slab-on-grade tilt-up box. Our real estate isn't where in and out transactions happen. Our real estate is where experiences happen within built environments that aren't built simply the least, but built to last. These big buildings and the ample land parcels around them also create an opportunity for incremental capital investment for our tenants and potentially for us. And that kind of incremental same-store capital investment opportunity isn't likely to be available in the typical smaller box owned by a triple net REIT. The only other asset class is that combine this kind of scale with high-quality finish and indispensability are Class A office and Class A malls. But in the case of gaming real estate, investors can own large-scale and high-quality indispensable assets in a triple-net lease structure with the benefits of transparency and cash flow predictability that the triple net structure inherently offers. Our big assets also produced big rent. Our average annual rent per property pro forma for the Venetian closing will be $55 million. In comparison, rent per store as the largest conventional triple net REIT is $260,000 based on public filings. Again, $55 million versus $260,000. By a long margin, we believe gaming real estate assets produced the highest rent per property among triple net REITs. This concentration of value in large assets may mean concentration of risk, but we believe this risk is offset by the high quality of these assets. We would rather have value concentrated in high-quality non-commodity assets than dispersed across conventional commodity triple net boxes. Another essential institutional characteristics of game or estate is lease duration. VICI's weighted average lease duration right now is approximately 34 years, and the Venetian lease upon closing will effectively be 50 years in duration, including renewal options. And in the case of VICI, these long leases include rent escalation and pro forma for the Venetian closing 95% of our rent roll will have CPI kickers. These key characteristics of VICI's gaming real estate, scale, quality, indispensability, long life, lease length and inflation mitigation, make gaming real estate what we believe is a superior investment for all investors seeking total return. But these characteristics, we believe are especially valuable for investors who must manage long-dated liabilities. When you combine the long-lived nature of our assets with our long-dated leases, we offer a truly long-dated income-producing assets to offset those long-dated liabilities. All of these investment characteristics of gaming real estate give us great confidence when it comes to expressing our fundamental belief that gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure, I'll repeat our belief gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure. Consider the choice between Caesars Palace Las Vegas, a 9 million square foot asset on 82 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, the most dynamic experiential street in America or a discount store that sits on a fraction of an acre on a secondary road in a secondary market. You can decide what you prefer. And with that, I'll turn it over to John Payne. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As many of you may recall, in March of this year, we announced the pending acquisition of the real estate of the Venetian Resort and Sam's Expo Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing, this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent, growing VICI revenue base by nearly 20%, and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. We agreed to acquire this iconic world-class asset in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip at a 6.25% cap rate. And just a few weeks ago, another real estate acquisition was announced in Las Vegas with Blackstone agreeing to acquire City Center's real estate from MGM at a 5.5% cap rate. The City Center transaction illustrates what we have been foreshadowing since our company was created. That is, when institutional capital realizes the discount between the incredible quality of gaming real estate and the undemanding valuation relative to other real estate asset classes. The days of the 10% cap rate transactions are over. Our acquisition of the Venetian real estate was announced at a very idiosyncratic time, during which the recovery trajectory in Las Vegas was unclear. We were highly optimistic as reflected in the 6.25% cap rate and prudently structured a transaction that worked for all parties while creating significant value for our shareholders. As those of you who follow the industry closely are undoubtedly aware, visitation, occupancy and consumer spend have continued accelerating in Las Vegas and operating margin expansion has become apparent. Midweek demand has been supported by the early return of meetings and conventions and the outlook for the back half of 2021 and 2022 is very promising. Similar to regional markets, Las Vegas is benefiting from very robust consumer demand and a new, more efficient operating model. As I've said before, the gaming consumer did not find a replacement for the bricks-and-mortar experience through COVID, not in the regional markets, and not in Las Vegas. As you can imagine, underwriting transactions during this time can be challenging. Each market and asset has unique attributes. The EBITDAR you consider underwriting 1 day could be significantly behind real-time performance just a few weeks later. No doubt this makes underwriting and negotiating a potential deal, a fun and creative challenge. We're fortunate our team has the ability and experience to manage this complexity. We thrive on this challenge, and we continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver the utmost value for our shareholders. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our recent investment outside of gaming and our financial results. David?
David Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. I'll discuss our exciting new partnership with Great Wolf and touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance, all of which is fully detailed in the press release we posted last night. During the quarter, we continued to expand our investments outside of gaming by entering into a mezzanine loan agreement with Great Wolf Resorts, a Blackstone portfolio company. On June 16, we agreed to provide $79.5 million to partially fund the development of the Great Wolf Lodge Maryland, an expansive 48-acre indoor water park resort located in Perryville, Maryland. The loan bears an interest rate of 8% and has an initial term of 3 years with 2 12-month extension options. We will fund our commitment using cash on our balance sheet and expect to fund our entire $79.5 million commitment by mid-2022 in accordance with the construction draw schedule. In addition, we'll have the opportunity for a period up to 5 years to provide up to a total of $300 million of mezzanine financing for the development and construction of Great Wolf's extensive domestic and international indoor water park resort pipeline. We are thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, the leading indoor waterpark resort platform and institutional operator. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion ATM agreement with the added flexibility to sell shares through forward sale agreements under the ATM. We've not sold any shares under the ATM in 2021. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.01%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.6 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was approximately 5.0x. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity, comprised of $407.5 million in cash on hand, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And in addition, we have access to approximately $527.6 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition, which John mentioned. Turning to financial results. And just one minor point to note in the earnings release. In the total revenue summary under second quarter results, the 8-K refers to a noncash leasing and financing adjustment of a negative $29.3 million. This should instead be a positive $29.3 million. Reported total revenues in this summary are otherwise correct. AFFO for the quarter was $256.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 45.3% over Q2 2020. As a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time, the forward sale agreements are in place. During the second quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 17.4 million shares. Our G&A was $7.6 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2%, which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard which, due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.010 billion and $1.035 billion or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the 20 - reflect the dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreement assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreement. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: It was great to see a new industry enter the fold. But could you provide some context to the size of the addressable market for indoor water park resorts and resiliency of those cash flows?
Samantha Gallagher: David?
David Kieske: Yes, Greg, great to talk to you. I'm going to take that in reverse order. I mean we've spent over 2 years studying the indoor waterpark resort sector. And I've just come to be enamored with it. We're thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, who is the leader in the sector and has a phenomenal institutional platform led by Murray and team in Chicago. The cash flows, they're essentially casinos without gaming. There are multiple revenue drivers in terms of the indoor water park component, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage. So we've talked about gaming, multiple levers within a box. And it's not just a box. It's a very complex box. These are very expensive assets to build that have a very, very durable customer base durable customer experience, which we come to love. So high-margin business and similar to gaming, they were shut down during COVID, but they've reopened. The customer has returned and customers returned in droves, and they've opened under a new operating model with higher profitability and higher margins. In terms of addressable market, Great Wolf is the leader. There's 19 Great Wolfs out there. This will be #20. We hope to continue to grow the platform with Great Wolf. And this is a sector that we will continue to kind of study look at and hopefully, over time, convert into real estate ownership if and when the opportunity arises.
Greg McGinniss: Great. And was this a marketed opportunity? Or how are you able to source the deal?
David Kieske: We've - the team with Ed, John, myself, we've got great relationships. Our Chief Accounting Officer came from Blackstone. So we have good relationships with a lot of operators in these - as John has talked about, we've been out meeting with operators since day 1, both in and outside of gaming. And we've developed a relationship with the Great Wolf team and the Blackstone team and we're able to together a very collaborative transaction that worked for both parties.
Greg McGinniss: Great. And then I guess final question, most simply, what's your appetite for additional deals in 2021?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. I mean, look, we haven't changed our plans. I continue to do, as David just said, with a great full team and the Blackstone team and other operators in gaming and outside game and continue to build what those companies are trying to do to grow? Is there a spot for us to help them grow as a partner for the long term? So I don't know what exactly is ahead of us, but we're continuing to be out there and build those relationships.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Adams with Loop Capital Markets.
Daniel Adam: Whether it's Blackstone's real estate investment on the strip or your deal with Apollo at the Venetian or even your recently announced financing deal with Blackstone portfolio company, Great Wolf. It seems increasingly that private equity is looking to partner with or compete directly with the gaming REITs. So I guess looking ahead, do you continue to see private equities involvement in gaming opco and/or real estate assets accelerating, flatlining or declining versus, say, what we've seen over the past 2 years?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Daniel, good to talk to you. I'll start out. We - I think the actual starting point and answer your question, isn't narrowly the issue of how much private equity capital will come into gaming, whether the opco or the propco, I think it actually starts with how much capital there is globally hunting free yield in a world where whatever it is today, 60% of ore of sovereign yield is negative. Capital, whether it's private equity capital or direct pension fund investment capital needs to find yield. And in the case of the brilliant deal, Blackstone did on City Center, buying a phenomenal piece of real estate at 555 gap. We must recognize that's not private equity per se. That is actually within their nontraded REIT, we believe. But the larger point is that to echo what John said in his prepared remarks, gaming real estate represents, we believe, the steepest great real estate on the planet on a comparative basis. In a day and age when industrial and even office to this day are trading at cap rates with 3 and 4 handles. Gaming real estate, even at a 5 handle on a comparative basis is of great value, especially for those again who are managing long-dated liabilities. The leases are long. They have escalation. In our case, they have CPI kickers and the capital is concentrated in assets that are absolutely indispensable to the occupant and the occupants are great credits as real estate tenants. And again, you're seeing more and more of this, where you might have seen as an example, that the Cadillac Fairview, the direct investment arm of Ontario Teachers, one of the leading direct investment pension fund complexes in the world has - is going to allocate more and more capital to real estate because they have determined that real assets are where they're going to have to get yield to make up for the lack of it in sovereign yield instruments.
Daniel Adam: That makes a ton of sense. And then I guess, just with respect to the Great Wolf financing deal, your second such financing transaction with a nongaming operator, I guess looking ahead, do you also see accretive asset acquisition opportunities outside of gaming. In other words, do you see VICI diversifying not just its nongaming investment portfolio but also specifically diversifying its nongaming tenant and asset base over the next, call it, 1 to 2 years?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Look, just in terms of the loan, I mean, we use the loan - the loan tool kit as a pathway to potential real estate ownership. So we do expect to expand - continue to expand outside of gaming. But as we've been very vocal about, it's not an either or. The majority of our investments will be gaming just as Ed talked about, the magnitude of the assets, the magnitude of the cash flows. But we will look to continue to partner with great operators and owned real estate with great operators to help them grow their portfolios, whether through direct ownership or the continued use of the mortgage financing tool that we've been successful with to date.
John Payne: And Dan, if I can just add to that as well. Just as a few years ago, when we started BK, you heard me on these calls talk about continuing to work with gaming operators to educate them on how a REIT like ours could help them in their capital stack and how we could help them grow. We're doing a lot of that in the - in some of these nongaming sectors as well as they're getting introduced to our company and our form of financing. And we're spending a lot of time doing that. And hopefully, that will lead to some accretive and exciting opportunities for us in the 1 or 2 years as you mentioned.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: With PE paying record cap rates for gaming assets and the potential for new entrants, I'm curious to get your perspective to what extent your gaming expertise is an advantage in discussions with operators?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Well, it's definitely - there's no doubt having some expertise in this space is quite important. These are, as David talked about, the nongaming assets being complex, our gaming - our tenants have very complex assets. And really, over the past 18 months, the business has changed dramatically. And so understanding how the business has changed and what is the long-term outlook of the business is critically important. And then understanding how these companies are going to grow by meeting with the C suites is important. And there's no doubt that you've heard us talk about the importance of relationships. These are long-term deals when we do these things. And so it is important to have those relationships and the understanding of the core business and how it's going to perform over the years to come. So I'd say that's a long saying Barry, that it is important. We think it's an important part of the VICI's - our plans.
Barry Jonas: That's great, John. And then just a follow-up question. We've obviously seen very strong cap rate compression in Las Vegas. Curious to get your thoughts on what we could see in the regionals, maybe what level do you think is reasonable?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, Barry. What we will likely see in real estate is the dynamic that you tend to see in other asset classes as an institutional line. As an example, when final mile logistics really started becoming a higher category you tended to see the greatest amount of bidding activity in what were then the epicenters of Final Mile, which was chiefly the Inland Empire of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as assets got bid up there and they got bought up in those 2 markets, you began to see capital then seeking return and ownership of assets in other markets. So capital started going to places like Atlanta and Dallas and Chicago and Cleveland. I mean there's an Amazon distribution center across from our Distell asset, outside of Cleveland and a whole lot of capital went into that. And what you will see likely in gaming, is this same, if you will, radiating effect from the current epicenter of gaming real estate investment, which is Las Vegas, right? As the asset class continues to prove itself out. And as opportunities perhaps don't become as numerous in Las Vegas, capital will seek opportunities in other markets. And in regional gaming, they will find assets that are outstanding in their income producing and income resilience characteristics. So it's a matter of time, but that, I believe, is all it is, a matter of time if this is going to be like other institutionalized asset classes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wesley Golladay: I just want to maybe follow up on that last question. Are you starting to see capital flow to be the regional assets, whether it's on the debt side or the equity side or is it still primarily concentrated in Vegas?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, I mean, we certainly know what we hear, David, right?
David Kieske: Yes. We know - exactly, and it's good to talk to you. And we've mentioned this before that our phones didn't stop ringing during COVID and some of the calls that we got were new entrants looking at gaming. And I think those new entrants are continuing to look at gaming, both within Vegas and outside of Vegas because - and these are primarily private capital sources who have historically invested in leisure, hospitality, entertainment companies, and they're almost through cash burn cycles. They're talking about cash burn, but they're looking at gaming, realizing, wow, how do I get into that sector? How do I potentially partner with somebody in that sector? How do I develop a platform in that sector? So I think you'll see more in the regional markets as time goes on here, just again, given the resiliency and quality of these cash flows.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then looking on the debt side of the equation, what are your plans for the financing of the Venetian? And where can you borrow today?
David Kieske: Yes, we've been very consistent. We - as I mentioned in my remarks, we have about $2.4 billion of equity sitting in the forward. So that's - and then we will go to the debt markets later in the fall, unsecured high-yield markets to get to remaining $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of proceeds to fund our $4 billion commitment for the Venetian. And our 10-year paper or 10-year quotes we've gotten recently is sub-4 kind of 3.5% to 4% range. Obviously, that bounces around a little bit with the markets, but we still feel very confident of our underwriting and the accretion we'll achieve from that transaction.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then one on the investment. When you look at investing in incrementally into your assets, what type of annual spend can we see here over the next 2 or 3 years? And do you have any active plans right now?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Wesley - yes go ahead, John.
John Payne: Yes. Just to say, Wes, I think you're asking about our current tenants and our current assets. Yes, it's the responsibility of our tenants to do that. We obviously have some visibility to projects that that they're going to - big projects that they're going to put forth. We also have in our leases, some obligations, the size of investment that they make into our assets. But it really is the obligation of the tenant or the operator to make those capital investments.
Ed Pitoniak: Right. But I think what was if you're asking about what is the opportunity for us to invest incremental capital under assets, we did just complete a project or I should say, Jack, our operating partners Cleveland just completed a project at Thistle with the help of our capital, a new smoking patio that's proving to be an outstanding success for which we will be getting incremental rent. We are working with our operating partners to help them understand the way in which we can provide capital for expansion improvements, reprogramming especially as they continue to see demand levels that are really just outstanding. I mean, very - a moment ago, mentioned how strong the operating results are and I just can't help looking for an excuse to mention the fact that when Sands announced, I guess it was last week, they reported 98% occupancy in the month of June. No international travel. Not much convention business yet, 98% occupancy. And as you all know, they've got over 7,000 rooms. And at 98%, that means almost 7,000 room nights, a nights sold. Each night in the month of June with again, no international travel and very little citywide convention business yet, and yet that business is coming towards the back end of the year. So our operators are certainly looking at scenarios where they're realizing there can be opportunities for expanding their capacity in one way or another or reprogramming in one way or another to take advantage of what is just outstanding levels of demand.
Wesley Golladay: Got it. And then 1 follow-up to that. You mentioned the smoking at the Jack the facility there. Can you talk about how influential the ability to smoke is that facility? We have looked at the gaming data in Pennsylvania it looks a little soft but it looks like it's partially explainable
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's been interesting, Wes, as this has been rolled out nationwide, there's been markets that started nonsmoking, Ohio, in particular, is a market that started out and still is nonsmoking. But what you heard Ed mention is the operators have created these outdoor facilities that allow smoking. And I think it's just to meet the demand of particular customer segments that want to smoke while they gamble. There are other states and cities even that are passing nonsmoking just have to monitor if that ultimately affects the business long term. But what Ed was mentioning is Ohio is a state that actually is non-smoking, but we help Jack develop a smoking area that is outside.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here this morning. I was wondering if you can take us through sort of the discussions you've had on the Chelsea Piers and Great Wolf side. Both of those were loans to start. Obviously, I think Chelsea Piers is on leasehold, which may have driven part of that. But I guess, sort of this risk balancing in terms of going in on the loan side versus going in on the fee and then doing a traditional sale leaseback. How should we think about sort of your incremental expenditure in non-gaming assets? Should we expect it to continue along the mortgage line with drawdowns in the future versus doing something more material in terms of investment?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Michael, it's a good question and to hear from you. A grounds saying that execution happens at the intersection of opportunity and strategy. And what you've seen from it so far, Michael, in terms of both Chelsea Piers and Great Wolf was seizing on an opportunity. In each case, we did not have at the time we did the deal, the opportunity to buy the real estate either by a leasehold interest, which would be possible. Eventually it's easy peers or buy into the asset, either in a stage of development or fully developed. So we're using the financing vehicle in the way David described is a way to have a seat at the table such that if there is an opportunity to become the real estate owner in the future, we have a ringside seat in order to do so. And again, we're going to continue to tell every field we can really come into contact with. And certainly, our first choice will always be to buy real estate, whether it be simple or buying long-term leasehold interest if it meets our investment criteria. But again, we're not going to be doctrinaire, we're going to be opportunistic if we think the right risk/reward profile is there. And in the case of these 2 opportunities, I mean we just could not be more excited. Chelsea Piers, as you well know, it's just up the street premium as a comparable asset. And I'm not sure it's fully appreciated. It's not only New York's foremost recreation asset, it's Manhattan's best film production studios. And you don't need me to tell you with the news this morning about Hudson Pacific and Blackstone partnering on the development of new studio space in L.A. That is one really hot category right now and likely to stay so for the long term. So again, this is a bit of a long-winded answer, but we're going to use every tool in the toolbox to get a ringside seat for opportunities to grow our portfolio accretively over the long term.
Michael Bilerman: And how do you think about - obviously, on the loan business, right, you get repaid and you don't have long-term ownership of those cash flows and would have to reinvest. Can you talk a little bit about the relationship with Chelsea Piers? It sounds like they drew down the other $15 million. And also on the Great Wolf side, obviously, that company was for sale. You probably spent some time looking at it to figure out some partnership. But how close are you to actually owning fee and doing a traditional deal in both of those cases? When should we expect potentially something to convert now that you've sort of been involved with both of those parties?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I mean in the case of Chelsea Piers, we couldn't put a highly specific timetable on it. But what I will tell you is that as we work with Chelsea Piers, one of the key things to keep in mind is that we like to partner with companies that are intent on growing and growing requires capital. And that's where we believe we probably can get our best traction over time, Michael. If it was just 1 operator with 1 asset, and that's all they ever wanted, our chances of doing something are what they are. But with operators who want to grow and who will require capital to do so, that's where we think the opportunity is I couldn't put a precise timetable on Chelsea Piers, but we are very excited about their growth ambitions. And in the case of Blackstone and Great Wolf, they've spilled out their growth ambitions. They're very expensive. And as David spoke of in his comments, we have the opportunity to keep funding them for quite a period of time, and hopefully be there with a very compelling offer there's an opportunity to become the owner of the real estate.
Michael Bilerman: Now can they - just in terms of that relationship, you don't have any sort of right to - like right of first offer on assets or right of first refusal if you decide to sell assets. And that loan, is that I mean I don't know how the drawdown works, but could they sort of prepay you completely and walk to another type of lender. I guess what type of clause do you have into that organization? And I recognize you have a strong relationship with [indiscernible], a partner on the gaming side. But just I'm just trying to understand how tied that revenue stream is that could lead to future deals?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn that part of the question over to David.
David Kieske: Michael, good to talk to you. As it relates to Gray Wolf, we do have a similar ROFO in place with Great Wolf in the event they like to sell. So similar as they talked about with Chelsea Piers, they may or may not like to sell single assets. But it's - what this does is gives us a seat at the table. And we will get monthly reporting information. We'll have - we have a very good dialogue with Murray and team, who runs Great Wolf, and we have a very good dialogue with the Blackstone team that will ultimately look to monetize this. So being in the mix and being in that flow keeps us close to the opportunity to secure long-term real estate. And part of our ability, part of what we bring to the table is that next slug of capital. There is - it's Great Wolf put out in our press release, JPMorgan has the senior loan on this Perryville development. And as you know, or you can talk to colleagues in the rest of the Citi Group organization, construction financing is not a deep bucket of financing. So for us to be able to provide the mezzanine component for this asset and a handful of many more. That's a very attractive piece of capital, especially when Great Wolf is out talking to securing future sites and being able to demonstrate that they have the capital and ready to go for future development. So there is a 5-year term, obviously, on the mezzanine piece, but we don't have - we don't believe it will be repaid quickly, and it will take 2 years to develop and then a little bit of time to stabilize. So while it's not a 35-year lease. We do like the investment and we do like what it opens up for us.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. One thing I just want to add, Michael, is that one thing that our embedded growth pipeline does give us the ability to do is invest time and energy in the developing of relationships that may not pay off for years. But nonetheless, we want to do that. An example of that was when John Payne started calling on Rob Goldstein, the CEO of Las Vegas Sands a couple of years ago with some of us going, yes, okay, go ahead, John. We're not sure that ever going to pay off. And obviously, it has. And similarly, whether it be in gaming or nongaming, our business model allows us to invest time into relationships that if we grow those relationships successfully, they represent our future growth in the years to come. And if we're investing time in a relationship here in 2021 that pays off in 2025, we feel we're actually doing our jobs right. But again, our business model allows us to do that in a way that some of the REIT management teams may not enjoy.
Michael Bilerman: And so how deep is that list? Is it 10 different types of experiential investments in terms of asset categories? Or is it more limited to like 2 or 3? I guess where are you placing how many different types of bets are you placing across industry verticals rather than within a vertical?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I think we're into double digits, John and David. I mean we're in the categories day by day that frankly, we weren't even on our radar 2 years ago. But as we evaluate them, we see the 4 things we most want, which is low cyclicality, no secular threat, healthy supply-demand balance and a durable end user experience. It's again, proven its durability for decades going backwards and promises to be durable for decades going forward. And there's a lot of white space out there, Michael, that the opco propco model has not pioneered that we think has the potential to be pioneered, especially within experiential sectors that have demographic tailwinds behind them for the next 10, 20 years that promise real growth opportunity to the operator, which will require capital, which we are so thrilled to provide.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: I know that you provided the rent contribution from some of the outstanding transactions that you've discussed. But could you actually maybe put a range around the AFFO per share post all these transactions that have kind of been announced and are pending at this point?
Ed Pitoniak: David.
David Kieske: It's David. Look, as I talked about, we reiterated our guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. John touched on the fact we'll get $250 million of incremental rent. And we think with an additional $1.5 billion of debt in and around 4%, you could probably - you can get pretty close to the AFFO impact there.
Stephen Grambling: Got it. And then I guess one other follow-up is just unrelated to that. Just as you've been looking at the strength of Las Vegas and the regional markets here, and I know you kind of talked to this in some of the remarks and the questions, but are you, at this point, starting to see either in bid processes or even in your own underwriting a shift away from underwriting to 2019 and now being willing to kind of think about a normalized run rate that is above that or even at the levels that we've been seeing?
John Payne: Stephen, it's John. It's a great question. I'll start by saying, boy, a lot of props to the operators in the gaming business right now. I mean our tenants - our public tenants have not announced their earnings, but you saw the earnings at Boyd and Red Rock and Monarch and Churchill and Sam's and others out there. And you do have to say, kudos to them for reinventing their business during this very tough time and showing incredible operating margins. I'll answer the question by saying, you really have to take an asset by asset, Stephen. You really have to go through and understand if there's an asset that's seeing considerable growth through the 2019 numbers, where are they getting and what segments they're getting and what margin are they getting it? How did they increase their margin? And this goes to my opening remarks by saying having expertise in our organization to be able to dig in, it allows you, if you are going to do a deal and do underwrite during this unique time to get a real good number that you're comfortable with on the EBITDAR level. And those are the type of things we'll do if there's an opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with CBRE.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe 1 for John or David, on the put call with Hosur Park and Indiana Grand racing. I think the window opens in about 6 months. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy and kind of managing the pipeline and what might convince you to exercise that sooner than later or hold off?
Ed Pitoniak: Before John - before John and David answered that question, John DeCree, I just wanted to point out, but everyone's benefit, the name of the firm that you are now associated with. Union Gaming, having become part of CBRE, I think is evidence of the fact that real estate - gaming real estate is in the institutionalization process when a company of the stature in global commercial real estate of CBRE besides this is the game that need to start playing in. So anyway, congratulations, John, and over to you, John Payne and David Kieske.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks Ed, I appreciate that. We're excited.
John Payne: Yes. Congrats, John. And John, to your question about the 2 Indiana tracks and casinos in Indianapolis. Our tenant has done a great job in taking those businesses over. You've probably been tracking the revenue levels there. They've also committed to large capital projects to both of those assets as table games has started at those 2 assets. There wasn't table games before that. Those construction projects continue. The business will take a little bit of time to stabilize after they get the capital projects in place. As you mentioned, the put call becomes active. It's 6 months from now. So we'll continue to watch these assets, see them grow. Obviously, we're partners with Caesars. The operator will continue to talk to Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker and understand what's going on there, and then we'll see how it ultimately plays out with the put call on the timing.
Unidentified Analyst: And maybe 1 for Ed on his favorite topic today and 1 that's near and dear to us on the institution of casino real estate. One of the questions we've dealt with over the past several years, Ed, as you have as well is some of the holdouts on casino real estate, some of the operators who've been a little bit more reluctant. But since probably 1 of those camps as we would have looked at and as you suggested earlier, but as cap rates continue to compress, I think the opportunity just gets more and more compelling for operators to consider you as a financing source. So my question, Ed, is at this current trajectory, do you think that over time, the majority or vast majority of casino real estate will be owned away from operators like some of the other real estate asset classes over time.
Ed Pitoniak: It's a good - maybe hard to answer question, John. I do think so much of the answer comes down to what would the recipient of the proceeds do with the proceeds, right? And I think what you're seeing so far, John, is that the propco model, the participation of a REIT is really valuable when an operator wants to grow and/or when an owner of an asset wants to exit entirely. You've not seen a whole lot of sale leasebacks undertaken for the sheer sake of financial engineering at this point, right? Which is probably healthy and sound. I mean, this should be done when an operator has a compelling use for the proceeds, whether to reinvest in their business, to grow their business, or otherwise achieve liquidity or for partners who need that liquidity. There is no question, John, that the fullest value of an asset will be realized with an opco propco model. It's really going to be up to the owners of the assets as to how they want to crystallize their value and when they want to. And to be honest with you, selfishly, if this is a process that takes years to unfold that's better. Because if it unfolds over many years to come, which I think is actually probably the likely bet, it produces a more sustained growth pipeline and gaming real estate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Landenburg.
John Massocca: So it was notable that the Great Wolf asset you're providing the construction lending floor was next to a casino property, albeit when you don't own. In your discussions with Great Wolf, was that proximity an important factor in why they chose that location? And I guess, with the read-through for VICI, could you utilize the excess land in your regional casino portfolio to maybe do more deals with Great Wolf? I mean, especially now that you have this kind of financing agreement or understanding is that something that was kind of part of the conversation as you were [indiscernible]?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: John, good to talk to you. The proximity of the Perryville Colocation was not part of the discussion. I think what it does is create a very - such to create an experiential entertainment center, which will be great both for the Great Wolf asset as well as PEM and GLPI who owned that real estate. But Great Wolf was able to secure the site. It's right off of 95. It's - as you've seen with the indoor water park resorts over time, closer to the core as this sector has become more institutionalized, you go back several years. They were further away from urban areas and cheaper land in areas that were a little bit cheaper to build. So this is just a continued institutionalization of the indoor water park sector. As it relates to our lands, if there's an opportunity with 1 of our tenants to put into a water park on [indiscernible] we would be happy to provide capital for.
John Massocca: Okay. But it sounds like developable land right of 95 is kind of a premium. And so the reason why it was a good place to put a casino there is also why it's a good place to put in your water park.
David Kieske: Exactly
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. And John, if I were going to on [indiscernible], which maybe a weakness for, I would say that the power center of the future won't be retail, it will be experiential. And as John Payne could attest to, it's actually American tribal gaming operators who are really the first in gaming to realize that they have the opportunity to create experiential power centers around so many of the amazing assets that they've developed and are operating.
John Massocca: Okay. And then another kind of bigger picture question. You talked before about the potential for the frontage space in front us, can you just tell us right there on the strip, given the announcement from Caesars earlier this month that they're kind of going to renovate the main entrance to Caesars Palace, does that impact your outlook for that space at all the potential for development there? I mean could it accelerate it? Could it maybe reduce it given what [indiscernible] is trying to do with its main entrance? Just any kind of outlook there?
John Payne: We're very excited about what Tom Reeg and Bret and Anthony Cronto announced about our marquee asset and addressing the entrants and making it more welcoming. I think that's going to be a fantastic project. I think you're talking about the acreage that we own that's part of the Las Vegas lease in front of Caesars Palace. And I think that, that is just a great piece of real estate that I know my partners at Caesars continue to look at what is the most appropriate development that goes there for the long term of Las Vegas and bring that casino out to the strip. And I know they're continuing to look at it. So I'm not sure there's a connection between the making the front entrance right now more accessible and the new development. But I do know that, over time, it's a great piece of real estate that could be developed into just some world-class opportunity to attract more customers to that building.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich with SMBC.
Jay Kornreich: As gaming cap rate compression specifically in Vegas, may make it harder to find accretive deals, is this environment motivating you to look further into nongaming investments?
John Payne: I don't...
Ed Pitoniak: Go ahead, John.
John Payne: Yes. I don't think it's - I was going to stress earlier when we were talking a lot about the nongaming opportunity as we're clearly spending time doing that. It's not an either or David talked about this earlier, and we've been talking about this for a couple of years is we've got capacity to do both. We see a nice runway in gaming. We're going to continue to build relationships in gaming, which should lead as it has for 3.5 years to accretive gaming deals. But we have the capacity now to look in other sectors and other opportunities that fit within our portfolio and that would work for our shareholders. So it's important to know it's not it's not an either where we have the ability to do both, and we're going to continue to do both.
Jay Kornreich: Got it. And then just regarding the remaining up to $300 million of capital for the Great Wolf Resorts, do you have any guidance on potential timing of how they would call that down?
David Kieske: Jay, it's David. We don't have any guidance. I have to ask Great Wolf. But we do know that they've got a very robust pipeline. And as I mentioned, their customer continued to want to visit the water parks even and get back out and they've seen a very big resurgence in their bookings and their activity at their assets. So they're seeing a great opportunity to expand the platform here, and we excited to partner with them on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Ravi Baby on the line for Todd Thomas. You guys weathered the pandemic well with perfect collections. Can you comment on the impact of the Delta variant and the Nevada announcement earlier this seams being required in public places what impact could this have to casino traffic and activity?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's a good question, and we'll continue to monitor. I think you know when the casinos opened in Las Vegas and had tremendous demand at the beginning when they open, they did require a mask for employees and for customers. And then it's been over the past couple of months where masks have been removed. And as you said, Clark County is saying that the mass need to come back for the operators, for the employees and the guests. So we'll continue to monitor it as the entire United States is. But as we saw when the casinos opened up, there still is a tremendous amount of demand for Las Vegas and for the assets that we own the real estate for our operators. So just more to come, but they have gone through this before the end of 2020 and the beginning of '21 and they're prepared, and I'm sure there'll be another opportunity where mask will be removed, but we'll monitor that accordingly.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A portion. I will turn the call back over to Ed Pitoniak for closing remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody. We're excited about the continuing institutionalization of gaming as a real estate asset class and believe we are well positioned to continue driving spirit shareholder - superior shareholder value. Again, thanks and good health to all. Bye for now.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to VICI Properties’ First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded today, April 30, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are generally identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, project or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our first quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information available on the VICI Properties website. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning to everyone on the line and thanks very much for joining us today. Some of you may recall that I started our last earnings call on February 19, by pointing out the pre-call commentary on our earnings release concerning Q4 2020 and full-year 2020, pretty much to be still down to VICI meets consensus. And me being me, I couldn’t help more or less in reality consensus kind of messes the point. This is why I actually said exactly. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question, but we think it's also worth asking the consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining. If it called for growth, was it a lot of growth or a little of growth. In VICI’s case, we reported what we believe at the time back again on February 19, we proved to be a lot of growth, 10.8% AFFO growth for full-year 2020 and 24.3% AFFO growth for Q4 2020. Now with the Q4 2020 reporting period is well behind us, we know with certainty that VICI did indeed post the highest AFFO per share growth of any American triple-net REIT in 2020 for the year and in Q4 2020. 12 out of 19 American triple-net REITs reported AFFO per share declines in 2020. Among those triple-net REITs that grew that closes the VICI achieved 7.0% AFFO per share growth for 2020 for the year and 11.8% growth for Q4 2020. The average AFFO per share year-over-year change, and I’m emphasizing the word change and I don’t want to use the word growth because negative growth is an oxymoron. The year-over-year change in triple-net REITs in 2020 was on average negative 6.9%. As on February 19 and is one of the few REITs to restore guidance, we announced 2021 guidance calling for between $1.82 and $1.87 of AFFO per share. In a moment, David will reaffirm that guidance. If in 2021, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth will be approximately 12%. If you measure AFFO per share growth from 2019 to the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, you end up with the growth rate for that period that two-year, three-year period of approximately 25%. To put VICI's earnings growth into perspective, we encourage those who own our stock and those who follow us to dust off that old-school metric known as the price earnings growth ratio or PEG ratio. In the case of VICI or any other REIT that reports AFFO, we calculate PEG ratio by comparing the current AFFO earnings multiple to the projected AFFO per share growth rate. These two numbers, the AFFO multiple and the AFFO per share growth rate percentage, are then expressed in ratio to each other. A REIT that at a 16-time multiple of AFFO and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 16% would be said to have a PEG ratio of 1:1. A REIT that trades at a 16 times AFFO multiple and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 8% would have a PEG ratio of 2:1. Obviously, the lower the PEG ratio, the less you are paying for growth. The higher the PEG ratio, the more you are paying for growth if any is there. We encourage you to look at the current PEG ratios for America's triple-net REIT because 2020 was a decline year for so many triple-nets again 12 out of 19 triple-nets are AFFO per share declines in 2020. We suggest you look at their PEG ratios over the period of 2019 through 2021. Take each triple-net REIT's actual 2019 AFFO per share as the base, measure that against 2021 consensus AFFO per share and then compare the resulting percentage of change against the current AFFO multiple of the REIT. To make the measurement meaningful, you'll need to eliminate those triple-net REITs to show lower AFFO per share in 2021 than they did in 2019. And that, in fact, means, you have to eliminate eighth of the 18 triple-net REITs, excluding VICI, in our sample group. Yes, according to FactSet, eight of these 18 triple-net REIT shows consensus AFFO per share earnings for 2021 that are lower than 2019. Based on data either publicly available or through FactSet, the resulting average PEG ratio for triple-net REITs that showed 2019 to 2021 AFFO per share growth, again excluding VICI, is the PEG ratio of 2.5 to 1, meaning, of course, at the average current AFFO multiple for these REITs of 17.5, it's 2.5 times the average expected AFFO per share growth rate percentage of 7% for the period of 2019 through 2021. We encourage you to calculate VICI’s PEG ratio based on our current AFFO multiple and our projected AFFO growth percentage based on the mid-point of our guidance. Whether you measure our growth percentage for 2021 versus 2020, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 12% growth in AFFO per share or 2019, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 25% growth in the AFFO per share, we are confident you will end up with a VICI PEG ratio that stands up very well to the triple-net REIT group and likely any other American REIT out there. The follow-on question of course is, “Well, VICI, what about next year 2022 and the years after that?” Bear with me just a second. I'm now going to turn the call over to John Payne. He will tell you about our drivers of AFFO growth in 2022. And for the period beyond 2022, we believe VICI stockholders can feel confident in our robust embedded pipeline of property acquisition opportunities and as well our strong record at sourcing, executing and funding open market deal flow. John, over to you.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter of this year was a very exciting quarter for our company. On March 3, we announced the acquisition of the real estate of the iconic Venetian Resort in Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent growing VICI's revenue base by nearly 20% and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Importantly, we're acquiring over 8 million square feet of world-class real estate along the center of gravity on the Las Vegas Strip. The Venetian Complex is one of the top revenue generating real estate asset in the world and we are thrilled to acquire this property at a discount to replacement cost and at an accretive spread to our cost of capital. The Venetian checks many of the boxes that are crucial too successful real-estate investing. 1) Quality real-estate in a prime location. 2) Robust rent protection through an effective guarantee from an investment grade entity through 2023 followed by significant property level covenant protection. And 3) An incredible organization running the operations which will be supported by a palette of vast resources and incentivized by their own business model to grow profitably which ultimately enhances our rent coverage. Many of you closely follow the gaming Operators have undoubtedly heard that there recovering Las Vegas is accelerating. We hear customers have already returned in great numbers and convention and meeting bookings continue to grow. We are very bullish on the future of Las Vegas and look forward to growing our portfolio in this geography. In the gaming and leisure markets, our properties continue to showcase strength driven by new stronger operating model that we believe is here to stay. Many assets continue setting records as revamped operating models meet robust and consistent consumer demand. We are proud to be partners with the best-in-class Operators on our tenant roaster in wish them continued success. They deserve the upside there currently there enjoying. Over the past 42 months, we've acquired 14 assets deploying over $12 billion of capital doubling the size of our portfolio or making us the most active REIT in the gaming sector by very wide margin. As many of you understand the nature of our triple-net business model means do not operate or asset manage our properties on a day-to-day basis. This supports our team the ability to study and execute opportunities on behalf of our shareholders. Our diverse team of gaming hospitality and real-estate executives remains busier than ever working tirelessly to create one in America's leading REITs. We're very excited about the potential deal why and we see before, while the nature of gaming transactions are lumpy, we have delivered consistent acquisition activity enhancing our portfolio accretively on fair terms and with appropriate risk protection. From the day we started this company, we have strived to create sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe this is the basic principle should be a fundamental goal any successful independent REIT and we will work tirelessly on your behalf to continue grow in VICI creating sustainable fundamental value by enhancing our real-estate portfolio. Now, we'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance which are fully detailed in the press release we built the last night. As we've discussed, in the first quarter we announced our biggest transaction to date the $4 billion acquisition of the real-estate of the Venetian Resort in Sands Expo in Las Vegas which will significantly grow the left side of our balance sheet. Simultaneously, we maintain a relentless focus on our capital structure to immediately access the equity capital markets an approach we've taken to and stay one of this REIT to secure accretive long-term funding and ensure we build the right side of our balance sheet to endure any heavy weather that may come our way. On March 8, we completed a follow-on offering of 69 million shares of common stock in an offering price of $29 per share for growth proceeds of $2 billion through a series of forward sale agreements to fund the equity portion of the Venetian acquisition. Proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuing to the terms of the forward sale agreements. This equity along with an unsecured debt rate that we intent to execute prior to the transaction closing provides VICI with all the capital needed to acquire this world-class asset on a leverage neutral basis. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 0.01%, rated average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.9 years, nearly have no debt maturing until 2024. As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.4 times. This is in line with our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5.0 and 5.5 times. So, please note this ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage level as it does not include the full impact of income from the Eldorado Caesars transaction, meaning if you take into consideration a full 12 months of rent from that transaction, our pro forma leverage would be at the low end of our stated range. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity comprised of $323 million in cash and a $1 billion availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. In addition, we have access to approximately $537.4 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward. Turning to financial results, AFFO was $255 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 41.7% over Q1 2020, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 17.1% as a result of the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in June of 2020 ahead of this closing of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.2% for the quarter which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As Ed mentioned, we are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full-year 2021, in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning on January 2020, we were required to implement a CECL accounting standard which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Importantly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe, AFFO represents the best way to measure the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $1 billion $10 million and $1 billion $35 million or between a $1.82 and a $1.87 per diluted share. The pre-share estimates reflected dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreements assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forwarded sale agreements. And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start with the Venetian deal, congrats on that. Just curious, what are your expectations for Apollo to potentially do more deals down the road that could get moved into the master lease and offer some cross collateralization?
Samantha Gallagher: John?
John Payne: Yes. Hey, Barry, good morning. Good to talk to you. Look, I won't speak for Apollo and their plans of growth. Obviously, they're excited about this asset. We’re excited to be partners with them. I'm sure we'll continue to look at this space as others because of how great the operators have been in recovering from the pandemic. But we didn’t go into it that there'd be other assets rolled into this Venetian lease, but we'll just have to wait and see, Barry.
Barry Jonas: Got it. Okay, great. And then, City Center just sold two acres on a Strip for $40 million each. Pretty nice comp for you, I guess. But where do you think the market is overall now? And given that number, would you be a buyer or seller of Vegas land here?
John Payne: Barry, good talking to you about this. I sent out a couple of thank you notes when I saw $40 -- $40 million an acre. But in all seriousness, we got land - a tremendous amount of land behind our asset that Harrah's Las Vegas and Caesars has land as well behind their assets that Flamingo and the LINQ, and we continue to look to see if there's opportunities to expand the Strip deep in the Strip there. Whether we’re buyers or sellers, we’re just going to continue to look ways to grow our company accretively and continue to talk to folks to see if there's opportunities to make our assets and to create value with our real estate.
Ed Pitoniak: And, Barry, if I could just add, this is yet another example of investors and other real estate asset classes realizing the value of the Las Vegas Strip, right? And I know, Barry, you've heard us cite in prior conversations the fact that retail real estate along the Strip has traded in the last 10 to 15 years at cap rates that start with either three or four, right? And this trade of those two acres is another indication that retail real estate investment along the Strip us further advanced in terms of valuation and the gaming real estate, but that's part and parcel of the institutionalization story we've been talking about with you for the last 3.5 years. Over time, the world is going to recognize the gaming real estate along that Strip should be considered just as valuable as retail real estate along the Strip for both fundamental reasons and frankly secular reasons.
Barry Jonas: Awesome. All right. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Stefan for Smedes. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you, do you have any updates regarding a new tenant at the Horseshoe Hammond? And then do you think regulators would be willing to be flexible around timing given they already granted the one-year extension?
Samantha Gallagher: John?
John Payne: Yes, Stefan, good to talk to you this morning. We don’t have any updates from the Indiana gaming regulars. We just have to wait and see their plans. They've always operated in the State of Indiana very fairly, and we'll just have to see how this ultimately plays out over the coming months.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then, you guys were creative in moving outside of the brick-and-mortar casino business with the Chelsea Pierstransaction. And then outside of the credit-enhancing benefits of iGaming, are there any other ways you’re thinking about participating in the growth of iGaming?
Samantha Gallagher: Yes. I think the - when we look at the emerging trends in gaming, iGaming is obviously an interesting aspect of it. And in this case, I'm not sure if you mean iGaming to also encompass sports betting. And it is sports betting that we as a REIT are most excited about as a secular technology-enabled trend behind the gaming business. As some of you've heard us talk about, gaming is a consumed discretionary sector. Gaming operators compete for consumer discretionary time and consumer discretionary spending. The way you increase your share into more discretionary time in spending is by increasing your share of mind. And the way you increase your share of mind is by increasing your share of voice. So, that you are ultimately top of mind when the consumer makes their spending decisions, spending of both time and money. And what sports betting is doing is giving gaming a much bigger share of voice and that was certainly demonstrated in the announcement Caesars made a week or two ago in terms of their new partnership with the NFL and I believe the seven NFL teams, they also partner with and it's obviously strongly exemplified by the media reach, the media and marketing reach that Barstool gives to Penn, another very important tenant for us. So, that's where our greatest focus is in terms of the emerging digitization of American gaming. We think it's being expressed most powerfully in terms of creating long-term value by greatly expanding the audience for gaming.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: Thank you for taking my question. I don’t know who wants to tackle this one. But as you guys speak out there today, Ed, kind of you alluded to it in the prepared remarks, I believe was John talking a little bit about the cost that have been taken out of the businesses and whatnot. When you think about in years past, synergies often drove kind of M&A activity, whether it was the larger portfolios plucking from smaller or vice versa. But synergies were always a big part of acquisition story. When you think about kind of the uncertainty of the future, you think about where kind of trading multiples are today for a lot of these names. And you think about kind of what really is left up on the synergy store would kind of cost us as they expand. Do you - how do you kind of envision the next, call it, six, nine, 12 months of M&A? Obviously, as someone who has been able to get a significant deal done?
Ed Pitoniak: John, you want to start?
John Payne: Yes, I'll start, Carlo. First, I want to give a shout out and just an amazing compliment to all the operators in the gaming space. And the results that are coming out that have been released are really amazing and operate in a new model in a very difficult time and showing margin improvements from 500, 600, all the way up to over a 1,000 basis points, Carlo. It's pretty amazing and sometimes it gets forgotten how hard that is the amount of work that the teams have had to do. And I just - our team has just tremendous respect not only for our tenants, operators who are tenants, but the others in this space. With that said, Carlo, you mentioned it right at the end is since we started the company in ‘17, we've been very active, we've been very fortunate to be able to do a large amount of accretive transactions for our company. And I just don’t see those conversations stopping at least would might play them back on the road back meeting with asset holders and Operators, I can't tell you obviously when the next deal will be for our company. But there is a great understanding now because of the time that we've spent in the other retailer space is how we of our nature can get into their capital stack. So, I think they'll continue those run rate in front of us that we obviously have in our embedded pipeline that even and outside our embedded pipeline.
Ed Pitoniak: So with that, I would add Carlo is that another factor driving in M&A right now and the part of Operators, that network effect is important and it's valuable if we can achieve it. In my own category is, curious on operations obviously they'll demonstrate it very powerfully. There were loads of network effect. And Caesars, Harrah's, last Caesars historically has obviously demonstrated that power of network effect. And I think, with the emergence in sports betting and what should be a very strong tailwind for gaming coming out of COVID, I do think that network effect is a much of factor in driving M&A right now for both bigger and smaller Operators, is that’s stepped my sense in specialty have.
Carlo Santarelli: Thanks John, thanks Ed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Adam with Loop Capital Markets.
Daniel Adam: My questions.
Ed Pitoniak: Hi Dan, sure.
Daniel Adam: So, in light of the major retail that was announced yesterday between Realty Income and very, I guess, what is your latest thinking on M&A not so much from a single property or asset standpoint but more along in the lines of our portfolio of assets or even a merger with another retail pacing triple-net. Does it make sense from your standpoint and are there any accretive opportunities out there for you guys?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, this is a good and intriguing question. And first of all, hats off to Canadian, the team at Realty Income. They are demonstrating what you can achieve when you have a superior cost of capital. Basically, the better and better your cost of capital gets, the wider your funnel gets when it comes to generating growth. I would say for the time being, we are so most fundamentally focused on defining what it will mean in the decade and decades ahead to be an experiential REIT. And at this point, we cannot identify another REIT out there that has a critical mass of experiential real-estate at the kind we want to invest in. But having said that, we are obviously very mindful at the end of every day, the beginning of every day that we work for our shareholders. And if we determine especially in constitution with our shareholders that the time has come when we should be considering such M&A, we will absolutely do so. We're not dogmatic about anything except for the fact that we think we want great real-estate and half of our shareholders. So again, we really do believe that experiential is going to be the best place to invest given the secular trends behind experiential. Those secular trends were already in evidence before COVID. The consumer preference for experience over things were very strong before COVID and when then our aid has proved it during COVID, we're already starting to see come back not only with our Operators but other experiential sectors. And if you combine that secular trends with the demographic trends that are in place whether it'd be baby boomers moving into their prime leisure years and millennials entering family formation. Experientials is really where we want to be. And if we're going to continue to grow our experiential portfolio, we're going to need to do it and want to do it by frankly discovering and mining white space with triple-net REITs that's not conventionally played in.
Daniel Adam: Thanks for the color, And then David, you've really done a tremendous job over the past three years strengthening the balance sheet. And earlier this month, S&P revise its outlook on VICI to positive from stable. I guess, to the extent we guys get upgraded to investment grades over the next 12 months? What does that mean from an incremental cost of debt perspective and with lower debt cost potentially expand a universe or M&A targets from an accretion standpoint? Thanks.
David Kieske: Yes, thanks Dan. In terms of the incremental improvement in our cost of capital from investment grade, I mean it obviously depends on the debt markets overall but if you look at historical spreads, it's 50 basis points to a 100 basis point or a 150 basis points, sometimes 200 basis points of improvement in rates for investment grades versus rates in the unsecured high yield market which we're currently in. Yes, I think our past with investment grade is probably not quite 12 months, I mean it's 12, 24 months from now is as most folks know we need to get rid of that $2.1 billion term loan that's outstanding in on income where our balance sheet. But, the overall goal from day one is to get to that investment grade credit rating, talking really lower our cost of capital and that exactly your point and then it makes our transactions our ability to pay. Increases our ability to pay and increases the accretion that widens our funnel and allows us to do more accretive deals going forward. So, it's something we're highly focused on and we talk to the agencies frequently and we were pleased to see S&Ps and we look forward that came out to U.S.
Daniel Adam: Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore.
Rich Hightower: Good morning guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Hi, Rich.
Rich Hightower: Hi, Ed. I was going to say thank you for your profits surreal treatment of the humble PEG ratio. I'm sure that was helpful for everyone.
Ed Pitoniak: You couldn’t see it, Rich. But I was actually smoking a pipe when I did that.
Rich Hightower: That's awesome. I wish I could see that. Well listen, I want to go back to the Venetian deal for a second. And when we think about other private equity involvement in gaming REIT structure so far, it's been in a I guess what I would call a permanent capital structure which I believe might be the thing from Apollo structure and having investment from one of their sort of traditional private equity fund. So, as you think about maybe the risk down the road of a potential exit by Apollo. How do you sort of underwrite that risk and replacing the Operator if I'm thinking about that correctly, how do you sort of PEG that, guys?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start Ed, and turn it over to John and David, Rich. It is obviously a question that we're dealing with or that these dealings will be. What we're very confident at is that Apollo is coming into this with a very clear vision of how to value that how you had been always been working a lot of sectors. And I have never seen the depth of Bill Johnson fall in when underwriting like ISR in this case. They did very much of their credit, they did primary research. Primary, proprietary research to determine among other things what exactly is the outlook of meeting players across America. And I'd say that is one example of the depth that Bill Johnson did lots of this and the credibility they’re bringing to their strategic and their business plan. And then, when it comes down to it, private equity firms obviously tend to exit when they created a lot of value and conceptualize that value. So, our prevalent assumption is, they will exit when the asset is performing very well and when the asset will be very attractive. Would be in whatever structure the exit takes place. And at this point, I don’t think that's predefined, whether by then it's been a platform that gets taken public or whether it's still a single standalone asset. It'll nonetheless be a single standalone asset as John has said in his remarks is, we believe the highest of using few more assets in America's real-estate. So, we really think when about this Rich and excited to see what they're going to do especially --
Rich Hightower: Ed, you still there, sorry I think it's breaking up on me.
John Payne: Rich, this is John, I think we lost Ed in that answer. I think you just going to add an excited, as you've been following the rebound in Las Vegas and I'll quickly that various business obviously the regional business as we've been talking about, quickly that the businesses are rebounding there and the rebooking windows that people are seeing are filling up. So, I think that's how we could end that question.
Rich Hightower: Okay. It sounds very right. Thanks John, I'll hop out of the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James.
R.J. Milligan: Good morning, guys. I have a question for Ed, because we have the analyst add on at the start of the call, but John I guess you're going to get it for me.
John Payne: I'll get that one, that won't be as fine with that. So, go ahead.
R.J. Milligan: I'm sure it'll be a great answer, John.
John Payne: Yes.
R.J. Milligan: We're still seeing cap rates north of 6% for gaming assets in general and at the same time we're seeing some retail assets, net leased assets trading on the five some even in the fours. And I guess, John do you think cap rates for gaming assets accurately reflect risk today, what potentially pushes them lower and then do you think that would be a positive or negative for VICI?
John Payne: Well, I'm actually going to, David's going to take this answer that we've been talking about this quite a bit. So, David you want to step in and try to get some color while we wait for Ed to come back?
David Kieske: Yes. R.J., I get to get here. And we do first part is to be actually accurately reflect the risk. No, I think we've then why we want to acquire as much as we can in that as we can you really think the risk is mispriced. I think ultimately, people will continue as they have done over the last three plus four five years understand the strength and really demonstrated by the last 12 months if we go back to our call a year ago what we were talking about closings and some every casino in the world. And the business model and the resiliency of our Operators with the ability to maintain rent throughout one of the worst pandemics in history highlights the strength of our cash flows and obviously the resiliency of our real-estate. As John mentioned in his remarks around the levels of conversation and we've factored all of you let this before that there are new entrances looking at gaming because they realize well that's the sector where the consumer hasn’t done the replacement for the experience. And it's a sector that is making money versus other entertainment leisure hospitality sectors that are still talking about cash burn around on turned finally turning the corner from cash burn to slightly cash burn positive. So, I think that's the opening driver that continues to push cap rates lower because you have more entrance and more fluidity in the transaction market like you see in broader real-estate sectors.
R.J. Milligan: And so, if that does happen over time, do that then increase the desire for which you'd go out and look at non-gaming assets?
David Kieske: I don’t think it's in either or gaming by the magnitude is the of the assets and the cash reserves, the majority of our spectrum, but -- mostly peers and we've talked to with all of you in the past. We stood the other sectors and meet with other Operators to understand where we might be able to expand into non-gaming and states that may not have gaming to give us a diversified portfolio real-estate or with Operators like the Chelsea Piers team, does have a have a phenomenal business model that are essentially casinos without gaming that have multiple levers, multiple business drivers, multiple revenue streams and a customer base that is very varied resilient and some loyal to that experience.
R.J. Milligan: Great, thanks David.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Bender, Macquarie.
Jordan Bender: Hi, good morning. Are you starting to see the number of companies looking or bidding on the assets increasing from pre-COVID levels? I guess, what I can make here is was the Venetian bidding process more competitive in what you've might have seen pre-2020?
John Payne: This is John, I'll answer that. We've seen many competitive good processes during our time over the past four years. Obviously, if you're in the business of gaining or you're in the business of real-estate that by the gaming assets and you're not interested in the Venetian, I'm not sure where you're spending your time. I mean, this is an irreplaceable iconic world-class asset center-of-the-Strip located. And so, it was a competitive process. There were people who were interested in this asset as many would be and we're again we're fortunate to partner with Apollo and come up with the structure that ultimately got the transaction done. I don’t know if there's more or less folks that would be involved in the processes. I will say I'll reiterate what David said, which is because gaming has performed so well coming out of the pandemic and there's still many hospitality or experiential companies talking about cash burn. Compared to the gaming companies, our tenants who are talking about record EBITDA levels, all-time record EBITDA levels and all-time margin heights that I do think it's caught many investors eyes that say well this is a business that the consumer did not find a substitute during this pandemic, we should look into it. And so, that leads to more competition, we'll just have to after see.
Jordan Bender: And then well, coming up on your seven eight years for the whole gaming REIT sector and we're sitting there roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion of rental revenue across this space. I was just wondering you can go over kind of your term and what you might think is left out there in terms of something that you would look at?
John Payne: You want to take that, David?
David Kieske: Yes. I mean, I think what this continue to be as we talked about, more folks looking at gaming, but the overall term continues to grow as you see the expansion of gaming in new jurisdictions, the Dallas and last November where there's six new jurisdictions in new entrance or new proposals for to seeing as Richmond, Virginia, obviously were we have to go for in Denver. So, as we think about the investible universe, we talked to you about $4 billion to $5 billion of buyable rents that's $50 million to $60 million, $70 million in buyable real-estate. But it's not a static number, it's a number that it was beyond that because you think about the ability for Operators to add towers, add rooms, add convention space, and that gives a great funding opportunities for VICI and then the new supply that comes in. Supply can cut both ways, we need to be cognizant of where the new supply is relative to our existing assets. But generally, it's a positive because it creates funding opportunities, increases the term. So, we're very optimistic about the future and our ability to continue to grow consistently year-in and year-out as we've done from day one with this REIT.
Jordan Bender: Awesome. Nice quarter and thanks for the color.
David Kieske: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.
John Payne: Hi, Stephen Grambling.
Stephen Grambling: Hi, Grambling both in our -- follow-up through, I can put as Carlos question on the regional market and strength in margins. As you look at the pipeline, kind of the strength in the regional markets impact, how you think about underwriting corresponding EBITDA coverage on rent.
John Payne: It's a great option, I mean this is where having expertise in-house that have run these assets with myself and Danny and in understanding how they're increasing their margin, where they're increasing their margin, which part of that margin is sustainable, where do we see there would be the risk. And so, as we think about any individual asset or combination of assets, where the margin has increased over the previous year, will study where we think it ultimately land the work with the Operator. If it's a bid process to see where they think it'll land and we'll underwrite accordingly.
Stephen Grambling: And then have seller expectations generally set, had been reset to that same level or how does that as negotiations been evolving?
John Payne: Well, it's not necessary that they set the level. They are forecasting where their business is going to be. They show what the previous three months or six months has been. So, there's actual numbers the forecast numbers. And again, if we're digging into the purchase of the real-estate of an asset with an Operator will dig into the historic EBITDA levels and margin levels where the new levels are and really study what is going to be sustainable. And that's how we'll ultimately come up with the appropriate starting EBITDAR that we underwrite the asset with the tenant if it's the sale I mean, with a current Operator, but say a lease back or with a new tenant, new Operator if it's a complete sale that we're going in with in our scope.
Stephen Grambling: Yes, I guess the question is, is there a aligning spread in terms of expectations from the Operators versus, I mean, the sellers versus what you're thinking here?
John Payne: We'd have to take, honestly you'd have to take that asset by asset and it's hard to say whether there's a widening or not, again will follow our process that we've done to acquire assets over the past three years.
Stephen Grambling: Makes sense.
John Payne: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: David, one for you. I know it's talking about escalators have CPI kickers in that. And can you just remind us what one could kick in near term, I think some are after a few years. Thank you.
David Kieske: Yes, thank you Thomas, good to talk to you. Overall, 92% of our rent is subject to CPI kickers. And the biggest one being Caesars both the Regional Master lease and the Las Vegas lease which takes effect every year November 1, so that kicked in that escalated last November. And in terms of, if you look at what didn’t hit it CPI's last year, but just given where CPI was versus the 2% bump in Las Vegas and the 1.5% bump in the regional leases. But, we like our CPI protections at something that we focus on in our leases and something that we think just given with all the talk around inflation out there. It differentiates such from the other two gaming REITs.
Thomas Allen: And then, I have some that don’t kick in for a couple of years or they all good to go this year?
David Kieske: There are certain leases that have kind of a one or two year, three year holiday depending on the lease. Hard Rock is 1.5 for the first four years and it's the greater is 2% of CPI after the Century leases 1% for years two and three and then one in the quarter or CPI had after. So, there is a holiday for depending on the lease and when we end close the transaction for a period of time. So, it somewhat tagged to other portfolio.
Thomas Allen: Alright, thank you.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.
Rich Anderson: Yes, SMBC. Good morning, everybody. So, on the Venetian, I'm wondering if you would be able to comment on what the cap rate might have been had Sam state on as the Operator. I know you're getting their backing for a few years. But perhaps, the market would have for everything that Apollo is and I don’t mean to throw them under the bus at all but that I wonder if it would have been a different price as Sam state on. Do you sense that or do you think it would had not add an impact on pricing of the asset?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, it's Ed, Rich. Because its talking is bad and I apologize everyone for dropping off hearing my answer to Rich Hightower. That is a very interesting question that no one's actually asked before. It probably would have been a factor given their investment grade. They're obviously very well serviced, they are the I guess multi cap gaining company in the world. So, hypothetically yes potentially. I do think though Rich, it's also worth reiterating that this deals have placed at a very idiosyncratic time in the market. A time in the market where a whole lot of would be bidders or sidelined because of uncertainty. This full process began at a point in late mid-to-late Q4 when the world was well when the U.S. was at a point of COVID resurgence that was causing a lot of uncertainty. And that's we were able to take action with Apollo at a time when many others couldn’t or wouldn’t. And that is that too was a fundamental factor in the price we ended up paying.
Rich Anderson: They say never waste a good crisis. So, obviously excellent transaction for all parties. The other question I have is and sort of alluded to earlier in the call, but I didn’t really get quite the answer in terms of future M&A and other Operators engaging with REITs. What do you think the main holdback is for anybody who's not sort of done business with the gaming REITs. What's the negotiating hiccup has kept them on the sidelines to this point in and do you expect that you'll see that sort of answer get that question gets answered so that there is even more players involved?
Ed Pitoniak: And just be clear in terms of what you're asking, Rich. This would be what is kept would be sellers from selling?
Rich Anderson: Yes, or Operators you know win for example. Those that have not engaged the REITs in any way to finance their assets.
Ed Pitoniak: I think the most fundamental issue Rich, or the most fundamental question for any Operator is well what would I do with the money. Right?
Rich Anderson: Yes.
Ed Pitoniak: And selling simply for the sake of selling, selling for this simple sake of finance or engineering nonetheless take the question what would I do with the proceeds. And frankly, when John and the rest of our team, we are the Operators. We always say you need a good reason to sell. And that really then breaks into next question is what would you do with the proceeds. And what we really preach frankly is we should have a compelling use for the proceeds and we fundamentally believe that funding growth is a tremendous use of proceeds because if you receive proceeds or a sale lease back, you're receiving proceeds that have the fact though equity. Because we never ask them the money back. And you can then deploy that the factor or preferred equity at a price that is even with the training up or begin your Operators there's still deeper equity and make a raise and we open the market. And I do think one of the dynamics that’s had work right now is the dynamic of network effect of growing store count. And that I think is already creating and we'll continue to create transactional liquidity.
Rich Anderson: Alright, good stuff. Thanks, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.
David Katz: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, you've covered a ton of ground. I just wanted to ask quickly whether there are mature international markets that would be inside or outside the boundary of consideration. Not that you don’t have quite a bit to do domestically but it's just sort of crossed the consciousness.
Samantha Gallagher: John?
John Payne: David, and good to talk to you, wish I could see you all. Yes David, and these are areas that we continue to looked at, if there's opportunities north of us in Canada or other countries that could fit into our reformat and be good REIT income. We'll continue to understand if there's an opportunity for us. So, we got to pass it at you that we got expertise to look there. You all rightly do have a strong embedded pipeline to continue to grow our company in the coming years without any new deals. But that does not stop, it's from understanding where there could be opportunities more we could help a good sent company grow by monetizing their real-estate.
David Katz: Right. And that could encompass pretty much the entirety of the planet so to speak as long as it meets the criteria?
John Payne: Yes, as long as it meets, we got to understand the tax situation, it will lull the only real-estate, a variety of other things, if they can work we'll tend to look at it.
David Katz: Got it, perfect. Thank you, very much.
John Payne: Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: I'll just add to David's question that. Our business model is one as well that it enables us puts us in a position that could pave to grow internationally very cost effectively. And just to dramatize the efficiency of our business model. If we use 2018 as a base year, since then on an annualized basis, we’ve grown our rent and because of triple-net that’s our NOI by approximately a billion dollars. And growing our NOI by a billion dollars has passed us only about $1.5 million to $1.8 million of incremental cash to G&A. I feel like, I’m glad it went to heaven with VICI because we can grow and grow very quite protectively and there is no reason that lies well to creating global reach, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming.
John DeCree: Thanks for taking my question. Covered a lot of ground as David had indicated. So just two questions maybe. One, first on construction costs, we’re seeing those creep up and I think some of your Operators are looking at developing projects. You mentioned a comment in your prepared about the purchase price of an issue being below replacement cost. So, we think about M&A activity and cap rate compression, I think we’re seeing some of the highest increase in construction costs that we have since you guys became public. Are you hearing that from your partners, is that pushing more people to M&A, would you expect that to be a gating factor going as some of your partners look to grow?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. John, I don’t know that we’ve seen a lot of evidence yet that commercial construction costs are accelerating anywhere near the way that residential construction costs are accelerating, I mean, like to deploy was gone from 17 bucks to 42 bucks in recent months. But, there is no lot of commercial construction that deals with whole lot of plywood. So, it remains to be seen what will be, in fact, in commercial construction. I could just say though, being in the meeting, convention business as our Operators are especially in Las Vegas. When there is a glorying construction sector in the US that tends to be a very good thing for Las Vegas and for the regional market and not just when Con Agar connects both or the world of concrete shows up. That’s all part and parcel of growing it, really good for our Operators and that’s it for us.
John DeCree: Very true, thanks Ed. And just separate note, the Venetian acquisition increases your exposure of rent going to Las Vegas quite a bit, you probably get this question every quarter and in some capacity also. Lot of your ropers and contracted opportunities are around the Las Vegas Strip, we had talks at length of how attractive the market is. But in the near to medium term, in your M&A or your acquisition approach, do you look to maybe be a little bit more active away from the Las Vegas Strip or is that less of a consideration just given the favorable dynamics that the Strip has right now?
John Payne: Yes. John, good talking to you. When we announced the Venetian, we were very clear that we, after the Venetian is closed, we will still be getting 58% of our rents from regionals and 42% from Las Vegas. And as you mentioned, we do have ropers, but don’t forget the very exciting foot call that we have and two large Indianapolis asset that would be in region. So, I think our plan continues to be to have a diverse portfolio as a mix of Las Vegas and again, you heard me say John, I like the downtown area of Las Vegas, I like the regional part of Las Vegas and I like the Strip where we’ve asset today. And then, I think you all see us continue to add to our portfolio in other region. So the key is that we’re going to remain balanced and diverse as we’ve since we started the company.
John DeCree: Very good, thanks John, thanks Ed.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Hermann with Baird.
Peter Hermann: VICI open in a mall in Western Pennsylvania of all places, I was wondering if you give us sense for the kind of appetite you think Operators would have in expanding the real said footprint into malls at this particular asset, would form well down the road? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, it’s a good question and you’re correct. [Indiscernible] opened a live asset in west mall in Pennsylvania. It would be interesting to watch it with a supplement license in Pennsylvania where they add it, somewhat they call smaller like and you mentioned they’re opened in a mall whether other state beside the licensing process, either add to licenses that are in restrictive stage 4 as new states open specifically saying, we’re going to use it as a redevelopment tool and the site is this mall that’s not doing too well. We just have to wait and see the asset that they built and my understanding is very naïve and is a unique way of using real estate in different way and we will just continue to monitor and I am sure other states are looking at how that all plays out, but I think we’re in early innings there.
Peter Hermann: I appreciate the response, thank you guys.
Operator: And your last question comes from James [Indiscernible].
Ed Pitoniak: James, are you there.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Can you hear me?
Ed Pitoniak: We can now, yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Following the Venetian transaction, when do you think that implies the value of Caesars power?
Danny Valoy: Yes that’s a great question that goes out with James. One would think, the value of Caesars power is quite high and it should be as was obviously the value of the garage here when Blackstone made what we think is a tremendously attractive and valuable purchase of brand. And then again MGO brand. Again, doing comparable commercial real estate asset, the revenue productivity, the profit productivity of these assets was really unviable by just about anything else there. When we announced to the nation, we invoked iconic examples or analog like the GM building, like the biggest Amazon distribution center that [Indiscernible] has owned outside of Seattle. These are assets that are just tremendously valuable and we own them and they’re occupied by tenants that are on leases that are effectively 35 years to 5 years and the like. I need to put a fine point out, contracting to buy the Venetian at $4 billion and $250 million of rent, we watered amount of rent, the average triple that we have to do a thousand. A thousand store acquisitions to equal what we bought in the Venetian, right. The top triple-net REIT in America, the average rent per store is $250,000, right. We bought $250 million in one asset and we bought it with the lease term of effectively 50 years weighted average lease term, a lot of these $250,000 boxes is in the same digit. And I think James, as more and more investors into real estate to public equity understand our model of tremendously resilient, a 100% rent, cash rent collection for VICI in 2020 as they realize our weighted average lease terms and they realize that we escalate our rent with GPI tickers. I don’t know if you can find a better viability matching real estate investment especially if you’re a long viability investor like a pension fund, then gain real estate.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for the color, Valoy. I’ll leave it on that.
Danny Valoy: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no more questions at this time.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. Let me just close out by reiterating our thanks to all of you for being on today’s call. We’re proud of the growth that we provided to our stockholders this quarter and believe they’re very well positioned to continue delivering industry leading growth and driving shareholder value. And as John pointed out, we’re very excited about continuing growth prospect of our tenant partners here at the forefront of the reopening of America’s leisure economy. Again thank you and good health to all.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-19 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 19, 2020 [Sic] [2021]. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Please go ahead.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information available on the VICI Properties website. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. If for any reason you hang up or the line goes dead in the next 30 seconds, here's the one message I want you to take away from this call. In 2020, according to FactSet consensus, two-thirds or 14 of 21 U.S. triple-net REITs are projected to post year-over-year declines in AFFO per share. In 2020, as David Kieske will elaborate on in a moment, VICI's AFFO per share grew 10.8% for the year as a whole, and grew 24.3% in the fourth quarter. In a year 2020, when again, two out of three peers are likely to see declines in the AFFO, we think VICI's growth is worth remarking on. But it's been interesting to see commentary so far, which can be pretty much reduced to VICI achieves consensus AFFO per share. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question. But we think it's also worth asking did consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining? Is it call for growth? Was it a lot of growth or a little of growth? Once all triple-net - American triple-net REITs report their 2020 results, we know with finality where VICI's AFFO per share grow stands on a relative basis. We already know where it stands on an absolute basis, and it is growth we're very proud of, especially coming out of the year so tough and so thoroughly dominated by the COVID-19 crisis. As I said in our Q3 2020 earnings call, what the COVID-19 crisis has taught us across the U.S. REIT management spectrum, is that the strength of the REITs business model is the aggregated strength of the REITs tenants business model. And for gaming REITs generally, and VICI specifically, the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that our gaming tenants have built business models of great strength and durability, and the strength and durability of their business models is derived from the strength and durability of their relationship with their customers, the end users of our real estate. This strength of the gaming operator, gaining customer relationship is a key lesson I take from 2020. This strength of relationship and the mission criticality of our real estate to that relationship is the key reason we, VICI, collected 100% of our rent in 2020 on time and 100% in cash. It’s the key reason we were able to announce what we believe is one of the larger 2020 dividend increases among large cap American REITs. It's a reason we were able to go back on offense as early as June with our Caesars Forum financing, and later in the summer, our first non-gaming financing with Chelsea Piers. Finally, it’s the driving force behind our AFFO growth in 2020 and our AFFO growth trajectory coming into 2021. But there's a second lesson I take from 2020, and it's a lesson, the clarity and power of which truly burst through in the second-half of 2020. And that is the emerging power of sports betting within the American gaming ecosystem. As gaming real estate owners, we aren't as focused on the TAM of sports betting revenue. So, of course, we hope our tenants realize as much revenue and profit as they can from this new channel of business, whether online or in property. As real estate owners of assets that we will own and our tenants will occupy for decades to come, we believe sports betting will have the greatest long-term impact and create the greatest long-term value by greatly expanding the audience for American gaming. American gaming is an American consumer discretionary sector. Every American consumer discretionary sector competes with the attention, time and spending of the American consumer. If a given sector can achieve competitive advantage in gaining and sustaining the attention of a potential new customer or consumer, that sector will likely generate outsized growth and value in the years to come. For American gaming, as an American consumer discretionary sector, we strongly believe sports betting represents a new competitive advantage. What we believe sports betting does most powerfully is insert American gaming more broadly and deeply into the American conversation. Think about it. What are the two great mainstays of getting an American conversation going? Number one, weather; number two, sports. You’ll see as the day ever comes when casinos offer betting on weather, but today is now here when sports betting is getting powerfully woven into the all-consuming American conversation about sports. Just to say two examples, involving two of our tenants, every time the Caesars sportsbook gets cited exclusively on ESPN, and every time Penn is able to deliver a sports betting message to REITs partner, Barstool, each of these great American gaming companies is reaching an audience of potential new customers, especially potential new and younger customers. The American gaming sports betting represents a new and technology-enabled paradigm for reaching, engaging and activating a new, bigger and younger audience. This technology-enabled paradigm is a new tailwind behind American gaming. And if you look at REIT asset class performance over the last few years, the winning asset classes in terms of superior total return that tends to be asset classes with technology-enabled tailwind. Cell towers, data centers, and e-commerce logistics are just three such examples. Conversely, the asset classes that have struggled tend to be those suffering from technology-related headwinds. We believe with high conviction that the gaming real estate asset class should, in the next few years, benefit from the technology-enabled tailwind. So all in all, 2020 was a year in which American gaming and American gaming real estate proved its defensive strength by enduring through one of the great crisis of our lifetime. And 2020 also showed, thanks to the growing strength of sports betting that American gaming arguably represents one of the most compelling offensive opportunities in the consumer discretionary sector in the coming years. The next sound you hear will be the sound of the American consumer roaring back. And as many of you have been writing about, after many months of consuming many things, American consumers will return to what has been their growing preference for the last two decades; the preference for consuming experiences over things. As some of you may have heard on the Sunstone Hotel Investors earnings call last week, our good friend and Sunstone CEO, John Arabia, cited transient bookings for the second-half of the year at their Maui property that are currently double-digit 13% above 2019 levels, and the outlook continues to improve on a weekly basis. We believe this is one of the many anecdotes around pent-up leisure demand that will benefit the consumer discretionary sector at large and the economy continues to reopen. I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne, who will talk about what we have done and moreover, what we are doing to capitalize on the roaring comeback of the American consumer. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. 2020 was another busy year for VICI as our hard work continues to pay off. In 2020, our team completed nearly $4.6 billion of transaction activity, growing our annualized revenue by approximately $360 million, or 37%. Throughout the year, we worked closely with each of our tenants as the pandemic unfolded to provide short-term solutions on and as needed basis. As Ed stated, our cash rent collection track record of 100% to-date is a testament to the quality and strength of our business model and our collaborative approach with our tenants. As you are undoubtedly aware, the recovery of the gaming industry has demonstrated that despite the many challenges over the past year, the consumer has not found a replacement with a bricks and mortar casino experience. Our portfolio of industry leading assets and regional markets continues to demonstrate margin expansion, and in some cases profitability above 2019 levels. While our Las Vegas properties, led by Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Corrado and the entire team at Caesars Entertainment continue to outperform peers on the strip. As we start 2021, we have the experience and credibility to explore opportunities both within and beyond gaming. And we're very encouraged by the volume and quality of potential transactions we see ahead. It is important to remember that for VICI, underwriting and investing in different sectors is not and either or. We continue to develop relations with gaming operators. We look for ways to support existing tenants’ growth, and we continue to spend time studying and meeting with operators in sectors beyond gaming, in order to be prepared to transact when the right opportunities come together. Our gaming investments will likely continue to dwarf our non-gaming investments, due to the sheer financial magnitude generated by gaming assets. However, we believe that growing our portfolio accretively through sector and geographic diversification, while maintaining prudent risk levels will yield the superior returns our shareholders deserve. We believe VICI is in great position to continue our industry leading growth. And we'll abide by the same principles that have driven our success to-date. We work hard with integrity to be the real estate partner of choice. We do fair deals, and we collaborate with our partners to create value for all parties. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and our guidance.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I want to start with our balance sheet. And since emergence, we've maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles, and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. 2020 put forth and VICI was able to navigate some very heavy weather, as we continue to transform our balance sheet, all while maintaining ample liquidity and never drawing on our revolver. Just to summarize, in June 2020, we raised $662 million of equity through a 29.9 million share forward sale agreement. We still have 26.9 million shares outstanding, representing approximately $547.9 million in remaining net proceeds as at year-end. In February 2020, we raised $200 million of net proceeds through our ATM program. And as we've discussed with many of you, we're on a mission of achieving an investment grade rating, and during 2020 we continue down this path. Last February, we closed on $2.5 billion of an unsecured notes offering comprised of a mix of five, seven and 10 year notes at a blended interest rate of 3.8%, continuing to stagger our maturity profile. $2 billion of these proceeds were used to fund the Eldorado transaction, and the remaining $500 million of these proceeds were used to retire the 8% secured second lien notes. During 2020, we significantly improved our composition in the weighted cost of debt. At emergence, we had 100% secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%, and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years. As we sit here today, 69% of our debt is unsecured, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18% and a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years with no maturities until 2024. As of December 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.8 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage as it does not include a full 12-months of income from the Eldorado transaction, meaning if you take into consideration of full 12-months of rent from that transaction, our leverage would be well within our stated range of maintaining a net leverage ratio between 5 and 5.5 times. And as of year-end, we currently had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity, providing ample flexibility for future accretive growth. Just to reiterate, 2020 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are, to maintain a disciplined composition and laddering of debt, whereby in any one year, we strive to have less than 20% of our total debt coming due, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility. We're going to opportunistically access the capital markets, to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and develop continued access in partnership from the equity and credit markets to finance accretive acquisitions. As I mentioned, our goal is to maintain a long-term target leverage ratio of between 5 and 5.5 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis, and ultimately migrate the balance sheet to that unsecured issuer and ultimately achieve an investment grade rating. Just turning to the income statement, total GAAP revenues in Q4 increased 57% over Q4 '19 to $373 million. For the full year 2020, total GAAP revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 37% over 2019. These increases, as John mentioned, was a result of adding approximately $360 million of annual revenues during the year from the closing of the Eldorado transaction, the Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage, the Chelsea Piers mortgage and the Jack Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loans. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $251.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share, bringing full year 2020 AFFO to $835.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. AFFO increased 28.7% year-over-year, while AFFO per diluted share increased approximately 10.8% over the prior year, which is due to the increased share count and resulting temporary dilution in the first half of 2020 from the June 2019 equity offering. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the significant increase in EBITDA, as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in high 90% range, when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter, which we believe represents a good quarterly run rate going forward, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.2% for the quarter, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As always, for additional transparency, we point you to our quarterly financial supplement for a detailed breakdown of our revenue and lease streams, which is located in the Investors section of our website, under the menu heading financials. We welcome any feedback on materials. Turning to guidance, we're initiating AFFO guidance for 2021 in both absolute dollars, as well as a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, going forward, our guidance will be focused on AFFO as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments, and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO guidance for the year ending December 31, 2021, is estimated to be between $1,010 million and $1,035 million or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share, which at the midpoint represents a 12.5% year-over-year growth in our AFFO per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the pending $26.9 million forward sale shares, assuming settlement of the forward agreement on June 17, 2021, the maturity date of the agreement. In addition, these estimates do not include the impacts of any pending or possible future acquisitions, dispositions, capital markets activities, or any impact in the incremental equity drawdown from these forward shares. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 per share, which represents an annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter was approximately 72%, in line with our long range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: Hi. Good morning, guys. Ed, thanks for your enthusiastic comments to start the call. It's maybe a valuable reminder that we on our side sometimes exist within our sort of narrow analysts speak bubbles, so I appreciate the reminder there.
Ed Pitoniak: My pleasure, Rich. My pleasure.
Rich Hightower: No, in all seriousness. But maybe I'm going to ask one sort of narrow question and then maybe a bigger picture question. But just in terms of really quickly on the Danville ROFR. Maybe just help us understand to the extent you can explain it at this point, some of the turns around that? And then, maybe I'm misinterpreting something here. But if I look at the roll through and sort of recompense for giving up the security of the master lease at Southern Indiana, how do we sort of pair the value proposition on either side of that, if that's an appropriate way to think about it?
Ed Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that?
John Payne: Rich, I'm not sure that that's the exact way I think about it. I think that ROFR just has an opportunity,, obviously as the operators need to decide at some point, if they ever want to monetize their real estate. We sure would like to have own real estate in a new market, which we think is going to do great well. We're very excited about the new tenant that we're going to have in Southern Indiana. I’ve known that The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for almost 20 years now from my old job when I worked at Caesars, and we're excited to help them expand their portfolio for the first time outside of tribal land. So, again, we - as you've seen with other deals, Rich, when we negotiate, and we do try to add to our embedded growth pipeline. And that's how this came about. In Danville, we'll just have to see if the operator ultimately wants to sell real estate.
Rich Hightower: Okay, I appreciate the color, John. And then a little bit from a bigger picture question, but also related to Southern Indiana. I know that the original press release stated 2.2 times coverage in the first year post-closing, so that puts us somewhere into sort of the mid to late 2022 by the end of that sort of measurement period. But take us into sort of the underwriting and how you gain comfort with what stabilized cash flows on this, or really any other investments are going to be over the next year or two? And how does the tenant and the landlord gain comfort in those – in that sort of ramp up, maybe as compared to 2019? Or how do we should think about it? Thanks.
John Payne: Yes. Rich, I'll go out this first and my colleagues can jump in. First, it starts with the relationship of understanding who your partner is. And as I just mentioned, I've been fortunate to have a relationship with the tribe and watch them grow their incredible business in North Carolina to record levels, as well as the regional business, Rich, as you know, has rebounded tremendously when there weren't many restrictions on the business. So the pandemic started in March and April, the casino shut down. But as they reopened in places like Southern Indiana, we've seen them open with the consumer returning to the business, as well as a margin or an operating model that's much more efficient than ever before. And I give great credit to our operators to do that. And so, as we went into this deal, we put all of those together, we talked to the tenant, we understand how they're going to operate business, and we develop the plan from there. But critical part is understanding how this business is going to rebound as the consumer comes back to it. We're very - again, I'll repeat, we're very excited to have them as our sixth tenant and running the Southern Indiana property.
Rich Hightower: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPM Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks, and good morning. Ed and John, you guys both talked about the importance of partnering with your tenants to drive growth. As you are thinking about non-gaming assets, is that equally important as you try to go down that path? Or do you think you may just have to bid on assets and other product types and try to get it going that way?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, the way we are approaching non-gaming is that we really want to pioneer into categories where REITs may not necessarily have been heavily trafficking and bidding and buying. We really have no competitive advantage in heavily marketed, heavily bid categories. And so what we're working hard to do, as we did in the case of Chelsea Piers, is identify either categories or subcategories, where we believe there are operators who have uniquely powerful, enduring relationships with their customers, and are producing economics that can support - more than richly support an OpCo/PropCo structure. It obviously takes a bit more time. But we're very excited about what we are learning and who we are meeting and who we're getting to know and the opportunities they represent. And I think, Tony, as we talked about with you around the whole technology tailwind theme, there are also cultural tailwinds out there, and we think there are certain experiential sectors, especially at the higher end we're going to have tremendous cultural and demographic tailwind behind them for the next 10 to 20 years. And that's where we see our opportunity. It's really not in the commodity categories of triple-net.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, great. And then for David, on the balance sheet, I mean, given what unfolded in 2020, and the performance of the portfolio. Any sense as to just how much more attainable IG might be in the near-term?
David Kieske: Yes. Tony, it's something that we've discussed the depth with rating agencies. We met with the agency several times during 2020, both on our regular checkup, but also as the pandemic was unfolding. And for us, it's really around the term loan. The term loan is secured by all, but one of our assets. And so we do not have a typical unencumbered asset pool like most traditional REITs do. So we need to refinance out of that secured term loan into the unsecured debt markets. And as we move into 2021 and into 2022, it’s - we will sequence that refinancing of that term loan potentially into 2023, part and parcel with what may come in the acquisition and the pipeline, what sort of funding we may need for additional acquisitions. So, it’s a - there's a clear path. GLPI has paved it and has proven that it's achievable tenant concentration. In of itself is not a gating factor, but just simply for VICI's cap stack and that term loan again securing all of our assets is - secured by all of our assets is the gaining item.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one last follow-up, on the other side of things. Just again, given the performance of the space through the pandemic, do you think that changes the discussion around yields on investments as we look ahead?
Ed Pitoniak: It should. If this category behaves the way, certainly so many other categories have Tony, that have undergone an institutionalization process. Yes, the prices should go higher. Our mission, we would work hard at every single day at VICI to make sure our cost of capital improves at a rate equal to or in excess of the velocity of cap rate compression. But it just stands to reason that these assets should attract higher prices as time goes on, as everyone recognizes that they came through really, a totally unforeseen magnitude of crisis. And making to better than just about any consumer discretionary sector out there as a real estate asset class, so yes, you have to think, especially as people truly start calling out from under the rock to COVID, that we should see what -- but frankly, I joined VICI four years ago, which is to take part in the next cap rate compression story in the American commercial real estate.
Anthony Paolone: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Grambling: Good morning. I guess a couple of follow-ups on the last few questions. First, as you think about any potential acquisition opportunities within gaming, are there any markets that you feel are more or less attractive or easier to underwrite given your current exposure? And can you weigh in on how that resilience of cash flow from operators may be impacting seller expectations around price relative to perhaps where the broader cost of capital is moved?
Ed Pitoniak: John will take the first part and David can take second.
John Payne: Yes. Absolutely. Good morning, Stephen. Look, there aren't any markets that we look at that we wouldn't study right now. We'd like the fact that we have a balanced portfolio. We've said that since we started the company, and I think we'll continue to have a balanced portfolio. We'd like to own assets in these regional markets, and we've talked about how resilient they've been and we've talked about how they change with operating model. But we're also big believers in Las Vegas ever since we started this company, not only assets on the strip, but also in downtown and local. So Stephen, we'll continue to turn over every rock and look at opportunities and all of the gaming market. That doesn't mean that we'll invest in every market, but we are sure we will take the time to meet with operators and talk about how they're thinking about how we can help them grow. And I'll turn it over to David to take the second part.
David Kieske: Yes. Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, I mix with pricing and kind of always think about capitalization. The pricing is maintained. The regional markets have come back. There is the level set, obviously not a lot of transactions, but the pricing in the regional markets is that or near where it was pre-COVID. TBD and Las Vegas, given a little bit slower ramp there. But as we think about our capital and our leverage, we're very focused on maintaining our leverage between that 5 and 5.5 times that we've talked about, that's back to Tony's question, something that's important for the agencies. And then a deal has to be accretive, where we talked with you all a lot about what we buy day one is what we live with for 35 years. So we have to ensure that we have the capital and underwriting is done on an on accretive basis to continue to grow our AFFO.
Stephen Grambling: That's helpful. And then a follow up on the comments around non-gaming, kind of non-heavily bid market opportunities. Should we interpret that any cap rates that you'd be pursuing in those markets could be equal or higher to those that you were pursuing in gaming? Or they're even a tolerance that as you look at some of these, because they are a huge asset classes that you could actually move down the top rate spectrum.
Ed Pitoniak: It could be. It could be all of the above, Stephen. The fact that they're not heavily bid could mean there are better bargains to be had. But it could also be exactly to your last point that that we can afford to pay and justify paying maybe a somewhat tighter cap rate, because of the nature of the asset, the risk profile of the asset, the barriers to entry, and what is very proven durability of the asset over the long-term. So, I hope this doesn't sound like sort of vague answer, but it will be so situation specific.
Stephen Grambling: Fair enough. That's helpful. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Barry Jonas: Great. Hey, guys. I wanted to start on your embedded growth profile or sorry, embedded growth pipeline. Any thoughts on timing there? Caesars has been talking about selling a strip asset. And I believe the Centaur call option could kick in starting next year. Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. So, you talked about something we're very proud of that we've worked on three years is building this embedded pipeline, with the deals that we've announced, and though we will continue to talk to our partner in Caesars about what they are seeing ahead, and what they are feeling about the Las Vegas market. And do they still see LA as they did when the Eldorado team took over Caesars but they may have one or two incremental assets that they don’t feel like they need in their portfolio, and they would end up going through a sales process. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're big believers in Las Vegas. We think that's the market that is going to rebound in all segments. And so they want to move forward with the sale. We're obviously very interested in owning more real estate of those assets that we have ROFRs. You also mentioned the put call of the two great Indiana assets in Indianapolis that come due, you're right on point, next year. And again, we'll continue to have talks with our partner about that. So two tremendous opportunities for us that we really worked on to develop over the years, with our embedded -- creating our embedded pipeline. As it pertains to timing, we'll just have to continue to have discussions with our partners on that.
Ed Pitoniak: Barry, if I could just add on something that kind of goes back to my opening remarks around VICI's growth in 2020. Someone could rightfully say, yes, okay, well, the markets already priced that growth in. And yet, what I don't think is being fully appreciated or valued in VICI is not only the growth we produced in 2020, and the growth trajectory that we bring in, in 2021. But the growth it is represented by that embedded growth pipeline, and just to get a little old school on you here, which I'm allowed to do because I'm really quite an old guy. I really encourage everybody to look at VICI on that old fashion, old school, price earnings growth ratio basis using our AFFO multiple in place of a PE multiple. And what you'll find especially looking over a multiyear period is that we will likely have in your calculations lowest peg ratios, you will find across the American REIT spectrum and certainly substantially below the peg of the S&P 500 at this current point in time. And again, I encourage a multiyear view because a lot of REITs are going to grow in 2021, because they shrank in 2020. And what you're getting with VICI a multiyear growth profile that goes into the future and just the way described Barry, thanks to the fact that in 2022, even if we couldn't get anything else done, we have got Centaur and the opportunity to call.
Barry Jonas: Yes. And then just one follow up, recognizing it's been done so far in concert with your tenant. But do you foresee any more dispositions or prunings in the portfolio?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Barry, I will have to continue to study that, but not specifically at this time. But we'll have to continue to understand would there be an opportunity.
Barry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes to Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you, you added a second native American tenant. And I just wondered, do you think this will be a trend to see more Native Americans moving away from tribal gaming into commercial gaming? And do you think you have maybe an advantage with two tenants in that wheelhouse already or sort of just touch on that a little bit?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes, it's a great question. It's exciting to see the tribes move into commercial gaming, because they've done so well in their original casinos. And so you're asking, will there be other tribes that will look at commercial gaming opportunity? I think there will be. And I think we do have relationships with numerous tribes, just based on my experience path, about 20 years’ experience working at Caesars and working the Native American tribal developments. So, we'll continue to, to meet with them, understand what they like to diversify outside their nation. And if they do, look for opportunities where we can work together. And I hope that trend continues, because I think it's quite exciting for the nations that are doing this audits that we've got a relationship with the Seminoles in the Eastern Band of Cherokees.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thank you. That's interesting. And then do you see, John, maybe are you seeing any sort of other entrants that have an incremental interest in their gaming industry now, given where cap rates are? And how, we will begin to expand on a relative basis? I know that sort of regulatory hurdles, but would you expect to see more foot players coming into the space?
John Payne: Yes, it's a great question. There's no doubt that the resiliency of the gaming operators during the pandemic has caught people's eyes. When a lot of industries are -- some are still talking about cash or burns, and regional gaming companies are talking about record EBITDA, it's going to catch the attention of many people that invest in the hospitality or experiential space. So, your question is, will others come into the space, there's no doubt that others are looking at it, because of how well these assets have performed and the magnitude of cash flows. But as you know, the operating business is quite complex, and it had some licensing requirements. But I do think over time, you'll see more groups getting into the business because it's not only the bricks and mortar, but to the Ed's comments at the beginning how exciting the growth path is, when you tie in sports betting and potentially I-gaming.
Smedes Rose: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys, thanks, John. I was wondering if maybe you could just address from a high level or almost a year, roughly into the pandemic era, and maybe go back to kind of prior to that and the nature of your discussions around deals. And I'm referring more towards terms whether it's coverage, things like that. And maybe just anything that's changed in the aftermath. Are people, potential sellers looking at different things? And I need that both from the Opco perspective, seller’s perspective, your perspective. Is there anything that stands out as having maybe been tweaked a little bit given the circumstances of pandemic, as well as the higher margins that we're seeing now, as well as the ancillary business lines and whatnot? Is there anything that you've noticed that's been dramatically different?
John Payne: Well, I'll start Carlo. I can't remember before the pandemic, what went on. I seem to have forgotten all of that. But no, look, I tried to have a constant dialogue, not only with our current tenants, but with all the operators in the gaming space. And I think as we think about underwriting, maybe we've talked more about rent coverage just due to what happened in the pandemic. But I think, Ed touched on this as well, it's just been exciting to watch the operators change their business model, or refine their business model so that when they come out of this pandemic, and I do believe we're going to come out of it, that they're operating these businesses just so much more efficiently than guys like I did 15-years ago. And that's exciting Carlo, and those are the type of conversations that we're having. As it pertains to transactions, I mean, we just continued to try to understand how the OpCos want to grow their business and is there an opportunity for our company to help them do that. And then obviously, there's a few levers of, if we do get into negotiations that you talked about, cap rate and coverage and escalation, all that. None of those have necessarily changed. So that's how I'd answer that question, Carlo. I don't know if Ed wants to add anything or David, but that's how I leave it.
Carlo Santarelli: That's helpful, John. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of at Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Security. Please proceed with your question.
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks. Do I have it right, the Caesars Southern Indiana is not on tribal land? Is that the case?
John Payne: Correct.
Todd Stender: Okay. Now does Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, does they benefit from lower regulations, lower taxes? How do you actually underwrite that one? That seems pretty unique.
John Payne: If you're asking about when they're the commercial operator Southern Indiana, they'll follow the same rules a commercial operator, whether it's Caesars or Penn, or any of them, the same rules will apply to them because the facility is not on tribal land.
Todd Stender: I understood. Okay. So as a tribal operator, you don't get all those benefits, if you're off of tribal land?
John Payne: They're very similar to the Seminoles in they are Hard Rock brand. I think you've probably followed that they have numerous casinos around the United States that they operate.
Todd Stender: Understood. Okay. Thank you, John. And did you share any information on the land and plans around the Danville, Virginia Casino Resort?
John Payne: Can you repeat? Did we share the what?
Todd Stender: The proposed plans. There's the right of first refusal around the Danville property. Are there any…
John Payne: Yes, that's a development project that is just getting started. So there's information about Caesars and they won the license and their development plan is there, but it's just getting started.
Todd Stender: Understood. Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line at Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Adam: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
Ed Pitoniak: Our pleasure.
Daniel Adam: So, you ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in total liquidity, including over $326 million in cash and $547 million that you have coming in from the forward share sell. You're in an envious position from a balance sheet perspective obviously. You're also arguably over capitalized right now. I guess, given your balance sheet strength, had you intend to deploy excess cash? And are there any near-term deals maybe in the next one to two quarters that are currently in the pipeline?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start there, Dan. I mean, Gabe and John can talk about the M&A landscape and outlook. But we have always historically I should say, we've kind of silly to use word always when the company is only about three years from its IPO as we are. But from the beginning, we have always tended to over equities the balance sheet in the interest of having firepower when opportunity strikes. And there may be a time -- there may have been a time some near-term dilution taken on, but that was near-term dilution endured for the sake of having a firepower to create long-term accretion to our ability to move very quickly when opportunity presents itself. We certainly do not intend to short change our shareholders, like keeping excess capital on the balance sheet for prolonged periods of time. But we're pretty confident, we're going to be able to put that capital to work.
Daniel Adam: Okay, great. I don't know. I guess, John, nothing to follow up on.
John Payne: No, I think Ed had talked about. Look, I'm spending my time, it's nice to be able to talk to the operators where, they're now focused on how to reopen and how to be safe. And they've done all that. Right now they can begin to talk about how do we grow and where do we want to go and how is the sports betting helping attract new customers and those things. And so it's nice to begin to have the growth conversations again.
Daniel Adam: Okay great. And then -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Dan, I was just going to add, I think one of the emerging dynamics that is powerful and positive is the growing recognition of the value of network effect in American gaming. Harrah's and then Caesars, obviously were the pioneers of true network effect in American gaming, and would still widely be considered to be the leaders through the power of Caesars rewards. But I think increasingly operators are recognizing in part because of sports betting that there is genuine value in creating network effect, and being -- having stores in as many jurisdictions as you can. And that we think is going to be a powerful force, especially once COVID clears away and continuing to drive M&A, and with a lot of the M&A driven not so much by the sellers need to get out as the buyers intense desire to get it. And there are markets in which buyer demand can create incremental supply.
Daniel Adam: That makes sense. I think you're alluding to market access, right, if I'm not mistaken.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. For our market access, also, and true market access being more valuable onto yourself and more valuable to your partners. Whether it be Barstool or William Hill, FanDuel, DraftKings, whoever your partner may be.
Daniel Adam: Great. And then just turning to the non-gaming side. So last quarter, you alluded to the potential for follow on transactions with the Chelsea Piers. Do you have an update on the timing of any such follow on deals? And how might a transaction be structured? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: David, do you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes. Dan, good to talk to you. Look, as we've talked about with Chelsea Piers, it's opened the doors open their eyes open increase the dialogue around non-gaming in a descriptive way in the beginning, right non-commodity, high quality real estate. And with any deal, we can't talk about specific timing and whatnot. But we would continue to meet with, discuss with and have conversations with great operators that have great real estate that might fit in our portfolio. So, can't say exactly when the next deal will come. But we're optimistic that there will be some more non-gaming this year. But again, it's just to reiterate what John said, it's not an either or. We're very active on the acquisition front and as we've started the conversation working to deploy that capital that we have on our balance sheet.
Daniel Adam: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please proceed with your question.
John DeCree: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Ed, and then a follow up for John. Ed in your prepared remarks, you talked a bit about the sports betting expansion and how that's such an exciting opportunity for the industry. I think a lot of folks can really see the clear picture of how that benefits your tenants and indirectly you guys, with higher rent coverage and higher revenue. But I'm curious if you have thought of or identified any ways that if VICI could benefit directly, and not referring to sharing in revenue or anything like that? But if there's an opportunity to fund themed sports books or look at your leases a little differently, given the earnings growth potential of your tenants and potential tenants. And just seeing if there's ways you can maybe find direct ways to benefit from this big industry trends.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very good question, John. And that would certainly be probably the most meaningful way, which would be a capital provider as great operators envision and execute what the whole sports betting sports culture sports viewing experience can be within a casino. John, I don't know if you've had a chance yet to go to Derek Stevens, new asset in downtown Las Vegas. But it is a great example. John has been there. John, our John Payne has been there. And John, maybe you can talk about it as an example of what we would certainly be happy with our tenants to fund, given the magnitude of vision that Derek has realized there. John Payne?
John Payne: John, you might have been there. It's a really well done brand new facility in downtown Las Vegas that is centered around really a lot around sports betting and the uniqueness there and the type of customer that likes that type of facility. And so, anyway, it's just a great example of the trends that are going on right now in the first build from scratch casino during this what I'd say, sports betting trend or let's say since it's a really neat place.
John DeCree: It is. It's a great place. I was thinking that. I was thinking Barstool teams sports books and those types of things. So it sounds like, let's say if a large tenant was going to refresh and rebrand, VICI could be a capital provider for that shareholders in exchange for some of it. Great. John, a question for you. You've experienced this through quite a few development cycles nationally. And it seems like we're on the horizon of one here in the U.S. And a lot of investors new to the space are always trying to calculate the PAM and number of assets. And we've got some developments, Nebraska, Virginia, Danville for you guys. New York talking about expanding casinos downstate. I mean, Texas is one that I probably would have never thought I'd be having that conversation again. But it's being talked about. So in your experience, kind of curious to get your thoughts realizing no crystal ball here. But are you seeing a push towards development? I know Red Rock, on their call called has a site in Las Vegas that's very interesting. So curious to get your thoughts on your outlook for gaming expansion in the U.S.?
John Payne: Yes, John. It is an exciting time. I mean, again, I'm 25 years into this, and I can't think of a time that has so many different levers of growth for this industry. Most calls are talking about sports betting and iGaming. And you just brought up a whole another opportunity that is out there where there's the new development opportunities for operators to expand their network. And it is quite exciting, and whether Texas comes but there's already the states that you mentioned with its Virginia and Nebraska, potentially New York that are three big opportunities. So, it is an exciting time. It's obviously something that we talk to our tenants or future tenants about to see, is there a way to structure that makes sense for VICI and our triple-net model, and we'll just continue to study. John, the normalization of gaming throughout the United States, it's just amazing right now. And it's great to be in the space that we're in, and it's great to see the success of our operators.
John DeCree: Thanks, John. And, David, appreciate the insights.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
John Massocca: Good morning.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey, John.
John Massocca: So just one for me. Maybe touching on the opportunity in Central Indiana again, how do you think about timing of potentially pulling down that transaction? I'm just thinking about this given rent to EBITDA level is already predetermined in that transaction, and record EBITDA results out there and maybe some questions about how sustainable those are and how sustainable those margins are. Does it make sense to maybe wait a little and see if EBITDA normalizes and get at a rent level that's really appropriate for the property? Or is it kind of the time you had with the time to collecting rents and there's no real reason to wait if you like the properties per se?
Ed Pitoniak: John or David?
John Payne: Well, the process is it -- right now just so we're clear, I mean, we own Southern Indiana right now. I think you know that.
John Massocca: Central Indiana.
John Payne: Central. David, you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes. John it's a question that we -- the similar questions that we got a lot when we merged right, as people recall it. We had the three call properties that we could call it a tent gap, which ultimately folded into the other auto transaction that we announced in June of '19. But John touched on it. We've worked hard to build this embedded growth pipeline. So it's a combination of ensuring that we have consistent annual growth. It's working with Tom and Bret and Anthony and their team and what makes sense for their capital needs and their ultimate sale of those assets. And then you're right, the performance of the assets will be kind of a third factor and a third lever, but those call perhaps for that put call runs from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. So, at some point between that period of time, we're going to be thrilled down those that have a great cap rate which should be highly accretive. But there's a myriad of factors that go into it. And we're excited to have that embedded growth.
John Massocca: I mean, is there any question about an individual asset level whether rents are maybe sustainable for the property. Or is there even, hey, Caesars and the tenant we trust. Obviously, we have a lot of other exposure to Caesars. I don't believe these are kind of corporate guaranteed, but at the end of the day that?
David Kieske: Yes. No, John, it's a good question. And one of the things we did get with the Eldorado transaction is that those would fold into the master lease. If you recall, we had a ROFR on those originally, and we converted that to a foot call. And those will fold into the master lease. So they will benefit from the corporate guarantee. And the asset level coverage is something that we will take into consideration, but knowing that they fold into the benefit of the master leases gives VICI embedded enhanced protection. And ultimately, part of the reason, Tom and team were willing to do the set up the put call is Tom's vision of bringing back and goal of achieving an investment grade rating on their side, right? This provides significant liquidity to pay down debt or continue their growth profile and improve the credit of our tenant, which will accrue through to VICI enhanced rent protections.
John Massocca: Okay. Thanks a lot. Understood. That's it for me.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hi, everyone. Thanks for working me in. I'll keep it short. I know there's an awful lot of focus on Las Vegas. And I'd love your perspective on how you're just generally speaking, underwriting Las Vegas? Meaning, operators are obviously projecting optimism. But from the investment perspective, are you anticipating revenues getting back to '19 levels in the next couple of years? Are you underwriting something less than that? Just how are you qualitatively thinking about that?
Ed Pitoniak: John can answer that in a moment, David, but I will just start by pointing out that this week we all learned of course, coke industries which has a rather strong record of capital allocation, it seems that they put capital in the Las Vegas, which I took as a net positive. But anyway, John, you want to answer David's question?
John Payne: David, look, I touched on it earlier on the call that and I probably sound like a broken record in my three years in this job. I mean, we're big believers in Las Vegas, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. This is city that has multiple layers, levers of revenue. We think that the FIT customer is going to recover. We think the Vice business, they're going to be way ahead of many other U.S. destination cities. We think that plane supply will be added back to this market quicker than most destination markets, maybe faster than any market. And so, we're believers in this market, Dave, and the performance in Las Vegas has been people like to compare first 2019 and 2020. I think that's a little unfair. I like to compare the performance of Las Vegas versus other U.S. destination cities. And when you look at the performance of Las Vegas, in 2020, which is probably going to be one of their worst year ever. We'll compare it to New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, Orlando, I mean, this is the city that's very resilient, and the teams there are working very hard. The other thing, David, I'll say is that we've seen this margin expansion in the regional markets, because revenues have come back close to '19 levels. When Las Vegas fees revenues come back to that type of level, I think you're going to see similar margin expansion at many of these operators, because they've worked very hard to change the operating model. And so we'll have to see that because revenues are going to come back. So anyway, that's just a long way of saying we're believers in the market, the strip and we talked about circa in downtown and how downtown's changing. And then the results out of the local market of, what I've seen from Red Rock results and Voyage [ph] results that you have those business seem strong. So anyway, we like the market and we'll continue to see if there's opportunities for us.
David Katz: Agreed. Thanks very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Hermann with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Hermann : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you walk us through the base case scenario for the upcoming Greektown variable rent adjustment? And as well get some color and a Margaritaville rent adjustment too? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: David or Danny?
David Kieske: Yes, I can take that. Hey, it’s David. So Margaritaville, and just put the 10 leases in perspective, right, there's a variable rent component, which is a small percentage of the overall rent that we get on an annual basis. From Margaritaville, it's $3 million as a $23.5 million of annual rent. And for Margaritaville, that we did not earn the escalator at that property, since the rent did not exceed the prior revenue metrics, or did not exceed the prior revenue metrics. And so, that was a variable rent decrease, and that was less than $100,000 decrease. So very, very de minimis on our total base rent. And then the Greektown that's coming up in June. And again, the variable component is $6.4 million out of the $55.5 million, $$55.6 million of total rent we collect, that $6.4 million of variable rent is only 50 basis points of our total revenue. So a small component of our total rent base again. And we'll have to see how that plays out given that's coming up in June.
Peter Hermann: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich. Please proceed with your question.
Jay Kornreich: Hey. Thanks, guys. One of your peers this morning said they are recently seeing increased non-gaming opportunities come up. And I'm wondering if this is true for you as well. And if so, what's the reason for the recent pickup?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, it's an interesting way to phrase it. I mean, what we've been doing is going and looking or as I described earlier Jay, off market categories where we should typically not gone. So we are much more oriented to going and finding what we most want to invest in as opposed to waiting the market to present opportunities to us, because the market tends to present opportunities to it would be better that are by definition more mainstream and commoditized.
Jay Kornreich: Okay. Just wanted to throw on the neck. So thanks for that.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Spenser Allaway: Thank you. Could you guys just share your thoughts on the potential upside from New York expanding legislation around online sports betting? And then are there any other states that should be top of mind in terms of evolving regulation or legislation currently?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Well, Spenser, good to hear from you. We actually don't have any assets within New York State right now. But I wouldn't say about New York State is what I would say generally, in terms of how we're viewing sports betting, which is really as a key means of market or audience expansion. There will be a lot -- once New York figures out what it wants to do in sports betting, sports betting and the culture around it will enable it to truly widen its audience in a way so many other states and operators are doing. So again, we don't have any highly informed thoughts around New York, but very excited about what this means for gaming nationwide.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. And just one more, I believe we discussed this sometime last year, but any more thought given to structuring variable events based more on EBITDA, or income versus revenue currently?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, by REIT law or legislation, Spenser, rent variation has to be based on revenue. REITs are not allowed profit participation. So for that reason, we would expect to see all kinds of variable rent mechanisms continue to be revenue based. I think that's the right way to put it, David.
David Kieske: Yes, that’s right. Exactly.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks.
David Kieske: Thanks, Spenser.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Amy. In closing, we thank you for your engaging with us this morning. As you can tell, we are very excited about our present situation, our near-term opportunities and our long-term prospects. We've been saying since we started in 2017, the gaming real estate represents the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Our conviction behind that thesis has only grown stronger, and we believe can be fully realized as we collectively witness the roaring back of the American consumer. Thanks again, everyone. Bye for now.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Presenters please remain on the line.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you standing by, and welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that today's conference is being recorded today, October 29. 2020. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, intend, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our third quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabriel Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. As we sit here today VICI is a few weeks past her third birthday. We've done a lot of work in three years and in quarter three of this year our work over the past three years truly crystallized. In Q3, 2020 we executed the following strategic growth and activities. We closed on the acquisition of three new properties. Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Laughlin. We accretively added incremental rent at our two Las Vegas properties, Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas. We provided a $400 million mortgage on the Caesars Forum Convention Center. And we made our first investment outside of gaming, with our $80 million financing of Chelsea Piers in New York, of which I'll say more in a moment. These strategic accomplishments in Q3 led to the following financial accomplishments. We grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 41.9%. We grew AFFO year-over-year by 38.4%. We increased our dividend by 10.9%. And not to be taken for granted, since the COVID-19 crisis began, we have collected 100% of our rent through October in cash. All told looking forward, these VICI growth activities in Q3 added annualized rent and income from loans of $288 million and a blended unlevered yield of 7.80%. Granted all American REITs haven't reported yet, but in what we've seen so far few other American REITs have posted these kinds of financial growth numbers in Q3 2020. And this growth for VICI takes place against the COVID-19 backdrop that has significantly degraded the financial results of many American REITs. And if I could just take a moment, I would note that, much of the commentary we've seen so far, we have seen VICI described as having met its expected results for Q3. And on the one hand, we're glad that we were expecting to grow in the way we have, but we hope it is not lost on anybody that the growth we did produce is truly remarkable. And this surge of growth consummated in the third quarter of 2020 comes in our third year of real estate investment management. Over this three-year period on an annualized run rate basis, we have grown our rent since emergent by 100% or $633 million, while significantly lowering our leverage from 8.5 times to the low end of our target range of between 5.0 and 5.5 times. VICI stands here today with a substantially bigger and moreover higher-quality portfolio with much lower leverage and a better laddered debt structure. And as I spoke of a moment ago, in Q3 we also made our first allocation of capital outside of gaming. Chelsea Piers is no doubt well known to those of you who live and work in New York. For anyone, who doesn't know Chelsea Piers well, this morning we uploaded to our website www.viciproperties.com a deck that summarizes the transaction and the asset. So the most valuable elements of the deck are the photos. Only photos not words can begin to do justice to the magnitude and experiential diversity of this asset. But here are a few words. Chelsea Piers is a 780,000 square foot facility on the Hudson River in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. It is New York's largest and best equipped sports and recreation facility. It offers one of New York's biggest and most dramatically situated banquet location. Finally, and very valuably, in the time of unprecedented film production activity, it offers the largest film production space in Manhattan. Roland Betts, Tom Bernstein and David Tewksbury founded Chelsea Piers in 1995. They remain in charge today. And through their 25 years of ownership and management, they have expertly and energetically steered Chelsea Piers through such past crises as 9/11, the Great Financial Crisis and Hurricane Sandy. We have confidence that under their continuing leadership, Chelsea Piers will recover strongly as the COVID-19 crisis eventually subsides and as New Yorkers once again return to New York's most spacious place to play and perform. While we're excited about our new financing partnership with Chelsea Piers, a partnership that could become longer term in nature, we remain very glad and very proud to be principally invested in American gaming real estate, a sector that has arguably performed better than any other place-based experiential sector during this COVID-19 crisis. To tell you more about how our tenants are doing and how we remain focused on gaming growth, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Payne. John?
John Payne: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. [Indiscernible] continuing our work to build the best company in our sector by focusing on the [Indiscernible] from accretive transactions and expanding our portfolio of the best-in-class operators. To that end [Indiscernible] Eldorado-Caesars merger originally announced in June 2019. That said [Indiscernible] Caesars for total consideration [Indiscernible].
Ed Pitoniak: Hey, John. John, my apologies. Your signal is breaking up quite badly. If you'd like, we could have David read your remarks.
John Payne: Please do. I apologize. It must be this -- I'm in New Orleans and we have a hurricane last night. So why don't you do that Ed?
Ed Pitoniak: Okay. David do you want to take it from there?
David Kieske: Yes. Sorry about that, everybody. As John was saying and I think he broke up. To that end, as many of you know, on July 20 we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado-Caesars merger, originally announced in June 2019. We acquired Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin and Harrah's New Orleans and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction added $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, strengthened the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocked our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas strip assets, a put-call agreement on Harrah's Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. Additionally in July, we agreed to fund the $18 million expansion at JACK Thistledown in exchange for incremental rent at a 10% cap rate. We also quickly and efficiently partnered with JACK Entertainment by providing them access to incremental liquidity. This demonstrates some of the benefits of having VICI as a capital partner, as we support our tenants in ways that preserve and create long-term value for all parties. Finally, as Ed highlighted during the quarter, we executed on an $80 million loan transaction with Chelsea Piers in New York City. We are very excited to announce this transaction involving an incomparable experiential asset in an incomparable city. Importantly, we believe this investment represents a meaningful partnership and potentially provides VICI a path to a longer-term relationship with Chelsea Piers, potentially adding sector and geographic diversification to our real estate portfolio over time. As we said before, we believe the transaction market within gaming is robust and will likely dwarf transactions that we may pursue outside of gaming just given the sheer magnitude and financial productivity of gaming assets. Despite over $8.2 billion of transaction activity since we started VICI three years ago, our growth story remains in the very early innings and we're excited about what is to come. You have seen us shift from defense to offense by announcing multiple transactions over the past two quarters. We always strive to do fair deals and we believe this is part of what has driven our success. We are often asked if we are going to slow down for a while, or take a break as others do. Given all the transactions we have done in a short period of time, the answer is a resounding no. You should expect us to consider participating in any fair process for an asset sale within gaming. Given our broad investment spectrum, we continue to believe that a bid that includes refinancing is likely to yield the greatest amount of proceeds for the seller of an asset and their stakeholders, giving our business the greatest prospects for growth. With respect to the operating environment, we are very proud of the way our tenants have reopened and managed our properties in the current operating environment. Despite many of the restrictions and challenges imposed on properties across the nation, our assets continue to showcase superiority relative to many other real estate sectors, as the brick-and-mortar casino experience continues to prove its durability. John has personally visited numerous assets across regional markets and was in Las Vegas earlier this week and has been quite impressed with many of the unique operational changes that the operators have done to improve and protect the guest experience, many of which have enhanced profitability. We are extremely proud to be invested primarily in gaming and we stand ready to support the growth initiatives of our tenants and other operators through fair lease terms, integrity and flexible long-term capital. I'll now touch on balance sheet and run through our financial results. Just turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues in Q3, '20 increased 52.6% over Q3, 2019 to $339.7 million. GAAP revenues included $26.2 million of non-cash items. Accordingly, total cash revenues in Q3, '20 were $313.5 million, an increase of 39.3% over Q3, '19. These year-over-year increases were the result of adding $88 million of rent and income from the loans during the quarter primarily as a result of closing the Eldorado transaction; the Caesars Forum mortgage; the Hard Rock Cincinnati and Century acquisitions which closed in late 2019; and the JACK Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed in January of 2020. AFFO was $227.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 38.4% over Q3, 2019 and AFFO per share increased 22.9% over Q3, 2019. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 15%, primarily as a result of the settlement of our June 2019 forward sale agreements in June 2020, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow-through was 100.3% for the quarter and margins expanded further into the high-90% range. Our G&A was $8 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was just 2.4%, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. I'd like to just highlight two items on the income statement. The first is our ongoing CECL allowance. In the third quarter, the non-cash CECL allowance was $177.1 million, which is primarily related to the new investments we made during the quarter. As a reminder, when new investments close, we record an initial CECL allowance through the P&L. Second is the $333.4 million gain upon lease modification. When we modified our leases as part of the Eldorado transaction, we were required to reassess our lease classification. And accordingly, we reclassified all of our Caesars leases to sales-type leases under ASC 842 and marked them to market resulting in a onetime gain. These items are both non-cash. As such, there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share, as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Just touching on the balance sheet and our capital markets activity. On September 28, we settled three million shares from the June 2020 forward sale agreement, realizing net proceeds of $63 million of cash on to our balance sheet. On September 18, we closed on the $400 million Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage with Caesars, utilizing cash on our balance sheet. And then as has been mentioned, on October 31, we closed on the $80 million mortgage with Chelsea Piers of which we funded an initial $65 million term loan with cash on our balance sheet and the remaining $15 million remains undrawn. This loan came about through a combination of a refinancing process Chelsea Piers undertook this summer, as well as a long-term relationship with the principals. The loan has an interest rate of 7%, a term of seven years and is the only loan in the cap stack of what is truly an amazing and irreplaceable asset in New York. And as we've spoken about on July 20, we closed on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction, adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah's assets and the acquisition of incremental rent from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas asset for total consideration of approximately $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offering that were previously held in escrow to fund the transaction. Our total outstanding debt at quarter-end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.4 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of September 30, our net debt to actual LTM-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.5 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true leverage, as it does not include a full 12 months of income from the Eldorado transaction and therefore does not represent our true run rate leverage levels, which is well within our stated range of maintaining net leverage between five and 5.5 times. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity comprised of approximately $144.1 million in cash on hand, $20 million in short-term investments, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And then, in addition, the company has access to approximately $557 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares that are subject to the June 2020 forward sale agreement. During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 based on the annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. This represented an increase in the dividend of 10.9%, one of the highest increases from any REIT during 2020. Our AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter was 76.7%, in line with our long-range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'd like to take any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: And John if you're listening, all the best with storm cleanup down there.
John Payne: I'm on, I don't know if you can hear me now. I've moved locations and tried again.
Rich Hightower: Yes. Yes. No, the cell towers sound like they're working. So -- but I know what that's like. So, as I said all the best, but yes -- I appreciate guys the bit of background on the Chelsea Piers loan. But maybe just to talk about credit underwriting for a second here. So, help us understand the security behind VICI's loan? Does the owner own the land beneath the facility, or is it just the improvement? I know you said that VICI's loan is the only one in the cap stack. But help us understand maybe the implied equity that sits beneath VICI and then where the loan sits maybe as an expression of terms of EBITDA or something along those lines? Just help us understand some of the details there if you don't mind.
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks Rich. There's a ground lease on -- or there's a ground lease even though it's in the river. Some of the peers are in the river with the Hudson Park Trust, but they own the peers and all the improvements and has that 28 acres 780,000 square feet. Financial metrics aren't public but it is a very, very low LTV when you think about the location and the size of the assets and the magnitude of EBITDA. This asset has a 25-year operating history. And as Ed said they've weathered 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, the Great Financial Crisis. And the revenue generators the complexity of this asset and their ability to generate consistently high EBITDA throughout the past 25 years there's been a reason that we're highly excited about this asset and excited to support Chelsea Piers. And obviously, New York was struck with COVID and some of the businesses did shut during the past few months. The majority of the businesses are reopening. The asset is generating productive EBITDA and the film studio business is blooming and going with just the global need for content. So, we're excited about this and what this may lead to in the future.
Rich Hightower: Okay, that's helpful David. And then just as far as that sort of longer-term potential there. I mean should we infer that a sale/leaseback transaction is at least somewhat plausible in the near to medium term, or is it too early to make that assumption?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Rich, this is Ed. I think it'd be too early to make that assumption with any kind of utter certainty, but it's a relationship we've worked very hard to develop. It is a company that is expanding its footprint throughout at least the New York region. So, we're very eager as we are with all of our partners to focus on growing our relationships over the longer term.
Rich Hightower: Okay, got it. And then maybe just a quick one in a bit of a different direction. But look there's been a lot of investment on the part of the operators around online sports betting. That's been obviously a pretty high-profile phenomenon lately. Would you see a chance for deal flow to VICI to increase specifically based on that? In other words where VICI would be a capital provider in the form of a sale/leaseback on a land-based facility, but where the proceeds would specifically be put towards sort of a non-land-based growth opportunity for the operator? And how do you sort of feel about trends in that area right now?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to John. But I think this is one of the most exciting things going on in our industry right now Rich. I know there's a lot of focus on the total addressable market, a lot of focus on what kind of revenue and profit that gaming companies will yield directly from iGaming and sports betting. And those obviously could be very important new revenue and profit providers to our tenants making our tenants an even better credit for us in the future. I think though that certainly for me one of the most powerful things going on is that technology is proving to be a tailwind right now for gaming and thus for gaming real estate. And this comes during a period where you can pretty much separate real estate asset classes into those that are benefiting from technology, obviously data centers and cell towers as two key examples or they're suffering from technology. Malls obviously being an extreme example on that side. And I think this is a case where technology is creating a tailwind for gaming and thus for the gaming REIT. And one of the most powerful elements of this tailwind is that it is helping gaming companies potentially develop their next-generation of customers. Every consumer discretionary sector has to ask the question where does our next generation of customers come from? Because being a discretionary sector is inherently up to the discretion of any given generation as to whether or not they're going to become customers. And -- if you want to put it in the simplest terms this is a powerful way to engage the [Indiscernible] generation and turn them into that next generation, which we think is enormously positive for the long-term productivity and security of our assets. But I'll turn it over to John in terms of how else we're looking at it and our willingness to get behind our tenants with incremental capital. John?
John Payne: Yes. I don't have much to add other than to say Rich, I think you -- over our three years you'll see we've been quite creative in working on deals and wanting to help our tenants grow. I do want to reiterate one thing -- David did a great job with my opening remarks and I apologize for being cut-off. But I did want to reiterate how proud our company is of our tenants' performance. I think sometimes it gets glossed over when many hospitality industries are talking about cash burn still. And we have operators in this space talking about record EBITDA and margins up 1,000 points. And I just want to stress that that really is incredible in the environment that we are in right now and it's a complement to the operators and how creative they've been. So Rich that's our comments on that question.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open. 
Smedes Rose: Hi. I wanted just to ask you there's a number of regulatory issues on the ballot this year either putting in casinos in cities like Virginia or setting limits in Colorado. What -- are there anything that stands out to you as making regions more or less interesting depending on the outcome of those votes?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I'll -- yes I'll jump in here. I think it's always interesting to watch what is on the ballots. I think Virginia is one that is going to have some opportunity. I do -- we'll see what happens in a few days. But I do think that's going to allow commercial gaming in that state and some new developments. And that could provide some opportunity for us or it could provide some opportunity for a tenant and make them continuing to be stronger. We'll have to watch Nebraska. I don't know how that is moving forward. And then to the answer to the question, we just answered about sports betting there are a number of states that are looking to move that forward and we'll see how that plays out. So -- and then obviously in Colorado, they're just kind of normalizing the casino environment by increasing debt limits, which will be good for the operators there. So all should be pretty positive. I'm watching Virginia closely though.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to switch back. You made for your major first investment in a non-gaming entity. John, obviously has very deep relationships in the gaming side. Going forward, how will you continue to look for non-gaming opportunities? And maybe you could just talk about -- you mentioned a long-term relationship with Chelsea Piers. But what -- could you talk a little bit about more who the relationship is with and kind of what brought you to the table as they considered or as they went through recapitalization?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Smedes, this is Ed. Yes, I personally have had a long-term relationship with the Chelsea Piers founders. But as a more general principle in practice what we very much intend to take advantage of at VICI is through both our management team and our Board we have lifetime's worth of engagement with other real estate -- experiential real estate asset classes. And we will use those relationships much in the way we've been able to enormously capitalize on John's unrivaled relationships in American gaming. And from the beginning we set VICI up as an experiential real estate investment trust. And we have always used as our absolute guiding premise that superior long-term returns in real estate investment management are generated through the ownership of superior real estate. So that is our greatest focus of all. Is a given piece of real estate truly superior in its marketplace and do its investment in operating characteristics promise superior longer-term returns? And Chelsea Piers ticked all those boxes and we're very confident that over time we'll continue to find opportunities like this in various experiential sectors.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Your line is open. 
Greg McGinniss: Hi, everyone. 
John Payne: Hey, Greg.
Greg McGinniss: On the transaction front you -- Caesars still needs to sell those two Indiana assets that you guys own together whether you own and they operate. Can you just remind us what the process may look like for when they try to sell those operations and how that's going to impact the master lease?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. So we have put-call on the two Indianapolis assets. David will have to remind me the exact dates when they're active. So it's not a ROFR. It's very clear. We do have a put-call on that. And we love those assets. I actually was in Indianapolis about six weeks ago at those facilities. Great business, great performance and we'll be excited. They will be added into what we're now calling our regional master lease. And David I don't know if you want to add a little bit of the details on the put-call and the timing on that?
David Kieske: Yes. Greg, I think you're asking about Southern Indiana and Hammond, but just the put-call starts in 2022 and runs till the end of 2024. But going back to Southern Indiana and Hammond, you're right, Caesars was required -- as part of the Eldorado, Caesars was required as part of the merger to sell three OpCos Evansville, Southern Indiana and Hammond. We own the real estate on Southern Indiana and Hammond. Those are processes that Caesars is running. We're not involved in those processes. If there is a sale of the OpCo, I think your question was around how does the rent change into the master lease, our total rent would not change but what it would create the opportunity for is tenant diversification for us. So we'll see how that will ultimately play out and how the bid processes work with what Caesars is required to do from Indiana.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. So we're not going to see a similar transaction deal that GLPI employed with Tropicana Evansville then? It's just going to be a transfer to the operator most likely?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah, I think – yeah, that's the great assumption, Greg. And just to be clear, the rent within the master lease might change with a new operator in either one of those two assets but our total rent would not change. And we're very confident Caesars is running the process in such a way that we're going to be very happy with whoever ends up being our new tenants in those assets.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. And then just a final question from me. Just curious what changed regarding the undeveloped land parcel acquisition, hereby, the forums and why are you no longer pursuing that one?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. So in a period of due diligence Greg, what we discovered is that there are various if you will entitlement and permitting issues surrounding that land that especially relate to Caesars' parking obligations. And it was not going to be easy to unwind those quickly. And given the magnitude of activity that Caesars is currently engaged in, in terms of integrating after the merger and undertaking the various activities that is we agreed that it was best for both of us. For the meantime we put that initiative aside and then perhaps return to it at a time when the dust has settled a bit post-merger.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Your next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Jared Shojaian: Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about your appetite for underwriting additional real estate on the strip right now? And how do you think about how terms would compare today in this depressed environment versus pre-COVID?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Do you want me to touch on that? Sure. Well. I was just out in Las Vegas as David said this week. So I had an opportunity to be on the strip and meet with operators throughout the whole city. So we continue to be excited about this market long term. Clearly Las Vegas has to get over not having meeting business right now and some international business, but we believe that that will come back. It really is amazing to think about the United States right now. And Las Vegas is down from its 2019 numbers, obviously, but there's still a lot of visitation going to Las Vegas. When you compare that to other U.S. cities like New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco there's no comparison that the consumer has not found a substitute for their travel patterns to a place like Las Vegas. So that's a long way of saying, we believe in this market. We're long-term investors. Would we do a transaction here in the short-term? I think the operators are more likely to get some more of the operations under their belt after COVID and better understand what the true run rate of EBITDA is going to be. But if you're asking do we still believe in Las Vegas, I think the answer is a resounding yes.
Jared Shojaian: Right, okay. I think the genesis of my question is really more about just media reports out from last week and your ability to participate in how you would think about underwriting Las Vegas right now. I mean, would you -- do you think a significant discount from what you maybe would have paid back in January is probably more relevant if you were to pursue something? I mean, I guess that's really more of the genesis of the question.
John Payne: And media reported -- you talked -- go ahead Ed. Go ahead.
Ed Pitoniak: I was going to say, Jared, that this is a situation in which you have to triangulate off of what is by I think everyone's agreement a temporary crisis that will have an end and true long-term value. And somebody that wants to sell or needs to sell during a crisis like this has to also be mindful of long-term value in the same way that the buyer does. So it's really hard to come up with a general answer as to what kind of discount should be applied given that we're talking about real estate, and in our case we would intend to hold for decades right? And so to what degree should a temporary crisis change the enduring value of an asset, I wish I could give you a really crisp cogent answer. But it's going to end up being so highly particular in terms of any trading that would take place amidst this temporary -- emphasis on temporary uncertainty. John, I don't know, if you want to add. 
John Payne: No. And I also think it's important we have -- if we were to ever transact the operating partner is critical. And of course most importantly, the going-in cap rate needs to be accretive. And so I assume you're asking about a large asset on the Las Vegas Strip. And like I said, we're always interested in hearing about great gaming asset strong markets like Las Vegas. 
Jared Shojaian: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just one more for me. How do you guys think about a possible investment-grade credit rating and how that potentially could be helpful to your cost of capital in any way? I mean I think just in your leverage and liquidity and the resiliency of your rental strength throughout this pandemic, what do you think the rating agencies would want to see to make that move? And would that be helpful? 
David Kieske: Jared, it's David. Thanks for the question. The resounding yes, it would be helpful, right? The cost of capital would be reduced. The access to capital would be significantly increased. I think the investment-grade bond volume this year is 4 times is a high-yield volume which is having a record year. But for us it's really just getting rid of the term loan. The term loan is secured by all but one of our assets and that's prohibiting us for having a traditional REIT unencumbered asset pool. And that's the catalyst, so to speak that the agency is looking forward to -- which would allow for the flip into investment grade. We give GLPI a lot of credit for getting there and highlighting that tenant concentration in of itself is not a gating item. We have similar rent from Caesars that they have from Penn. So there is a path. And again it's just the repayment that term loan, which we'll work to do over the coming months and years here.
Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Ed Pitoniak: Hi, Barry.
Q – Barry Jonas: Pre-COVID, we had Blackstone enter the space. We had another triple-net about to enter the gaming REIT space. Given the operating results operators are seeing now I'm curious if you expect more activity from some of those newer REITs to reemerge anytime soon? 
Ed Pitoniak: Well if they're paying attention you would sure think so Barry. I mean, again, if you look across so many real estate asset classes right now and you ask the fundamental question, how are the tenants in a variety of asset class is doing? It's very hard to identify other than maybe again data centers and cell towers examples where the tenants are doing better than ours are in terms of profitability. That is obviously very much true in the regional markets.  But I do think you're going to see as you did last week, you're going to see pleasant surprises I think even from the big strip operators in terms of how well they've done on a relative basis. So yes, there should be greatly increased interest in gaming real estate, given the way the gaming real estate has been validated through this crisis. When John and David and I and the VICI team started telling our story three years ago, we were often asked the question. Well are you guys going to need a crisis in order for people to get comfortable with the durability of this real estate and its income streams? Then we said, well we don't think we need a crisis. But well what the hell we got one. And again I think, we really cannot be more pleased with the way our tenants have performed. I think what this crisis has demonstrated Barry is that gaming real estate is not -- emphasis on not commodity real estate. In real estate categories, they are relatively commoditized. In other words, one box is like another. And if I own a coffee shop or a gym or something else and I can threaten my landlord with moving to another commodity box a block away, I have a lot of leverage over the tenant. These are not commodity boxes. These are one-of-a-kind boxes. Pretty much the definition of irreplaceable or certainly, the definition of very difficult to substitute. And that tends to be a key characteristic of non-commodity high-value institutional-quality real estate is that it is not easily substituted and that the tenants occupying that real estate operate fundamentally good businesses. And our tenants operate fundamentally great businesses. 
Q – Barry Jonas: Great. And then just curious if you looked at Tropicana Evansville or if your exposure in that stake just made it less appealing from the start? 
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Well it's an odd situation. It was owned by a gaming REIT and it's now still owned by a gaming REIT. And I believe there was even an agreement that it could not be sold to another REIT. So it's a really good piece of real estate. I think GLPI has to be very glad they're going to continue to own it. They're going to own it with a good tenant. And we wish them the very best. And to your point Barry, we do obviously have very nice exposure already in Indiana with Southern Indiana and Hammond. And but we will be able to increase our exposure with what we think are two of the best assets in the state with the so-called Centaur assets.
Barry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask -- so following up on a question earlier as it pertained to the large-scale asset in Las Vegas. At the way -- I guess this is big picture thinking about, I would love to get your opinion and get your expertise on it. But in a situation as we are today it would seem as though a sale/leaseback -- traditional sale/leaseback type of structure for a large asset like that in that market would be difficult, just given the cost of carrying on kind of the rental obligations over the near term, while the asset ramps up to obviously the capitalized multiple that would build into the valuation or said differently the EBITDA, it would be expected to get to over time. In that type of situation where maybe the buyer has to look out -- the opco buyer has to look out a little bit further, are there any types of structures that you guys could think of to potentially try and support the transaction while not necessarily putting all of the onus on the operator to carry certainly a large rental stream in the near term that's not overly kind of dilutive to yourselves as you make a financial contribution on the asset?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll take a first crack and then turn it over to John and David, Carlo. Would it be possible to come up with structures that would address that challenge that you rightly identified? Yes it would be possible to come up with structures and would do that. They would be complex by nature. Complex structures have a way of sometimes collapsing under the weight of their own complexity. But it definitely could be done by willing parties. There are creative ways to bridge these kinds of temporary devalue or revenue productivity issues. And we would certainly be -- as John has already talked about we are certainly able and willing to be creative in financing structures when the opportunity is right. John, David I don't know if you want to add to that? 
John Payne: No other than this -- you did a very good job Ed. I'll just add that we have the advantages of looking at real estate for the long term that hopefully over the next 30 years we look back at 2020 and it's just a blip. And so, Ed has answered your specific questions. But again I think one of the advantages we have is we're not going to be measured on what's going to happen in the business in the next month or quarter.
Carlo Santarelli: That’s great guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. I think that this actually fits in some regard with the question you just answered. You have engaged more and more with traditional loans. They've been seemingly done as a purpose pitch. But in looking through the accounting last night it appears that they actually bear less risk than some of the core lease revenue streams that you have. I'm interested to hear you talk about how you think about those streams in terms of value and how you would have us think about them in terms of value particularly given the prior question is that, they could be used as part of a structure with a purpose.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes I'll turn it over to David in a moment David Katz. And the loan business can be a very effective tool for REITs at giving itself exposure to sectors it may be new to and gives them an opportunity to acquire and learn in if you will a less risky way for the absolute long term. I would say we're generally going to be biased toward using loans to put ourselves in a position to eventually we would hope acquire either the underlying real estate tied to that loan or otherwise acquire real estate within that sector because we are a REIT that's being engineered to last for decades and decades and decades. Loans obviously come due they get repaid. And then if capital gets returned you've got to go find another thing to do with it. So David I don't know if you want to add to add to that, David Kieske?
David Kieske: Yes. No Ed, I think you covered it well. And David Katz I like the perfect pitch, the corporate path to long-term ownership, there will likely be some small percentage of our total investment base that we can utilize in the REIT structure to deploy capital in very safe, low LTV scenarios that may lead to a path of estate ownership over the long term. So that's something we're excited about and excited about continuing to use our capital accretively.
David Katz: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Jordan Bender with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Jordan Bender: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So with regional revenues maybe structurally lower given some of the turnoff in the non-gaming, but EBITDA is -- might be higher going forward. I was wondering how you think about structuring some of your future escalators and your resets that might be tied to revenue versus tied to EBITDA.
Ed Pitoniak: John, you want to take a first crack at that?
John Payne: No, it's a great question. We actually have not been asked that question, but it's something that we will consider moving forward. I thought the question was going to be leading are those revenues necessarily going to be coming back? And I think what the operators have learned and through their abilities and their analytics is that some of that revenue was -- just simply had no margin to it. And so I was going to answer it to say it's not coming back. But your question about what will we think about leases in the way we do escalators differently, I'd say we're always flexible as we create new leases, if there's a way that's fair for both sides. And if there's a way that our escalators should be different and based on some numbers, we'll think -- we could think about that differently. Good question.
Jordan Bender: Thanks. And then, with some of that non-gaming, that might not be coming back and then access land at some of the properties, I was wondering your thoughts on possibly repurposing some of the way maybe something that's not in the gaming sector?
Ed Pitoniak: Yeah. It's an interesting question, Jordan. I mean I think we're talking obviously mainly about interior space. So we would really be talking about -- we'd be talking about repurposing interior space. And in that respect, I think especially, as sports betting evolves, it will be very interesting to see the way in which the sportsbook experience evolves and changes to meet what could be increased demand. And John was in Las Vegas this week for the opening at a D. And John, maybe for the benefit of everyone who wasn't there for that, maybe you can talk about the centrality of the sportsbook, sports bar experience of that brand-new asset.
John Payne: Yeah. The Circa asset opened on Tuesday and very focused on the Gate and the sports betting and just a wonderful new facility in Downtown Las Vegas and centered as I said around the gambler. Now, back to your first question about operators and extra space, hypothetically, if they're not going to reopen their buffet, how will they reposition that and add other amenities? That's the beauty about our tenants. And they see opportunities to improve revenues or drive a different consumer to build in. They'll change what that space is used for. And I think you're going to see that happen over the coming years as they realize they were operating restaurants or other outlets that drove revenue, but weren't driving trips and weren't driving profitability. And how do they fill that space with new amenities that do that? And one could be larger sportsbooks as Ed mentioned. Very good question.
Jordan Bender: Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask briefly about the -- I think you've approached this from a few different ways as it relates to some of the margins and changes that are occurring at the regional properties. And I'm just wondering at high level, at the end of the day does this change cap rates at all in your view? Are these like for instance -- with some of the fundamentals that we're starting to see here is there a way to possibly underwrite the growth or the normalization a little faster than maybe we would have done in the past? And just how do you think about how some of these changes in fundamentals could ultimately impact what you're willing to pay?
Ed Pitoniak: And Shaun, just so we're clear when you speak of the growth that we would be underwriting you mean the growth in tenant EBITDAR?
Shaun Kelley: Correct. Exactly, Ed. So the higher -- in fact, we're seeing 1,000 basis point type higher margins today. Is there a portion of this that you can underwrite/or do you need to see a lot more stability before you do?
Ed Pitoniak: Obviously, more time adds to more confidence and more certainty. But again, I think it's just -- it just blows me away what is reported what Red Rock has reported, what Penn reported today. And these are amazing numbers. And to produce them amidst this crisis the way they have, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in how good our tenants are right? And I think I talked about in our Q2 call Shaun, at the end of the day so much of the value of real estate ends up residing in the quality of the tenant business, right? And our tenants' businesses are getting validated. Like almost nobody else is out there outside again of like data centers and cell towers, and try buying a data center for anything less than a more than a -- I don't know 3.75% cap. So, we obviously -- we have to underwrite in relation to our cost of capital, and there's no way around that. There shouldn't be any way around that. But what we would hope to see and what we believe we will see is that as the market recognizes the quality and security of our real estate in its cash flows our cost of capital will improve commensurately and we will be potentially in a position to pay more for these assets and happily pay more because they are of such high quality. But again we can't get ahead of our cost of capital.
John Payne: And Shaun, I'll just add to that real quick. Ed explained it well. But part of the reason why I'm out and about and meeting not only with our tenants but every operator is to continue to study the magnificent performance that these operators are delivering, so that as we do underwrite we have an understanding of what is going to remain and what may – what part of that margin may be getting back. So I'll just add that little tidbit.
Shaun Kelley: John maybe pushing a little further, since you've been in that business for 20 or 30 – 20. 25 years. can you just tell us or give us your sense of some of the findings right? I think we're all trying to do the exact same thing and even some of the companies are. But just kind of – what's your maybe your gut instinct or your initial view on how sustainable some of these changes may be?
John Payne: First Shaun I'm a recovering operator, right? So take what I say [indiscernible] just as an example of what is going on and the improvements that they're seeing and why it only it's good for the operator, it's good for the customer. What's happened in Las Vegas with room service at large operations room service that these big businesses lost standalone operation in its own kitchen its own staff. With COVID, what they've been able to do is not have room service but allow the consumer to order from the great restaurants that are at many of these resorts, places like Caesars Palace has Nobu and Rao's and a variety of other restaurants that now the consumer in their room can order from those restaurants. It's turning a negative business into more profitable business for the operator and it's a better experience for the consumer. Would you rather get a meal from Nobu at your room or some pancakes and bacon from room service? And so those are – there's 15, 20 other ideas that are improving the margin and they'll keep that forever. And it's also making the experience better for the consumer.
Shaun Kelley: Great color, John and I hope you hang in down there, okay.
John Payne: Good, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Thank you. So earlier this year, I think the commentary was that the transaction market for gaming assets was stalled because of operators focused on kind of resuming their businesses. Now that operators have resumed their businesses and trends are going well has there been a pickup in the kind of transaction pipeline? Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll answer this. I'll start and then turn it over to John. Thomas, I think that what we're seeing is – well, there's two key factors in play: how well gaming has performed and recovering from the COVID crisis and this – the excitement around iGaming and sports betting. And because of those two key factors, you've got incumbent players who want to grow their store counts simply to grow their businesses and do so accretively. But also because I think Thomas, and you covered this very well, there's a bit of a land rush mentality in American gaming with the proliferation of sports betting such that people want to put more pins in the map and expose themselves to more jurisdictions for sports betting. So you've got the incumbent players who want to grow and you've got new capital that wants to come in and start to establish footprints and grow as well. And that is going to create a sense among owners of existing assets to hey, my assets are pretty liquid and they might be quite valuable right now. So I don't think it's going to be so much a case of existing operators saying, hey, I'm going to do a sale/leaseback in order to just financially engineer my own business. It's going to be potentially existing owners who go I sweated it through COVID. I'm really glad to still be alive and doing well. But maybe I actually ought to take an offer from these guys who would so love to own my casino an operator and a gaming REIT like VICI. So I think you're going to see increased liquidity based upon the excitement around the sector. And John you can talk about what you're seeing and hearing in your travel.
John Payne : No. I think you described it well, and I think there's this excitement around this sector that we've not seen in years for all the reasons you talked about. Again, don't underestimate the operating business as they're putting up record numbers and margins and a lot of the other hospitality industries continue to talk about how much cash they're burning or hoping to get places open. So, it's really been I think what the operators have done.
Thomas Allen: Thank you both.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Thomas.
Operator: We have time for one final question. Our final question will be from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Just one. We've spent some time kind of talking about how your underwriting criteria for assets post-pandemic may change. But curious -- and it's only been a few months since reopened and not a ton of deal activity. But how are you seeing the OpCo or your partners change or starting to think about adapting their kind of criteria for doing a transaction with you in kind of the face of a full shutdown? Are you seeing they're -- anything that they are maybe willing to be more flexible on or things they're looking to safeguard on their end? So kind of curious on anything that you've seen so far from would-be tenants and how they kind of look at the lease and entering into a transaction that may have changed?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. Good to talk to you. I'm not seeing a significant difference. I mean, we've been pretty vocal about just our underwriting and adding another lens to the way we look at deals based on what we saw during COVID. I think I've said for the past couple of quarters, the operators have a better understanding how a REIT like VICI can help them and help them grow, which I think is important. And we've spent our first three years trying to make sure they understood that and how we're a partner. So, not -- as you said, there haven't been a ton of deals. GLPI had a deal yesterday as we talked about, and we'll continue -- if there are items in the lease that make the OpCo uncomfortable and we can work with it as, I think, you've seen we want both sides to walk away from the table feeling good that they're fair deals. And we'll adjust accordingly, but we haven't gotten there yet.
John DeCree: Thanks, John. Thanks everybody.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
Operator: We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you operator. Please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. The number one takeaway from this call should be that the growth we produced this quarter in our revenue in our AFFO and in our dividend has been fueled by the economic power and resilience of our tenants' businesses. We are grateful, very grateful to our tenants and our tenants' customers for this resilience. We believe we're well positioned to continue growing our portfolio and driving superior shareholder value into the future. Again, thank you and good health to all. That will do it operator. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that today's conference is being recorded today, July 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel of VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, intend, project or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our second quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here's what remains foremost for us at this time. We continue to hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this COVID-19 crisis as best as can be. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, May 1. In my opening remarks, I focused on what because of COVID-19 we did not know with any certainty at the time; we did not know when our assets would reopen, what the recovery pace of our tenants’ businesses would be; when exactly our $3.2 billion transaction with Eldorado Caesars would close; finally, when VICI would be able to return to an offensive portfolio growth strategy. Here today, July 30, we now know four key facts. Number one, virtually all of our assets have reopened. Number two, our operators have seen strong operating recovery at our regional assets, and through the end of June, we're seeing improving results at our two Las Vegas assets. Number three, the Eldorado-Caesars merger closed in July 20 and our $3.2 billion portion of that overall transaction will produce annual incremental rent of $253 million at a 7.8% cap rate, while also replenishing VICI's embedded growth pipeline. Number four, we returned to offence and continued our opportunistic growth on June 15 when we announced our intention to provide a $400 million mortgage loan on the brand new Caesars Forum Convention Center and purchased 23 more acres of strip proximate land, giving us a total land assemblage of 50 strip proximate acres, giving VICI the only large scale opportunity to deepen the Las Vegas strip at its center and to participate in the potential for long-term growth that this land represents. It all added up to another quarter that validated VICI’s business model and generated market leading growth. For second quarter 2020, and in July, VICI collected 100% of cash rent from all of our tenants, which very few American REITs were able to do in Q2. This contributed to VICI achieving 20.4% growth and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, which we believe will be among the various – very highest EBITDA growth rate among all American REITs for the quarter. In a moment, John Payne will discuss our operators performance and the benefits of the Caesars merger in more depth, and David Kieske will give you details about our own financial performance. But let me take a moment to speak of the root causes of our Q2 2020 performance. We believe VICI was able to continue collecting 100% of rent, delivered 20.4% EBITDA growth and opportunistically go back on offense in Q2 2020 because fundamentally we have high quality tenants. For any rent collecting multi-tenanted REIT, the strength of the REIT’s business model is the aggregated strength of its tenants’ business models. All of our tenants at this time are gaming operators. And during Q2, gaming operators generally, and our five gaming operators specifically, mainly Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock, Century Casinos and JACK Entertainment showed the strength, liquidity, durability and agility of their business models. As most of you know, I've spent time and have experience in a number of leisure, recreational and hospitality sectors, both as an operator and as a real estate investment manager. In coming to gaming real estate, as I did in 2017, I've come into a sector where the operators are I strongly believe the most dynamic and success driven operators in global leisure and hospitality. Over the course of this COVID-19 crisis, our five operators have shown just how skilled, energetic, decisive and driven they are. Here's what they have shown over the last few months; quick and effective action to shore up their liquidity; quick and effective action to minimize costs and cash burn rates during the period of closure; quick and effective action to be ready to reopen safely once given the green light; finally, quick and effective action to restore revenue and EBITDA when many other leisure sectors haven't even reopened yet. What we're also seeing is that our operators’ businesses are key factors to the health of their local economies and to their state and local treasuries. As long as our operators can operate safely, their states and cities want them open for everyone's benefit. At VICI, we're sober, very sober in fact, about the fact that the COVID-19 crisis is not over. We cannot rule out the resurgence of the virus could depress demand for, or potentially lead to reclosures of casinos. But in what we've seen so far for our gaming tenants and for VICI, this crisis may ultimately provide strong proof of the strength and quality of the gaming REIT business model, which is built in turn on the strength and quality of our tenants’ businesses. To hear more about our tenants, I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2020 was another very productive quarter for VICI. Over the past several months, we've worked jointly with our tenants, including Caesars, Century Casino and JACK Entertainment to provide limited short-term relief with respect to certain non-rent related requirements under our leases. As we said in the past, we will work to provide short-term solutions for our partners as needed based on each individual operator’s unique circumstances. Accordingly, during this quarter, we've announced agreements to modify certain near-term capital expenditure requirements for Caesars and Century. Additionally, as noted in more detailed in our earnings press release, during the second quarter, we partnered with JACK Entertainment and agreed to fund a gaming expansion at Thistledown Racino, yielding more rent for VICI commencing in April 2022 at an attractive 10% cap rate, while also modifying our existing loan facility to provide certain temporary covenant relief and to add an additional five years to the initial lease term, as well as increasing the principle on the existing term loan and providing revolver facility to JACK. These agreements in short-term modifications help ensure that the operators we partner with are able to focus intently on reopening and operating their business through the current pandemic, while also protecting the integrity of our lease agreements and preserving long-term value for our stakeholders. As many of you have likely seen by now, the reopening of casino properties throughout the United States has been met with very robust consumer demand. Property across the regional landscapes have experienced healthy volumes. And in many cases, profitability is exceeding pre-COVID and prior year levels. We view this as a testament to the resilience, durability and longevity of the brick and mortar casino experience. While destination and fly-to markets may take longer to recover we remain believers in markets such as Las Vegas, which has proven over value proposition over a decade. As real estate investors, we think about investing in assets and markets over long periods of time. And believe the geographic exposure we have engineered with approximately 70% of rent coming from drive-to regional markets and the remaining 30% from the Las Vegas Strip represents a good balance for VICI and our shareholders during this time. Over the past, nearly three years, since we started VICI we have communicated our firm belief in the attractiveness of gaming as a real estate asset class. We believe the gaming industry through early reopening results is showcasing superiority to many other real estate sectors. While the gaming industry is unique and at times complex, we are fortunate as real estate investors to have decades of gaming experience within our management team, which greatly benefits us as we continue to navigate the pandemic and ultimately focus on investing for the long-term and growing VICI through accretive transactions. In terms of acquisitions and the outlook for growth on June 15, we announced a planned $400 million mortgage loan transaction with Caesars, which will be secured by the Caesars Forum Convention Center in Las Vegas. This structure allows VICI to benefit from $30.8 million of incremental annual income upon closing, while providing flexibility for the asset to ramp before ultimately converting to an OpCo/PropCo structure accelerating our call option from 2027 to 2025. Simultaneous with the mortgage transaction, we announced the intended purchase of approximately 23 acres of land from Caesars at a very attractive valuation of $4.5 million per acre. This land sits adjacent to the center of gravity of the Las Vegas Strip surrounded by assets that have proven their financial viability over the decades. And combined with our existing 27 acres along the same corridor gives us approximately 50 contiguous acres. Over time, we will seek to partner with third-parties for the development of that land with the goal of continuing our market beating growth well into the future. And finally, 10 days ago on July 20, we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado Caesars merger. We acquired Harrah’s Atlantic City, Harrah’s Laughlin and Harrah’s New Orleans, and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction adds $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, it strengthen the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocks our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas Strip assets, our put/call agreement on Harrah’s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. In addition to this robust and unmatched embedded pipeline of opportunities, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with our operators across gaming and other sectors, and believe our broad investment spectrum will continue to yield consistent, accretive growth for VICI’s stockholders. Now I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our financial results for the second quarter and then move to our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I discuss the quarter, let me just acknowledge and express my sincere gratitude to our team across accounting, asset management, finance and legal for all their efforts closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic. While at the same time we are closing a $3.2 billion transaction. We at VICI are lucky to have such a cohesive team. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q2 2020 increased 16.8% over Q2 2019 $257.9 million, while total cash revenues in Q2 2020 were $261 million, an increase of 19.5% over Q2 2019. The year-over-year increases were the result of adding $44.4 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019. And the JACK Cleveland, Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed on January 24, 2020. AFFO was $176.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.4% over Q2 2019, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 18.5% as a result of our June 2019 equity offering and settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. AFFO for the quarter was also negatively impacted by approximately 23 million of negative interest expense carry related to the February bond offering for the Eldorado transaction being held in escrow for the entire quarter and approximately $3 million less in interest income on a year-over-year basis due to the decline in interest rates. Our G&A was $7.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Our results, once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 99.2% for the quarter. As you may recall, beginning in January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL, Current Estimated Credit Losses a new accounting standard which requires us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses related to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases in similar assets. CECL is applicable to VICI as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the accounting standard as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. In the second quarter, then non-cash allowance related to CECL was a reversal of $65.3 million from the allowance for Q1 2020, which drove a $0.13 increase in net income per share. I'd like to again, make the point that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Turning to our balance sheet and capital markets activities, on June 2, 2020, we settled in full the June, 2019 forward sale agreements utilizing net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion of cash onto our balance sheet. In June 19, in connection with the announcement of the pending Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage and acquisition of the approximately 23 acres of land completed an upsize primary fall on operating of 29.9 million shares of common stock at a offering price at $22.15 per share for gross proceeds of $662.3 million through a forward sale agreement. The proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement. And then John had mentioned, on July 20, 2020 we closed on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah’s assets and the acquisition of incremental rents from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas assets for total consideration of $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offerings that were previously in escrow to fund the transaction. Following this we have approximately $400 million of cash on hand. Our total debt outstanding at quarter end was 6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.6 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt-to-LTM EBITDA was approximately 3.4 times below our stated range and focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 times and 5.5 times. This does include the impact of the June 2, forward settlement and restricted cash that’s set in escrow as of June 30. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity comprise of the approximately $400 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $630 million in net proceeds from the future settlement of the 29.9 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreement entered into on June 19. During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.2975 per share based on the annualized dividend of $1.19 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter was 83%, slightly above our long-term range of 75% as a result of the June, 2019 equity offering. With that Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Thanks guys for your comments. Good to hear from you, and thanks for taking my questions. For starters, maybe this one’s kind of best for John. John, as things have evolved coming out of obviously the pandemic disclosure period, et cetera, as you look ahead at drawing from kind of your deep industry knowledge and whatnot, I think it would be fair or at least from my perspective, would be fair to say that we do likely see some contraction of the go forward in terms of trends that we’re seeing right now. In the event that, that happens, and we do start to see a little bit of that the macro economic impact of the pandemic and kind of trends, do you believe in this new interest rate paradigm and where we are right now, and kind of what we’ve seen in terms of debt issuances from some operators coming in at meaningfully higher than what we’ve seen previously spreads, that there will be a flow of kind of new opportunities as kind of the trading multiple versus the cost of capital dynamic has shrunk materially in favor of promoting more transaction activity?
John Payne: Yes, it’s a very good question. Again, I think it’s important to remember because we moved so fast that just back in April, the focus of these operators was really about getting open, right, and ensuring liquidity. We now are sitting here in July and it’s about staying open. And I think to your point, Carlo, you’re asking about, now are they starting to think strategically and are there going to be opportunities for us. What I would tell you is from our perspective, and I think I’ve communicated this, not only we’ve been working with our five current tenants throughout this pandemic, I’ve stayed active with really almost every operator in the gaming industry, understanding their position, how their business doing, what they’re seeing from their consumers and letting them know due to our positioning that David and Ed had put us in with ample liquidity that should there be an opportunity for us to transact with them, to help them grow their portfolio or provide liquidity or do a sale lease back that we’re available and when we’d like to talk to them. That doesn’t really answer your question about predicting the future, but what I would tell you, it’s our job to make sure that if there are transactions that at least we’re in the mix, and people understand that we’re moving from, as Ed said earlier in his remarks, from being completely on the defensive to back as we’ve shown over the past weeks, back on the offensive side of the ball a little bit here. But Ed should also – Ed and David should also weigh in on that question.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Carlo, you have rightly identified the fact that for a lot of operators in gaming, as frankly, across every major and hospitality sector, the cost of capital has gone up meaningfully in the last few months, both the cost of debt capital as you’ve cited, but also the cost of equity capital. And as I think you’ve heard us talk about before, we actually see the capital we provide through a sale leaseback. And in fact, being another form of equity, it is permanent capital. The recipient of it does not have to pay us back. And the cost of the capital we give them as simply the rent they pay us. So if you look at rent as expressed as a cap rate, it is generally much lower than their cost of equity currently and probably for a while yet. And to your point, it is becoming competitive with their cost of debt. So based on that, and also based on the fact that I think we’re already starting to see operators, especially regional operators, who want to grow their store count, those who do want to grow their store count are very focused on partnering with REITs in order to win the bid because it will otherwise be very hard for an operator who wants to grow store count to win the bidding if they have to bid against an OpCo/PropCo bidding combination.
Carlo Santarelli: That’s very helpful. Thank you both. And David, if I just could, one quick one, I think if you kind of look at fourth quarter run rate EBITDA relative to kind of your current net debt levels, et cetera, you guys would probably be looking at leverage of around five times, which certainly does provide a little bit of cushion in a lower rate environment for you guys to go out and potentially take on some leverage. Could you kind of comment a little bit about how you’re thinking about the capital structure here moving forward in terms of the hypothetical potential transaction?
David Kieske: Yes, Carlo. Good to talk to you. You’re right. We’ll be just kind of sub five times on a pro forma run rate basis for everything we’ve announced. As we talked about what’s the equity raise in June, we’ll likely match funds that equity with debt at some point in the future, which gives us $1.2-odd billion of total volume power if you go out and think about raising $600 million, $700 million of high yield here at some point in the future. So on an ultimate leverage neutral basis with the balance sheet, we’ve got the functionality, the flexibility, and obviously the capital markets are going to do some backdrop right now for that.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Baird.
RJ Milligan: Hey, good morning, guys. Ed, you mentioned restocking the pipeline, especially, the captive pipeline with the closing of Eldorado and Caesars. Just curious on your thoughts on timing of executing on any of those growth opportunities.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I’ll turn it over to John here momentarily, RJ, but I mean there’s no question that Eldorado was what we now call, should now call Caesars, the new Caesars was greatly helped by the financing activities they undertook in mid-June, simultaneous with the announcement of our convention center mortgage and land purchase. So they obviously put themselves in a better position than the market at large had anticipated post-merger. And when it comes to the timing of anything we might do with that, I’ll turn it over to John.
John Payne: Yes. Look, I – it’s hard to, as I’ve said before, exactly predict the timing. But as our embedded growth plan has ended or the ROFRs on the Las Vegas strip, we obviously talked quite a bit about our put call opportunity on the two assets in Indianapolis and then a ROFR Horseshoe Baltimore. So as Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker takeover Caesars, they’ll continue to see where there’s opportunities. We like all of those opportunities. I think you’ve heard them talk about having enough supply in Las Vegas and potentially selling one or two assets there. As I said in my opening remarks, we’re big believers in the long-term of Las Vegas. Las Vegas obviously has some short-term issues. They’re going to have to deal with the decrease in flights, the loss of international business and the decrease the of convention business. But we really are big believers in that city for the long-term, based on consumer behavior, and absolutely the number of segments that people can be attracted. So we’ll just have to see what plays out with the embedded pipeline, but that doesn’t mean we’re sitting back and waiting just for the embedded pipeline to determine our growth of our company. As I’ve said, I’ve been quite active making sure people know, understanding what’s going on with operators and spending time and talking to them. So we’ll see how it plays out in the coming months.
RJ Milligan: Thanks. And do you anticipate doing more unique transactions, similar to the one that we saw with the convention center, if you’re not happy with where your cost of capital is?
Ed Pitoniak: I don’t think RJ so much. It will be a function of whether or not we’re happy with our cost of capital, I think it’ll be more a function of the organic situation of what we’re looking at, how much clarity and certainty there is around income production at the moment and how much clarity and confidence there is around forecasting the income production in the near to midterm. So again, I think those will be the key elements, it will drive the structuring decisions that we make. David, I don’t know if you want to add to that.
David Kieske: No, I was going to say the same point. It’s not necessarily related to the cost of capital. It’s a myriad of factors that go into it. And obviously with the mortgage, it was – as we talked about kind of a synthetic bridge to long-term real estate ownership.
RJ Milligan: Understood. Thanks, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, RJ.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with SunTrust Robinson.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start off asking how should we think about any regulatory risks around your ability to exercise the put call agreements for the two Caesars racetracks in Indiana? And if for some reason regulators had any issues, would you get access to a comparable asset or assets within Caesars portfolio instead? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: John, you want to start on that?
John Payne: Yes, I’ll start. I mean, I think that like any transaction, there’s always – you always have to get regulatory approval. So the comment that the racing condition of Indiana would need to approve a sale leaseback of the two Indianapolis assets, not surprising to me at all, having been in the industry for too many years, 20-plus years, every acquisition we’ve ever done is – had those stipulations that we need to go through a process. We need to spend time with the racing commission to let them understand who we are. So not a concern about the language that’s out there right now. Maybe Sam or Danny, you want to answer the second part on the potential substitution? Should there be an issue?
Samantha Gallagher: Sure, John. This is Samantha. The arrangement that John said does not have substitute assets. But as John mentioned, I think those comments surrounding the put call was not surprising and is actually no different than prior comments when we had a ROFR, prior ROFR from those assets. So we intend to work with the regulators of the period of time or the put call. In exercise, we want to make sure they can get comfortable with our REIT structure.
Barry Jonas: Great. That’s really helpful. And then I guess, Caesars is – new Caesars is talking about selling, I believe, operations at three of your assets now. Just curious, can you remind us that they would need your consent to sell those operations?
Ed Pitoniak: John, Samantha?
John Payne: Yes. So if you’re talking about two assets in Indiana, and then I think what’s the third you’re referring to just so I answered the question, but the answer is yes.
Barry Jonas: Yes. Got it.
John Payne: Yes. So, yes, both those assets in Indiana that been referred to the Southern Indiana and Hammond would meet our consent if they currently sit inside the master lease and we’ve really liked the real estate of those two assets.
Barry Jonas: Understood. Then just a quick one, you’ve agreed to various CapEx waivers for your operators. Given the strength we’re seeing in regional markets now top line, but more so margin, do you think those waivers are still needed?
John Payne: I think when we negotiated these waivers with a few of our tenants, it was absolutely appropriate. We – the properties are doing well right now, and we’re excited about that, but I think we’re pretty cautious. And as Ed said in his opening remarks, we’re pretty realistic about that the pandemic is not over. We hope the business continue to perform well. We expect them at this time do that, but again, I think those relief packages at the time we negotiate were absolutely appropriate for us and for our tenant.
Barry Jonas: Great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of the Smedes Rose with Citi.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the convention center for a moment. You talked about just having some clarity on income production. And I was just wondering, can you talk about your views on income production at that center? What’s kind of the book of business look like? And I assume it’s all sort of been pushed out a little bit. And how do you anticipate financing that loan? Will it be with cash on hand? Will you use equity? Maybe you could talk about that a little bit.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. So on the book of business needs, prior to the outbreak of the crisis, Caesars had actually built up a very strong book of business for the convention center. And obviously to your point, conventions that were scheduled for the assets in 2020 had largely been postponed or canceled within 2020. And you would have to – we would have to all hear from Caesars, which we’ll be doing obviously shortly as to how things are looking for 2021 and beyond. In terms of our financing of the mortgage, I’ll turn it over to David because that was obviously the main focus of our equity raise back in June. David?
David Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ed. Smedes, it’s good to speak to you. As we – when we announced the deal on June 15, we obviously simultaneously announced the equity offering, which resulted in an upsized equity offering and gross proceeds about $660-odd million. As we talked about in connection with that, there’s an efficiency to raising capital over equitizing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will match fund that to ultimately run our balance sheet on a leverage neutral basis. So as we think about funding that mortgage, we’ve got cash on hand about $400 million as we sit here today, and then we have access to that forward, which really doesn’t have an end date on it. So we’ll likely fund that with a mix of cash. And some of that forward here as that closes probably third quarter and then ultimately go to the debt markets at some point in the future to match fund that on a leverage neutral basis.
Smedes Rose: Would you expect this acquisition then to be accretive to earnings?
David Kieske: Yes, we would. I mean, the 7.7% cap rate and on a leverage neutral basis, it is accretive to earnings.
Smedes Rose: Great, thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, do you have any color on when the Greektown Casino might reopen?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: We got word yesterday that the state of Michigan is going to allow the Detroit casinos to open in August. I think it was August 5 or 6. So Penn will come out, I’m sure relatively shortly here and give an exact date, but the news came out to me yesterday that that will happen in the state of Michigan.
Smedes Rose: Great. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Smedes.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John G. DeCree with Union Gaming.
John DeCree: Hey, guys. How’s you’re doing?
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, John. Good to hear from you.
John DeCree: Good. Wanted to ask a question about the land that you’ve purchased in your land bank in Las Vegas and spent quite enough time on that. So I believe parcels or your initial parcel is a part of the lease with your existing tenant, maybe not the part you’ve just bought, but the existing part. And I was wondering if you could talk about any restrictions that you might have on that? Or how the relationship would work if you wanted to develop it or if your partner wanted to develop it? And what are some of your options on those parcels?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. So I’ll start John, and then Samantha can jump in and correct me if I get anything wrong. You’re absolutely right. The land that we already own, the 27 acres we already owned, were subject to the Caesars lease and Caesars have the right to use that land within our overall leisure arrangement with Caesars. With our purchase of the 23 acres we did not already own, we’ve also built an agreement that will become part of this formal agreement once we execute on the transaction in fall, whereby Caesars will be able to continue to occupy the land until we have a use for it. And they will in turn for occupying the land, cover the cost of that land in regard to things like real estate tax, insurance and security. In terms of our overall vision for the land, we see this as a way of capitalizing on what we still very strongly believe to be the long-term growth of Las Vegas. The long-term growth of Las Vegas is tourist destination. And frankly also the long-term growth of Las Vegas as a global city in its entirety. And we see that land as giving us a chance to participate again, not only in the growth of Las Vegas tourism, but in the growth of Las Vegas as a place where people choose to work and to live as well as to play. And this land gives us an opportunity to do what we most love doing, which is growing our business by growing our relationships. We are not a developer. We will not take on development risk, if not what REITs generally do. And what we will do is partner with great developers, great providers of development capital, who should get rewarded for development risk in order to realize the highest and best use of this land over time. And what does land ultimately does is provide part of the answer to the question where does VICI’s growth come 5 to 10 years from now? Because again, over that kind of timeframe, we are still raging bulls on Las Vegas.
John DeCree: A quick follow-up on that. If you were to find a partner away from Caesars today, would there be any restrictions on what the land could be used for? I’m not sure if it’s entitled for gaming. Maybe a better question for John, but would we expect it to be, maybe it’s too soon at this point, complimentary to the building that your tenant owns nearby? Or could you potentially do hotel casino there as well that may be competitive?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, it’s way too early to tell, John. Way too early. I mean, what I would say is, whenever you develop, you want it to be complimentary to what’s around you because that tends to be the way you realize the greatest amount of traffic and the greatest amount of overall attraction for the destination.
John DeCree: Got it. Thanks, Ed. That’s all for me. Appreciate it guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered regarding the land parcels. But I would suspect you’ll see some earnings drag, I guess. If you’re combining the mortgage with the land parcel, yes, I get the impression that Caesars will cover some of the operating expenses, but maybe just not cash flow producing real estate. How do you think about funding that with this equity, but having maybe some earnings drag going forward?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes, Todd, it’s really on the $100 million or $103 million of incremental capital that we have to invest to acquire the approximately 23 acres at the right point in time when we ultimately decide what we do with the land, as Ed’s talked about, the right partnership and the right long-term vision, the other 27 acres would come out of the lease. And then at that time, there might be some drag, but obviously that’s very, very early days and how that ultimately plays out VICI determined. But if you think about $100 million on our total balance sheet, very, very de minimis minor drag given that asset start to producing nature of that asset mix.
Ed Pitoniak: Especially when looked at, Todd, as a leverage neutral, i.e., not $103 million of equity.
Todd Stender: Got it. Okay. And timing, I think I got the impression, this is a late to Q3. And if that’s the case, is that forward equity? Maybe that’s the timing around maybe seeing some of that be settled?
David Kieske: Yes. We’re working on. As you know, we talked about it with everybody, we announced that on a letter of intent and working through documentation and diligence now as we speak. So sometimes mid to late third quarters when we’d expect that to close. And you’re right, that’s probably when we would ultimately use some of that forward – settle a portion of that forward agreement.
Todd Stender: All right. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.
Jared Shojaian: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Now that the Creasers deal has closed, your payout ratio on go-forward AFFO is well below your historical target. Can you just talk about how you’re thinking about the dividends right here? And should we assume that September is kind of your typical time period for when you reevaluate it?
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Jared, thanks for joining and thanks for your work this quarter. Yes, we adhered to an annual increase in our dividend. We bumped it in Q3 of 2018, we bumped it in Q3 of 2019. We don’t bump our dividends mid-year or at the closing of transactions. So we’ve got time before we make any decisions around the September declaration and ultimately October payout. We work closely with our board and assess where we are in terms of our liquidity, where we are in terms of state of the pandemic and COVID, obviously where our tenants business are and the outlook going forward. So our payout ratio is a little bit high right now just because of the non-income earning shares that we’ve had on our balance sheet since the June, 2019 offering. But we’re going to approach the third quarter with cautious. And as Ed talked about, we’re silver, where we are in the world. So we’ll evaluate it with the board and make the right decision to be in a position to ensure that we never put VICI out there as a REIT that has to cut their dividend or change – use of dividend going forward.
Jared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you, David. And then just a separate question, love to get your thoughts and opinion on this. Do you think we could see a reevaluation of regional gaming assets as this crisis has probably shown the world that regional assets are a lot more stable than many people might've realized? And then on the flip side obviously, I know you sound pretty bullish on Las Vegas, but how are you thinking about the revaluation or devaluation potential of Vegas here multi-year perspective?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll speak initially from a real estate perspective Jared and then John can jump in. But starting with Las Vegas, I do not think over the long-term it should change the way in which Las Vegas gaming real estate is valued. We obviously saw institutional investor have the caliber of Blackstone come in and validate Las Vegas real estate. They obviously are investing in long-term. They are long-term believers in the value of Las Vegas real estate we are. This is a temporary crisis that will eventually come to an end. We do not think this crisis generates secular negatives for Las Vegas. We do think Las Vegas can and will come roaring back for a whole host of reasons. But to your first point, regional, yes, you are absolutely right. This should really validate regional gaming as a real estate asset class as well as obviously an operating business given that it is far outperforming, just about any other leisure hospitality sector you can possibly identify. And it is not – it was not under secular threat coming into this year, it was posting very positive results as a sector in January and February. It is showing itself again very well here, and going forward you're not looking at the kind of overhang of secular negatives you are seeing in other categories like movie theaters where, Universal has said, yes, okay, after 17 days we will start streaming a movie. So again we think this is very validating the regional gaming. But I'll turn it over to John who has obviously operated so many of the assets that we own in the regions and can verify just how integral they are to the lives of regional customers. John?
John Payne: Yes, not much to add here other than I have a smile on my face as someone who's spent almost 20 years of his career operating these regional assets, it's nice to see that the world is starting to understand how durable they are, the loyalty from their consumers. As you probably heard me say I mean, these are people, social clubs or country clubs or this is where people go to have their entertainment. It's where their friends are and you can see even during this worst pandemic that we've ever seen in our lifetime that as the businesses open up, they've been quite successful. So it's nice to see and I agree with that. And it is common, especially when you look at these assets compared to restaurants and movies, theaters, and a variety of other areas that are struggling where these assets that they've been open up have done quite well.
Jared Shojaian: Great. Thank you very much for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: Hey good morning.
Ed Pitoniak: Hi, Greg.
Greg McGinniss:
2019 to Q2:
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I think we need the benefit of time, Greg. We are still as a nation and as a national economy we're still in a period of great uncertainty – uncertainty and lack of clarity. And when you have uncertainty and lack of clarity it pretty much leads to not being able to be bullish and confident in forecasting, anything. So to return to guidance at this point, we believe would be fundamentally premature. David, I'll turn it over to you to see if you have any added thoughts.
David Kieske: No. Yes, the other thing Greg is I think we've talked to you about, I would say our business is pretty transparent, pretty predictable, especially now that Eldorado deal is closed and the noise out of that speak is now flowing through on a run rate. When we pulled – we pulled guidance, part of the reason was also CECL, there's new noise in the non-cash implications of CECL. We will have a charge in the third quarter around related to closing of the Eldorado transaction and bringing those three new assets on their balance sheet. So it's hard to exactly predict that and pinpoint that. So we'll assess guidance probably returning to calendar into 2021 the next point in time.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then just a quick two-parter on the Caesars agreements with state regulators. So first is what level of additional financial commitment is now required to Caesars. And how do you think about that burden versus rent POU? And secondly, are there any other demands that we should be aware of the impact of the business such as the sale of the casino operations?
Ed Pitoniak: I think we're started, Greg, everything with all of the principle requirements and obligations have been obviously publicly announced that is the way the regulators do business. And in terms of the additional financial partners that you're referring, for example in the CapEx requirements in New Jersey obviously those will benefit the assets and their performance as in the expansion Caesars enjoyed as we believe they will have incremental return on incremental capital.
Greg McGinniss: I agree. Thank you very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks Greg.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hightower with Evercore.
Richard Hightower: Hey, good morning everybody.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey, Rich.
Richard Hightower: I hope everybody's doing well. So a couple of ones, here so just with respect to the incremental term loan and revolver to JACK Entertainment, I know that the initial term loan tranche had a five year term, are there any prepayment features that we should know about there? And if – given that it's 9% secured paper and potentially JACK might have other options for that capital or another source of capital that's maybe a little bit cheaper. How should we think about that dynamic between VICI and JACK? And then what would you do to sort of replace the income before the end of the five years, if it came to that?
John Payne: Yes. If there is a prepayment feature after 18 months, I believe anything correct me if I'm wrong. But given is a small amount, 50 million not $70 million, we've looked for opportunities to reinvest that, but this is a kind of a win-win and it's consistent with our approach where helping our liquids – helping our tenants shore up some of their liquidity at a point in time when nothing was open and as you’ve seen in Ohio, the assets are doing extremely well.
Richard Hightower: Okay. Go ahead sorry.
Samantha Gallagher: And Rich, were they to repay the loan, we certainly do not lack for confidence in our ability to redeploy that returned capital accretively. Obviously, led by John Payne, Business Development, who works for VICI over the last two and a half years with over $8 billion of transaction. We are always confident that if there are compelling opportunities out there, we're going to source them and execute on them best we can.
Richard Hightower: It is a staggering amount of work that you guys have all done. So I agree with that. And my second question is, maybe a twist on the valuation question from earlier, but just looking at stock performance in multiples across the net lease in REIT space, Ed, where do you think VICI and your closest peers are with respect to that incremental cap rate compression relative to some of the more traditional retail focused net lease names given the collections are all across the board, but some are quite low and you guys are sitting at 100%, where do we think we are in that evolution?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I think we're on a positive upslope, Rich. We were obviously not there yet. And I think part of the explanation for not being there yet for not having closed the gap quickly is, that these things do take time and I'm not sure frankly how much fundamental analysis and evaluation is going on right now anyway. But to your implicit point, yes I do think the broad investment community, the dedicated REITs, the income seeking generalist investors are going to recognize and are – again to your point starting to recognize the game REITs, all three of us are posting very good rent collections results. But moreover our tenants are showing themselves to be performing very strongly and that I do believe to your point deserves ultimately reserves relating. It leads to parity and not arguably to some measure premium given how we performed. And again given this as well Rich that this crisis is really showing the stress and strain of any sector that we’re beginning to show signs of secular threat. Whether it be the secular threat as represented by e-commerce, the secular threat is represented by things like streaming media. Gaming is really well integrated as a place-based destination experience in the lives of millions of Americans. And we think that ultimately adds-up to very high quality real estate.
Richard Hightower: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: HI, good morning. So I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about how the tenants businesses that held-in well through the end of June maybe for John what are you hearing on the latest kind of operations since COVID cases picked up?
John Payne: Yes. Good to talk to you, Thomas. I've not heard much of a change in the business. I have heard some occupancy levels going up in some jurisdictions, but regionally the business continues to be strong based on the conversations that I've been having. Again, I think as they continue to add some more amenities back to the facilities as when the restrictions are lifted you're going to see the business continue to perform.
Thomas Allen: Okay. That echoes what Boyd said earlier this week. And then just as my follow-up on how are you thinking about the multiple paid or the returns you're looking for when you're funding capital improvements versus the entire real estate of a property? Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: David, you want to take that?
David Kieske: Yes, that's a good question Thomas. And then with the JACK capital that we just funded, obviously we are earning 10% return but that's partly because we're not – the incomes are coming in until April of 2022, so even though it's $18 million very small amount for VICI but it's a factor of return, but it's out in the future. It goes part and parcel of what it is, it is expansion of a ballroom, is it really income enhancing, income producing where the overall asset is going to be significantly improved, which would lower the risk of the asset and maybe warrant for a higher price? Or is it, I have the specific examples but it’s in and around probably playing higher than where we've been acquiring assets just giving us an incremental add-on to an asset, but each situation, each cap rate is obviously dependent upon the unique facts and circumstances of the situation.
Thomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: Good morning.
Ed Pitoniak: Good morning, John.
John Massocca: So I know you've almost talked largely about the pipeline, but maybe as we think about underwriting an appropriate valuation for Las Vegas Strip assets, do you think you would need to see a couple of quarters of post-pandemic performance in the market, where you're comfortable in underwriting any transaction or you didn't give the long-term nature of your leases, you just underwrite to almost kind of pre-pandemic performance levels?
Ed Pitoniak: I am going to turning it over John Payne here in a moment. John will talk about that, I would just say when it comes to growth, we never attach to any kind of words that have anything with business to our growth, but head-to-head. I will hand it over to you John Payne.
John Payne: It's hard to follow that. Look things to Las Vegas. I mean again, I think we've been consistent and I've been very loud about this, that we really are long-term investors. Yes, in short-term Vegas has some hurdles that they need to get over, but this is a city that even during this time and even with the restrictions that are on it consumers are going to enjoy what they have to offer. And we believe over the time 2022, 2023 and moving on this business is going to rebound. As it pertains to underwriting an asset, now that's exactly what we're spending time on is what is the appropriate level to do that? What is the appropriate cap rate? But we'll have to continue to study the business as to your point we'll have to consider and see what the next couple months are like in the quarters and then determine the EBITDA that we use to underwrite as well as the cap rate. But again, I can't stress enough, you heard a lot about the short-term of Las Vegas, but we talk a lot more about the long-term in this, how resilient this city has been and how resilient the operators are to continue to reinvent themselves and be successful with the properties that they have.
John Massocca: Okay. And then may be switching gears a little bit, given the strength of kind of regional operations, should we expect or potentially could we see any more of these modifications going forward? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but the only leases that are kind of as is versus pre-pandemic are Hard Rock and the Penn leases?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. I mean, I can't predict what's going to happen. I think we've been, as we've said a couple of times, we've been sober about that. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, the operations that have open and almost all of our operations have opened other than Michigan, which will open here shortly have been quite successful, in fact exceeding some of their 2019 numbers. So we're just going to have to wait and see if we continue on this path, the business are going to be strong and there won't need to be any concessions, but we'll just have to monitor what happens in the United States, but we feel obviously much better here in July than we did back in early May.
John Massocca: Good. That's it for me. Thank you all very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.
Ed Pitoniak: David?
David Katz: Hello. Can you hear me, okay?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, how are you doing, David?
David Katz: Sorry. I know you've covered quite a bit of detail. I appreciate that. I just wanted to talk about the CapEx waivers that are in place and how you're thinking about those versus a terminology that would be more like defer? And whether there could be sort of catch-ups down the road and the interest of preserving real estate’s value by making sure it's properly invested?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I think David, one of the key principles that we believe in is that ultimately our operators are the beneficiary of capital well-spent and they bear the first pain when capital is not spent. I think the self-reinforcing positive qualities of this business model as opposed to say the hotel business model where a third-party manager dictates capital that they all may or may not get a return on. We much prefer this model, because at the end of the day the operator is responsible for the capital, but it's also again the beneficiary of capital well-spent and is the one first harmed, when it is not spend in terms of loss competitiveness, revenue, and profit. So we believe in this model and the ability of this model to prevent assets deteriorating in a way as you rightly pointed out they can when capital is not spent over the long-term, it didn't needs to be spent.
David Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. That’s it from me.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, everyone. Just in under the wire I suppose, just one question for me, John in your prepared remarks you said or mentioned a sort of 70-30 mix between the regional portfolio and the Vegas portfolio. The undertone has been here throughout the call, but just kind of curious to say it out loud, is this an appropriate mixture of VICI going forward or how do you think about that 70-30 split kind of strategically, obviously you'll underwrite acquisitions as they come? But is that a target ratio that investors should think about there's a comfort level for management, especially after everything we've seen from a performance perspective through COVID or just how do you think about that?
John Payne: Yes. I don't think we've ever talked about necessarily a target. I think what we've talked a lot about is we like the diversification that we are really the only REIT in this space that has positioned itself to invest in destination resorts in Las Vegas also as well as the local business in Las Vegas, should that come about as well as every market in the region with all different types of operators. So I think our philosophy has been, we want to remain diverse. We want to continue to grow our tenant base. We started this company 2.5 years ago with one tenant now have five and I think you'll ultimately see that grow. But we today were at 70-30, we like where that is. But I don't think Shaun, you hear and say that's where absolutely has to be exactly around those numbers. We just liked the diversification than being in many different types of markets. And you can see that diversification has helped us during this pandemic.
Shaun Kelley: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time.
Ed Pitoniak: And Shaun, I would just add to what John has rightly said that, as a REIT we obviously want to give our investors a chance at not only income steady, predictable income, but we also want to give our investors a chance to capital appreciation as the market recognizing superior value of the assets. And over the long term and as I think again was validated by the investments Blackstone made in Las Vegas last year and early this year, we do believe that Las Vegas could give the greatest opportunity for capital appreciation, which when combined with a steady income production of regional. We think it adds up to a very compelling long-term in our both income and capital appreciation strategy.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. To close out, please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We’re proud of the results we have provided to our stock holders in this quarter and those results again our validation of both VICI’s business and the businesses of our tenants. With 100% rent collection – cash rent collection in Q2, with our ability to go back on offense well before most other REITs, with the closing of our $3.2 billion transaction with Caesars and the $253 million of annual rent growth that brings, we believe we are on track to deliver one of the strongest growth rates of any REIT in America over the next year or two. Again, thank you and good health to all. Operator, that concludes the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Presenters, please remain on the line.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today May 01, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Please go ahead.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good afternoon. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intends, projects and other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Here is what is foremost at this time for us and that is that we hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this crisis as best as can be hoped. Our hearts go out to any who have been stricken by this virus and to the hundreds of thousands of US gaming industry employees who have been furloughed for the past few weeks. Those stricken, we wish a speedy recovery and to those who've been furloughed, we wish for reopenings to come soon and come safely. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, February 20th and in my opening remarks I focused on the ways in which VICI's relationships have fostered the building and bettering of our REIT. I talked on that call about our relationships with gaming operators and asset controllers, our creditors, our own people and of course you, our stockholders. Today, about two months after our last earnings call, I want to talk about another critical VICI relationship and that is our relationship to reality. The essence of our relationship to reality is this, we don't deny reality, we don't fight reality. We manage our business so that we make the best we can, a reality. Reality has changed a lot since our last earnings call to the point where reality can feel sort of unreal. Here's what we know with real certainty. 28 - of 28 of our assets are closed. Here's what we do not know with any certainty. When our assets will all reopen and what the recovery pace of our tenants businesses will be. There are many different scenarios for when our assets could reopen and many different scenarios for what the recovery paid to the American Regional and Las Vegas Gaming could be. We are modeling all of those scenarios and digging deep into what the implications of each scenario could be for VICI and for our tenants. But it's too early to commit to any strategy that only works if a certain scenario prevails, because we don't know which scenario will prevail. We are working and we'll continue to work, day by day, week by week, month by month with our tenants to determine how we best mutually navigate this crisis, which may ultimately mean supporting our tenants during the short term in ways we believe will benefit us over the long term. But there is one strategy we are committed to and have in fact been committed to since day one at VICI. And that's to be prepared for heavy weather and scenarios that heavy weather may bring. The one strategy that works for most variety is heavy weather is a liquidity focused strategy, a strategy that centers on already possessing and having ready access to cash is sufficient to meet the company's fundamental financial obligations for a prolonged period of heavy weather. Our cash position is supported by the way we run our business, low G&A, high margins, high flow-through of revenue growth to profit growth, strong cash retention driven by a payout ratio at the lower end of triple net REIT standards. As our CFO, David Kieske will make clear later in this call, VICI's liquidity position today is a position we will work to preserve every day going forward. I've talked about what we know and what we don't know, the outlook for reopening and recovery. But let me close out these opening remarks by turning to what we strongly believe. We believe we own high quality, well located real estate that is and moreover will remain mission-critical to our tenants. We believe that our tenants are in a business gaming that has proven its deep and enduring consumer appeal over decades and through February 2020 American Casino traffic revenue and profit were at their highest levels in recent years. American Gaming is a consumer sector that did not come into the COVID-19 crisis with pre-existing conditions. And while we don't know what the pace of gaming recovery will be post COVID-19, we believe that there will come a time in the future when consumer demand for the gaming experience will return to prior levels. All of this is to say that because of the long term durability of gaming as a consumer experience we believe strongly in the enduring value of gaming real estate. VICI’s owners, you our stockholders own this fundamentally valuable real estate and we believe strongly that the value of your real estate will endure long past, the passing of this crisis. With that, I will turn the call over to John Payne, our President and Chief Operating Officer. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. To start the first quarter of 2020 remain productive for VICI. On January 24th we closed on the acquisition of JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino and a sale leaseback transaction with JACK Entertainment. We paid a total of $843 million and added $65.9 million of annual rent to our portfolio through a master lease which represents an attractive 7.8% cap rate for urban real estate in Ohio. Just last week on April 24th, we and our tenant Caesars, announced the disposition of Valley's Atlantic City for total proceeds of $25 million. Not only will we receive approximately $19 million of the gross proceeds from the sale, but we will retain ownership of the Wild Wild West Casino area in Sportsbook, which will be folded into our Caesars asset. And importantly there will be no change to the existing annual rent under the master lease with Caesars. This transaction helps balance our geographic diversification as we work to complete the acquisition of Harrah's Atlantic City and it's just another example of how VICI works constructively with our tenants even in this current environment. Turning to our tenants and the outlook of the gaming industry. Unlike many other REITs who have hundreds of tenants, we currently benefit from only having five tenant and we continue to have active dialogue with each of our tenants during this unprecedented time. We've collected 100% of our rent in April, and with respect to the outlook for May we believe all - we believe all rent will be received this month. Many of you have asked about our diversification strategy on prior calls. Specifically as it relates to investment outside of gaming, we have been very thorough in our evaluation of other sectors and have not made an investment to date by design. We believe this measured diligent approach has benefited our investors given the current environment. While we'll continue to evaluate the investment characteristics and overall attractiveness of other sectors, we will remain intensely focused on gaming as we believe at the right time gaming will yield opportunities for VICI to continue to grow creatively. In addition to our tenants, I am spending time with other casino operators to best understand the potential reopening timelines across the industry. As Ed mentioned every commercial casino property across the United States remains closed and at this time we're not yet aware of a definitive timeline for reopening. As many of you know in normal times, the gaming industry operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week 52 weeks a year and operators have extensive experience developing, communicating and executing detailed operational plans. This energy, expertise and rigour will be key to reopening safely, successfully and profitably. We are firm believers in the resilient enduring nature of the gaming industry. The game industry has an extremely loyal customer base and has proven its resilience through challenges in prior economic cycles. As Ed noted, gaming did not suffer from any pre-existing conditions heading into this pandemic. In fact, January and February of this year were among the best months, many properties have experienced in decades and we believe customers are eager to return to our facilities, particularly at the local level upon reopening. While we do not know exactly what tomorrow brings, we believe that the importance of our assets will only increase in the months and years ahead given the mission critical nature of the asset to the operators, the revenues collected by the states from gaming tax and the total jobs the casinos create in their respective communities. We retain a strong liquidity position as David will discuss and we stand ready to support our tenants to the extent absolutely necessary in ways that create value for VICI over the long term. And lastly, with respect to the Eldorado transaction. Eldorado stated in their press release last Friday morning that they continue to remain intensely focused on closing the transaction with Caesars. We stand ready to close on our portion of the overall transaction as our financing is complete, which David will discuss. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Before we discuss our financial results and balance sheet, let me take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our accounting, asset management, finance and legal teams for all their efforts and relentless focus closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic, truly a remarkable effort. I'd like to point out that we added an additional schedule to the back of our earnings release, which breaks down our cash revenue by lease and the corresponding non-cash adjustments in order to tie to GAAP revenue as presented on the face of our income statement. We also disclosed this breakdown, as well as other detailed financial information in our quarterly financial supplement, which is located in the Investors section of our website under menu heading Financials. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q1 ’20 increased 19.2% over Q1 ’19 to $255 million, while total cash revenue in Q1 ’20 was $257.6 million, an increase of 21.8% over Q1 2019. These increases were the result of adding $44.1 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019, and JACK Cleveland Thistle down acquisitions and related loan which closed on January 24th 2020. AFFO was $180 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the quarter. Our G&A was $7 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.8% for the quarter, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was nearly a 100%. Beginning January 1st, 2020, we adopted CECL, a new accounting standard, which required us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses relating to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases and similar assets. CECL is applicable to us as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the new accounting standard, as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. We have historically determined that our leases effectively have 35 year durations, given the mission criticality of the assets to our tenants. This lease duration and other factors lead to our leases being classified as finance leases for accounting purposes. The CECL allowance is derived from estimated probabilities of lease default in any resulting losses over the full life of the leases, inclusive of all extension options. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused this allowance to increase in the first quarter of 2020 to reflect the current economic environment. This resulting non-cash allowances recorded through our statement of operations impacting net income and FFO, but is excluded from the calculation of AFFO due to its non-cash nature. In the first quarter, the non-cash allowance related to CECL was $149.5 million drag on net income and a $0.32 drag on net income per share. Like to again make the point, that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to FFO and AFFO per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and capital markets activities. On January 24, 2020, we amended our credit agreement which reduced the interest rate on our term loan B from LIBOR plus 2% to LIBOR plus 175 with a LIBOR floor of 0%. On February 5th, 2020, we closed on a $2.5 billion unsecured notes offering comprised of $750 million of five year notes at 3.5%, $750 million of seven year notes at 3.75% [ph] and a $1 billion of 10.5 year notes at 4.125%. We placed $2 billion of the net proceeds into escrow pending the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction, which amount is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the Eldorado transaction does not close. The remaining $500 million of proceeds were used to retire the 8% second lien notes which were redeemed on February 20th. On February 7th, we sold 7.5 million common shares under our at-the-market equity program for net proceeds of $200 million. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion of unsecured notes currently held in escrow with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.9 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As the March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately five times, in our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 and 5.5 times. This includes the impact of the restricted cash that sits in escrow. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion in liquidity comprised of approximately $310 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds from the settlement of the 65 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreements entered into in June of 2019. Between the proceeds from the equity forward agreements and the 2 billion of unsecured notes in escrow, we have three $3.2 billion of capital earmarked for the closing of the Eldorado transaction. As noted in the press release we put on April 16th, 2020, given the economic uncertainty and a rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic together with the implementation of the new CEL accounting standard which significantly impacted net income, we withdrew our previously issued 2020 guidance and are not providing an updated outlook at this time. As many of you know, our guidance does not include acquisitions that have been announced but not yet closed. We believe this approach to guidance is prudent and responsible though it is typically resulted in a material difference between the range we provide and consensus estimates which do include pending acquisitions. Accordingly, we will evaluate the overall structure and usefulness of guidance going forward. Finally as it relates to the dividend, during the first quarter we paid a dividend of $0.2975, based on the annualized dividend of a dollar $19 per share, our AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter was 78%, slightly above our long range target to 75% as a result of the June 2019 equity offering. With that, operator please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you about some of the language in your more recent filings, were you in the context of your lease as you talk about ongoing dialogue with your tenants. So I'm assuming that rent deferrals or concessions are not on the table at this point. But could you talk about some of the things that you are considering or what you know, you might need to work with that month to help them through this time. And then my second question, you know, you talked about liquidity a little bit and is there a point where you would consider paying a portion or all of your dividend in stock or combination of stock and cash?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. Thanks, Smedes. Good to hear from you. John, why didn't you take the first part of the question regarding how we approach tenant discussions and then David can address the dividend funding question. John?
John Payne: Yes. Smedes, good morning. As I said in my opening remarks one of the advantages we do have, we have five tenants and not hundreds of tenants. So as you can imagine we are actively engaged in discussions with our tenants, not only about our leases and potential modifications, but really about their business, what they they're seeing, how they think they're going to ramp. And we've had a variety of apps from our tenants based on a variety of potential scenarios as it relates to the openings and timelines and ramps and currently right now as you know you follow the space, there's not real clarity about exactly when these assets are going to open and then there's a variety of models that we run on how they're going to ramp up. So as you can imagine the tenants are beginning to ask, some of they asks have [ph] included partial rent or relief or deferral of rent, but there are other temporary lease modifications like CapEx spend that could help our tenants preserve cash. So we're looking at this holistically, it is important to realize that we think that value needs to be traded for value and we do think that this is a temporary problem, so temporary problems need temporary solutions. And so that's how our discussions continue to go. They've been productive and hopefully we'll continue to have greater visibility in the next day or in weeks when the assets will open and then we'll get a better idea of how the assets will ultimately ramp. So Ed, I'll turn it back to you.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, you want to address the dividend funding question.
David Kieske: Yeah, thanks Smedes. Hope you’re well. As most people know or as you know, we set the payout ratio very low from day one. We've always had a targeted payout ratio of in around 75%. Obviously, we're a little bit above that given the equity offering from last June. But part of reason - part of the reason we set the payout ratio low is to be able to weather all storms and to maintain the dividend. And we're obviously in a hell of a storm right now. And so we're relentlessly focused on maintaining that dividend and as we work with our tenants we feel confident that we will be able to maintain that dividend as we sit here today. We have the liquidity to maintain that dividend. I think for me, it's part of your question was, would we consider paying some of that in stock, if needed we might evaluate that option, that would not be our first choice. But if things continue on and if we don't know what tomorrow brings, that's something we might evaluate. But at this time as we sit here today, we're very focused on maintaining that cash dividend.
Smedes Rose: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Guys, obviously you know, with the deals that you did both the equity and some of the capital markets transactions in preparation for the acquisition that you guys have closed on and plan to close on, you've let yourself in a very nice liquidity - a very nice liquidity position. As you think about the balance sheet and going through these upcoming transactions, whatever it is that they closed, you'll still - it seems [ph] have a pretty good buffer of cash. And I guess my question is, is there anything that that you guys could consider in terms of maybe some creativity around how you put that cast to work in the short term, whether that is you know, cash need to potentially support some of your tenants or cash to go out and kind of looks to be a little bit more aggressive on the M&A front as one could surmise that there will be other – other assets out there that are in need of some form of capital markets help or liquidity?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Carlo, I'll start on that. And good to hear from you Carlo, hope you are well. Maybe I just want to start by actually recognizing David Kieske for his leadership on that – the bond financing we did in late January. I remember talking to David in early January going really, you really want to go that soon and he said yeah, I want to go that soon. And God bless us that we did when we did. You may have seen that Netflix which is obviously a pretty good credit these days went out to raise money last week and they still couldn't reach our benchmark on our five year. So anyway, again, thanks and thanks to David for that. In terms of how we think about use of our cash Carlo, the general approach we're taking right now and it's an approach we really dug into with our board yesterday on our Q1 board meeting, is an approach that we define as situational readiness. At this point given the uncertainty of reopening, given moreover the uncertainty of ramp back, we have to be ready strategically and economically for the broadest possible array of situations or scenarios and that array ranges from the highly, highly defensive on one end to the highly offensive on the other. And at this time we really can't pre-commit to being highly, highly defensive or highly offensive, because it's again too early to tell. But if things start to show green shoots, if we see the consumer coming back, if we see the assets reopening and producing good results, you are absolutely right, our liquidity position puts us in a position where we can make the jump into offense potentially before others because, again, thanks to David's leadership on our balance sheet, we got a totally undrawn revolver and we have that ample cash that you referred to. But at this point, what we really like about our position is it makes this situation really ready for the broadest array of situations from again be extremely defensive to the highly offensive.
Carlo Santarelli: That's helpful. Thank you very much, Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Carlo.
Operator: Next question will come from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Good morning, guys. Trust everybody is doing well.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Thanks, Rich.
Rich Hightower: I guess, Ed just a thought - go ahead.
Edward Pitoniak: All yours.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Just a follow up I guess on that last question, as we think about longer term, maybe with respect to the external growth prospects for this sector, to the extent that you are having you know, those sorts of discussions right now with potential sellers you know, depending on their situation, do you detect an extra sensitivity around maybe layering on the added fixed costs of at least to an operators capital structure. Do you think more equities capital structures will be the norm going forward? And then maybe as we think about how coverage ratios and everything - everything along those lines will change just in the context of greater uncertainty. Obviously no one runs a business with a zero revenue outlook. But you know, just that added level of conservatism as we think about the potential rent revenue that could be out there. Does that diminish kind of you know, in light of what's happened.
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a really good question, Rich. And I think the answer could be very complex and fairly variable based on that situation of each operator. I think one point you make is absolutely right. I think you could see for both operators and REITs a more conservative approach to balance sheet management and cash flow. I think in the hedge fund - after this Lexicon [ph] the term lazy balance sheet is not going to get used for a while here. I think companies will generally get rewarded for being conservative. I do think where gaming REITs could have appeal to gaming operators who are still on the critical amount of property is that we can be another form of capital. I think you can presume their equity is going to be quite expensive. Their debt has gotten more expensive, to the extent that we can provide another form of permanent capital at affordable prices. That could be appealing, especially when combined with the fact that our capital does not bring with it any kind of bullet maturity. And I think anybody right now who is facing any kind of bullet maturity is in probably a pretty high state of nausea and we are a form of capital that does not bring that kind of anxiety with it.
Rich Hightower: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And then just a quick a quick sort of modeling question. I know you've got some time before the coverage test on the Caesars leases and certain other leases, before those tests kick in. But I think on the two Penn leases those come up in year two, do you care to sort of ballpark where we are maybe with respect to getting those escalators by that time?
Edward Pitoniak: John and David?
David Kieske: Yeah, Rich. Its David. Hope you’re well. The two leases you're referring to obviously Margaritaville and in Greektown. Margaritaville reset earlier this year, 1/1/20 and we got that escalator. We're coming up on your two Greektown. We closed at May of last year, so June 1 of this year will be the reset - yeah the reset, excuse me. And we are in discussions with Penn around that, unlikely that reset happens just given the performance of the asset.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks, David. I appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question will come from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks for taking the question. I guess, my first is for John. I guess, given your experience as an operator, how would you generally think through cash needs to reopen some of these properties and how cash generation or breakevens might change in an environment where there's just lower occupancies due to social distancing?
John Payne: Well, to remind you, I'm recovering operator, so you can only take what I said with - that I've been there. Look, I think that I've got great confidence in these operators. You know, it reminds me of the time Churchill said, never let a good crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is, this is something that no one would ever wish upon an industry or a country. But these operators have now had a few weeks without operating business to think about how they reopen them in new ways. And I think what you're going to see is obviously there's going to be restrictions on whether that's mask or social distancing restrictions. But they're also, as those pass over time, different ways of how the companies think about operating the business. So to answer your question, I think that will in the short term when revenues aren't going to be the way they were in 2019, you're going to see some margin differences in those performances, but I think that over a long period of time you're going to see those businesses come back. And teams are laser focused, the operating teams are preserving cash, ensuring they've got the right amount of cash in the cage, not too much, not too little. And we'll just have to see again how these businesses ultimately ramp.
Stephen Grambling: And then a…
David Kieske: Stephen, if I could just add a little more color to that as a fellow recovering operator in this case schemed off in my case. You know, when you're an operator your two main inventory items are the utilization of space and the utilization of time. The social distancing strategies that our operators undertake, as John has spoken of, they will obviously reduce space utilization at one time. But we were talking to one of our operators the other day and it's an example of how energetically and vigorously gaming operators think about the management of their two key inventory items, space and time. That they're taking a very innovative approach to how they manage the utilization of time and have identified segments in the day where specific customer demographics will be given a specific invitation to come at a specific time of day. And thus while the overall space utilization may be somewhat lower, you could potentially get higher utilization of day parts than you had previously because of the customer's willingness to adapt their behavior in order to safely visit and enjoy the casinos. And again, I take a lot of - I take a lot of encouragement and – well, not solace. But I think a lot of encouragements on how are operators are thinking about how they're going to manage their business in that respect. We're seeing the example close to home. As you know, within our TRS we own four golf courses, two of which are going to reopen tomorrow. And in southern Indiana, our tee sheet is full for the day and we're selling tee times based on social distance practices, right up until the 4 o'clock time slot. And any of you who ever been in golf course operations know, it's usually very tough to book the 4 o'clock in the afternoon time slot and it's an example of how I think the American consumer will adapt their behavior in order to enjoy what they really want to enjoy.
Stephen Grambling: Great, thanks. And then not to beat a dead horse, but with the stock trading where it is it seems like the market or investors are expecting some kind of relatively permanent rent reduction. I guess, are you considering or how are you thinking about permanent amendments such as rent coverage floors or just an outright change in leases at this point?
Edward Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes. Stephen, hope you’re well. And to use a business full answer it all depends, right? It's tenant by tenant specifics and what the individual circumstances are. You know, I think you heard John say, you know, could it be a form of temporary liquidity to bridge them you know, through a period of - back to Carlos or back to the question around what what's the cage cash and what are operating needs for the couple - next couple months. You know, we do benefit from the fact that we do have liquidity, so could we buy additional assets from our tenants, could we provide some form of true liquidity versus trading an asset for rent, deferred rent. And I guess, it would - it comes down to as John said, making sure that we trade value for value. The unique aspect about the sector is that these are mission-critical assets for the tenants. And unlike the broader triple net sector, where a lot of tenants are just walking and not paying - not going to pay rent and may not ever come back, you know, given the licenses, given the importance of the assets to the tenant, to the employees, to the states and the tax revenues they generate, the tenants need to maintain these boxes and need to stay in these boxes. So you know, we will find ways to help support our tenants if needed. But you know, we're still in the early stages here as we sit here May 1st and you know, the outlook for opening is still a little bit unclear, but there's some green shoots out there.
Stephen Grambling: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next question will come from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Todd Stender: Thanks. Just on that theme of cash in the cage you know, obviously visibility when states will reopen, can you speak to what states - what else they can do to lower the barrier to re-entry, modify or loosen regulations? Heard about cash in that cage, but anything else that you can think of?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yeah. I mean, I think you're thinking about this correctly. Again, we are not the operator, our tenants are, but we stay in contact and I think you're thinking about it right and that these operators are going to these states and saying look, this is unprecedented time. We don't know yet exactly the demand from our consumers when we first open up. Are there some things here that can help our liquidity position that ultimately over the next month, two months, six months, year, we'll get back to “normal operations”. So I don't have the specifics. Cash is obviously one that's been. But there are other regulations that have put in place over time. Remember many of these regulations in these states were created 20, 25 years ago and made sense. I do think that there will probably be a push over time to continue to find new ways to make it more efficient for the property. So I don't have any specifics, but I'd tell you that is what the operators are doing, are pushing the states to find ways that they can have some temporary solutions to this unique situation.
Todd Stender: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the Bally's Atlantic City transaction and how you got the results that you did?
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you. Yeah. Good to hear from you Thomas. John?
John Payne: Yeah, I mean this is a discussion and when we announced it as I said on April 24th, as we continue to look at that market, as you know, Thomas we’ll be acquiring as part of the Eldorado deal, Harrah's Atlantic City. We saw this unique opportunity to kind of decrease our position there. Well, at the same time the Wild Wild West casino and its sportsbook will be rolled into Caesars. So not all of the real estate or the asset is being sold and it also was a negotiation that allowed our rent out of the non-CPLV lease to remain the same. And we just saw this as a unique opportunity to make that transaction and for those reasons I thought it was good for us to do that.
Thomas Allen: I guess, you have the expectation that your tenant income will go down because of it and you wanted to get some incremental cash to defer that or how did you get to the $19 million calculation?
John Payne: Splitting of the - go ahead, David.
David Kieske: Yes…
John Payne: Go ahead, David.
David Kieske: That was similar that the Reno transaction where we split the proceeds 75, 25 with Caesars that we announced at the end of - the beginning of this year. Similar proceeds split roughly 75% of the total consideration went to VICI's landlord in Caesars, as operator.
Thomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good morning.
Edward Pitoniak: Good morning, John.
John Massocca: I know we've kind of belabor this point a little bit, but just given some of your commentary on prior questions, I mean, is it fair to categorize your view of negotiations with tenants that you would prefer some kind of asset for you - asset exchange or assets or liquidity exchange to the traditional deferral that maybe we're seeing more of in kind of the retail oriented net lease space?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: I think yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it. I think it's important understand also for us that it's May 1st today, the clarity on when the assets are going to open is not great. Hopefully in the next week or so we'll get greater clarity. And then how these assets ultimately ramp is not real clear. I mean, you can see there's numerous scenarios run by every operator and by us. So it's important for us to continue to see how this ultimate is going to play out. But your description is exactly how we've been thinking about it is, that these are temporary issues, there needs to be temporary solutions and those temporary solutions have to have value for value trade and that's how - that's a quick way of our overview of our philosophy.
John Massocca: Very helpful. And then switching gears a little bit, as you kind of enter what might be a more challenging environment for kind of Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Strip market. How does that change maybe philosophically the way you look at your Roper's there and maybe make it more attractive because you might be able to potentially get into a property at a lower basis or you know with a little more uncertainty would you potentially think about you're not executing on those if the opportunities arose?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. I'll turn over to John Payne in a moment. John, let's talk a bit. I think our starting point would be that while Vegas may indeed recover somewhat more slowly than the region over the long term we have no - there is no flagging of our conviction. It is one of the world's great destinations but John Payne, I’ll turn it over to you for more color.
John Payne: Yeah, I think Ed you started out answering the question perfectly. I mean we are long term investors of real estate. As you all know as David opened up by saying, we look at our leases over 35 years. This is pandemic has been just awful and unprecedented. But we do think that it is temporary. Now whether temporary is months or temporary is a year or year and a half, we'll have to wait and see that ultimately plays out. And I sure can't predict that. But it doesn't change our long term view of Las Vegas and our long term view of the very limited amount of assets that are on the strip in Las Vegas. So we still think that that is a community and a destination that over the long term will continue to perform and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities there, whether that's in the short term or in the long term. So I hope that gives you some visibility on how we're thinking about it.
John Massocca: I appreciate all the color. That's it for me. Thank you guys very much.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks, John.
Operator: Next question will come from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. You know, covered a lot of detail, but I wanted to just follow up on CECL and I did get on a minute or two late, so apologies if you've touched on this. But just a thinking and recognizing that it is non-cash and optical and what it represent. How could we think about what that will look like a quarter from now, two quarters now, three quarters from now on the assumption that we start to move down a road toward properties starting to open up.  You know, is this kind of the one big shot for it and what we see is an incremental from here, is that we might expect that to look?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah. David Katz. Good to hear from you. I'll turn over to do David Kieske in just a moment. But let me give you my perspective as a non accountant, my perspective as an asset manager. And when CECL first came along, I will confess I went really – we go to do that, why. But what I've come to appreciate about the CECL practice if you will, is that it is I believe a valuable management tool when it comes to being situationally ready. What CECL requires us to do is first of all to look forward, which is always valuable in and of itself. And as we look forward at the credit quality, credit condition and operating performance of our tenants, the forecasted performance of our tenants, it requires us to be honest and rigorous about what the various scenarios could be. And it is a further tool in our tool kit to make a situation only ready for what may transpire in the coming period based on a reasonable and rigorous forecast. As to the volatility, the CECL could bring in coming quarters and years. I'll turn that over to David Kieske.
David Kieske: Great. Thanks, Ed. And David Katz yes, as Ed said, CECL reflects the deterioration especially in Q1 in the broader economy and it's not management's expectation for any losses in the current portfolio, it is simply an accounting standard, it's a non-cash allowance. And if you look at you know, note 6 page 28, 29 of our 10 Q, we've put some good disclosure in there around how CECL evolved over the first quarter. On 1/1/2020, we had to record an initial allowance, that was 2.88% of our total investment balance. That number on a normalized - normal economic environment should answer your question David, should move around 5, 10 maybe 15 basis points a quarter. Given COVID, given the downturn, it spiked up to about 100 basis points this quarter, so that it's - the model is all identifiable inputs really around credit rating and the economic outlook of the economy. And so that's what drove the change. But once we get back to normalize run rate, you're right David, it should be much - it will be less volatile and stay within a little - more of a stated range.
David Katz: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question will come from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, just at a high level, any color on how this crisis may change or say influence thoughts on how a structure deals in the future?
Edward Pitoniak: Yeah, I'll give you some first thoughts. Barry, good to hear from you. I hope you're well. You know, as I said in regard to what Rich Hightower asked about you know, I do think you know this whole experience will cause all of us to expand the rigor with which we account for you know, extreme scenarios of performance or operating conditions. And so I think you know there will be a lot of focus, obviously on tenant credit quality, as there always – already was with us and coverage and various lease terms and conditions that give us and the tenant comfort that - that even in the most dire times we can each mutually survive and ultimately thrive. John and David Kieske, do you want to add anything to that.
David Kieske: No I think you described it well. Ed, I think will – I have nothing to add to that.
Barry Jonas: Great. And then I guess, just a follow up for me. Any color on golf operations. Just curious any expectations on when that business could reopen and what the ramp could look like for that particular business?
Edward Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yeah, I'll take - I'll take that. As Ed mentioned, we're opening two of our courses today and two of our courses tomorrow. And Nevada just gave the go-ahead two days ago. So we've not had a lot of pre-selling there and those will open tomorrow of course in Mississippi and our course in Indiana open today. And as Ed mentioned the tee sheets were quite full. So we'll continue to watch that. The operations like we're seeing in other hospitality areas are not full operations, meaning our clubhouses are not open our food and beverage are not open. I think we'll have some really good visibility over the next six weeks, as we're able to start marketing to consumers in our destination courses in Las Vegas. We'll obviously be more focused at the time on locals and in some of these courses like Cascata, which I'm not currently a golfer, but I know from golfers that's a bucket list course that we'll price at a fee to allow locals to come out and play. So we should see some good demand to start getting that business up and running. So to answer your specific question, I think we need a couple of weeks to better understand how it's going to ramp, but the early results at least what we're seeing in Indiana and Mississippi are quite encouraging.
Edward Pitoniak: What I would just add is that, while obviously the economic impact of this VICI is not all that material, I think the greater meaning for us and perhaps for you as well is that the pent up demand to get out of that damn house that it so strongly exist in America right now. I mean you're seeing it manifest itself on beaches, people just want to get out and while we see data that measures public perceptions of safety and their willingness to go back out again, while we do see a high percentage of Americans rightly saying they are going to be careful in how they return to leaving home, there's a lot of people who really, really want to leave all.
Barry Jonas: Including me. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next question will come from Sean Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Sean Kelley: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I'm not sure who this question is best for, but I'm just kind of curious as we think about the reopening plan from the operator perspective. You know, just wondering if you guys have any thoughts about how like - you know which properties reopen by the operators could - could impact sort of the difference in coverages between sort of four wall properties and the broader corporate guarantee. So maybe just your broad view on sort of how does the corporate guarantee help you in the kind of and this type of landscape and how could that fluctuate around the portfolio or impact operator decisions? Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Sure. David, you want to take that.
David Kieske: Yeah. Thanks, Seam. And as Yogi Berra once said, it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future, so you know this is where we think - this is where we take comfort in the master lease and especially across the Caesars portfolio which obviously has assets all across the country, Vegas and in very, very good regional network. So we came into this you know north of three times on a corporate coverage, given the wholly owned assets in the Caesars - in the Caesars portfolio, primarily on the Vegas strip, that corporate coverage will come down and nobody really knows where you know what the ramp will be what EBITDA will be. But you know the corporate coverage is key to us and obviously we have that with Century, Penn and you know we have the individual leases with Penn where we are [indiscernible] corporate coverage and then Hard Rock is also a corporate coverage. But given the investment grade nature of that and then we feel very, very comfortable with that and we have a corporate coverage on a smaller entity with JACK, very meaningful investment where Dan Gilbert one of the owners there. So we'll have to see. It's hard it's hard to take. It's hard to predict, the coverages will come down but we don't really you know, we don't have a good sense as John talked about how this ultimately opens and ramps.
Sean Kelley: Thanks. Thanks for entertaining that David. And then my other question was just on the JACK portfolio specifically, can you just remind us of what sort of the extra collateral or what is kind of you know what may be in that corporate guarantee beyond the you know the obvious operating properties. That's it from me.
Edward Pitoniak: David or John?
David Kieske: Yeah I can do it. Sean, couldn't think of another entertain that. Look its an entity called Rock Ohio Ventures, ROV. It owns the two casinos Jack Cleveland, JACK Thistle. JACK Cleveland actually sits within the Higbee building, which is part of ROV, Rock Ohio Ventures, as a garage next door. And then some additional land right in that area. So that's part of the reason we ultimately did that loan to JACK is there's additional real estate collateral within that entity.
Sean Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: I have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. This is Ed I hope all of you found the call to a value today and maybe even a little bit entertaining one of our owners texted me during the call and let me know he was pretty sure this was the first earnings call that invoked both Winston Churchill and Yogi Berra. So again, we hope you found the time value. And let me just close by reiterating our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. With each passing week we will learn more about what our collective recovery from COVID-19 will look like as quietly as an economy and the gaming industry and as the coming period unfold we will share along with you as we can assist you always feel you can reach out to us whenever we can be a help to you. Now you have our best wishes for good health. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.+

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today February 20, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good afternoon. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intends, projects and other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you Samantha and good afternoon to everyone on this call. We greatly appreciate you joining us. Over the course of our opening remarks and over the course of the call, we will discuss with you our 2019 Q4 and 2019 full year key activities and results. John will cover our portfolio and business growth activities and results. David will cover for you our financial results and the continuing institutionalization of our capital structure. I'll begin by sharing our thoughts on 2019 as evidence of what we've been building over the last two years or so since VICI was born. From VICI’s earliest days, we've focused relentlessly on the methods by which we will manage and grow your REIT. Taking advantage of our collective REIT experience, as a management team and as a board, we've attacked the following two questions with as much energy and rigour as we can manage. Question number one, what's the character of the culture that a great REIT grows out of? How do we attract and retain the best people on both our board and our management team, so that we can live up to what I believe is axiomatic in Real Estate Investment Management, and that axiom is simply the best people, plus the lowest cost of capital wins. Question number two, what are the partnership principles and methods to build and sustain a great REIT? With our own people, with transaction partners, with advisory partners, with capital partners, both equity and credit, and with long term operating partners or tenants. We focus relentlessly on these two questions, because we believe, finding the right answers to these questions is key to instilling and maintaining the right methods for managing, governing and growing the REIT. And we focus intensely on our methods, or means, because we fundamentally believe that the scalability of our REIT management and governance methods ultimately drives the scalability of our REIT results or [Indiscernible]. Our 2019 achievements were of a magnitude matched by very few other American REITs in 2019. We had one of the most productive and value creating years of any REIT in recent history. I'm proud of our achievements, but even more proud that these outcomes are the result of the management team and the management method that we've been building since VICI day one. And that's because the results of 2019 are done. They are history. But what our management team and method can and will achieve in 2020 and beyond, represents our future and the value we can continue to create for our stakeholders. Here is the essence of our strategic method; growing relationships. It is absolutely as simple as that. If we grow the right relationships in the right way, we will grow and sustain the value of the REIT in the right way. The right way comes down to growing and constantly bettering our business by growing new relationships with new partners, and sustaining and broadening mutually beneficial relationships with existing partners. Let me quickly run you through our key partnerships. Number one, are people. In 2019, in our second full year of operation, VICI was one of only eight American REITs to win certification as a great place to work. We are using the great places to work program to ceaselessly monitor and improve the experience of our people, because VICI’s success depends on the unceasing energy and engagement of our people. Number two, gaming partners. In 2019, we grew and bettered our portfolio by growing new relationships with operating partners in Reno, Nevada. Eldorado, Hollywood Florida, Hard Rock, Vienna Austria, Century Casinos, Detroit Michigan, Jack Gaming. In doing so, we added to the relationships we already had with great partners in Las Vegas Nevada, Caesars, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania Penn gaming. Number three, equity partners. In 2019, we grew and bettered our capital structure by growing our relationships with the equity investment community, becoming by the end of Q4, 2019 the most don't triple net REIT by America's dedicated REIT investment managers as measured both as a percentage of market cap and in absolute dollars. And it will come, when it comes to Europe's top real estate investors, VICI was their number one triple net holding at the end of Q4, 2019. Number four, credit partners. In late 2019 and early 2020, we bettered our capital structure by initiating and quickly growing a relationship with a fixed income community, raising nearly $5 billion of unsecured debt at some of the best pricing achieved in recent history, by our grade of credit. And we achieved that because in part, we are recognized and given credit for our ambition to become an investment grade credit. Number five, learning partners, it is through our relationships with great operators and knowledgeable advisers that we learn about the gaming marketplaces, those where we already own gaming real estate and where we will potentially acquire more gaming real estate. Finally, number six potential new sector partners. It is also by growing relationships with operators and NASA controllers and advisors and other experiential sectors that we are learning and will learn about these other sectors. Learning that will determine if, when, with whom, and how we will invest in other experiential sectors. This fundamental strategic method, growing our REIT and our value by growing our relationships with valuable partners, sounds simple and basic, and it is. But during my career in real estate, I've been struck over and over, by the tendency of real estate investment companies, in many different sectors to sacrifice relationships for the sake of maximizing their take in a transaction. They sacrifice potential future growth by leaving the current counterparty saying to themselves, and others in the marketplace, I will never do business with that company again if I can help it. That is not who we are at VICI, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. We are relationship builders, not destroyers and by doing so, we believe, we are value creators. Since our very first day, VICI's business development has been led by one of the very best relationship builders in American commercial real estate, John Payne. I will now turn the call over to John, and he will tell you about the relationships and value we built in 2019, and how we're approaching growth in 2020. John over to you?
John Payne: Thanks Ed. Good afternoon to everyone. As Ed highlighted, 2019 was a transformative year for VICI, our investors and our team. Over the course of the year, we were by far the most active, and led the gaming REIT sector and acquisition activity. Indeed, we were the only game REIT to announce arm length transactions in 2019. In total, we announced $4.9 billion of transactions across regional and Las Vegas assets, at a blended 7.9% cap rate. Including the pending Eldorado transaction, we increased our annualized rent by approximately 45%. Doubled our roster of best-in-class tenants, and demonstrated consistent, accretive acquisition activity for the third consecutive year. We believe our independence focus on relationships and ability to structure creative transactions that worked for VICI and our partners over the long term will only add to our momentum for years to come. During the fourth quarter on December 6, we closed the acquisition of three regional properties with Century Casinos. This $278 million transaction adds $25 million of annual rent under a master lease, representing an attractive 9% cap rate. This transaction has important strategic significance and that, it creates a partnership with Century Casino, an expert operator of small to midsize assets with ambitions to grow their U.S. platform, and demonstrates that we can partner with operators of all sizes. Just a few weeks ago on January 24th, we closed on the acquisition of JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino and a sale-leaseback transaction with Jack Entertainment. We paid a total of $843 million and added $65.9 million of annual rent to our portfolio through a master lease, which represents an attractive 7.8% cap rate for urban core real estate in Ohio, one of the fastest growing regional markets in the country. Additionally on January 15th, we announced the disposition of Harrah's Reno for $50 million. Not only will we receive $37.5 million of gross proceeds for the sale, we will also have no change to the existing annual rent under the master lease with Caesars. This is a great example of how VICI works constructively with our tenants while redeploying the sale of proceeds towards other attractive growth opportunities. As we head further into 2020, the transaction environment remains active, and we see plenty of opportunity, both within and outside the gaming industry. We also remind you that we have worked diligently to secure an embedded growth pipeline that ensures the company maintains visible, long term growth. Upon the closing of the Eldorado transaction, this embedded pipeline includes, two row four opportunities on the Las Vegas strip assets, a put-call option on two high quality assets in the growing Indianapolis gaming market, a ROFR on the world class Caesars Forum Convention Center in Las Vegas, and an additional ROFR on an urban core casino in Baltimore. We believe VICI remains in a great position to capitalize on opportunities that the market presents, and we will continue to put your capital to work, growing our portfolio, accretively, building a world-class REIT and driving superior shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our balance sheet and guidance.
David Kieske: Thanks John. I want to start with our balance sheet. Since our emergence just a little over two years ago, we brought relentless focus to ensuring that we have a capital structure that will weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection, our equity and credit partners deserved. During 2019, and into the first part of 2020, we continued to transform our balance sheet through extremely disciplined capital allocation. To summarize; in June 2019 we raised 2.4 billion of equity through the largest REIT primary share offering ever to fully fund all the equity required for the other auto transaction, as well as the JACK Cleveland Thistledown transaction. As a reminder, we upsized the offering to 115 million shares comprised of a 50 million share regular way common stock offering resulting in an immediate net proceeds of approximately $1 billion with such shares being added to our total share account on June 28. We also entered into forward sale agreements for the additional 65 million shares. Upon settlement, the forward component of the offering is anticipated to raise remaining net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, in March 2019, we officially raised 128 million of net proceeds through our ATM program. This efficiency was demonstrated again earlier this month where we sold 200 hundred million of equity via the ATM to ensure funding for active transaction pipeline. We upsized our line of credit by 600 million and made 2019 increasing the total capacity to 1 billion, enhancing our liquidity profile and extending the maturity from 2020 out to 2024. We continued on our mission of strengthening our balance sheet with the ultimate goal of achieving an investment grade rating. In November 2019, we executed our very successful inaugural unsecured notes offering with an upsize offering of 2.25 billion, which was 3.6 times oversubscribed, comprised of a billion and a quarter of seven year notes at 4.25% and 1 billion of tenure notes at four and five eighths percent. The proceeds from this offering were used to retire the secured CPLV CMBS debt where we replaced a standalone secured mortgage that carried a rate of 4.36% with a blended rate of 4.32% on the new unsecured notes that were used to retire this secured debt. We incurred total breakage costs of 110.8 million but as part of the Eldorado transaction, we will be reimbursed for half of these costs upon the closing of the ERI transaction. We took advantage of this partnership from the credit markets and on February 5th 2020, we closed on a subsequent $2.5 billion unsecured notes offering, which was 4.9 times oversubscribed comprised of $750 million of five-year notes at 3.5%, $750 million of seven-year notes at 3.750% [ph] and $1 billion of 10.5 year-notes at 4.125% [ph]. $2 billion of the proceeds from the February notes offering were put into escrow and along with the proceeds from the equity forward agreements from the June equity offering we now have $3.2 billion of capital earmarked for the Eldorado transaction. The remaining $500 million of proceeds from the February notes offering were used to retire the 8% Second Lien Notes which were redeemed earlier today. All of this debt financing significantly improves our composition and weighted cost of debt. At Emergence, we add 100% secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years. As we sit here today, post the activity in early 2020, we have 6.85 billion of total debt outstanding 69% of our debt is unsecured with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%, a weighted average year to maturity of 7.1% and we have no maturities until 2024, a significant improvement providing VICI with the ability to continue to finance highly creative transactions. Overall, 2019 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, maintain a very disciplined composition and lettering of debt whereby in any one year, we strive to have less than 20% of our total debt coming due. Safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility, opportunistically access the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all real estate transactions, and develop continued access and partnership from the equity and credit markets to finance accretive acquisitions. Maintain a long term target leverage goal at 5 to 5.5 on a net-debt-to-EBITDA basis, which we will be well within pro forma for all the transactions we have announced and migrate the balance sheet to an unsecured issuer and ultimately achieve an investment grade rating. In terms of our financial results, this afternoon we reported that total revenue in Q4, 2019 excluding the tenant reimbursements for property taxes increased 15.2% over Q4, 2018 to $237.5 million. For the full year 2019, revenues increased 9.6% over 2018 excluding the tenant reimbursement of property taxes. These increases were the result of adding a $146.6 million of annual rent during the year from the Margaritaville, Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which all closed in 2019. AFFO was $176.6 million or $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter bringing full year 2019 AFFO to $649.6 million or $1.48 per share in line with our 2019 guidance. AFFO increased 23.6% year-over-year while AFFO per share increased approximately 3.5% over the prior year, which is due to the increased share account and resulting temporary dilution from the June 2019 equity offering. Our G&A was $5.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.2% for the quarter, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model, as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was approximately 100%. As always, for additional transparency, we point you to our financial supplement for a detailed breakdown of our cash rent buy lease, which is located in the Investor’s section of our website under the menu heading, “Financials” and as always we welcome any feedback on the materials. As John mentioned on acquisitions, we closed on the Century portfolio on December 6 adding $25 million in annual cash rent at a 9% cap rate. We funded the Century acquisition using cash on our balance sheet because the JACK Cleveland Thistle down acquisitions subsequent to year end on January 24th adding $65.9 million in annual cash rent at a 7.8% capitalization rate. We funded this transaction using cash on our balance sheet. We continue to expect the Eldorado transaction to close by the end of the second quarter. We will add $253 million of annual rents increasing our total annual rent by approximately 25%. As for guidance, we are continuing to present our guidance in absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. The per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact from the additional 50 million shares of common stock issued on June 28, 2019 as well as an estimate of the additional shares from the unsettled board sale agreements that are required to be included in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method. We estimate AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2020 will be between $728 million and $748 million or between $1.50 and $1.54 per diluted share. As always, our guidance does not reflect the pending Eldorado acquisition, nor any other potential acquisition activity. Finally, in the fourth quarter we paid a dividend of $0.2975 based on the annualized dividend of $1.19 per share. The dividend was paid on January 9th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 27. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Good afternoon. Thanks for all the color on the guidance. David, to simplify you. You filed an 8-K along with one of the recent financing transactions outlining I believe is $1.85 and pro forma FFO per share for all the transactions you have in process. Can you just talk to the puts and takes of this pro forma number as we think about what has changed since that filing which included excluding also compare and contrast this to the guidance for $1.50 to $1.54? Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Steven, this is Ed. I’ll start off and turn it over to David. Yes. What you've cited is a number that represents an annualized run rate, once the Eldorado transaction closes and that again I must emphasize does not constitute our 2020 guidance. Our 2020 guidance which David just shared with you obviously does not include the impact of the Eldorado closing. We obviously do not yet know with precision exactly when our Eldorado transaction will close, and when the new rent will start coming in. But once the new rents starts coming in, if you annualize that over the forward 12 months, you get to a number very much like the number that you picked up on in the offering memorandum in the high yield document. And as to how that might or might not have changed any since then, I'll turn it over to David and he can address any other technicalities here.
David Kieske: Yes, the only thing I'd add Stephen is that it’s an annualized run rate for Eldorado, but for all the other transactions that we have announced obviously we've done a lot in 2019. So with the annualized run rate for Century, for Cleveland, JACK Cleveland Thistle downs. The $1.85 [ph] is based on the pro forma share count that in there, that obviously there's some slight changes to our share count with the ATM 7.5 million shares that we issued under the ATM just recently. So, but the run rate number is a good number based on a full year impact of all the transactions that are pro forma in that number.
Stephen Grambling: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe an unrelated follow up. So now that you've had a little bit more news and action in the space from private equity and MGM, but also one of your peers, are you seeing any change in the opportunities set for gaming deals in other words, are owners changing their view of real estate value, and their willingness to think about monetizing that? Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start off, and turn it over to John, Stephen. Yes absolutely. We're seeing increased interest in the sector which we have always hoped for and wished for. We cannot claim that this is a sector deserving institutionalization and potential cap rate compression if there's not increased better interest in it. That is fundamental to any institutionalization or cap rate compression story. And as operators or asset controllers have seen this level of activity and have seen the valuations they are understanding the role that REITs can play in helping them grow their store count or crystallized value. And I'll turn it over to John for more….
John Payne: And now I think Ed described it very well. I mean, we can't be a company that started three years ago and talked about what great real estate these gaming assets are, and not expect there to be the others who noticed that. And so it's a great time in this space and operators are understanding how REIT can help them grow their business. So it's great.
Stephen Grambling: Great, I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Just kind of along those lines. I'm just wondering, do you think that at some point you would be willing to or may need to partner with some of these larger private equity firms as they now start to maybe focus more in on this as you know its kind of one of the last sectors to be kind of institutionalized with -- I think they have sort of inherently more repetitive cost of capital? And to be need to kind of starting [ph] up? Or how do you think about that?
Edward Pitoniak: I mean, we'll certainly be open minded about it, Smedes. If in a given situation, we could get the best outcome for our shareholders by partnering with another capital provider, we absolutely would. I would just maybe, I guess, maybe a bit of a nuance. But what you have seen is the entrance technically have not private equity, you've seen the entrance of a non-traded REIT. And there is a difference there. And so far as a non-traded REIT, like high quality -- non-traded REIT like the Blackstone REIT is unlike a private equity player. Unlikely to say, okay, five, seven years from now we're getting out. The B REIT, as it's known is really a permanent capital vehicle. And we think that it is permanent institutional real estate capital that has come in as opposed to private equity per say.
Smedes Rose: Okay. That's a fair distinction. Thank you for that. And I guess my other question is just in general, are you waiting for Eldorado to close and then you have a pipeline that would be in place along with that transaction. So do you feel -- I mean, would you expect to be looking continually at other things as well? Or would you maybe take a pause while you consider what comes to you through the Eldorado transaction?
John Payne: I didn't know I was allowed to take a pause. But no, I think we are operating in the same way that we've been operating since we started the company. We're out and then started this call about relationship building and making sure people understand how we would structure a deal or look at a deal. So, yes, we've got this great transaction that we hope to close by the middle of this year with Eldorado and we obviously have spent a long time developing our embedded pipeline, but that doesn't stop us from continuing to grow the company where we see unique opportunities with great real estate.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good afternoon guys.
Edward Pitoniak: Hey, Rich.
Rich Hightower: I want to go -- I think you maybe glossed over this quickly in the prepared comments, but the ATM issuance, is that related to an unannounced deal? Or is that related to something that's already been announced? Just to clarify that.
David Kieske: Yes. Neither. We just taking advantage of an attractive stock price and a very efficient tool to access the equity markets to make sure that we've got funding for them for our future pipeline or any future needs that do arise.
Rich Hightower: Okay. So it was just totally opportunistic in that sense and just maybe safer to have a little extra equity on the balance sheet basically?
David Kieske: Exactly. Yep.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe bigger picture on the topic of non-gaming assets. Can you just maybe help us define the landscape of non-gaming hospitality opportunities out there? How do you think about it? How do you think about operators in the space? And are you discovering any hospitality focused operators that might be interested in a net lease structure along the lines of the way that casino companies have done it?
Samantha Gallagher: Yes, Rich. I mean, the way we -- and we may have talked with you previously about this. But we look at other sectors through the lens by which we evaluate and value gaming. We're looking at sectors. We're working hard to identify sectors that have low cyclicality i.e. lower than average consumer discretionary cyclicality much as gaming does. We obviously want to be looking at sectors that are not under secular threat, that are fundamentally sectors built around people sharing an experiences, same time, same place which inherently Amazon can put in the box and ship to your house. Number three, we're looking for healthy supply demand balance, given that overinvestment tends to be the surest way to destroy capital value. And then finally number four and this is probably the key filter, making sure that at the heart of the real estate is an end user experience to which the end user has demonstrated decades of loyalty, going backward and likely going forward. So, we're certainly seeing sectors that have some of those characteristics. We're meeting operators who have great operating platforms, very strong relationships with the end user, CRM systems and network effect. I think we've mentioned number those sectors in the past. We believe that demographic trends whether it would be the aging of the Baby Boom or Millennials going through family formation are going to mean very strong tailwinds for these sectors. And certainly, we are looking for sectors that either have an established triple-net model which you've referred to or are capable of supporting a triple-net model. And so much of that comes down to the operators business -- being a business where the operator is highly incentivized and highly rewarded at owning the operating leverage of the business. I mean, you and I talk about hotels a lot. And one of the struggles in the hotel business right now is the misalignment as to where owner -- the ownership of operating leverage resides, which is usually where the real estate owner, almost always with the real estate owner and where operating responsibility if you will tend to reside which is i.e. not with the real estate owner. That's the model we'd rather stay away from. And so we're going to prioritize sectors where the operator's economics can support our kind of structure.
Rich Hightower: Got it. I would appreciate that color. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sean Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Sean Kelley: Thank you. I think most of our questions were already answered. Appreciate it.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Indiscernible] asking on behalf of David. Given the ATM insurance and upsized debt issuance, do you have some access cash on your balance sheet. Do you anticipate going to that market again soon for other acquisitions in the pipeline?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. As we think about future acquisitions obviously our playbook to-date and we'll continue this playbook as upon announcement of a transaction. If there's a requirement for equity, we would go to the market that day and raise equity match fund the equity side. But just to clarify. The debt proceeds or the debt offering that we've done to date, all that's been earmarked either for the Eldorado transaction or the refinancing, the second leans that happened today. And so the ATM again was just an efficient use -- efficient way to access the equity markets and raise a little additional capital for the active transaction pipeline we have.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, it's Steve [Indiscernible] on for Carlo. Thanks for taking our questions. First, we just wanted to clarify one thing with respect to the $58 million debt extinguishment charge. Does that relate to the CMBS? And will there be a reimbursement from ERI at the conclusion of the transaction, as I believe you are splitting the cost of the breakage?
David Kieske: Yes. It's David. And just as I mentioned in my remarks, the total charge is $110.8 million. We split that 50/50 with Eldorado. So the $58 million that shows up on our income statement is $55.4 [ph], plus some transaction legal fees related to the retirement of that debt.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then given one of your competitors had some circumstances at present that one can imagine, puts them potentially at a bit of a pause. Do you believe there to be opportunities at present with less potential competition presenting themselves to you?
Edward Pitoniak: We really never look at these deals that there's less competition especially back to our opening remarks about how attractive this real estate is and how we've been communicating that since we started the company. So at least from our philosophy how we go into looking at a deal especially one that we know is on the market, I don't think we approach it to say there's less competition today than there has been in the past.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Adam from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Daniel Adam: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Given your cap rate compression and the recent lift that we've seen in publicly traded opcos in recent months i.e. Penn. I'm wondering if you're noticing an increased willingness at all would be sellers to transact?
Edward Pitoniak: I don't know if it's because of the last activity that you're talking about and they're seeing that their opco multiples are going up. I think it's just a matter of as we've said before, as more people are educated on this space, they're understanding how a REIT can fit into their portfolio. How we can help them, grow their businesses. So I think you maybe seeing some of that. I'm not sure necessarily it has to do with the stock price moving on the opcos or the propcos right now, I think its just a matter. There's been years now of helping folks to understand that.
Edward Pitoniak: And I think there's increasing understanding through the work we're doing, as well as our colleague in the sector are better understanding, Dan, around how to think about the capital we provide, whether in a sale-leaseback or by partnering some -- with someone when it comes to helping them increase their store count by partnering with them on their purchase of the opco and our purchase of the propco. And I think there's a greater and greater understanding that we are a permanent capital provider. The capital we provide does not have a maturity date. It does not need to be paid back. And I think as everyone thinks over the long-term about how they're managing their own capital structures and the risks associated with their capital structures, they realized the value of not having large bullet maturities to the extent that doing either sale-leaseback with a gaming REIT or partnering with the gaming REIT to acquire an opco accreatively, enables them to reduce their risk profile over time when it comes to again the laddering of their liability.
Daniel Adam: Great. That color is very helpful. And I know that you alluded to this both in the prepared remarks well -- I think John and Ed in prepared remarks, and Ed in another question. But its interesting that this morning the question of monetizing real estate actually came up on six flags earnings call. And I'm just wondering what opportunities, specifically what experiential markets in particular do you see the biggest opportunity outside of the gaming respace for you guys? Thanks.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Again, I think it would be in the context of that that, if you will that four lens framework I spoke of regarding cyclicality, there's secular threat, supply/demand balance and durability they experienced, certainly the theme park business looked at broadly is a business that has certainly proven its durability over time. The supply/demand balance tense to be pretty healthy and so far as these are very expensive asset to build. I don't know when we last had a Greenfield asset in the theme park, American theme park sector. It is again not something Amazon can ship to your house. And generally speaking, especially drive to theme parks have tended to whether economic downturns quite well. So it would be representative of the kind of experiential center -- sector, sorry, that takes those boxes.
Daniel Adam: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from RJ Milligan from Baird. Your line is open.
RJ Milligan: Hey, good evening guys. My question on the 185 run rates for all post announced transactions, that does include all financing for those transactions. Is that correct?
David Kieske: That's right. Yes. The pro formas in there reflect the recent high yields and obviously the June 2019 equity offering, but again that's not our guidance, that's a pro forma 8-K number.
RJ Milligan: Fair enough. And I guess, is it fair to assume that you will continue to pursue deals, only deals that are accretive?
David Kieske: Absolutely, RJ. I think we've shared with you, REIT has an opportunity to do one bad deal, because after that we won't have access the capital or the support of credit markets or the equity market to continue on. So anything we do will be accretive.
Edward Pitoniak: And we don't plan to do that one bad deal.
RJ Milligan: So I guess it's fair to assume then, if you take the $1.85 run rate for the trans -- once the transactions are close on a pro forma basis, if you were to assume any additional transactions or acquisitions that it would therefore be higher than that $1.85 run rate?
David Kieske: That's the fair assumption.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Our board certainly wouldn't let us get very far if we came along and say, yes, you know that $1.85 was actually now $1.83 because we just did a bad deal. Not that we will bring anything like that to the board in the first place, but I can tell you they wouldn't certainly say Pasco. Now, we're always going to be really determined to generate accretion. It is what our investor deserve. It is how value gets created. And frankly RJ, it's how we get paid. We get paid on total return. And needless to say, total return is likely to suffer whenever we do a deal that causes our FFO per share to decline on a per share basis.
RJ Milligan: Thanks. That's helpful. Yes, I'm just looking at 2021 consensus is below that $1.85 run rate. So it seems like numbers might be to change?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. And I think in fairness, RJ. We feel for everybody in the work they have to do out there like you do, because VICI has been a case of many moving parts and a lot of complexity over the last, especially whatever it is now, nine, 10 months since we announced our transformative deal with Eldorado. To unfairness to everybody, it's been hard to piece things together. But what we did achieve with the January financing, I guess, it closed in early February was cost of funding clarity for every dollar that ends up paying for the Eldorado deal. Is that's a good way to put it, David.
David Kieske: Absolutely.
RJ Milligan: That's helpful. And my last question is just and I think maybe you mentioned this, but if I may have missed it. Any thoughts on timing on looking at the ROFR assets?
Edward Pitoniak: Well, it depends on which ROFRs you're talking about. I assume you're talking about the Las Vegas ones. And I think that -- this is one where we're going to be prepared, should Tom and its really up to Caesars and Tom Reeg running that business. If they would like to transact on one of those we're going to be prepared to do that, whether that's in later 2020 or on further years.
RJ Milligan: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricardo Gila [ph] from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Earlier today Bloomberg cited that Las Vegas Sands had interest or had inquire about the new Caesars flume [ph]. I know that you guys have a contractual obligation -- a contractual rights on the real estate for that asset. Hypothetically, if Las Vegas Sands or any other operator wanted to acquire that asset how would that work out given that you guys have a contractual rights on that asset?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Well, Ricardo, I'll start and then John can add in. First of all, we obviously don't -- as a practice, we do not comment on rumors, and we don't really speculate on hypotheticals. I think what we'll just emphasize to you is that Caesars has built a magnificent new convention center in back of Harrah's Las Vegas which we obviously owned and we encourage everybody to be there. Try to be there in April, John, because.
John Payne: The NFL draft we hosted there this year.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, it will. Yes, it will. So, sorry, we can't help you out on the rumors of this or any kind of hypotheticals Ricardo, but we will just leave it at it is a beautiful structure upon which we do have what you refer to which is a put-call agreement [ph] with Caesars.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Edward Pitoniak: Good afternoon, John.
John Massocca: Touching on Ricardo's question and maybe kind of a different angle. If there was a transaction that occurred because of the put-call, you're right, would survive any transaction, correct?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. That's correct.
David Kieske: That's correct.
John Massocca: Okay. All right. Then I guess shifting over to the balance sheet. When I think about the pricing on the private placement that you closed in February. How do you think that would have compared from a rate perspective to what you could have gotten had you been an investment grade issuer?
David Kieske: I mean, John, you've seen the -- just earlier this week I think National Retail Properties went down and look at a 30-year bond at low threes. So there's 75 to 100 basis points depending on the conditions of the market that over time we can look to take off our price of debt capital.
Edward Pitoniak: It's significant, John.
John Massocca: Okay. Makes sense. And I guess outside of that are there any other kind of levers you think you can pull with regards to the balance sheet today particularly given with the prepayment of the second lien notes. The balance sheet kind of look like how you want to look long term or there some other levers that you could potentially pull?
David Kieske: I mean the next -- the gating item now, John, is just to get rid of that term loan. It swapped. We're going to swap to rolls out early next year and swap to rolls out in 2023. But the term loan encumbers every one of our assets. So all of our assets are secured by the term loan. And so that the gating item for the agencies and what would trigger us to become -- ultimately allow us to become investment grade rated. So we want to work on repaying that officially and minimizing the breakage cost on those swaps over time.
John Massocca: Understood. And then one last detail question. Is the ATM issuance in 1Q 2020, is that baked into the guidance number you put out?
David Kieske: It is, yes.
John Massocca: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you very much.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Hi, guys. Thanks for all the color. I think you've answered just about all the questions. But just, I guess to get your thoughts. There's at least a handful of casino properties around the U.S. that have received a lot of capital dollars lately whether new or renovations that seemingly have pretty substantial real estate or replacement value, but have not yet ramped cash flows. Just want to get your thoughts on how you kind of look at maybe some of those opportunities? And how you kind of think about the value of acquisition targets between the actual values of real estate and maybe cash flows that might take a little longer to get to where they should be. There is there an opportunity to do something or is it kind of just wait and see from your perspective?
Edward Pitoniak: Well, I think as a guiding principles, John, if you're going to be the real estate owner of an asset, the thing you most want is for the operator or the tenant, the occupant to be as successful as possible and is absolutely comfortable and confident with their own economics as possible, because it's just simply never all that good to have a tenant operating really on a tight margin literally or figuratively. So, we would always obviously talk to anyone and everybody about how to be helpful to them as a capital partner, as a real estate partner, but I think as you may be heard us say in the past, we kind of live by an adage, talk to us by our Board Member, Craig MacNab, which is that the rent should be as low as possible as a percentage of the operators economics. And so obviously the greater the degree to which the asset has stabilized and revealed what is likely to be its run rate economics, the more confident both the operator and the real estate owner can be in their underwriting such that the resulting opco, propco arrangement, the resulting lease is highly sustainable.
John DeCree: Thanks. That's definitely answers my question. Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from Jay [Indiscernible] from SMBC. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Assuming the best for last. Thanks guys. As we think about diversification pro forma of the Eldorado merger you have about 83% rent exposure to Eldorado Caesars. So considering your robust in-place pipeline and your comments to form new relationships, how should we think about both growth and diversification going forward?
John Payne: Well, you can see from when we started the company a couple of years ago that we've been on a mission to diversify our tenant base. And I think we've done a good job in a short period of time, but we're not done yet. So, as Ed started his comments, this is about building relationships, understanding the operators and how we may help them continue to grow. So I don't know if that exactly answers your question. But we are still looking for opportunities not only with our growth pipeline as you talked about but outside that with new operators in gaming and outside gaming as Ed mentioned.
Edward Pitoniak: You know I'll just add maybe put it in the context. As we've revealed or disclosed in our investor deck, our run rate rent once everything closes I think around $1.2 billion.
David Kieske: $1.25 billion, yes.
Edward Pitoniak: $1.25 billion. So obviously a point of that is $12.5 million, right? And so with every deal we can do that might involve say, we're going to take $50 million of rent, right. We can take that down potentially four points, right? So, it's something we work relentlessly on, not simply to diversify for the sake of diversifying. We wouldn't do a bad deal just for the sake of creating any kind of further diversity of the rent role, but certainly in adding the relationships we've added through John's leadership with Penn, with Hard Rock, with Century, with JACK. We've made it for a better portfolio and obviously better risk adjusted returns.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. And then just one follow up. As we see -- as we have seen Blackstone come in and take a further entrance into the space. As you guys talk to operators, have you seen any cap rate compression in either Las Vegas or original casinos?
Edward Pitoniak: No. I mean I think you're seeing -- you've seen the transactions that has been out there. Obviously, you're talking about the Blackstone transaction with Bellagio where they paid a 5.75% cap rate when it comes to -- you have to really take this one asset at a time, one location at a time, one region at a time. But we've had again as we've talked a lot on this call, we've had good conversations with potential sellers, and we'll continue to do that.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. And I know on the 3Q call we talked about Bellagio, but just seeing that Blackstone is now involved with JV find Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand with 6.35 cap rate just seen them coming further. Wondering if that's change in the conversations between you and potential operators?
Edward Pitoniak: They're obviously paying attention. They are also obviously paying attention to the fact that our cost of capital along with the cost of capital of -- our peers is improving as well. And this will be a fluid marketplace. There will be a lot of data points people look at when it comes to estimating or negotiating for value. But again this is something as real estate people were very comfortable with, because it is in the nature of institutionalizing markets that there will be this fluidity. And as long as we can maintain a positive investment spread based on our cost of capital and the income yield that we're buying, we believe we're creating value for our shareholders through creative additions, AFFO per share.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Thank you for taking me back in. One quick one. You mentioned being effectively partners in capital allocation with your tenants. I guess a broader question around the right CapEx requirements for any of the properties that you own or otherwise. Is any kind of rules of thumb given your background in the industry that you would point to is really being the right level of maintenance CapEx for your properties? Thank you.
David Kieske: Yes. It's a very good question and it really depends on the asset that we're talking about. As you can see with the deals that we've done starting with Harrah's Las Vegas, we negotiated $171 million of capital will come in, because we thought it was critically important for that business to grow and the numbers that we are underwriting to add that capital. You really need to take it property by property, age by age, what a new property like JACK, Cleveland or JACK Thistledown, which are brand new properties and what they need and maintenance capital is very different than an asset that had 30 years old and as capital. So it's hard to give the range. But as we look at deals that we do that's the type of stuff that we spend time with on the property with the operator understanding not only their maintenance but their growth capital.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, Steven, I'll just add and given your other coverage areas, this should resonate with you. In my case as somebody has run to hotel REIT, I got to say I like this business model a whole lot better. Because the CapEx belongs to the operator who owns the operating leverage. And it is the operator who will suffer first and suffer most consequentially if they fail to invest in their property and keep it competitive because again they own the operating results. But looked at it in a more positive way the operator gets the reward they deserve to get when they invest in the property and they improve the performance of the property whether through CapEx or improved operations. So we think that this is a much better model for incentivizing and rewarding proper stewardship of the asset by the operator both again in terms of the continuing investment in the property and continuing to improve its performance.
Stephen Grambling: Maybe without pegging you down too much would you generally think that capital intensity is higher like for like for Las Vegas or destination assets relative to regional properties or you generally think that the capital intensity of a casino is higher or lower than a hotel?
David Kieske: Well, the largest capital expense for maintenance for casinos is the hotel. So if you're in a destination resort, you're most likely going to have a hotel.
Edward Pitoniak: The way I look at it is as a non-gaming guy, Steven, is that if you look for instance, in Las Vegas, is the capital intensity of a Las Vegas asset higher than the capital intensity of a regional asset. Absolutely yes. The thing you though have to ask at the same time is the revenue intensity of Las Vegas asset had higher than the revenue intensity of a regional asset. And I'm going to put Danny on the spot, because Danny you share with me a statistic for instance as to the revenue productivity per gaming position in Las Vegas versus the regions.
Danny Valoy: Yes. It's a multiple depending on the market and I think certainly in Las Vegas you also have to take the tax rate into account, because you're only operating with a tax rate at sub 7%.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. But there is a multiplier effect in terms of the revenue intensity preposition for instance slot machines I think it was a multiple that was well into the whole numbers as to the revenue intensity per position. So you can support higher CapEx when the asset has a much higher revenue productivity character to it or to put it another way, one of the things I don't think gets paid enough attention to in gaming and frankly other sectors is the revenue to asset ratio. How many pennies of revenue are you producing per dollars of capital deployed? And once you get to Vegas the revenue intensity and thus the revenue to asset ratio I think is very positive.
Stephen Grambling: That's great color. Thanks so much.
Operator: And your last question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Just a quick follow up on guidance. Generally speaking what is the isolated impact of the treasury stock solution on guidance?
David Kieske: John, I mean, we have 60 million shares that reflects the dilutive impact from the forward sale agreements under the treasury stock method. We can walk you through that of the number.
John Massocca: That's perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Ed Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you operator and thanks again everybody for your time today. We look forward to providing you an update on our continued progress when we report our first quarter results. And again thank you for making time this late in your day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today November 1 2019. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher General Counsel with VICI Properties. Go ahead.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you operator and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will expect should guidance intends projects and other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be concerned in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our third quarter 2019 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today we have Ed Pitoniak Chief Executive Officer; John Payne President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you Samantha and good morning everyone. This third quarter of 2019 was another quarter in which VICI continued to build for our shareholders an institutional quality real estate portfolio and an institutional quality balance sheet. In a moment John Payne will tell you about our growth initiatives in quarter 3 and since the end of quarter 3 and then David Kieske will tell you about our financial results and balance sheet initiatives. But first I'd like to spend a few moments on recent developments in our marketplace and what they may mean for VICI over time. I'm referring in particular to the news 2 weeks or so ago of Blackstone buying the real estate of Bellagio. When we launched VICI a little over two years ago we were charged with and charged up about the opportunity to tell the equity and credit investing communities that gaming real estate possesses the characteristics that typify institutional-grade real estate. These characteristics distill down to the real estate being mission-critical and critically difficult to replace for tenants whose end user relationships and economics have endured and will endure for decades. And we said from the beginning two years ago that the time would come when more America's commercial real estate investors would come to investigate and invest in America's gaming real estate. All along, we said that this growing recognition would be inevitable, and it would be welcome, given that real estate doesn't achieve its full value until this recognition takes place by institutional capital, or to repeat the phrase we use on our quarter one 2019 earnings call validation drives valuation. Blackstone's purchase of the Bellagio real estate is just that sort of validation and thus GIFs in all respects, a good thing for VG for our shareholders for our sector. Some have asked why took so long. Others have asked how fast other institutional investors are likely to move. Well it took time for Blackstone and will take time for others like Blackstone. Because learning takes time. Institutional real estate investors make educated investment decisions. Before they invest capital they invest time. They take the time necessary to study an asset classes cyclical risk its secular risks its vulnerability to oversupply and in B2C real estate the credit quality and business model sustainability of the tenant. Blackstone obviously benefited from the learning they obtained through their investment in Cosmopolitan and no doubt they study rigorously before they made that Cosmo investment decision and reaffirmed their learning before making their Bellagio investment decision. Learning takes time and it takes diligence. And advantage accrues to those institutional real estate investors who learn about previously noninstitutionalized asset classes at the highest velocity. If what they learn leads to positive views on the asset class they can execute highly attractive investments before other market participants are ready to do so. At VICI we call this accelerated asset class learning process cognitive arbitrage. It's arbitrage borrowing of doing the hard work of learning and then acting on that learning. Blackstone is not the first institutional real estate investor to figure out the value of Las Vegas Strip real estate nor would they claim to be. The fact is that retail real estate equity investors have understood for years that the Las Vegas Strip is one of the most valuable real estate markets in America. Just ask David Simon of Simon Properties what kind of capital he has been willing and able to put into Las Vegas Strip real estate. And real estate credit investors have also long understood how valuable Las Vegas Strip real estate is and have lent against it accordingly with the recent refinancing of Las Vegas Sands is Grand Canal Shoppes at an appraised 4.5% cap rate as evidence of that. But here's a key fact. There are still many institutional real estate investors who have not yet started or are just beginning the work of understanding the real investment -- real estate investment characteristics of our sector. As they learn about our sector the demand for and value of gaming real estate including our assets will grow. We've been asked if we are likely to see increased bidding competition for assets we believe we will. Will this increase the risk that we may be outbid for assets? We believe it may. But if we get outbid for an asset it means asset values are rising. And if the values of traded assets rise history will tell you that the market is pretty effective at marking non-traded assets to market. Unless a given portfolio suffers from specific idiosyncrasies such as troubled tenants or troubled governance. VICI suffers from none of those troubles. So we believe that if asset values rise our cost of capital should further improve correspondingly enabling us to sustain our competitiveness for gaming assets and for non-gaming asset classes as well. Some of you understandably are asking what this Bellagio transaction means for regional gaming real estate. Simply put we believe it means good things. The Bellagio trade over time will bring increased focus on and interest in the gaming real estate asset class as a class. Take high flow-through logistics real estate as an example. An asset class that I spent time around thanks to my association with the great folks at real time. When the real estate investment market began to appreciate the mission-critical nature of distribution real estate to the final miles of e-commerce the initial focus was on markets proximate to the biggest urban cores such as Northern New Jersey and L.A.'s Inland Empire. As understanding of the mission-critical nature of this real estate grew the investment bull's eye also grew to include other geographic regions. Take as an example the $177 million suburban Cleveland Amazon distribution center across the street from the Thistledown Racino asset we announced the acquisition of earlier this week or take the deal Prologis announced on Monday by at an estimated 4.5% cap a portfolio of logistics assets concentrated largely in the mid-Atlantic and the Upper Midwest. We really believe sorry, the same ripple out dynamic will play out for regional gaming real estate. As a real estate investment market comes to appreciate the mission critical nature of regional regional gaming real estate to America's great regional operators, especially those for whom regional assets are key spokes in their national hub and spoke network. There will be differences in value between Las Vegas and regional gaming real estate, but these will be differences of degree, not kind. We've also been asked about right of first refusal or rovers on to to do be determined Caesars own Las Vegas Strip assets are worth as much now that this velocity of trade is hurt. Our answer is that we believe they're worth more now. rights of first refusal simply aren't worth a lot in a marketplace where there aren't likely to be many offers. If there is indeed likely to be more institutional real estate investor interest in Las Vegas Strip real estate and if Caesars decides to sell the entirety of 1 or 2 Las Vegas Strip assets that is both opco and propco. These ROFRs give us an exclusive window of opportunity and with that an exclusive window of time to find an operator who can partner with us to acquire the asset. Caesars will and must make the best total value decision for their shareholders but we believe these ROFRs should enable us to consummate a transaction with Caesars at a fair price and with quick execution without Caesars necessarily having to bear the cost and market risk of a prolonged marketing process. All in all our excitement around VICI's value creation opportunity grows with every quarter. And John will now share with you on recent exciting developments. Over to you John.
John Payne: Thanks Ed and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter on September 20 we officially closed on the acquisition of JACK Cincinnati Casino and partnership with Hard Rock International. We were happy to close the first acquisition we announced in 2019 and we are very excited about the future of this property under Hard Rock's leadership. As many of you know earlier this week we announced our fourth transaction of 2019 in which we will acquire JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino and a sale-leaseback transaction with Jack Entertainment. We are paying a total of $843 million which represents an attractive 7.8% cap rate for urban real estate and will add $65.9 million of annualized rent to our portfolio. The transaction will expand our footprint in the state of Ohio one of the healthiest and fastest-growing regional markets across the country and will add a fifth tenant to our roster. We're very excited about beginning our long-term partnership with the team at Jack Entertainment and we will look for ways to partner with the Rock Ventures family of companies as they further their investment in Cleveland and concentrate on select assets within gaming. The transaction with JACK brings our total announced transactions in 2019 to $4.9 billion and total announced transactions since our company was formed just over two years ago to $7.6 billion. We are often asked how we've announced so many complex transactions in such a short period of time. As I've said since we started the company the principal keys to our success have been our true independence our deep understanding of the tenant's underlying business our focus on executing what we consider fair deals and finally our willingness and ability to structure deals to meet our operators' needs. Over the coming months we will focus on closing our remaining pending transactions as quickly and efficiently as possible. We continue to believe we have the best growth profile amongst our peers heading into 2020 and our significant embedded pipeline allows us to build on this growth consistently in the future. We also continue to invest time including through engagement with operators and learning about sectors outside of gaming as we work toward our goal of building a best-in-class REIT with geographic tenant and sector diversification. We have proven the ability to source and execute accretive deals and we will continue to evaluate transactions on their financial and strategic merits as we consider increasing our investment universe. We believe that the acquisitions we've announced to-date have demonstrated this discipline not only to our operating partners but also to our shareholders who have entrusted us with their capital. With that I will turn the call over to David who will discuss our balance sheet and financial results.
David Kieske: Thanks John. I'll first cover a few of the highlights from our quarterly financial results before turning to our balance sheet and capital markets activity. Our total revenues in Q3 '19 excluding the tenant reimbursement of property taxes which are no longer required to be presented on the income statement under ASC 842 as of January 1 2019 increased 7.4% over Q3 '18 to $222.5 million. Cash rent revenue from our leases was $219.4 million for the quarter and included $1.3 million related to the JACK Cincinnati acquisition which closed on September '20. Our G&A was $6.7 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 3% for the quarter which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We incurred approximately $1 million of transaction expenses in the quarter primarily related to the legal and accounting costs associated with documenting the leases for JACK Cincinnati and the Eldorado transaction. These costs are required to be expensed under the new leasing guidance. Our AFFO for the third quarter was $164.6 million or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis. AFFO increased 24.5% year-over-year while AFFO per diluted share decreased approximately 3% over the prior year given the increased share count and related dilution from our equity issuances in November of 2018 and in June of 2019. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model. Flow-through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was approximately 106% while flow-through of cash revenue to AFFO was approximately 95%. As always for additional transparency including a detailed outline of our cash rent revenue by lease we point you to our quarterly financial supplement which is located in the Investors section of our website under the menu heading Financials. We welcome any feedback on the materials. Moving on to our balance sheet and funding activities. As a reminder on June 28 we completed an upsized follow-on offering of 115 million shares sold at a price of $21.5 per share for net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion. The offering was comprised of a 50 million share regular way common stock offering resulting in immediate net proceeds of approximately $1 billion and such shares being added to our total share count on June 28. We also entered into forward sale agreements for the additional 65 million shares. Upon settlement the forward component of the offering is anticipated to raise net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. We retain the ability to settle the forward transaction in whole or in tranches at any time between now and September 26 2020. Our objective with the June offering was to immediately de-risk the balance sheet by effectively locking in funding certainty for the announced and prospective deals. With this approach we continue to have some near-term dilution but we believe this capital ensures that we have the balance sheet flexibility needed to close on the announced transactions and provide our shareholders with very attractive long-term growth. For the remainder of the long-term funding needed to close the Eldorado Century and Cleveland/Thistledown transactions as well as the refinancing of the existing secured CMBS loan currently on Caesars Palace Las Vegas. We intend to access the debt markets through a combination of term loan and unsecured bonds on a leverage-neutral basis. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.96% 98% of our debt is fixed with the remaining 2% floating providing clarity to our future interest expense. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately four,.three years and we have no debt maturing until 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in liquidity including approximately $774 million of cash and short-term investments and availability of $1 billion under our revolver. This $1.8 billion in liquidity does not include the forward equity component of $1.3 billion I referenced above. Finally as of September 30 our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 4.2x well below the low end of our long-term target of 5x to 5.5x. Regarding our acquisition activity we continue to pursue consistent accretive growth and work to close the transactions we have announced in 2019. As John mentioned we closed on the JACK Cincinnati transaction on September 20th adding approximately $42.75 million in annual cash rent at a 7.7% cap rate. We funded JACK Cincinnati using cash on our balance sheet. With respect to the JACK Cleveland Thistledown acquisition that we announced on October 28 we will not need any additional equity to fund this transaction on a leverage-neutral basis. As I mentioned we had prudently raised all the equity funding required in our successful June 2019 follow-on offering. Between the 3 announced pending transactions the century portfolio Eldorado and JACK Cleveland Thistledown we will add just over $343 million in annual cash rents increasing our annualized rental income by approximately 37% on a run rate basis. In terms of timing we expect the century portfolio to close by year-end and expect JACK Cleveland Thistledown to close in early 2020 and the Eldorado transaction is targeted to close in the first half of 2020. With respect to guidance we will continue to present our guidance in absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis to provide additional transparency. We are updating our full year 2019 guidance to reflect the closing object Cincinnati on September 20. And the acceleration of the deferred financing fees that have been incurred in connection with a $4.7 billion bridge facility for the Eldorado transaction. The pressure estimates reflected dilutive impact of the additional 50 million shares of common stock issued on June 28, as well as an estimate of the additional shares from the forward sale agreements that are required to be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method. We now expect to be between 645,000,650 million or dollar 47 and $1 48 per share, versus our prior guidance of 635 million to 645 million, or dollar 45 to $1 47 per share. As always our guidance does not reflect any of the pending acquisitions or prospective capital markets activities. On our dividends for the second year in a row we announced an increase in our annual dividend during the third quarter. We paid a dividend of $0.2975 based on an annualized dividend of $1.19 per share representing a 3.5% increase from the prior annualized dividend. The dividend was paid on October 10 to stockholders of record on September 27. With that operator please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Carla Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carla Santarelli: Hey guys, good morning And Ed thank you very much for all the commentary on questions you were obviously going to get. When you think about kind of the incremental entrants into the space and not just referring to the recent Blackstone deal but others that are suspected to be milling around and potentially doing some work. How do you think it affects -- we could all kind of debate I guess your cost of equity and how it affects your trading multiple. But how do you think it affects your cost of capital on the debt side? Meaning in your discussions with lenders which presumably you've been mired in for quite some time now as you get ready for the upcoming deals. Has the tenor changed as more kind of entrants come into this space and people get more comfortable with what exactly it is you guys are doing?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Carla it's a great question. And I think we can apply that term I used in my opening comments cognitive arbitrage to the credit markets as well. This is a new real estate asset class and real estate lenders have had to work to understand it in much the way that real estate equity investors have had to work to understand it. Because obviously they need to understand the key investment characteristics of our assets and the key characteristics of our credits -- our tenants sorry in their credit quality. And I think you could presume that over time we believe at least that the credit market will underwrite our real estate in such a way that it will start to more resemble through institutional real estate credit quality underwriting.
Carla Santarelli: Great. And then David just -- I'm fairly sure I know the answer to this but I want to make sure I'm 100% clear. The guidance you guys provided. I know you said you expect Century to close but certainly not included in your implied fourth quarter guidance correct?
David Kieske: That's right Carla. And just survey is clear everything that has been announced is not included in the guidance. So the guidance has been updated for the Cincinnati closing as well as some changes in some deferred financing fees. But guidance does not include Century Eldorado or the recently announced Cleveland/Thistledown transaction.
Carla Santarelli: Great. Thank you guys. Appreciate
Operator: Your next question comes from John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the colors. Ed in your prepared remarks you spoke a lot about the Bellagio transaction which was really helpful. There were 2 other transactions in and around the Strip Circus Circus and Rio. I think those kind of come with a little bit of a development opportunity and some land. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on those? And there's some development on the Strip Resorts World that drew Las Vegas. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on what development and those types of projects look like on the Strip in the context of VICI and additional opportunities that you see for yourself?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes John I'll start this and then I'll turn it over to my colleague John Payne. I think the starting point for us is we are tremendous believers in Las Vegas. The market as a whole the Strip downtown locals. And we just think that the fundamentals of Las Vegas are so strong when it comes to truly being a global city with the infrastructure to support the volume of activity that does take place there will continue to take place there from so many different visitor segments. In the particular case of Rio and Circus Circus I think we see those as both redevelopment repositioning opportunities. And at this point we didn't see a compelling need or opportunity to participate in those but we absolutely wish the new owners of those -- both of those 2 assets the very best and we believe they can succeed. They're obviously very smart investors and operators in both instances. And beyond that I'll turn it over to John for his further color.
John Payne: Yes. Look I think John a great question. And Ed touched on almost all of it. In his opening remarks he did refer to the 2 ROFRs we have in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're quite excited about for the long-term. And we'll continue to watch how the new development opens up. As you know there has not been new development in Las Vegas for almost a decade. And it'll be exciting to add new product into that market and continue as Ed said to be this world-class destination resort market that caters to just a wide variety of demographics and age groups. So we're excited to see those open.
John DeCree: That's helpful. And to stay on Las Vegas Strip for a quick follow-up. John maybe a question for you. With your 2 ROFRs and you think about your portfolio is there a thought or any concern about taking too much exposure to a singular market like Las Vegas. Is that something that you would be focused or right now is kind of the whole map still open and kind of agnostic to location at this point?
John Payne: No. I mean we think about that obviously. And what we like about our portfolio today is how diverse it is and we do have Las Vegas exposure and we have large regional exposure and we're also continuing to grow our pie. And so we see this opportunity to continue to be diverse in many different markets. And we realized we've said from the start of the company we really like Las Vegas we like the Strip we like the locals market and we like downtown as well. And so we'll continue to evaluate opportunities there. But we don't think there's overexposure because we also plan to continue to grow our company in other ways outside of Las Vegas.
John DeCree: Very helpful. I appreciate it. And congratulations again on all the successful activity. A - Edward Pitoniak Thank you, john.
Operator: Your next question comes from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Barry Jonas: Hey, guys, good morning.Just maybe 2 questions. First can we talk about golf operations for the quarter? It came in a little bit lower than what we were thinking especially on the margin. Just any color there? And maybe what's the right way to think about that business going forward.
Edward Pitoniak: John do you want to take that?
John Payne: Sure. It was a little off. Again remember the third quarter is the quarter where we see in Las Vegas in particular where the course is due out to close for reseating. But we've been quite excited about the team we put in place and it's now going on almost two years of run it. Remember these courses were run particularly in Las Vegas as casino courses there were amenities to the casino operations and now they're run by us as stand-alone. And we've seen nice growth in a variety of areas not only in the golf business but also in weddings and other areas where we see ways we can use the facility differently. So a little off in the quarter but we feel quite good about the consistency of the business that we're going to see in 2020.
Edward Pitoniak: And on the revenue side -- Barry I was just going to add on the revenue side. The golf courses have actually grown the revenues quite strongly in terms of both rounds and revenues have outperformed their markets substantially this year.
Barry Jonas: Great. And then look I think the deal with Rock gaming is really interesting and some of the comments about the potential to work together in the future. Just asking sort of the standard non-gaming question is moving to non-gaming something that could happen sooner than later at this point? Or just any color there would be great.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes I'll start and again John can jump in. Barry it will happen. We're seeing very compelling opportunities across a number of non-gaming sectors. And when it comes to the Gilbert Group. We're obviously very excited to be partnering with JACK Cleveland and Thistle but we're also very excited to be affiliated through JACK with the Bedrock Group of companies who have so much going on in both Detroit and Cleveland. We're very excited about their developments in and around our assets our asset in downtown Cleveland. And John and I were in Detroit about a week ago. And what Bedrock has on the go there is so exciting. You might have seen they just announced a big project in Detroit right next to our Greektown Casino with Steve Ross related that -- it is not an experiential asset that we would have anything to do with. But it's part and parcel of their ability to make urban landscapes. And to the extent that they ever build experiential assets that we could potentially be a valuable partner and we would obviously love to do so. John do you want to add some color on top of that?
John Payne: No I think you nailed it. I think being associated and partners with very successful merchant developers over the next decade will open up opportunities for us. We think whether we decide to do it or not but this team is incredibly creative in what they do and what they've done in Detroit. The land they have in Cleveland around the assets that we just acquired so more to come on that but it's exciting. We're excited to be partners with them.
Barry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Adam from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Daniel Adam: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first off congratulations on announcing yet another large and accretive deal in the quarter which actually leads me to my first question which is how big does VICI want to be ultimately? And related to that do you think a horizontal merger with one of the other gaming REITs make sense maybe to accelerate your scale and exploit the cap rate arbitrage opportunity that exists within gaming while you still can?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes Daniel good to talk to you. In terms of how big can or should VICI be I mean it should be as big as it can be while continuing to truly grow shareholder value in a risk-adjusted way that does not put shareholder value at risk which is to say getting bigger simply for the sake of getting bigger is not a strategy we would ever pursue. And in terms of how we look at opportunities across the full spectrum of opportunities we've got a team that has been demonstrated in these two years that has a tremendous amount of energy and a tremendous amount of capacity. We will always be looking at every option we have to increase shareholder value. And right now we think we've got a really nice full plate pursuing exactly the kind of strategy we've been pursuing these last 24 months.
Daniel Adam: Okay. That's great and I totally agree for what it's worth. And then my second question is related to MGM's increasingly vocal strategic focus on becoming asset light. I'm wondering to what extent you think the MGM strategy shift will lead to other owner operators who maybe previously wouldn't consider sale leasebacks to reconsider.
Edward Pitoniak: Yes Daniel. Yes I think -- I apologize this is going to sound like a pat answer but I think time will tell. There are obviously a tremendous number of really smart people involved in the development and execution of the MGM strategy. And they obviously give evidence of that with a very compelling transaction they did with Blackstone. And we wish them -- we sincerely wish them the very best. We believe they did us a favor with that deal and we thank and congratulate them for that. And as time goes on I think they have the opportunity to demonstrate that an asset-light strategy can be value creating. And again I will only say we wish them the very best.
Operator: Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thank you.Ed I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about some of your comments around valuation particularly in regional markets versus Las Vegas. And it just seems like to me that the value regionally is more related to the license to conduct gambling versus the underlying value of real estate for some sort of alternate purpose. And value would be connected to the scarcity of those licenses which often become more available than states are interested in raising more tax revenues. I'm just trying to think about maybe putting Las Vegas aside. How do you sort of I guess underwrite risk around -- well I guess regulations on a state basis either expanding gambling or more or raising taxes on the operators et cetera
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. Well Smedes it's a very good question. And I would absolutely agree that there is value in the license. And in terms of the degree to which the value of the license can be subject to risk through a license expansion that is indeed a risk. But I think it's interesting to see what has unfolded in Pennsylvania and appears to be unfolding in Illinois. When a jurisdiction will put incremental licenses up for auction and the market participants acting very rationally tell the jurisdictions well we don't actually want to buy those because we think the market is adequately supplied. So right now I think you have at least for the time being a rational market when it comes to supply-demand balance even when a given jurisdiction might want to increase supply. And then in terms of the intrinsic value of the real estate while it may or may not have alternative uses it is truly bespoke real estate. It is mission-critical real estate it is very difficult to reproduce it is very expensive to reproduce and it's absolutely mission-critical to operators whose economics are so compelling. They're going to want to continue to occupy it. So I would just reiterate that while there may be differences of degree in value I would say that there will not be differences of kind especially for good solid regional assets in good regions where the tenant is a very solid occupant. And I'm going to say something I probably shouldn't say. But I believe I could make a rational argument that MGM National Harbor which is one of the great regional assets in America could be valued at a cap rate even south of Bellagio. It's a 24-hour City. It's an incomparable piece of real estate in incomparable location. I think there's a very very healthy and exciting and energetic debate that can be had around how to underwrite good regional gaming assets. And the degree to which people think they deserve a substantial discount to assets on the strip is potentially losing sight of real value.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: So as kind of a follow-up to that last question. I know we're early days here with the Bellagio transaction having just been announced but are you seeing -- I understand your view is that regional gaming could potentially have the same valuation as Vegas Strip gaming. Does -- has that played out though in terms of demand? I mean are you guys seeing maybe more demand for Vegas gaming from other -- for Vegas real estate from other institutional capital sources just given it's a more familiar market. It's probably a market you can put more money to work in quickly or how is kind of the competition shaping up between Vegas and what you're seeing when you're going out and looking at assets in a regional market?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. First of all John I want to clarify that if I -- I seem to suggest that regional assets should be valued equally or the same as Vegas assets. I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that. For select regional assets I believe I could make an argument and I could be defeated in the argument that there are select regional assets it could be considered even as valuable or even potentially more valuable than good strip assets. I think generally speaking again regional assets will probably trade at it sounds like slight or discount to be determined to Las Vegas real estate. In terms of how the market is looking at regional real estate in light of the Bellagio transaction I think I should highlight that it is only about 3 weeks ago. So it's a little too soon to tell although I will tell you that we had a call from somebody on the -- I think the Blackstone announcement was made on when -- on Tuesday and on Friday somebody called and said you guys haven't rerated yet 3 days later. So it will take a little bit of time. But I think you've seen indications from other parties like EPR a very very good REIT of their interest in gaming regional and otherwise. And I think you will see increased focus because again as people realize that there is value in the very intrinsic nature of this real estate they will realize that real estate outside of Las Vegas has value as well.
John Massocca: Okay understood. And then specifically with regards to the loan that was announced as part of the Jack Cleveland and Thistledown transaction can you maybe describe what types of properties are collateralizing the loan? Just a color there.
Edward Pitoniak: David?
David Kieske: Yes it's a -- it's a secured first lien on the Higbee Building and the May Company Garage which is all part of Rock Ohio Ventures as our ultimately guarantor.
John Massocca: Okay understood. And then lastly is there anything maybe structurally that would prevent you from putting in place another forward like a forward equity transaction if say you saw a new influx of deal volume? I understand you can fund with the current pipeline with the existing kind of capital raised in equity that you could -- equity on the forward today. But if you needed to put another one in place. There's nothing structural that would prevent you from putting a new one in place before you take the old one down. Is that a correct way to think about it?
David Kieske: No you see in agri others do have multiple forwards outstanding at the same time. So no there's nothing structurally out there. It's just a -- it's an equity offering with the derivative component. So we could to your point if there was something out there sure.
John Massocca: Oh, that's it for me. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone.Question for John. I want to make sure that I heard some of the commentary appropriately about the prospects for growing into contiguous or alternative or non-gaming forms of real estate. I think you may have said opportunities over the next decade which leaves quite a bit of latitude there. I just wanted to go a little further and ask do you think that this is something that could occur or evolve over the next say two or three years or is it a much longer-term evolution that we should be thinking about?
John Payne: Yes David good question and I'm glad to clarify my comments. The referring to decade was to the partnership with the Rock venture family of companies and working with them to develop. As it pertains to my comments about hospitality and experiential I think more in the near-term than that. So to your point about two or three years opportunities there I think we've been quite clear that we are spending time better understanding certain sectors spending time understanding great operators in those sectors and are there opportunities for us to continue to diversify our portfolio with the goal to continue to be geographic and have tenants and sector diversification. That clarifies my comments.
David Katz: Got it. And if I can just follow that up is it a necessary bridge or link that involves an owner or developer of gaming assets who also does other things or just using as an example a project like Pompano which has a casino as a hub but is intended to have a variety of other asset classes within the entirety of the project. Should we think about gaming owners and gaming properties as really the bridge or a link?
John Payne: No we like that link but it doesn't have to be that link I guess is the way I would put it. So if there are opportunities that are adjacent to facilities we own or others that are -- and they're developing experiential hospitality assets that we like and we can be involved we sure do. We'll study and understand that's right for us. But by no means does it have to be linked to a gaming operator or a gaming facility. In fact we're spending more of our time on areas that are not linked. But -- so that's really kind of where we are.
David Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.
John Payne: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Thank you. So in your initial remarks you made the point that private and public market values converge eventually. I don't think that always happens. And so if it doesn't what do you do?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. No you're absolutely right Thomas. There can be situations in which they don't. And you would know even better than me. But I mean hotels may be a case in point right now where private market values are in excess of public market values. And when that disparity of value exists it does tend to correct over time. If nothing else the private market starts to scoop up underpriced public market assets. It does not tend to be a permanent condition unless there's something inherently wrong with the assets or the portfolios as a collection. And I suppose one of the options for public players in any real estate sector when the public market continues to undervalue them is again see if the private market will pay you more than the public market is willing to pay you today.
Thomas Allen: And do you ever have conversations with people about selling single assets?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes we do occasionally but it's not because we feel they're undervalued it's because somebody else is interested in them for various strategic reasons on their own part. And after two years obviously we're still very excited about what we own. And we're also very excited about the progress we've made in two years such that we are not in any sort of state of frustration or impatient at this point as to how the market is valuing us. We believe the market's understanding of our value proposition continues to grow quarter-by-quarter. While there is occasional noise in the equity market overall and in the RMZ we like the progress being made and we're certainly not impatient at this point. Thank you, Thomas.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Thanks for thanks for taking the question. We obviously covered a lot of ground here. But Ed I want to maybe this is a hard question to answer given a lot of the differences in addition to the similarities. But I wonder if you care a gander on what a cap rate spread between Bellagio and its current structure and your CPLV at least on the other side of the Strip as we think again about that sort of ripple effect in cap rates that you mentioned and have referred to at other times.
Edward Pitoniak: Rich it's a very good question. It's a very fair question. It's a question I've definitely mulled over in my mind. And I'd be a fool to tell you that I have a highly confident answer right now. But I would say that -- and this I think true Rich you know real estate very well. In any asset class you look at each opportunity on its own merits and with its own particularities. So in the case of Bellagio you would look at the trading cap rate of 5.75%. And you would evaluate that cap rate not only in relation to the property its quality its location the credit quality the tenant but you would also look at what were the lease terms associated with that 5.75% cap right? And then any other asset you look at whether it'd be CPLV or any other really higher end strip asset you would ask okay what should the cap rate be in relation to the particularities of the asset its lease the tenant and its credit. And I would simply say that we have absolutely love Caesars Palace as an asset. We're very excited about what Caesars has been doing with it. We're very excited about what the new Caesars management team will be doing with it. We love the fact that it's got land out front the 7 acres that we talk about in our investor deck that we believe are the most underutilized 7 great acres in American commercial real estate those being the 7 acres at the intersection of Flamingo and Las Vegas Boulevard otherwise known as the Strip. So yes I'm just going to leave it at. We love the hell out of that asset.
Rich Hightower: No that's good. I mean as you said it's -- there's a lot of moving parts but it's interesting to hear your perspective on that. I'll follow-up on another question here too maybe actually combining a couple of other questions that have been asked. But as you think about VICI over time and what a lot of REITs do as they get to a certain size and they look at asset recycling as the potential source of equity and as you think about additional private market players getting into the space that VICI resides. And what do you think the opportunities are maybe not today but over the next two, three, four, five years to think about selling assets as a source of equity for new deals and kind of get that machine working in that direction. Is that a possibility that is on the horizon at some point?
Edward Pitoniak: It definitely should be Rich. I don't think we would be very good real estate portfolio managers if we weren't always asking if a given asset in the portfolio might be worth more to someone else than it is to us. So we would not be doing our jobs if we did not over time engage in that kind of rigorous portfolio management asset by asset. And so I think to your point Rich it will be evidence of the further maturation of the asset class as an asset class and it will give further confidence to market participants that there is a liquid market in the assets and that values can be established with confidence.
Rich Hightower: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, It's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Ed sort of wanted to talk a little bit about some of your opening comments as well. And certainly Blackstone coming in and paying what they did with the cap rate justify sort of value of real estate. But it also leads to cap rate compression that if you don't have a commensurate decline in your own cost of capital. Your investment spreads are going to narrow and you won't be able to create the same level of accretion. And so on one hand it's justifying the institutional quality of the real estate. But it also makes it perhaps more difficult to generate the same level of accretion if you're not going to get the same lift in your own cost of capital? And I guess how do you sort of think about that aspect?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. No we think about it a lot Michael. And we're glad to have you on the call. It'll go back to the remarks -- I'll go back to the scripted remarks I made which is that we have to count on the market if you will marking our assets to market and are getting the cost of capital improvements that would go with that. If that were not to happen we would have to be looking at assets we can afford and may have some strategic advantage in bidding core. I will say Michael that in this case we really put tremendous value on especially John Payne's relationships across the gaming sector and our ability to forge relationships with operators that in some cases as you've just seen this week give us a competitive bidding advantage. But again only time will tell. You've raised a question that could play out. We're hopeful and confident that it won't. If we can continue to demonstrate on our part that we're very shrewd energetic acquirers of assets at the right prices.
Michael Bilerman: When I think about the net lease model when you look at the traditional net lease REITs. Their competitive advantages their cost of money and then the ones that have been able to distinguish themselves as the relationship-based investing that we been able to have right? And so you mentioned John Payne and his relationships for you that's what gives you an added bonus relative just to the cost of your money. But those companies trade at big premiums to the underlying value. And I guess that's eventually where you want to get to?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes you are absolutely right. You are absolutely right. And I do think that it is this iterative process where the demonstration of competitive advantage tends to improve the cost of capital which in turn increases competitive advantage. So what we want to achieve I guess Michael is virtuous cycle dynamics or flywheel dynamics choose whichever metaphor you want. And again we will be patient. We will not get out over our skis in terms of paying what we should not be paying in order to somehow try to demonstrate to the world we should be valued higher than the market is valuing us at that time.
Michael Bilerman: You mentioned skis. Where are you right now in terms of other verticals outside of gaming?
Edward Pitoniak: Relentlessly and energetically investigating. And again I think what we're -- when we look at every sector that we look at outside of gaming Michael we really look through 4 key filters: Is it a highly cyclical sector? If it is it's frankly not as interesting; is it a sector that is vulnerable to secular threat which if you will the place based business means can Amazon put what is experienced in that place in a box and ship it to your house. That's one of the principal secular risk so many sectors are facing right now. The third one is the supply-demand dynamics. Is it a sector that is vulnerable to overinvestment which would lead to oversupply which would lead obviously to poor economics and thus poor returns. And then finally at the heart of the real estate is there an operator offering an end-user experience that has proven to be durable for decades going backward and is likely to be durable for decades going forward. What we're excited about is we're identifying a number of sectors that have those characteristics. Some of them may or may not have tremendous macro trends. Ski you mentioned it does not have tremendous macro trends over the past 3 decades but you got a couple of players surely who are demonstrating they can be very very successful and create an awful lot of value against an otherwise sluggish macro backdrop because of the competitive advantages that they're achieving through among other things network effect.
Michael Bilerman: You don't feel that online gaming and the potential for increases in that avenue. And I recognize that there's more to it but you don't feel like that's a longer-term secular threat to the gaming business? The hard [indiscernible] right?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes yes exactly. At this point it does not appear to be online gaming it's been active now in the U.S. since 2011. And there's really very little evidence that it has cost brick-and-mortar visitation. You do have examples like New Jersey sports betting where there is an awful lot of mobile activity including those who take the path train to Hoboken and surface in Hoboken so they can place a bet. But at least in that case the revenue is funneling back through the brick-and-mortar facility. But by and large the reason people go to casinos is to get out of the house. And we think the human urge to get out of the house is a pretty enduring one.
Michael Bilerman: Well those people should just get a private VPN and rather than taking the train to Hoboken but that's a separate issue. I appreciate your time. Thanks. A - Edward Pitoniak Thanks, Michael.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you very much operator. In closing we at VICI are more excited than ever about the institutionalization of this real estate asset class. We continue to make significant strides in executing our strategy as evidenced by our activity in the year-to-date and we have no I repeat no plans of slowing down. Our growth pipeline continues to be robust and we believe we are well positioned to continue growing our portfolio and driving superior shareholder value. Thanks again for your time today. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress when we report our fourth quarter and year-end results. Thank you all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties’ Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, August 1, 2019. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the Company’s second quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intend, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the Company’s SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our second quarter 2019 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our Q2 2019 earnings call. The second quarter of 2019 has proven to be another extremely busy quarter in VICI short history. In a moment, John will recap our Q2 growth activities. And David will recap our Q2 financing activities and financial results. But before we get to that, I’d like to spend a moment putting our Q2 activities and results into the context of what we’re striving to achieve over the long-term for our shareholders. VICI is now almost two years old and we have accomplished a lot in a short amount of time. In a nutshell, we have announced approximately $6.7 billion of acquisitions and raised approximately $5.6 billion of equity. We reduced our leverage from 8.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at emergence to 3.7 times net debt to EBITDA at quarter end by refinancing nearly $2 billion of debt at lower interest rates and eliminating over $1.3 billion of debt. We also increased the Company’s annual base rent by 181%. If you include the incremental annual rent of the pending transactions announced, but not yet closed. That is a lot of activity over the short-term. All of which has been in pursuit of our goal to build an institutional REIT for the long-term. Towards that end, we have upheld a relentless focus on the following. Improving our portfolio for the long-term to recreate of acquisitions and investments, enhancing our lead structures and terms for the long run, growing our tenant relationships and enhancing tenants strength for the long-term. Having the broadest investment spectrum across the gaming real estate landscape. Building a balance sheet for the long-term, balance sheet that can successfully weather any economic or credit cycle we may endure. Building and executing at VICI dividend strategy for the long-term. A strategy that delivers a secure and well-covered dividend with sustainable growth with dividend growth funded by achieved income growth, not anticipated income growth. Building an ownership base for the long-term, an ownership base that recognizes and values the quality, durability, and irreplaceability of our real estate. And building an unrivaled growth pipeline that gives our shareholders the value of predictable long-term growth years into the future. The investment community can trust that this relentless focus on creating long-term value means that we will not see our prospects for creating lasting shareholder value for the purposes of capturing a short-term gain. So some of the longest duration leases in the industry, we’re able to take an expansive outlook and act accordingly. Take for example the stat I mentioned earlier, that we have announced approximately $6.7 billion of acquisitions and raised approximately $5.6 billion of equity. REIT focused on immediate short-term accretion would not have relied as heavily on equity funding for the announced acquisitions, especially not far in advance of acquisition closings. If we had not taken the disciplined approach, however, while we may have generated more immediate accretion, we would’ve sacrificed long-term value creation for that kind of short-term gain. Another short-term measure would have been delayed funding until closing, but in doing so, we would have taken significant market and pricing risk. In either case, we would not stayed true to our relentless focus on building a REIT that can thrive through all cycles. The focus we believe is essential for our investors to be able to trust and rely upon as we act in their best interest in our capital allocation decisions. Looking back on the transactions we announced this quarter and those of you who have completed in our short history, you will see a consistency and we fund our transactions in a manner designed to provide long-term funding certainty, long-term accretion, long-term security of cash flow and long-term sustainability and growth of the VICI dividend. We realized that the long-term nature of our acquisition and capital allocation strategies makes it challenging to calculate with precision, the immediate impact of our related funding activities. The benefit greatly from cultivating a base of investors and covering analysts who collectively understand and support the long-term value creation that we believe our strategies will deliver. We especially valued this understanding and backing when our shareholders stepped up with such strong support for the equity raise we launched and currently with the announcement of our transformative transaction with Eldorado. And before I turn things over to John, I’d like to stress the degree to which our transaction with Eldorado was all about long-term value creation. We believe this transaction will enable us to number one, contribute significantly to the long-term success and competitiveness of our largest tenant; number two, significantly improve and extend our Caesars leases for the long-term; number three, add significant long-term AFFO accretion; finally, number four, restock our growth pipelines and long-term. That’s a great introduction to what John has to say about our Q2 2019 growth activity. With that, over to you, John.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. As Ed mentioned, we had quite a busy quarter. We closed on one acquisition and announced over $4 billion a new acquisition. We established three new tenant relationships while adding upon closing, seven new properties across six regional markets, while at the same time, we refreshed our growth pipeline. I’d like to spend a minute on each of these transactions and their strategic benefit for VICI, JACK Cincinnati. As we discussed on last quarter’s call on April 5, we kicked off the quarter by announcing the JACK Cincinnati transaction in partnership with Hard Rock International. We’ve agreed to acquire $42.75 million in rent for $558 million representing an attractive 7.7% cap rate. With this transaction, we will enter the strong urban gaming market of Cincinnati with a world class gaming operator with a proven track record of success in the Ohio market. And we add another first class operator to our tenant roster. Greektown, next, on May 23, we officially closed on the acquisition of the Greektown Casino Hotel for approximately $700 million simultaneously leasing the asset to Penn National. This high quality asset located on 7 acres in the urban core of Detroit is a great addition to the VICI portfolio. And add $55.6 million in rent at an attractive 7.9% cap rate. We are pleased to expand our partnership with Penn National and further diversify our tenant income while adding to our geographic diversification by entering a strong and stable regional market. Century Casinos, on June 17, we announced the acquisition of three regional gaming properties for $278 million in partnership with Century Casinos. Upon closing, this transaction will add an additional $25 million in rent under a master lease at a very attractive 9% cap rate. The transaction provides a several strategic benefits. First, we are creating a new tenant partnership with Century Casinos, an expert operator of small to mid-size assets with plans to expand further into U.S. regional gaming. Second, we’ll be entering the State of West Virginia and the Pittsburgh MSA, thereby –diversification while adding value for shareholders that accretive to AFFO on a long-term basis. The Eldorado transaction, lastly, one week after we announced the Century transaction, we announced the transformative $3.2 billion deal in conjunction with Eldorado’s proposed combination with Caesars Entertainment. The combination of Eldorado and Caesars will create the largest domestic gaming company with market leading assets in nearly every regional market benefiting from the most robust and sophisticated customer loyalty database Caesars Rewards. We are thrilled to partner with Eldorado to provide a portion of the capital they need, in order to execute on their goal of creating the largest and most dynamic gaming company in the country. This transaction is especially attractive for VICI, as we will add $252.5 million of incremental rent, including $98.5 million of rent from our Las Vegas Strip properties in $154 million of rent across our regional master lease. All four blended cap rate of 7.9%. What’s more, as Ed touched upon, we have also refilled a strong diverse growth pipeline that ensures the company maintains visible long-term growth opportunities. This refresh pipeline includes two go for opportunities on Las Vegas Strip assets, a put-call option on two high quality assets in the growing Indianapolis gaming market and an additional roofer on an urban core Casino in Baltimore. We’re excited to work with the Eldorado team and look forward to our continued partnership in the future as we both execute on our strategic goals. In conclusion, with over $4 billion of transactions announced in the second quarter alone, we’ve accomplished an equivalent amount for VICI shareholders. We’re very proud of the progress we’ve made in adding to our tenant roster further diversifying our geographic distribution, refreshing our growth pipeline and of course doing it all in a manner that is long-term accretive to AFFO. As our activity in the quarter indicates, we’ve proven our ability to source, execute and finance acquisitions of all shapes and sizes. We will continue to be determined and we believe VICI remains in a great position to capitalize on opportunities that the market presents. With that, I’ll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and financial results. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I’ll first cover a few of the highlights from our quarterly financial results before turning to our balance sheet and the specifics surrounding our recent transaction activity. As a reminder, starting on January 1, 2019, under ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard, we are no longer required to present real estate taxes and the related tenant reimbursements on a gross basis since they are paid directly by our tenants to the relevant taxing authority. Therefore, neither of these items appear on our June 30, 2019 statement of operations. The prior period, will not be retrospectively adjusted and therefore the historical financial statement presentation remains unchanged and continues to include the gross up of the real estate taxes and related tenant reimbursements. Our total revenues in Q2 2019 excluding the tenant reimbursement of property taxes, increased 9.3% over Q2 2018 to $220.7 million. Our G&A was $6.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 3% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projection and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We incur $2.9 million of transaction expenses in the quarter, primarily related to the legal and accounting costs associated with documenting leases, the JACK Cincinnati, the Century Portfolio and the Eldorado transaction. These costs are required to be expensed under the new leasing guidance. Our AFFO for the second quarter was $156.8 million or $0.38 per share, AFFO increased almost 22% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 9% over the prior year, given the equity issuances last November and the most recent offering at quarter end. Our results once again, highlight our highly efficient triple net model as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was approximately 105% and while flow through of cash revenue to AFFO was approximately 95%. As always, for additional transparency, we point you to the quarterly financial supplement, which is located in Investor section of our website, under the menu heading financials. We believe you’ll find this detailed information helpful and welcome any feedback on the materials. Moving onto our balance sheet and capital markets activities, we had an active quarter, further strengthen our balance sheet and positioning the company for continued growth. In connection with the other auto transaction combined with the other transactions that had been announced but not yet closed, we pursued a comprehensive capital funding strategy. Our objective was to immediately derisk the balance sheet by effectively locking in funding certainty for transformative sequence of deals. With this approach, we will have some near term dilutions, but we believe this capital will ensure that we maintain balance sheet flexibility and an effort to provide our shareholders with long-term growth. This thinking led to the activity during the last week of the quarter. On June 28, we completed an upside fall on offering of 115 million shares sold at a price of $21.50 per share for net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion. The offering was comprised of a 50 million share regular way common stock offering resulting in immediate net proceeds of approximately $1 billion and the shares being added to our total share account on June 28. We also entered into forward sale agreements for the additional 65 million shares, up on settlement, the forward component of the offering is anticipated to raise net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. We retain the ability to settle the forward transaction in whole or in tranches in any time between now and September 26, 2020. We view the success of this upside offering as a significant expression of support, confidence and trust from our shareholders and we do not take that commitment lightly. We will continue to work to deploy your capital accretively as we execute on our long-term strategic goals. For the remainder of the funding needed to close the Eldorado transaction as well as the refinancing of the existing secured CMBS loan currently on Caesars Palace, Las Vegas. We intend to act with the debt markets through a combination of term loan and unsecured bonds on a leverage neutral basis. Related to our debt in May, we amended our revolving credit facility, we increased the borrowing capacity by $600 million to a total capacity of a $1 billion. We also extended the maturity by two years to May, 2024 and we moved our interest rate to a leverage based grid with a range of 175 to 200 basis points over LIBOR, Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.97%, 98% of our debt is fixed with the remaining 2% floating, providing clarity to our future interest expense. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 4.5 years and we have no debt maturing until 2022. We ended the quarter with over $2 billion in liquidity, including approximately $1.3 billion cash and short term investments and availability of $1 billion under our revolver subject to compliance with the terms of our revolver. As of June 30, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 3.7 times, well below the low end of our long-term target of 5 to 5.5 times. Regarding our acquisition activity, John touched on most of the specifics, so I won’t repeat it all. We closed on the Greektown transaction on May 23, adding approximately $55.6 million in annual cash rent at a 7.9% cap rate. Then between the three announced pending transactions, JACK Cincinnati, the Century Portfolio and Eldorado, we will add just over $320 million in annual cash rent, increasing our annualized rental income by approximately 32% in just one quarter. In terms of timing, we expect JACK Cincinnati to close by the end of 2019. For the Century Portfolio, we continue to target closing in early 2020. And the Eldorado Transaction is targeted to close in the first half of 2020. Now with respect to guidance. Beginning this quarter, we will be presenting our guidance in absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis to provide additional transparency. We are updating our full year 2019 guidance to reflect the closing of Greektown on May 23, as well as all capital markets activities completed in the second quarter. We now expect AFFO to be between $635 million and $645 million or $1.45 and $1.47 per share versus our prior guidance of $600 million to $615 million or $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Our underlying AFFO assumptions are consistent with prior guidance adjusted for the closing of Greektown. While the per share range now accounts for 50 million shares issued in Q2 and the potential dilutive impact resulting from a Forward Sale Agreements we entered into in June, to the extent, that our stock trades above the deal price, as we will be required to record treasury stock dilution under GAAP. As always, our guidance does not reflect any of the pending acquisitions. Turning to our dividends, we paid a dividend of $0.2875 based on the annualized dividend of $1.515 per share on July 12 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 28. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you and good morning. This question is probably really going to blow your mind. If I can – in the perspectives back in June, you guys did talk about another deal that you were potentially in later stages of negotiations for. I don’t know if you’re able to comment directly on that specific reference. But if you could talk a little bit about maybe how things have proceeded in terms of the pipeline, that would be helpful.
Ed Pitoniak: John, you want to go ahead.
John Payne: Sure. Well, I can’t specifically talk about that, but I think, as the past 22 months I’ve indicated, I hope to you, Carlo, that we remain busy and active at all times. And so, we continue to work that deal that we called out and we continue to be on the road quite a bit in comparison to others and look at other opportunities as well. So it’s a busy even during these summer months right now.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, John. And then if I could, maybe David you would be best position for this one, but in terms of that specific transaction with the financing that you’ve done to date, including the equity as well as the term loan and unsecured that you’re targeting. Are you guys in pretty good shape in your opinion to kind of do the deal with not necessarily maybe cash on hand, but cash on hand and the proceeds of what you’re going to raise later in the year regardless of this transaction?
David Kieske: Yes. That’s right, Carlo. And just to clarify, in terms of what we’ll raise later in the year in terms of, as react to debt markets, we do not need any more equity. We will not go back to the equity markets to fund. The acquisitions that we have announced or the potential acquisition that’s referred to an S-4, part of the reason that we upsize the offering was to take into account. Our pipeline, we feel confident about our pipeline and do not foresee any more equity in the near term.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a busy 2Q, I think busy might be an understatement, but congratulations nonetheless.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, John.
John DeCree: Wanted to talk high level for a second. Ed, in your prepared remarks, you’ve discussed the importance of balancing the short term accretion with long-term value creation. And I think, some of the merits of the transactions you’ve done are quite obvious with replenishing the growth pipeline, so on and so forth. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more, it might be helpful to kind of talk about some of the strategies for long-term value creation and kind of really where you see VICI going, as we get out a year in some of these transactions close and your kind of ultimate goal for the company.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, well, I think, John, our fundamental opportunity continues to be to invest in what we believe is fundamentally great real estate, real estate of high institutional quality. And yet, we’re able to do so at this time, at what are still, we believe, bargain prices. If you wanted to put it into something at a private equity real estate framework, typically in private equity real estate you talk about either core yields, core plus yields value-add and opportunistic or opportunistic and value-add. And we believe right now, we’re buying core plus to opportunistic yields for what is fundamentally real core real estate. We love this opportunity. And we believe – for those who haven’t yet been able to see it, we highly recommend that everybody take a look at the report that Green Street put out on our sector earlier this week. It’s a collaborative effort on the part of VICI, MGP and GLPI. And we think it further emphasizes the core message, which is this is fundamentally great real estate. And what we fundamentally have is the opportunity to build a great portfolio of real estate with great tenants, whose operating business is what ensures the long-term integrity and durability of our real estate cash flows. So, again we just want to continue to tell the story. We want to continue to ignore the noise in the market. We’re at a point right now as a country, frankly, where there is so much noise and nervousness whether around politics and policy or the capital markets. And yet we think underneath all of that, the economy continues to be very strong. And as you have seen, John, with the reports out of Penn and Boyd last night and as everybody saw from the June Strip data, gaming continues to go on really well. And we believe it’s got a long runaway ahead of it. And we also like obviously prospects for other experience in sectors if you look at demographic trends and cultural trends that we think are going to continue to put great value on experience in real estate. I realize that’s a 50,000-foot answer, but I hope it is of some service to you.
John DeCree: That’s helpful. That’s all I was looking for. I think good comments. And I think if you can answer my follow-up. So maybe to switch gears slightly. You guys provided some unique financing sources for two very different types of companies. One, very large scale and one much smaller scale. I think historically over the last couple of years we’ve seen some of the gaming partners be a little resistant to partnering with REITs so we’ve certainly seen the change over the last 12 or 18 months. As you provide unique financing opportunities for these companies of all different sizes and positionings, have you seen increased receptivity or inbounds from other potential partners. I guess the short question is, are you seeing an increase in the acceptance and receptivity to refinancing on forward transactions?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I’m going to turn it over John in just a second here, John Payne, John DeCree. But what I just want to say, before I turn it over to John, is that what we’re seeing is greatly increased receptivity from gaming companies that want to grow. It’s simple as that. Gaming companies who want to grow are realizing that gaming REITs are a great way to help finance their growth. We represent another source of permanent capital, permanent capital that is frankly more affordable than equity they might rise or other permanent capital they might rise in the public markets. And we continue to believe that gaming growth – gaming-oriented growth companies will continue to look to VICI for help in achieving their growth ambitions, but to give you more color and granularity on that, I’ll turn it over to John.
John Payne: Yes, John, it’s a great question and I give a lot of credit to my colleagues on the phone Ed, David, Sam, Gabe and the whole team that come from a REIT background. And I think in the gaming space, the explanation of how REIT can help a company grow was really based on my colleagues helping me tell that story to potential sellers that hadn’t been done before in our space. And so the first year we spent a lot of time doing that and it has led, as you can see, to opportunities with a wide variety of folks in our space and really outside in the experiential space. So to answer your question specifically, we obviously continue to spend a lot of time with outbound calls, but as I’ve said over previous quarters we’re seeing more inbound calls and we’re also seeing more inbound calls with folks who understand the model a lot better than they did a few years ago, where it wasn’t just lease on the table and say take it. It’s an explanation of how a REIT in our space can be a partner, can be a long-term partner, can help the companies grow, and so it’s been a good start for our company.
John DeCree: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the comments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Stephen Grambling: Good morning, thanks. First on the intermediate term, you have outlined a lot of the details around the incremental rent from the announced transactions. You already to a degree front-loaded the financing for these. So maybe if could help investors frame what the AFFO per share kind of power is of the business as we look at all these transactions together maybe a couple of years out. And then maybe a follow-up to John’s question, as you look longer term, I mean what are the guardrails to think about when you start to look outside of gaming or is that still not really something that is top of mind? Thank you.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Stephen, it is a good question. I mean just on the announced acquisition, the $4 billion that we announced in the second quarter that adds about $320 million of rent. Obviously we need to lever that and based on our share count that’s $0.60 a share part of rent and obviously we need to put that in our leverage neutral basis. So the way we set up the REIT is that the year-in, year-out growth of 10% to 12% on the total return and part of the issue that we face in this sector is this front-loading that growth, right. We have announced Greektown in November, we closed this year, so you get three quarters of rent and AFFO in 2019, and now Century as well as Eldorado will close next year. So continue to build growth in AFFO for years to come. We will get about half of – half of the Eldorado transactions just assuming immediate close in 2020 and a then full year of rent in 2021. So we continue to ladder the growth of the company by working day in and day out to add the acquisitions and sequenced it into the FFO growth over time.
Ed Pitoniak: And for the second part of your question, Stephen, in terms of outside of gaming, what would we see as guard rails. Most fundamentally, the real estate has to be home to an experience that we believe has great durability to it. That it is an experience that is greatly valued today by the end user and is an experience that will be greatly valued by the end user 25, 35 years from now. And that experience probably has to have within at what we call experience complexity. It’s what we love about gaming. It is an experientially complex business in which the operator has the opportunity every day to refine the experience, add new elements to it, replace what has become obsolete with what is new and fresh. And we will look – when we do look outside of gaming, we will look for that same experience of complexity and that same fundamental durability of experience.
Stephen Grambling: But so it doesn’t sound like you’re currently feel the need or compelled to look outside of gaming.
Ed Pitoniak: And we’re certainly doing all we can to learn about sectors outside of gaming, identify sectors outside of gaming. They would have the characteristics that that would lend themselves to a compelling investment thesis. But needless to say, with $4 billion of gaming acquisitions in one quarter, we are very, very excited about continuing to help gaming companies grow. And that includes big companies like Eldorado and Caesars and obviously smaller companies like Century, which the great growth opportunities for themselves as well.
Stephen Grambling: Greg, thanks. Fair enough. I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from media Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is now open.
Cameron Hughes: Hi, this is Cameron Hughes on behalf of Smedes. I just wanted to get your take on the range of deal sizes you might look at going forward, whether that would be larger like Eldorado transaction more complex or smaller like the Century deal.
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Well, I think you described the range for us. I think we – as we started the company, we didn’t put brackets around what we’re going to look at and not look at. We thought that would restrict us. It would not allow us to meet all gaming operators and even non-gaming operators at this time. And so we really do we take any meeting, it doesn’t mean we’ll do any deal, obviously. But we don’t put parameters around the size, if it’s creative for us, if it’s with a strategic partner like Century that many would describe as a small deal, not many $300 million deals are called small, but they are seems to be in this space. But that was with the – as an example, an operator that we believe is growing a U.S. platform and not only would do that deal but others. So the simple answer is we’re looking at a lot of different things of all magnitude and we’ll continue to do that, because we think it will lead the quarters like we just ended.
Ed Pitoniak: Cameron, I’d just like to add to what John said that, the fundamental value proposition of a REIT is to be able to distribute cash through all cycles. And given that reason for being a REIT should inherently have some element of hedging and its portfolio strategy. A REIT should not be overexposed to anyone geography, anyone necessarily customer segment. So that one can again ensure that the cash is there to distribute through all cycles. And that’s we like having the biggest investment spectrum in the gaming REIT space. That again enables us to do the kind of deal we did with Eldorado, while also doing the kind of deal we did with Century. Because by having that diversity of tenant diversity of geography, we again put the REIT in a place where we’re not overexposing to anyone particular aspect of the business that that could lead to higher risk in terms of the sustainment, sorry, of distributions.
Cameron Hughes: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.
John Massocca: Good morning.
Ed Pitoniak: Good morning, John.
John Massocca: So just kind of roughly speaking, what do you think your capacity is today to do larger deals given, maybe assuming you closed in the more tangible acquisitions in the pipeline that you mentioned at the time of the equity offering. Essentially is there enough kind of on your plate today that maybe there needs to be a pause or you think you can continue to do some larger transactions going forward in the near-term.
David Kieske: John, it’s David. I’ll start and John Payne can add onto that. I mean right now, obviously we’ve announced a lot and we have a lot to digest and to close. So right now we’re focused on ensuring that we lay out a discipline financing plan on the long-term debt and continue their path towards lowering our cost of capital to ultimately pursuing a path towards investment grade. But in terms of acquisitions, like we’ve got the capacity to, as John said, we meet with a lot of people and we look at a lot of things and some larger transactions probably right now are probably off the table for us. As we think about ensuring the closing of Cincinnati, they closing a Century and then ultimately working with Eldorado to ensure the seamless closing of the broader transaction early next year.
John Massocca: Okay. And then you kind of mentioned, the debt markets in investment grade, if you think about the cadence of the type of debt you plan to issue. Is there any thought about potentially taking out the CMBS – the Caesars CMBS with term debt in order to position yourself for the rating agencies and the unsecured market or is the timing of all that going to be dictated more by the security of getting that kind of cash on hand?
David Kieske: We will take out the CMBS stat as part of the broader Eldorado transaction. As we announced back in June, Eldorado is agreed to split those – the transaction cost, the breakage costs with us. And as part of the overall transaction, we will either take that out with you, the term loan or high yield and just to give a little bit of depending on the markets where they are in the cost of capital. And that cleans up our capital structure too, which has been a very positive feedback for the rating agencies. And then that begins to remove the big hang up in the rating agencies right now is just the amount of secured debt that we have in our cap structure. And so to start to more towards an unsecured borrower, ultimately through the high yield markets and then long-term through the investment grade markets is our plan over the course of the next several months.
John Massocca: Do you think you’d be able to raise in the kind of investment grade markets before, I guess the closing of ERI and it’s a bit of some of that’s out of your hands.
David Kieske: Investment grade is probably 24 months, 18 months to 24 months, maybe 36 months off. We’ll meet with the agencies in the fall here. But a lot of it will be, again, they remove the secured debt that’s in our cap stack. And that’s both the CMBS, the second liens that are, we can call next year in October of 2020 and I would say the term loans we have today are secured debt. So we got a little bit of work to do, but taking out that CMBS was a big first step and we’re excited about that.
John Massocca: Okay. And then can you provide any color maybe on potential timing for taking out of the CMBS?
David Kieske: Its November 10 is when we can repay it. That’s the first call window. And then sometime late fourth quarter, early first quarter 2020.
John Massocca: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Adam with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.
Daniel Adam: Hey guys, good morning. So earlier in the week, Boyd had made some comments about the current M&A market. And I think their exact quote was that it feels a little quiet right now. Obviously, Boyd is an operator and you guys are a real estate company, but why do you think they’re seeing the current M&A landscape differently than you are?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I think it varies by geography, by market segment, by operator size. You’ve obviously seen Dan, in recent weeks, you obviously saw our announcement with Century. You saw the announcement of the transactions Twin River did with Eldorado. There are – there is activity going on and again, it’s going on maybe at segments or at asset level. Asset size levels that Boyd does not operate at and again Boyd is a really good company. And again, I think it’s part of the fact that this is a sector that we – those of us moved to gaming like myself and David are realizing it has more diversity to it than we initially understood. And these smaller assets need to be understood as smaller assets in the larger context of hospitality and entertainment or recreation, because while they may be relatively small assets within the gaming universe in terms of EBITDA per asset versus hotels or other recreational asset, these things make a lot of money. So there is activity going on. And again, we like the fact that we’ve got an investment spectrum that enables us to do the kind of deal we did with Eldorado. The strip assets at the same time that we can do the deal we did with Century.
John Payne: And let me I just add a little bit to that, because I think sometimes Daniel, at this perspective, I mean we just finished announcing a quarter of $3 billion worth of acquisitions, just three years ago…
Ed Pitoniak: $4 billion.
John Payne: In this $4 billion sorry. Just in this perspective, just in this space three years ago that would last 18 months before someone would do anything else. And so I think that it’s just perspective change a little bit to say, well, there’s not a lot of activity in this space. And we’re sitting here in August and we’re just one company that last quarter announced $4 billion of acquisition. So I’d say it’s very active. Again, I’m not contradicting my friends at Boyd at all it’s just – I think perspective – it depends on where your perspective is.
Daniel Adam: Okay. That’s helpful. And then my follow-up is a bit more nuance, but with respect to the Las Vegas Strip rifer, would your rifer on those assets still apply if they transacted prior to the closing of the Eldorado, Caesars deal.
Ed Pitoniak: I’m sorry, who would that they be in that case?
Daniel Adam: So would be Caesars in the inter-sell between now and closing.
Ed Pitoniak: Caesars really would be essentially precluded under their merger agreement with Eldorado likely to do a deal without having Eldorado’s approval. So it would be more complicated than that, giving a size of that.
Daniel Adam: Okay, that’s great. Awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey, David.
David Katz: You’ve covered a lot of ground, but I wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier commentary from Ed, from the beginning, the discourse has been around establishing your independence from Caesars. And I think it’s fair to say that you’ve walked a lot of that talk or maybe flown or driven. But this – the Eldorado deal does sort of tether you in some way to a single tenant. And I recognize concentration is not the same as overall independence. But as we think about going forward and deals that you may be considering, how much does that notion of independence and concentration factor into the decisions relative to accretion or the other evaluative criteria?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I think I’ll start David, and I’ll turn it over to John. I think that what this transaction most represents is our ability to creatively transact with independent operators. In other words, what I’m trying to say, and I’m not saying it very elegantly, David, is that we did the transaction with Eldorado, we didn’t do it with Caesars, right. And I think it’s a great testimony, especially to John’s leadership in our business development activities that we were able to initiate a relationship with Eldorado, an independent arm’s length relationships that led to a transformative transaction that does happen to involve our existing larger tenant. So I think the greatest message to take out of this transaction is not an issue of are we independent or not from Caesars, it is our ability to create relationships that yield deal flow. And I think we work relentlessly hard every single day on the development of relationships, because it is those relationships that generate deal flow. In this case, this particular deal does intensify our tenant concentration to a degree but we take great confidence in the relationships the built with Penn and Hard Rock and Century that we will continue to generate tenant diversity which will ultimately lead to some lessening of that concentration, though that concentration in and of itself does not scare us. John, if you want to add to that?
John Payne: No. I think you described it well. I mean, I was – our independence is a huge competitive advantage for us. We don’t have a parent company that gives us deals or hands us deals. We have to work every day to get out there to build relationships with others and prove that we can close deals with a wide variety of operators and we’re going to continue to do that. A simple way doing it makes me, makes me work hard every day to get out there to get more deals and, it will continue to be, the independence as you mentioned is going to continue to be a big factor of it.
David Katz: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Barry Jonas: Thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe just another angle on Eldorado, they’ve said they’re going to come out of the Caesars deal at around a 50:50 mix of lease versus wholly owned. How do you kind of weigh the opportunity to further penetrate that ratio versus the strong rent coverage ratio you have now? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, it’s a great question. It was, it was obviously a guiding principle to the deal we ended up constructing with Tom Reeg and Bret and the Eldorado team. We see great merit in them having that balance. To your point, it is the substance, the key substance of our rent coverage and it obviously is a key element in their cost of capital and how it is they’re valued. So, we would be very happy if they continued to maintain that kind of ratio. The ROFRs don’t necessarily mean sale leasebacks, and we again think that Tom is approaching this with a philosophy that it puts both companies, the New Caesars and VICI in very strong positions.
Barry Jonas: Great. And, then just a follow up, last quarter we talked about other REITs potentially exploring the gaming asset class. Just curious, are you seeing anything out there and given the unique nature of gaming every, what’s the likelihood we see another entrant? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: I’ll start and then I’ll turn it over to John. I think it is high, I mean, speaking of this again I go back to this thing fundamentally really good real estate that is available at very, very attractive prices. And, there are certain bidders that could show up for regional assets. There’s perhaps another set of bidders who would show up for Las Vegas assets. I think we should all keep in mind the Las Vegas Strip, real estate gaming real estate does not require the real estate owner to be licensed, which could make it very comfortable for certain kinds of real estate, institutional investors to very quickly move into the ownership of Las Vegas Strip real estate. And again, we’re seeing the degree to which institutional capital, applies very high value to the Las Vegas Strip real estate. If you happen to notice the latest print on the refinancing of the Grand Canal Shaft recognition, which got valued for the purposes of the loan made on those assets of, I think it was an implied cap rate of 4.5. Right. So again, I think there will be a lot of hunger for this real estate given how fundamentally good it is in a commercial real estate environment where you’re looking at sectors that are either undergoing secular challenges or otherwise really fully baked in terms of how they are valued today.
John Payne: And I’ll just add onto that. I mean I think as people see that the number of transactions that we’ve done as a company at 7%, 8%, 9% cap rates when they’re in other industries and they are buying and then the stability of our tenants and the quality of our tenants and their ability to attract new consumers and keep those consumers. And then there’s other REITs that are in spaces that are buying things at 3%, 4%, 5%. I think there’s no question that people are taking a look at this space. Obviously EPR has put one of the best gaming executives I’ve worked with on their board. And I don’t think they do that if they weren’t looking at, about this space. And, as I’m out talking to potential sellers, there’s no doubt that there’s other REITs that are beginning to try to understand, this space and that’s why we’ve built our model on partnerships and winning the ties and being the firm that understands the growth plans and those things. So, anyway I agree with that, that over time there’s going to be others entering this.
Barry Jonas: Fantastic. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from RJ Milligan with Baird. Your line is now open.
RJ Milligan: Hey, good morning. Just a question on the reloaded captive pipeline. Obviously you guys don’t have control in terms of the timing with those assets like you do with the call option properties, but curious if you could give some color on, if you did have that optionality when you would like to bring those assets on and maybe what you think the timing looks like based on your conversations with Eldorado.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, again, I’ll start and John will add RJ. We obviously are going to generate tremendous rent growth in 2020, by virtue of the closing of Cincinnati, the closing of Century, and eventually the closing of the Eldorado transaction, which will probably also generate 2021 AFFO growth based on the timing of a mid-year close. So, to be honest with you, the pipeline, if the pipeline starts in 2021, 2022, that’s perfect in terms of growth cadence. And, yet we will be very responsive if Eldorado wishes to proceed on any of these opportunities at an earlier date. They’re fundamentally great opportunities. We want to be a great partner. If they’re ready, we’re ready. John, want to add?
John Payne: No, I think you described it well. That’s how we thought about negotiating as having multiple opportunities in the future and not just one. So, whether it’s when they want to execute in Indianapolis or on the Strip or in Baltimore or other opportunities, you can see that “embedded” pipeline opportunities are multiple and will allow us to again, have that metronomic growth, that historically has not been seen in the gaming REIT space. But I think you’re seeing it in our two years of just continuing to knock out growth and acquisitions, for our shareholders.
Ed Pitoniak: RJ, previously we had a growth pipeline that lasted until 2022 given the original call agreements. And we used those call properties to effectively extend our growth pipeline to what we believe is probably around 2025 especially if you then incorporate the put-call we already possessed on the Las Vegas, the Forum Convention Center, which opens next spring by hosting the NFL Draft. So again, we’ve got a pipeline now that visibly goes to about 2025 and includes hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental rent. And I don’t think there’s many other American REITs out there with that kind of pipeline.
RJ Milligan: That’s helpful. Thanks. My second question is maybe you could comment on the board strategy in terms of the dividend, just in terms of expectations for growth going forward. Can we expect it to move in line with AFFO growth, slightly lower as you look to maybe retain some free cash flow or is there any taxable issues where it might actually increase more than earnings growth?
David Kieske: Yes RJ it’s David, good question. As you saw last year we announced the dividend increase in Q3. I think, one of the things that we wanted to set this company up to be ultimately be a dividend aristocrat. So, year in and year out consistent dividend announcement in terms of timing and ultimate dividend growth, we discussed the dividend with the board on a quarterly basis. So any future increase is bound to subject to board approval. But we’ve always targeted an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70%, 75% area. That’s as we talked about with you to give us like an internal self funding. So, I think you’ll see the dividend in and around that payout ratio. And start to implement a consistent annual sequencing of increasing that dividend, on an annual basis and not in line just with the announcement of acquisitions, but again to keep this year in and year out consistent timing for our increase.
RJ Milligan: Okay, that’s helpful. And then last question, just sort of a modeling question, David, can you talk about or quantify the impact, you’re assuming at AFFO from the forward or the dilution of the forward in the back half of the year?
David Kieske: Yes RJ, if you layer in the 50 million shares, starting January 28 and take that out to whatever that is 183, 182 days that gives you about 435 million, weighted average share of about 435 million and you can see in our release, we’re about 438 million. So, it is a 3 million share impact from the forward.
RJ Milligan: And you expect that to continue through the end of the year?
David Kieske: That’s right, yes.
RJ Milligan: Great. Thanks guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you RJ.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Can you comment on how the investor education initiatives are progressing? Do you guys think we’re any closer to closing the gap between gaming and net lease REITs or do you think that it may take a downturn for this to actually play out?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, that’s a great question Dahlia. We, think that all three companies, MGP, GLPI and ourselves have done a very good job of showing the degree to which on a back-testing basis, the gaming REIT rents would have been well covered even during the great financial crisis. So, we have a lot of faith in a garden variety recession, if you will, should absolutely have no harmful impacts to our cash flows or to those of our colleagues at MGP and GLPI. So we don’t think that is in and of itself a necessity. We think that there is a growing awareness again of the quality of the real estate. And that’s what should be the ultimate valuation of our sector. It takes time. Every cap rate compression story that’s ever played out takes time. And frankly, the entrance of new bidders is a validating step that could be a key element in that re-rating. But at the end of the day, what we most have faith in is, is the fundamental intrinsic quality of our real estate and its ability to produce sustained free cash flow for our investors cycle in cycle out. That’s the ultimate base case comfort that everyone should have. But above and beyond that, there is this opportunity for our real estate to be revalued accordingly.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That’s helpful. And I guess on a similar note, can you provide any detail on how you think about tenant quality, what factors are most important, are there any red flags, when a new tenant is under consideration?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I think there’s two are their operating strengths, do they operate well, do they know their customers, do they have a strong enduring relationship with the end users who are the ultimate, determinant of the value of the property? And then do they have a good strong balance sheet that’s going to enable them to weather every cycle, a credit and economic. And so far, needless to say, we’re very happy with the tenant roster we have and we will continue to use those two key criteria, operating strength and balance sheet to evaluate any other tenant we’ll do business with.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bradford Dalinka from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Bradford Dalinka: Hey, good morning Brad on for Thomas Allen. Just wanted to see if you could help us think, about the balance sheet vis-à-vis the put call options throughout there. I know in the past you’ve talked about some long-term leverage targets, but do you plan to keep extra capacity in there is a speed bump in the economy and maybe there could be a put rather than a call? Thank you.
David Kieske: Yes. Bradford, it’s a good question, because obviously part of the Eldorado overall strategy is de-levering and I think Tom and Brad have been pretty vocal that the put could be a potential mechanism for Eldorado to de-lever their balance sheets. So look, part of the way we think about it is we are, once we’ve settle the forward we’ll have $11 billion of equity market cap and be somewhere in sort of $16 billion $17 billion total enterprise value company. We increased our line-of-credit this year to a billion. You’ll probably see that increase over time as well. So as we approach, the period between 2021 and 2024 when that asset could be potentially put through us, we feel we’ll have sufficient liquidity on our balance sheet, our access to liquidity to be able to execute that put if Eldorado doesn’t in fact do that during that time period.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I would just add to that, Brad, that when the day comes that all the puts or calls have been exercised, I would say as a general management principle, we will still want to have that capacity to take advantage of opportunity. As Warren Buffet says you want to fearful when everybody else is greedy and greedy when everybody else is fearful. So, we always want the REIT to be in a position to be opportunistic when others may not have the capacity to be opportunistic.
Bradford Dalinka: Thank you. That was extremely helpful.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to Ed Pitoniak for closing remarks.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you operator. Thank you to everybody who’s been on the call. To sum up in short as VICI history has been Q2 2019 with an inflection point in our brief history. We announced new partnerships, great new tenants, Hard Rock and Century. We entered into a transaction to help facilitate the transformation of our largest tenant Caesars. We further fortified our balance sheet with a largest primary REIT follow-on in history. We restocked our growth pipeline such that through embedded growth, we could potentially add hundreds of millions of dollars of new rent to our rent roll over the next five to seven years. None of this would have happened without our shareholders for whom we are honored to work, and for whom we’ll stay relentlessly focused on long-term value creation. Thanks again to all of you for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties’ First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 02, 2019. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intend, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our first quarter 2019 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning everyone. We're very excited to be here and appreciate you taking the time to join us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. We released our first quarter results last evening. John, and David will walk you through the quarter and recent activity. But first, I want to provide some context on how we view the start of 2019 in terms of our progress against our long-term strategic goals, and how we continue to build on our foundation to be the next great American REIT. The first quarter of 2019, was the first full quarter in which the rewards from our significant transaction and capital markets activity in 2018 were reflected in our financial results. The Q1 2019 net of the effects of the new lease accounting standard, which David will address in a moment, our revenue increased by $13 million, and our operating income increased by $13.1 million, meaning we achieved 101% flow through of revenue growth to profit growth. Our ability to turn acquired revenue into new profit and free cash flow is one of the hallmarks of our triple-net business model. All told, this resulted in our shareholders' net income growing nearly 35% year-over-year, while AFFO was up almost 22% on an absolute dollar basis and approximately 3% on an AFFO per share basis. The increase in our AFFO was the result of the lease modifications we completed in the fourth quarter with Caesars, annual rent increases embedded in our leases, ownership of Harrah's Philadelphia for an entire quarter and almost a full quarter of rent from Margaritaville, which we closed on January 2nd. Our AFFO per share growth was reduced by the short-term dilutive impact of our very successful first follow-on equity offering we executed in November of 2018. As we have discussed with you, we are focused on building a leading REIT portfolio and corresponding balance sheet that can weather all cycles. As a result, we elected to over-equitize the balance sheet with the November follow-on offering in raising $724.5 million of gross equity proceeds. These additional proceeds have a near-term dilutive impact on our per share results, but position us for long-term success. Just to touch on Margaritaville for a moment. We've been very clear and building VICI. We are laser focused on providing our shareholders with best-in-class income quality, income resilience and income transparency. A key element to take -- to achieving this vision is tenant diversity. In January, when we closed on the acquisition of Margaritaville, we've bought great real estate. But just as important, we officially launched our partnership with Penn National Gaming, one of the best gaming, leisure and hospitality operators in the business. We have also partnered with Penn to acquire Greektown, which as Penn noted this morning on their own earnings call, we anticipate closing by the end of May. Continuing on this diversification theme. John will provide additional details, but thanks to his deep industry connections, on April 5th against the backdrop of decreasing overall commercial real estate transaction activity, we announced the first gaming transaction of the year in which we are partnering with Hard Rock International to acquire the JACK Cincinnati Casino. We are excited to partner with Hard Rock, a global investment grade leader in gaming, hospitality and leisure, and an experienced operator in the Ohio market. We look forward to expanding this relationship over time as both companies continue to execute on their growth strategies. We have achieved tenant diversification faster than any other gaming REIT, through our relationship with Hard Rock, Penn and our foundational tenant Caesars. As it relates to Caesars, we are honored to be Caesars real estate partner at the 21 properties where we currently do business together. As you heard on their call last night, continues -- Caesars continues to produce industry-leading results demonstrating their strength as one of the top leisure and hospitality operators across the globe. As it relates to Caesars valuation of paths for enhancing shareholder value and the potential impact of VICI, we would remind you that our leases and our call options our obligations of the entity and transfer with the entity should any transaction occur. In regard to the transaction committee that was formed our fundamental thesis and our fundamental commitment, which we have expressed to Caesars is that we are always here to help Caesars grow the performance and value of their business as we are for any partner we will do business with. We feel great about this -- our start to the year and how we continue to progress on our strategy based on the three key drivers of value creation to our business model. Namely number one, ability to deliver portfolio income of the highest character and quality. Number two, a best-in-class and fully internalize governance and management structure and three, one of the best embedded flash internal and external growth profiles across the REIT sector. Through these advantages we believe we will provide our shareholders with superior returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our recent transactions and what we're seeing in the market. John, over to you.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. While it's only been a couple of months since we last spoke to you all, you can see that we remain very busy. On April 5th we announced our sixth acquisition with our third operating partner since we started VICI just a year and a half ago. With the pending purchase of the JACK Casino in Cincinnati, we're extremely excited to enter the Ohio market, which is one of the fastest growing regional markets in the country. We will acquire approximately $43 million of annual rent for a purchase price of $558 million, representing an attractive 7.7% cap rate. Similar to the Greektown transaction, the acquisition of JACK Cincinnati will expand our geographic footprint into a strong urban gaming market and further diversify our tenant base. Now in addition to Caesars are foundational tenant, we've built long-term partnerships that Ed had said with Penn National through our acquisition of Margaritaville and Greektown and Hard Rock with our announced purchase of JACK Cincinnati. We are proud to partner with Hard Rock as they truly are one of the most recognized experiential operators worldwide with a very strong track record of success operating in the Ohio market. As you've witnessed in VICI's first 18 months, we've announced $3.2 billion of transactions, and we believe there remains an abundance of potential acquisition targets in the gaming space. So we do not see ourselves slowing down anytime soon. We will look to add to our momentum while opportunities for accretive transactions of all shapes and sizes remain in the marketplace. Additionally, we have the option to take down any of our three call option properties with a 60-day notice. We retain one of the best internal and external growth profiles in the REIT sector and we will continue to put your capital to work, growing our portfolio and progressing toward our goals. Those goals include; diversifying our tenant base, expanding geographically and attractive urban and regional markets, and growing our Las Vegas exposure, all while creating value for our shareholders. With that I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and financial results. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. I will cover a few of the highlights from our quarterly financial results published last night. As you'll see on the income statement starting on January 1, 2019, under ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard, we are no longer required to present real estate taxes and the related tenant reimbursements on a gross basis since they are paid directly by our tenants to the relevant taxing authority. Therefore neither of these items appear on our March 31, 2019 statement of operations. The prior period, will not be retrospectively adjusted and therefore the historical financial statement presentation remains unchanged and continues to include the gross up of the real estate taxes and related tenant reimbursements. Our revenues in Q1 '19 excluding the tenant reimbursement of property taxes, increased 6.5% over Q1 '18. Our G&A was $6.2 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projection and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We did incur $889,000 of transaction expenses in the quarter, primarily related to the legal and accounting costs associated with documenting the JACK Cincinnati acquisition. These costs are required to be expensed under the new leasing guidance. Our AFFO for the quarter was $151.5 million or $0.37 per share for the first quarter. As Ed mentioned, total AFFO increased almost 22% year-over-year and AFFO per share increased approximately 3% over the prior year. We'd like to draw your attention to our quarterly financial supplement where we strive to provide additional transparency in information. The supplement is located in the Investors section of our website under the menu heading Financials, and we value any feedback you may have on the information presented. Now moving onto our balance sheet and capital markets activities. During the first quarter, we issued $6.1 million shares of common stock through our at-the-market equity program at a weighted average price of $21.28, raising net proceeds of $128.1 million. We view the ATM as an extremely efficient tool to shore up our balance sheet outside of transaction specific capital raises. Our balance sheet continues to be in a phenomenal position to execute. As of March 31, our net debt-to-LTM EBITDA was approximately 4.3 times, below the low end of our stated range of 5 times to 5.5 times. This does include the impact of the excess cash on our balance sheet we raised in our November equity offering, as well as the recent ATM issuance that will be used to fund the Greektown and JACK Cincinnati transactions. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.97%. This includes the impact of the two interest rate swap transactions we entered into on January 3rd, having an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. These have an effective date of January 22, 2019 and a termination date of January 22, 2021 and effectively fix the LIBOR portion on the $500 million under our Term Loan B facility at a blended rate of 2.38%. Taking into account our swap agreements 98% of our debt is now fixed rate debt providing clarity to our future interest expense. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 4.8 years and we have no debt maturing until 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of cash in short-term investments and an unfunded $400 million revolver providing us liquidity for future growth. To follow-up on the acquisition front that John discussed, on January 2nd, we closed the acquisition of Margaritaville for $261.1 million, adding approximately $23.2 million in annual cash rents. The transaction was funded using cash on the balance sheet. For Greektown, we will use the proceeds from our November equity offering to fund the transaction, which we anticipate closing by the end of May. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the acquisition of the real estate of JACK Cincinnati for a purchase price of $558 million adding $42.75 million of annual rent. The combined Greektown and JACK Cincinnati transactions are expected to be funded on a leverage neutral basis utilizing debt and existing cash on hand. We are reaffirming our 2019 AFFO per share guidance with a range of $1.47 to $1.50. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the pending acquisitions of Greektown and JACK Cincinnati that have been announced and not yet closed. We paid a dividend of $0.2875 based on the annualized dividend rate of $1.15 per share on April 11th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 29th. In closing, we continue to make tremendous progress as we execute on our strategy and we remain well positioned with significant liquidity and access to capital to keep growing our portfolio in driving shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Thank you very much and thanks everybody for the comments thus far. Ed, in your prepared remarks you made the statement that that you guys were able to execute on some transactions in a commercial real estate market that has seemingly gone a little bit more challenging. When you think about the nuance of the gaming REIT business and model, relative to the backdrop of broader activity in commercial real estate, do you view it as a net positive maybe for valuation as investors seek areas where there could potentially be more growth as from the standpoint of maybe thinking about it just from a stock level as opposed to a slowdown in the environment where you guys are kind of operating in an environment where we're not really seeing any kind of slowdown in transaction activity?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I think you picked up on something very important Carlo. If you look across and again we approach this as the real estate people that we are as we look across all of the other American commercial real estate sectors whether it be industrial, multi res, medical office, single-family housing in so many of the sectors the prevailing wisdom and it remains to be seen whether that prevailing wisdom is correct is that most American commercial real estate sectors are in the late innings of the cycle that they are in. We believe the gaming real estate is still a very early inning story. It is a story and it has really developed we believe over the last 12 to 18 months in terms of especially the dedicated REIT community understanding the Alpha that they can obtain by investing in publicly-traded gaming real estate. So we believe that this will continue to be a sector that gets a lot of attention growing attention because of that if you will off cycle characteristics. This is a place that the active manager we believe will continue to find value especially when compared to so many of those other late inning commercial real estate sectors.
Carlo Santarelli: That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then, John, you mentioned in your comments that you guys did want to remain focused on growing your Las Vegas exposure, unless I misheard that, but let's assume I heard that properly. Clearly there is one large asset out there. I'm not going to ask you to comment on that specifically. But I will ask a bigger picture question as it pertains to Las Vegas, clearly, a market where real estate has been valued at a little bit more of a premium. Would you guys in any way, I don't want to say jeopardize, but maybe sacrifice some of the discipline you've shown to-date to do an acquisition, such as a large, kind of, let's call it third party type of deal, that might be a little bit more expensive, it might not be out of the gates accretive, if it meant potentially opening up new avenues for deals down the road with the new partner or something along those lines?
John Payne: Yes. Carla, I'll jump in there and Ed or David will. I don't think we would ever sacrifice the way we think about underwriting and ensuring that it's accretive at the beginning. As you know, we -- the way we're structured it's imperative that it's accretive to us as we do the deal. You didn't miss hear me at all, and that -- and I think we've been clear on this suite. We would love to have more Las Vegas real estate, whether that's on the strip where we continue to believe there is a limited amount of supply of invaluable real estate on the strip, but we've also said that there are some great assets and some great real estate in downtown and also in the locals market that they should ever come for sale and there is an opportunity to do a transaction, we looked at that as well. It doesn't mean that that is our sole focus as we continue to look at opportunities outside Las Vegas, where we, as you've seen as we love the urban real estate that many of these casinos have. But David, Ed, you want to add to that answer that Carlo asked?
David Kieske: Carlo, it's David. And John, I think you did it. I mean we will not -- as everybody knows we are triple-net REIT. So the accretion that we underwrite day one and we live with, we don't have the ability to asset manage, property manage or improve operations in our model. And this is the part of the reason we're able to achieve such high revenue flow through, but we will be very disciplined in the way we approach any asset and any acquisition depending, regardless of how large it is and where it sits.
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, and I would just add one more thing, Carlo. Because you touched on it, an important element. An element that's strategically important to us, when you did cite the fact that we will put value in our underwriting on developing strategic relationships that can grow over time. It would not become a factor that causes us to accept dilution going in, but to your point, it is a very important point in how we evaluate any given transaction.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. That's very thorough, and then John, if I could, just you mentioned obviously the locals market in the downtown market. To the extent that you've thought about certain transactions within either of those markets, I'm going to assume that there's unlikely to be any gating issues that would make transactions in those markets any more difficult necessarily than transactions on the strip, or in any regional markets. Is that fair?
John Payne: Based on what I know I think that what you said is accurate, but it's hard to give a general comment on that. You got to look at the specifics of a current transaction.
Carlo Santarelli: Understood, thank you very much guys.
Ed Pitoniak: You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of RJ Milligan from Baird. Your line is open.
RJ Milligan: Hey good morning guys. Given the fact that the stock is sort of pushing up near all-time high, so I was curious how do you think about using your more attractive cost of equity to possibly expedite pulling in the call option properties?
David Kieske: Yes, RJ, it's David. Thanks for joining us. Look we've -- we loved the call properties because it gives us that embedded growth, and as we talked about that ability to drive consistency through the sector that I don't think has been demonstrated in the past. And so we still layer in the call properties, one in each year is a base case scenario. One in '20, one in '21 and one in '22 and each one of those delivers $40 million odd of rent to VICI and that is at our discretion. There's a lot, as John mentioned, there's a lot going on out there. So we don't -- we haven't deviated from that kind of base case today, but it is something that we are always mindful of and we do highlight where the stock is and that's we've had to downs our cost of capital and the accretion that we can achieve on each of those.
Ed Pitoniak: And I would just add RJ, that -- obviously that that improving cost of capital that you're referring to also gives us the ability to make whatever else we may be working on other than the call properties even more accretive as time goes by.
RJ Milligan: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, David, can you talk about sort of your expectations for additional ATM issuance throughout the year to fund. I don't know if you need additional capital to fund Greektown or want to bring down leverage. But can you talk about what you expect the cadence of ATM issuance to be for the rest of the year?
David Kieske: Yes, RJ, it's a good question. As we sit here today, we do not need any additional equity for Greekdown or JACK Cincinnati. So we're fortunate to have executed a very successful follow-on offering in November. And then as we view the ATM, look it's one of the most efficient tools -- equity tools that we have available to us as any REIT has available to it. And we will evaluate numerous considerations including the trading environment of our stock, investor demand around our stock, and kind of what the long-term outlook of our pipeline is, obviously with the timing that it takes to close these deals and making sure that we have pre-funded the balance sheet, we've put the balance sheet in the best position as possible to drive as much optionality for us is very important to us. So, we'll assess the ATM kind of opportunistically as we have with all the equity offerings that we've done.
RJ Milligan: And I'm not sure that if you can disclose, but the ATM issuance in the first quarter was that just general way or was that incoming inquiry for a position?
David Kieske: Yes we opened it up in the first quarter and it was the general way issuance throughout the quarter.
RJ Milligan: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Adam from Nomura. Your line is open. 
Daniel Adam: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a follow-up related to the call option properties. The more I think about it, my question is, why doesn't it make sense to call them in now. I mean, wouldn't calling them in sooner rather than later enable you to maximize the net present value that you see from the accretion?
David Kieske: Yes, Dan it's a fair question and look it's the one that we've gotten since day one. I mean we know they are always there. We're not going to let them go. And the stock continues to work in the right direction as Ed alluded to the understanding of the merits and you've been a big proponent of helping people understand the merits of the sector. And so I think, it can remain a lot of activity out there, third-party acquisitions and they will always be accretive and they could potentially be more accretive tomorrow if the stock continues and heads in the right direction. It's not something that we want to engineer our financial growth, so to speak, financial AFFO growth, but again we look at them layering one in 2020, one in 2021 and one in 2022.
Ed Pitoniak: And again I would just reemphasize Daniel that, I mean, here we are, where we're -- basically we're in our seventh quarter as a company, if I'm doing my math right. And in those first six quarters we did as John already spoken of in the prepared remarks, $3.2 billion of acquisitions. So that averages out to about $500 million a quarter. Obviously it hasn't layered in exactly like that, but you get a sense for the velocity at which we've been able to grow the business. And as we look forward, we continue to see the opportunity to continue to grow the business at or close to that velocity, and thus we are not faced with a situation where we really need to bring down the call properties in order to continue that kind of velocity. And thus given the opportunity to choose when and how we do it, we will continue to prioritize those opportunities here right in front of us.
Daniel Adam: Okay great. That makes sense. And then just one follow-up. So yesterday, EPR technology, that they are now more open to exploring deals in the gaming space. I'm just wondering what are your thoughts are on this pluses and minuses? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: I think, net-net Daniel, it's very much a plus. The guys of EPR are very smart real estate investors. And in their recognition the gaming real estate can represent real value, and truly institutional quality real estate. We see it as an important step in the validation that any commercial real estate sector needs to ultimately realize its full institutional value, right. In other words, as we become fond of saying, validation drives valuation, and any new entrant into the sector is a another step in that validation process, which is to say another step in the revaluation or rerating process.
Daniel Adam: Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning everyone. And thanks for your insights and color so far. I just wanted to ask, Ed in your opening remarks, you made some commentary about Caesars, about your largest tenant. And the degree to which there maybe actions or strategies that you can take whether it's stepping up on any optionality that you have, ahead of any change of control or any specific outcomes, and I don't expect that you may have detail to share with us specifically. But are there strategies that you can consider to protect or add value in that context given where Caesars sits today?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. Maybe just as a starting point, David, though, you didn't ask about a per se. I think everyone on this call, saw the Caesars results yesterday and we do not -- we must emphasize, we do not rely on Caesars quarterly performance to solidify the security of our rent. But we were very happy to see for the sake of Caesars team, that those results were as strong as they were. So that's, sorry that just I wanted to add to be a preamble.
David Katz: It's clear.
Ed Pitoniak: In terms of how we approach any sort of engagement with Caesars, we are very mindful of the rights we have, we are very mindful of the obligations that we have and we will be looking at anything that arises in a relationship with Caesars through the filter of how do that make Caesars even stronger which thus further securitizes the quality of our rent. And then, how do we make sure that obviously the interest of our shareholders are being carefully preserved as well. And then, beyond that we take a lot of confidence in fact there is a lot of very smart people involved at Caesars, there is a lot of energy and a lot of urgency to create value and we're actually excited about the opportunity we have to work with them to increase the value and the strength of both of our businesses.
David Katz: Thank you, for that. And just one follow-up on another matter and on regarding the prior questions. Around other real-estate fronts looking within gaming and I know it's been somewhat of an early stage discussion about looking about your looking outside of the gaming realm. I suppose a fair question is has anything changed in that regard, you know there certainly has been some news about contiguous businesses coming up for sale and so forth. Any updates there?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. You know, we from day one, we've positioned VICI as an experiential REIT and from day one we've always been engaged both as a board and a management team in learning all we can about experiential factors that share what we believe are the key characteristics of what we love so much of our gaming. And as we talk with you David, we love about gaming, then it's fundamentally a business in which great operators offer diverse experiences to a diverse clientele across diverse geographies. And as we look at adjacent sectors, we are seeing in some of those sectors those same characteristics and it's that diversity of experience clientele and geography that we think greatly improve the risk profile of any experiential sector. And to your point, there are certainly some names coming up in adjacent sectors that have characteristics we're very interested in. We obviously have to we were obligated to learn all we can, we're obligated to invest very carefully and we're obligated to make sure we never lose sight of the fundamental opportunity right in front of us right now which is to continue to grow our gaming real-estate asset portfolio very accretively.
David Katz: Got it. Thank you, very much. I appreciate you taking my question.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Barry Jonas: Hey. Good morning guys. I guess just following up on the non-gaming question. I mean, do you analyze those deals the same as gaming or different and do you think diversification away from gaming ultimately helps your valuation and maybe your cost of capital?
Ed Pitoniak: Barry. I'll take the first crack at this, and I'll let John and David pitch in. It will improve our business and our cost of capital. And this is obviously believing the obvious. If we make fundamentally good real estate investment decisions, and we -- if we are going to do this, we need to make sure that we understand, not only the general but the highly specific characteristics of any sector. So that we understand, among other things, its supply demand characteristics, not only now but going forward. Is it a sector that's going to be favored or disfavored by demographic, cultural and social trends over the next 10, 20, 30 years. Again, we are investing, basically in multi-generational assets, and we need to have confidence that there will be a durability to the experience that then yields the durability to the rent. And again, the factors that come into play in those sectors may be different than the factors that come into playing gaming, especially given the highly regulated nature of gaming, which you generally don't find in these other experiential sectors, and thus don't have, if you will, the built-in, if you will supply growth constraints, that the intense regulatory regime of gaming does provide.
Barry Jonas: Got it. And then, you know look, I think early on investors are very focused on you having a single tenant, you've addressed that twice now. At this point, are you somewhat agnostic about adding an additional tenant relative to those initial concerns or you're happy just working with the ones you have?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Barry, I'm very active in continuing to build relationships across all the platforms, and it's been great to finalize deals with Hard Rock and Penn and of course Caesars. But we continue to meet other companies, understand our growth strategies. What are they trying to achieve over the coming years and is there a place where we can be a part of that. So I think you'll see Barry, over the coming months or years that we continue to add more tenants to our portfolio.
Barry Jonas: Got it, alright thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Coleman for Mike. There are no fronting question I got to ask, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. John from Union Gaming, your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning, guys. Sorry, it was I hit the mute button, clicked there.
Ed Pitoniak: That's fine.
John DeCree: Just, wanted to get high-level thoughts, maybe Ed or John, on the behavior that we've seen in some of the corporate companies and potential partners early on. I think there was reluctancy and probably still to some extent for some of the operators to partner with the REIT, but we've certainly seen just across your portfolio more folks are willing to work with you guys and even your peers. I was wondering what you thought has changed or is it just the education, people getting more comfortable, and how do you kind of see that going from here? Is it just, are your conversations with potential operators getting easier about partnering?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: Yes. I'll take that and then Ed can jump in if I don't completely answer. I think you've described it well. I mean, when we started, I think at times, there is a misunderstanding of how a REIT like us could help many companies to grow. So again it's a relatively new sector, probably only five or six years old compared to many others in the REIT business that are decades old. So I think we've been on and you know this, John, we've talked to you about this, we've been on a mission to make sure, at least in our first 18 months that everyone knew who VICI was. How we could help them with their growth plans? How we do fair deals that we're an independent company and how we can again be there available to them, should they want to do a sale leaseback or sale of their company? And I just think it's a little bit of an education process where folks better understand how we can be part of their team so that they can it's -- you are correct, more and more folks are starting to understand. It doesn't mean honestly, you have the structure, but I think they understand how we can be a thought and I think VICI has played a big part in helping to educate and get out there and tell people about our company and the REIT space in general, Ed, David, anything on that?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes. I'll just add one more thought John, and I added as an open question that we would not pretend to have the answer to, and I think that open question, John is, is to what degree will a gaming asset that comes to market to be sold here in the future. To what degree will a whole co be able to win the bidding, if a REIT is interested in the real estate of that asset that has come to market, and an operator is interested as well. In other words to put the question in the most succinct terms, will there be circumstances when a whole co can outbid the combination of an OpCo and a PropCo, right. That I think is the question going forward that fundamentally ends up time to the degree to which gaming REITs can continue to grow.
John DeCree: Ed, I think that was my follow-up question. I was going to present to you on, on just competitiveness as the REIT stay involved. So perhaps a slightly different question for you guys as a follow-up. How do you think about, when you're underwriting an acquisition, particularly some of the single asset stuff that you're looking at or have done on a 4% coverage basis. There's been a clear preference for -- some corporate guarantee or credit support from your OpCo partner, but do you think about just kind of the 4% coverage, even if there is a some type of credit enhancement involved, kind of as you underwrite at this point in the cycle or how do you think about that going forward? And that's it from me. Thanks guys.
David Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. I can start and John chime in. As Ed and I've appreciated and John's realized over the long-term there is such a resiliency to the gaming revenues and cash flows that come out of these assets. So as we underwrite assets ultimately over the long term we want to try to get to kind of the 2% coverage. But as you've seen us do with the fixed deals that we've announced to-date, the coverage ratios going in at a range of a 1.7% and 1.8% with a much lower in Harrah's Las Vegas knowing that there were significant capital going into that asset. But the Margaritaville, as you heard this morning, we would do that at a 1.9 and Penn made the comment this morning that they are having the best quarter ever in that asset. So it's a combination of knowing what the operator can do what they can do with synergies and the conviction that we have in the partnership with that operator in their ability to continue to drive revenues obviously, EBITDAR for rent coverage in there as well. It's a little bit of a long-winded rambling answer but I think it's -- it depends. And, but ultimately if we 1.7%, 1.8% getting up to a 2% over the long-term is where we'd like to be.
John DeCree: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Bill on for Stephen. And thanks for taking my question. So following up on Daniel's question earlier. Do you expect as the gaming REIT space becomes more appealing to diversified REITs there'll be a pickup in the industry consolidation? And are there any barriers to entry associated with gaming licenses?
Ed Pitoniak: Bill. Yes, good to hear from you. In terms of what you're talking about in terms of industry consolidation, could use just clarify what you meant by that?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Just like a maybe a higher propensity for diversified REITs or even gaming REITs to acquire and consolidate within the industry?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, yes. So again I -- we would look at the increasing interest in gaming real estate as a sign of validation. And as to what the impact of that will be on bidding, as to what the impact of that will be on the incumbent gaming REITs in terms of their growth, their consolidation, again an open question at this point. It would stand to reason that the arrival of new entrants, the validation that they bring should lead to a rising tide that should rise -- raise their -- all boats when it comes to improving your cost of capital, and needless to say as cost of capital improves to a point that was raised earlier, it does make the available suite of investment opportunities gaming and non-gaming more abundant.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you. And there was recently announced closing of a lease gaming property. Do you expect us to have any ripple effect on regional casino underwriting?
Ed Pitoniak: Dan you want to take that?
David Kieske: Ed, I don't think so. I assume you're talking about the small asset that 10 and GOP I have in Tunica?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
David Kieske: Yes I don't see that effective regional underwriting.
Unidentified Analyst: That's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca from Ladenburg. Your line is open. 
John Massocca: So is there any thought process on your guys and to maybe keeping the leverage below target levels over the next couple of years. Just given, particularly given the call option properties are so accessible for you guys, that it just gives you more flexibility of not being reliant on your position in the capital markets to take down those deals in the most accretive manner?
David Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. The leverage is something that we're very mindful of obviously this entity started at 10.5 times and we worked to really, really hard to take a lot of leverage out of the system. And then with the size of the deals and the timing of the close, we never want to be in a position where our funding -- there is funding uncertainty around our acquisitions. So, I specifically, with the call properties we've got internal funding capabilities out of having a lower AFFO payout ratio around 75% of our AFFO, that in itself provides a nice funding capability for the call properties. We will keep the balance sheet of 5 times to 5.5 times. And so that does provide us some optionality with the call properties. So we don't specifically keep the balance sheet under-levered for those call properties. We want to make sure that we are -- we have funding certainty around anything that we've announced or anything that we potentially may acquire here in the future.
John Massocca: Okay. And then shifting gears to the two kind of pending transactions. How should we think about timing and maybe size of potential debt raise to help kind of fund those without putting too much of a burden on the line. I know you talked about doing some debt around Greektown. I mean is that just going to grow kind of pro rata for the additional acquisition in Cincinnati or was it kind of the original contemplated issuance around Greektown sufficient for both acquisitions?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, John it's a good question. As Penn said this morning and we are reiterating obviously it is subject to final regulatory approval, Greektown should close by the end of May. The plan would be to use cash on the balance sheet to close that asset. And then it sets the debt markets later in the year to acquire both Greektown and JACK Cincinnati on a leverage neutral basis. So Greektown is $700 million, Cincinnati is $558 million, so $1.2 billion $1.3 billion of total value for our assets that we're adding to the portfolio this year. So rough numbers $500 million, $600 million of additional debt that we will need to fund on a leverage neutral basis. And again, the markets are there today and as we get through the Ohio regulatory process we'll make -- we would have certainty around closing, we'll look to add incremental leverage on to the balance sheet.
John Massocca: Okay. And then kind of touching maybe on the regulatory side, I know it's kind of a broad question, but are there any markets or states where you think you guys may have destructural difficulties pursuing additional acquisitions because of regulatory concerns around competition or given kind of the diversity your portfolio, is it pretty wide open right now?
Ed Pitoniak: John you want to take first crack of that?
John Payne: It's hard to say, but I don't think there is any regulatory restrictions that I see in front of us of deals that we're looking at, and where we may be. So the answer right now is, I don't see any impairments for us to be able to grow from the regulatory.
John Massocca: Understood. That's it for me. Thank you guys very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bradford Dalinka from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, Brad on for Thomas Allen.
Ed Pitoniak: Hey Brad.
Unidentified Analyst: I wanted to ask you guys you had another one on the call options. Some articles indicates Caesars is looking to renew its license in New Orleans and potentially put some capital into that property. Could that situation impact the timing of the structure of the economics on that call? That's it for me. Appreciate the question.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks Brad. John you want to take that?
John Payne: Yes, Brad. This is John. So you are right that Caesars continues to look at extending their operating agreement, which expires in 2024. They're going through a state process right now, and we continue to monitor and work with them on that that option. We'll have to see how it ultimately plays out and how it gets finished and what the capital commitments are. So we're in contact with them as Ed said earlier, and we'll see how it it plays out and we'll be able to give some clear direction on where that's going. I don't know, Ed or David if you have anything to add to that?
Ed Pitoniak: I mean, I would just add that, obviously, as we talked about in the announcement of the Jack Cincinnati acquisition and as we talked about in the announcement of the Greektown acquisition, there are relatively few downtown regional casinos across the US landscape. New Orleans represents yet another one. And obviously we believe it is a really wonderful place to own a property. So we're obviously supporting Caesars in every way we can to ensure success in this process.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from a line of Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is [indiscernible] on for Smedes. I just want to ask how I think you comment on how current transaction pipeline looks and how it's changed over the past 6 to 12 months? 
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll take that. Someone asked me yesterday on a plane how things are going? I said I'm busier than I ever have been. But we've been saying since we started 18 months ago that we've been busy. So the activity is good. I think that the work we did in 2018 to build relationships and let folks know who we are, hopefully will continue to pay off. And in '19 and we'll do some work with those companies. So I'd say it is quite busy. We're quite active and it's pretty exciting time in this space.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Operator. Thanks to everybody again for your time today. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress in the summer when we report our second quarter results.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties’ Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 15, 2019. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.
Samantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company’s fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and the supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intend, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company’s SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company’s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning everyone. We’re very excited to be here and appreciate you taking the time to join us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2018 earnings call. We released our fourth quarter results last evening, which caps off the end of our first full fiscal year. In a moment, John Payne and David Kieske will walk you through how active and productive the first 17 months for VICI have been. It’s been a tremendously exciting 17 months for us as a team and what most excites us, everyday we come to work, every time we meet a new potential shareholder or a new potential business partner is the opportunity we’ve been given to develop and share the next really great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. As part of every real estate institutionalization story is institutional capital coming to understand the nature, quality, and durability of the cash flows in a real estate asset class that hasn’t previously seen broad and deep institutional investment. Every day we are excited to tell the VICI story, a story based in three key drivers of value creation. One, our ability to deliver portfolio income of the highest character and quality. Two, a best-in-class and fully internalized governance and management structure. And three, one of the best internal and external growth profiles across the REIT sector. Here’s a bit more on each one of these three value drivers. Portfolio income, character and quality through our triple-net lease structure partnering with leading operators in Caesars and Penn, we deliver income durability throughout economic cycle at a value and magnitude we believe no other real estate sector is able to currently produce. And our triple-net structure, where we have no property management, leasing or capital expenditure requirements, our reported AFFO is our true AFFO, giving our cash flows a degree a transparency and integrity hard to find in any other real estate sector. Capability and governance. We have established a board and a REIT management team with a deep bench of expertise in real estate, gaming and hospitality bolstered by a governance frame work explicitly designed to serve our one and only class of shareholders to common equity shareholder. We are completely independent from our tenants with no overlapping directors or ownership in our company. Internal and external growth. Our results speak for themselves. We have executed over $8 billion worth of acquisitions and capital markets activity since our emergence on October 6, 2017. I’ll let John tell you more about our growth track record in prospects in a moment. And even with all this recent activity, our future growth pipeline remains robust as we of course still have three call option properties, which we can acquire at a 10% cap rate at any point prior to our 2022. We will continue to evaluate those opportunities, but John will now expand upon the appetite for gaming transactions has not diminished. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to John to further discuss our recent transactions and what we’re seeing in the market going forward. John?
John Payne: Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Since our emergence, we’ve been extremely busy on the acquisition front as we’ve announced five acquisitions, which include four new properties and the consolidation of Caesars Palace, Las Vegas with the acquisition of the Octavius Tower. These acquisitions combine for a transaction value of approximately $2.7 billion across four markets, two of which are new markets for VICI, as well as approximately 330,000 square feet of gaming space and almost 4,000 hotel rooms and suites. Every one of our acquisitions has been complimentary to our strategic goals. When we wanted to increase our presence on the Las Vegas Strip, we acquired Harrah’s Las Vegas and sold Caesars 18 acres of our Las Vegas land holdings in exchange for a row for on a new world class convention center, which is currently under development. When we wanted to consolidate our ownership of Caesars Palace and further extend our footprint on the Las Vegas Strip, we acquired the 668 room Octavius Tower, adding $35 million of annual cash rent. When we wanted to expand into a top regional market, we acquired Harrah’s Philadelphia and added $21 million in rent for a new purchase price of 82.5 million in connection with amending our foundational leases to align VICI and Caesars strategic interest to create more long-term income stability, initiate annual rent escalators in our non-CPLV and Joliet Leases and incentivize Caesars to further invest in the assets in our portfolio. When we wanted to increase our regional presence and diversify our tenant base in record time for a gaming REIT, we partnered with Penn National Gaming and acquired the Margaritaville Resort Casino in Bossier City adding 23.2 million of rent to our portfolio and when we wanted a high-quality asset in one of the best regional gaming markets we further expanded our partnership with Penn with the announced acquisition of the Greektown Casino-Hotel located in downtown Detroit’s historical central business district adding $55 million in annual rent. Through these accretive acquisitions, we have closed or announced the addition of over $220 million in annual cash rent, a 35% increase from our initial annual rent at emergence, which was only 17 months ago as Ed mentioned. Each of these transactions accomplished a strategic goal we identified when we started VICI. What’s more, all of the completed acquisitions were done accretively on a leverage neutral basis for a very attractive cap rate. 2018 should give you a sense of what we hope to continue in 2019 and beyond. With a REIT team and deep hospitality industry connection, we will continue to put your capital to work as we grow our portfolio and continue progressing towards our goal. Those goals have not changed. We intend to continue to work on diversifying our tenant base, expanding geographically in attractive urban and regional markets and growing our Las Vegas exposure, all while creating value for our shareholders. The number of transactions announced by us and our peers over the past couple of years have bolstered the components in the gaming REIT model. REITs have become increasingly involved in gaming M&A conversations as operators look to capitalize on the underlying value of their real estate. The market environment for gaming transactions continues to be active and we look forward to the momentum we have headed into the rest of 2019. With that, I’ll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and financial results. David?
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Starting with our balance sheet, since our emergence, we have been highly focused on disciplined capital allocation to progress our strategic goals. We have transformed our balance sheet since emergence accessing the debt in equity market to finance accretive acquisition, significantly reduce leverage, and safeguard the company’s balance sheet against future uncertainty. To summarize, we raised over 3.1 billion of equity through our $1 billion equity private placement in December of 2017, a $1.4 billion IPO in February of 2018, which was eight times oversubscribed and the upsized $725 million follow-on equity offering in November, which we are proud to say represented the largest primary first follow-on offering ever done by a REIT. In 2018, VICI alone issued approximately 21% of all public REIT equity issued for the year. We entered into a $750 million equity distribution agreement or ATM agreement in December, giving us an efficient tool to access equity if and when needed. We significantly strengthened our balance sheet. We reduced our leverage from 8.4 times debt-to-EBITDA at emergence to 4.2 times net debt-to-EBITDA at year-end by refinancing nearly 2 billion of debt at lower interest rates, and eliminating over $1.3 billion of debt. Our outstanding debt at year-end was $4.1 billion with a weight average interest rate of 4.97%. This includes the impact of the two interest rate swap transactions we entered into on January 3. These effectively fixed the LIBOR portion on $500 million under our Term Loan B facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.38%. Our debt is now approximately 98% fixed, providing certainty to our future interest expense. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 5 years and we have no maturities until 2022. We increased our annualized dividend in June by 9.5% to $1.15 per share after only two quarters of being a dividend paying REIT. We ended the year with approximately $1.1 billion of cash in short-term investment in an unfunded $100 million revolver providing us liquidity for future growth. In terms of financial results, yesterday we reported AFFO of $139.9 million or $0.36 per share for the fourth quarter. During the full-year of 2018, AFFO [to] $525.6 million or $1.43 per share in-line with our 2018 guidance. Our earnings for the quarter reflect revenue of $226 million, which was comprised of $218.5 million from our real property business and $7.5 million from our golf business. Real property business revenue was comprised of $187.3 million of the income from direct financing leases, $11.3 million of income from operating leases, and 19.9 million of property taxes paid by our tenants. Our fourth quarter revenue includes 6.3 million of noncash direct financing lease adjustments. As you may have noted, the $6.3 million adjustment is substantially lower from prior quarters as a result of the lease modifications which were effective as of November 1, 2018. On the expense side, our general and administrative costs were 4.3 million for the quarter. This is lower than our previously stated run rate of approximately 6 million per quarter as a result of a one-time adjustment related to a true-up of certain gross receipts and franchise taxes incurred at the State and local level. Going forward, we continue to expect our G&A to be between 6 million and 6.5 million per quarter with slight fluctuations possibly occurring quarter-to-quarter. We like to draw your attention to our financial supplement located on the investors section of our website under the menu heading financials. We’ve added additional quarterly disclosure and continue to value any feedback you may have on the information presented. To follow-up on the acquisition front that John discussed, on November 14, we announced the $700 million acquisition of Greektown in downtown Detroit. We will use a portion of the November equity offering proceeds to fund the Greektown transaction on a leverage neutral basis, which we continue to target closing during the second quarter of 2019. On December 26, we completed the acquisition of Harrah's Philadelphia for the net price of 82.5 million, including $159 million reduction to the gross price of 241.5 million to reflect the aggregate net present value of the lease modification. This transaction was completed using cash on our balance sheet. With the closing of this transaction the lease modification took effect retroactive in November 1, 2018. I would like to briefly go over the impact of the annual escalators on 2018 results and where the annual cash rent stand heading into 2019. The Non-CPLV and Joliet base rent of 465 million was increased by 1.5% to an annual amount of 472 million on November 1, providing us rent at a revised amount for the final two months of 2018. On December 26, the non-CPLV and Joliet base rent was raised again by 21 million to 493 million to reflect the closing of Harrah's Philadelphia. We collected rent on the property for six days during 2018 and will be subject to the annual escalator of 1.5% beginning one November 1, 2019. The CPLV base rent, excluding Octavius Tower was increased by approximately 2.6% or 4.4 million to an annual amount of 169.4 million on November 1, providing us with her rent at a revised amount for the final two months of 2018. Inclusive of Octavius Tower, which is not subject to an annual escalator, the annualized CPLV base rent is currently 204.4 million. The Harrah's Las Vegas escalator was effective as of January 1, 2019 so there is no impact on our 2018 results. Our cash rent for 2019 is projected to be approximately 88.3 million for HLV. Subsequent to year-end, on January 2, the company closed the acquisition of Margaritaville for 261.1 million adding approximately 23.2 million in annual cash rent. The transaction was funded using cash on our balance sheet.  Turning to guidance. We expect 2019 AFFO per share to be between $1.47 and $1.50 per share. As a reminder, our guidance does not include pending acquisitions that have been announced and not yet closed. As a result of the following offering, the outstanding share count at year-end is approximately 404.7 million shares in a basis for our guidance.  Compared to our 2018 AFFO results to be approximately midpoint of our 2019 guidance assumes the following: A $0.03 per share increase due to the impact of annual escalators on the CPLV and non-CPLV Joliet and HLV leases, a $0.05 per share increase due to the full-year impact of rent added to the non-CPLV lease from the acquisition of Harrah's Philadelphia, a $0.05 per share increase, due to the full-year impact of rent added to the CPLV lease from the acquisition of Octavius Tower, which is not subject to the annual escalator, a $0.06 per share increase due to the acquisition of the Margaritaville Resort and Casino. This was partially offset by $0.14 per share decrease due to the addition of 34.5 million shares to the total share count of as a result of the November 2018 equity offering. Finally, the reduction in DFL adjustment for 2019, as a result of our lease modification, is reflected in the $0.02 per share adjustment from FFO to AFFO in the table in our press release. As a reminder, this is a non-cash item, which increases topline revenue for 2019 and is deducted to calculate AFFO. Just to reiterate, our guidance does not include the Penn and Greektown transaction, which we expect to close during Q2 2019. Greektown allowed 55.6 million of annual rents in our portfolio once the transaction closes and we expect to fund this on a leverage neutral basis. In closing, based on our 2018 performance, we continue to make tremendous progress as we execute on our strategy. Heading into 2019, we believe we are well-positioned with significant liquidity, to keep growing our portfolio, and delivering shareholder value.  Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.
Ed Pitoniak: Hi, Smedes.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just understand your guidance a little better, I mean you kind of walk through it there, but are there any other kind of below the line items that maybe people are not factoring in or maybe we're not factoring in because you're coming in below consensus forecast. So, maybe on the taxes side or some other item that maybe we're underestimating?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, Smedes, it's a good question. With the guidance – consensus is to mixed bag of results that are out there, some analysts say that’s additional acquisitions that are outside of Greektown in our numbers, so I think when you factor in Greektown and the additional AFFO, we will achieve by the annual rent of $55.6 million and then again, we will fund that on a leverage-neutral basis from an assumption on $350 million of debt. I think the – in an apples-to-apples comparison from our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50, adding in the Greektown transaction at some point in mid-year, I think you get to that run rate, that we expect to achieve then, if you take out the [noise to the other] analysts, I think that's an apples-to-apples comparison.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thanks. And we can follow up with you maybe offline on that. The other thing I just wanted to ask you, Caesars remains very much in the press as potentially a sale candidate, and just wanted to ask you to kind of – if you can kind of recap any implications for your leases with them, if Caesars is sold or if Caesars is to be – if it's broken up potentially into different pieces?
David Kieske: Yes, Smedes, I'll start and then John and Ed can chime in. Look, the leases in the call right that we have, the call properties, the three call properties that had alluded to our obligations of the entity and transfer with the entity, so obviously we only read what’s in the press, but we're confident in Caesars and them as operators and the obligations of that we have with – the right that we have with Caesars would continue in the event of any potential transaction.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Barry Jonas: Hi guys, good morning. Just a clarification on the Caesars question. Do you technically need to give consent to them in a change of control or sale of individual assets?
Ed Pitoniak: No, we do not Barry. This is Ed. Good morning. No, we do not.
Barry Jonas: Got it. Even the call option properties?
Ed Pitoniak: Well, again, as David emphasized, in a change of control, our right to continue to call the call properties, continues.
Barry Jonas: Great, and then just look … sorry.
Ed Pitoniak: And again, all the obligations of the leases would transfer as well.
Barry Jonas: Got it. And then just look, high level, just curious if you can comment on the level activity in the M&A pipeline of things slowed at all? Or is the pace remain pretty brisk? Thanks.
Ed Pitoniak: John.
John Payne: I'll take that one, Barry. No, we continue to be quite busy. Someone mentioned me another REIT mentioned that it slowed down a little bit, but we're feeling quite good, continue to be busy on the road, talking about potential deals as busy as we were in the latter part of 2018.
Barry Jonas: Alright, great to hear. Thanks so much, guys.
David Kieske: Thanks, Barry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Mike Pace: Hi, good morning. And David, thanks for the added disclosure on the DFL and since it's noncash, I won't belabor on that anymore. But maybe just some color on the capital structure, I guess you put in place some additional swaps, I think you have total swaps of $2 billion or so now. And I'm wondering what you think that implies or how we should read that in terms of you wanting or considering to chipping away $2 billion plus term loan maturity in the – I think the 24 time-frame. Does that imply that you don't do that prior to the swaps running off and then how do you think about that large maturity out into the future as you sit here today and then I have a few follow ups?
David Kieske: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Good to talk to you, looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Look, in terms of swap, it's a two-year swap on $500 million of the term loan. We were opportunistic and took advantage of very low point in the market that fix a portion of our debt for the next two years.  Obviously with the second liens and the term loan and then ultimately the CMBS, as we've discussed our strategy that ultimately migrate to an unsecured borrower and so there will be a sequencing of steps that will have to occur to put that in place over time, and I think the first will be the second lien potentially next year, and then with a two-year swap that would potentially give us a portion of the term loan that we could address in 2021. So, just kind of working down the capital stack over time as the objective here and obviously being very disciplined and how we access the markets and where we – when we do that throughout the sequencing of our company.
Mike Pace: And then, while I have you on the capital structure, you mentioned $350 million of debt for Greektown, that's incremental debt. So, we shouldn't assume that you're just going to use the cash that you raised from the equity offering, is that right?
David Kieske: That's right. I mean we've modeled that and underwritten that internally at a leverage neutral basis, look we upsized the offering just given how strong the pipeline was where we were in the market and we feel really good about having the excess liquidity on balance sheet today.
Mike Pace: Okay. And then for any of you here. I guess, to get back to a prior question, maybe I'll just use the word activist rumbling across the marketplace, but do you guys ever think about the size of deals that you could do from a capacity or even your own appetite standpoint. And in that context, can you just remind us what your leverage target is and your willingness to go above that, if larger M&A opportunities do pop up?
Ed Pitoniak: Mike, this is Ed. And again, good to talk to you. I think the fact that we were able to execute on a $1.1 billion transaction within really what amounted to six weeks or seven weeks after our emergence, speaks to the fact that when there are opportunities of magnitude, we will do all we can to see those opportunities in a way that delivers our owners, the kind of risk adjusted returns they deserve and I think we've proven our access to capital both on the equity side and the debt side. So, again, we are willing to go after big opportunities, but we will always be highly disciplined in the way we do so, and if I can just go back for a moment to your question about Greektown and us funding it leverage neutral, that is very much our plan right now. But, if I could just take a moment to kind of talk about guiding principles in terms of how we approach risk management at VICI, when we raised the money that we did in November, we were obviously raising equity in excess of what we needed for Greektown. But the feedback we got from our long-term shareholders in November, is that they believed in our guiding principle that we should always achieve funding certainty. If we can do so in a way that's accretive for the shareholder, and needless to say when December unfolded the way it did, we were very glad that we had the funding certainty for Greektown that we did, because we all painfully remember. December felt like a microcosm of the financial crisis, thank goodness, it was only a fire drill, not a fire that burned out of control for the month’s quarters and years at a time, but we went to bed every night knowing that we could fully paper Greektown, no matter what continue to unfold. So, again, yes, we plan on Greektown being leveraged neutral, but the approach we will always take, is an approach where we are willing to sacrifice a certain amount of temporary, emphasis on temporary dilution in order to achieve long-term funding certainty, in order to generate long-term accretion for our owners.
Mike Pace: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Thank you. Hi, good morning everybody. So, Ed, I think you just answered the majority of my question, but as I think about the balance sheet today, and including some of the short-term investments you're obviously exiting the year pretty healthy from a cash perspective and clearly as you get into the first quarter here, we will see the Margaritaville transaction, which is already closed. And then, obviously, we'll see Greektown when that happens. But as you think about kind of the cash balance that you guys are carrying through this year. In an ideal world, where do you – what do you kind of see as the cash need for the business? And I guess asked differently, does it kind of signal or could we read into kind of the elevated cash that you're keeping with the fact that you're going to kind of split that $700 million payment and maybe think that, that dry powder could be for some other things that you're contemplating at present?
Ed Pitoniak: Very much so, Carlo and our Board, Chairman used a phrase in conversation a couple weeks ago, I never heard maybe you all have heard it before, but the phrase he used is that executions occur at the crossroads of strategy and opportunity. Our strategy is obviously, continue to grow the portfolio accretively for our owners. Our strategy emphasizes continuing to build and diversify our portfolio and our tenant base, and we obviously love doing the kind of deals we've done in the last few months with Penn. So, we will have that money available to do deals that come at that crossroads of strategy and opportunity out in the open market. If they were not to materialize, and again, we have a – we go into the year with a lot of confidence as John just said that we’re going to be able to find deals out there that we can do accretively for our owners. We always do have the backup of the call property. If we found ourselves in a situation where opportunities didn't materialize at the pace that one might wish, and thus, we are able to deploy the capital as you can well understand very accretively on a call property.
Carlo Santarelli: That's super helpful. Thank you, Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Carl.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Adam with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Daniel Adam: Hi guys, good morning.
David Kieske: Hi, Dan. Good morning.
Daniel Adam: Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quick one – quick follow-up on Caesars. To the extent that a strategic buyer held non-Clark County regional assets, would your ROFO with respect to the Caesars regional properties that they would potentially buy in the future, also hold on those assets in the event of a sale-leaseback?
David Kieske: No, Dan they would not.
Daniel Adam: They would not?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, And I think I would just add Dan, as an element of color around that. You know, procedures for Penn for anybody else, we're able to do business within the future. We always want to be the answer to the question. How do I fund my opportunities, right? We want VICI to be a great answer to that question of how do I fund platform growth? How do I fund development? How do I fund deleveraging? How do I fund the opportunities that are in front of me? And we want to be a permanent capital provider to great operators and we have great confidence in our relationship with Caesars that we can continue to be that solution provider, as well as being a solution provider to other great operators out there.
Daniel Adam: Got it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good morning.
David Kieske: Good morning, John.
John Massocca: So, kind of touching back on the acquisition environment again, can you maybe comment on the acquisition and transaction expenses you incurred in the quarter? Are those related deals that are kind of, let's say, completely dead or could that be something where negotiations are ongoing, but maybe didn't close during the quarter? Just any color you could provide there would be helpful?
Gabe Wasserman: Hi, John. It's Gab Wasserman here. Those are some expenses post some deals we're looking at and we didn't feel that they were capitalizable under GAAP, but we're still looking at them, but felt it was the appropriate time to expense them during the fourth quarter.
John Massocca: Very helpful, thank you. And then maybe kind of – more on a strategic side of things, you continue to kind of grow the portfolio outside of the original Caesars properties. How do you think about corporate guarantees versus assets that a corporate guarantee? And then maybe what's kind of the appropriate in your mind property level coverages with both types of transactions?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start this out John and then turn it over to our John. Obviously when you have a corporate rent guarantee, you don't have to fixate to the same degree on asset level coverage. But when we're doing single asset deals, we obviously are very focused on the coverage at debt level, and obviously it is a value even in those single asset deals to have corporate guarantees that go beyond the asset, but that's when we really drill in on what is the current cash flow of the asset? What is the coverage going in? What will the coverage be going forward, based upon the synergies, the operator is able to realize? So that we have confidence that the operator can be very successful and that the rent can thus become as lower percentage as possible of the revenue and the cash flow of the asset. John Payne, you want to add to that?
John Payne: Yes, John. I'd only add that it also depends on – we've been clear on this. We talked to public companies and large public companies and small, but there is – in this space, there's quite a bit of private companies that were out to. So, it really just depends, there isn't just a formula of how to do a deal, but we're out there talking to everyone. I think Ed described it incredibly well, but how we think about it.
John Massocca: Make sense. And then kind of lastly, I know you talked about potential debt with regards to Greektown. Sorry if I missed this. Can you talk about what are the – maybe pricing you think is in the market for that?
David Kieske: Yes. Look, John, I think we point MGP at a very successful offering and we recommend them on – reopening the markets after the December malaise. There were five and three quarters, we've gotten indications in and around that area. So, we feel good about where the margins are, and they seem to be functioning after the shutdown essentially in December.
John Massocca: That's it for me. Thank you very much.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, John.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Hi, thanks. I guess a quick follow-up to Carlos' question and to be clear, I guess would you contemplate a systematic exercising of the call option properties as we get close to expiration and how would a potential sale of Caesars if it were to go down that path, change your thought process on the options specifically call option properties specifically?
Ed Pitoniak: John Payne, you want take that?
John Payne: Well, to first one, I think your question is around would we take them down all at once, and we've been clear since we started that we don't see the path forward that there is an opportunity to acquire something externally that we have these options and we'd look at them at one at a time or across all three. I'm not sure, I think differently about if I think your question, Stephen was around if someone else was operating the call properties would we think that differently. Is that your question?
Stephen Grambling: So, I guess on the first one was, not if you do them all at once, but would you come up with a systematic approach one a year, each year, so that there is not really surprises in the market.
John Payne: Yes, I mean, I think that is our plan right now and that, again if we are forward-looking and we don't think our pipeline is as strong as we believe it is today, we will begin to turn to those option properties and we know how accretive they'll be if we execute them. Where we are today? I think you're hearing us say we feel good about the depth of our portfolio in front of us and we'll continue to evaluate when the right time is to execute those option properties. Ed, I don't know if you want to add to that?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, no, that – you nailed it, John. I would just add, Stephen, I think in terms of how we think about our growth on a base case basis, it would be that kind of metronomic year-by-year take down, that would be our base case game plan. Just to go back to that execution being at the crossroads of strategy and opportunity, there could be situations that either could accelerate that or call – upon attending call for taking down two at once, but we would we see those as a key means by which we delivered the kind of metronomic year-by-year growth in AFFO per share that certainly real estate investors, institutional investors expect and get delivered from the blue chip names in the triple-net sector and elsewhere across our universe.
Stephen Grambling: Great, thanks. And then, what markets are you most interested in as you look about – look for future opportunities for growth? And is there a mismatch between where you want to grow versus where assets are available for sale?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: No, not at all. I think that we continue to like our diversification where we've got exposure on Las Vegas strip, we have exposure in regional markets, we have exposure in what we call urban regional markets. Clearly, there are some opportunities in markets that we'd like to have greater exposure in and there are some markets that we simply don't have real estate in, Las Vegas locals’ market being an example that we really like that market. So, there's not a mismatch between what is potentially for sale and where we'd like to expand. All I would say is, we will continue to remain diversified across our portfolio as we continue to grow it.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. Maybe the last one is just, as MGM is talking about shifting the ownership of MGP and potentially making a little bit more of an independent entity. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape for potential deals?
Ed Pitoniak: John?
John Payne: No, I think we've come at this as you know, since we've been – we were born a true independent REIT and we've come at any bid process that it's going to be a competitive process and we want to ensure that we get a fair deal for both the seller and for us, but we have not seen based on what you said, an increase in the amount of competition for assets that are potentially for sale because we've always come out at that there was competition.
Stephen Grambling: Have seller expectations changed, as the sector has started to do additional deals?
John Payne: No, I think sellers are realistic about what they can get and you get into negotiations and talks with them, and ensure that you're going to get a fair deal both ways, that it works for our company or for any REIT and it works for the seller and it works for the operator that you're partnering with. So, I've not seen unrealistic expectations a year ago, and I'm not seeing unrealistic expectations today.
Stephen Grambling: That's great. Good luck, this year, guys.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, Stephen.
David Kieske: Thank you.
John Payne: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning everyone. Thanks for all the color so far, Ed I just got maybe a question for you or anyone who wanted to chime in kind of higher-level thinking. We talked a lot about casino real estate, how strong and durable that income stream is? But what are your thoughts on kind of non-gaming or resort other leisure type of acquisition activities and Caesars has been branding some resorts in select cities. Is it something that you look at today or is there just enough to do on Casino resort, M&A front that it's not really something you're branching out and how do you think about some of the other opportunities?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, John. Good to talk to you. We certainly are busy with gaming M&A right now and we obviously like the real estate investment economics of what we're looking at in gaming. But, from day one, we have positioned ourselves as an experiential REIT and we look ahead at the next 10-20 years with a high conviction that this should be a great 20-year period, the leisure, entertainment, recreation, hospitality and wellness. As you look at both the generational age-wise, the Baby Boomers and Millennials going into periods where there will be especially for Baby Boomers increased leisure time. And so, we have from day one, been determined to make sure we are learning at a pace that enables us to be in a position, whether it's many years from now or a few years from now, to be able to make compelling investments in non-gaming opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And frankly, our investment criteria will largely be framed by what we love about our investment in gaming real estate, which really starts with what we call experiential complexity. The thing we love about so many of our gaming assets is the operator offers a rich experience, a rich multi-dimensional experience that greatly intensifies their relationship with the end user and thus protects them and us from disruption and obsolescence. So, we will look for that same experience of complexity. We'll look for operators who have that really strong enduring relationship with the end user. And we'll look for the kind of demographic, psychographic cultural and regional tailwinds, that ensures that asset. We'll have the kind of cash flows over a multi-decade period that our owners deserve. But again, that is not imminent at this time. But the learning has to be taken place if we're going to make good decisions in the years to come.
John DeCree: Thanks, Ed. Thanks for the color. And one follow-up on, I guess, a more specific question on types of M&A I think, slide I saw that you guys have put out maybe in January with your investor deck that kind of positioned kind of necessary return thresholds, relative to growth and I think somewhere in the middle with international gaming opportunities and we haven't had a chance to talk about that slide yet. So, I thought now would be a good time. Is there anything internationally that would make sense, is that just too challenging from how you position the business model or is that something that might perhaps come in somewhere between kind of North American gaming and some of those other kind of leisure and opportunities that you've just kind of spoke about?
Ed Pitoniak: Yes, I'll turn it over to John in a moment. We certainly haven't prioritized international gaming as a REIT. Any REIT that goes outside the U.S. borders has to have an investment strategy that has a very strong risk management component to it. So that you're managing risk on tax, you're managing risk on currency, you're managing risk on rule of law or property ownership right. So, we certainly haven't prioritized it at this time. But it's certainly in our learning file for going forward. John, if you want to add any color beyond that. John Payne?
John Payne: No, I think you described it well. I think if an opportunity came our way, we would continue to study is that the right place to be? Or are those the right assets and is that the right operator to be with us? We make a move to international, but I think Ed described it very well.
John DeCree: Thanks guys and congratulations on the first full-year, last year.
Ed Pitoniak: Thanks, John.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the conference back over to our presenters.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. Thanks again all of you for your time today. At VICI, we are privileged to be invested in experiential real estate, that is all about the shared experience. All about the desire of our guests to gather together in one place at one-time to share memorable and sometimes momentous experiences. And here's what's great about shared place-based experiences. They're something that e-commerce has not figured out or to put in a box and ship your house. And real estate investors recognition of this dynamic is still in its very early stages. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress in the spring, when we report our first quarter results. Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties’ Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, November 02, 2018. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Sacks Gallagher with VICI Properties.
Samantha Sacks Gallagher: Thank you, Operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the Company’s third quarter 2018 earnings release and the supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties Web site at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intend, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the Company’s SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our third quarter 2018 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we’ll open the call to questions. With that, I turn the call over to Ed.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join VICI's third quarter earnings call this morning. We released our third quarter results last evening and it has been just over one year since we emerged from our spin-off. We now have a full year four fiscal quarters of the reported results under our belts. Here are a few of our key accomplishment in building our business over our first four quarters of operations. We’ve raised nearly $2.4 billion of equity through our Q4, 2017 equity private placement and our February 2018 IPO. We refinanced over $2 billion of debt and eliminated over $1 billion of debt, we’ve closed or announced the total $2.1 billion of acquisitions and we’ve managed to de-lever from 8.4 times debt-to-EBITDA emergence to 5.0 times as of Q3, while growing our pro forma AFFO by about 46%. And might we have accomplished all of this within the governance framework that was established to serve our one and only class of shareholders the common equity shareholder. We realized that our sector leadership in and always will be contingent on us making good decision, taking the right actions and managing risk properly, day after day after day, so that every day our shareholders' interest are being relentlessly cared for and value is being steadily created. This past quarter as regard to our growth pipeline we closed on the activity of tower acquisition from $507.5 million, adding $35 million of rent and rounding out our ownership of the real estate of the iconic Caesars Palace, Las Vegas. We continue to move toward closing the Margareta Hill, Harris Philadelphia and lease modification transactions. We hope to have all of those wrapped up during the fourth quarter. We continue to see a lot of activity in the sector as John can attest and we'll do so in a moment and we don’t see ourselves slowing down as we intend to continue to pursue attractive growth opportunities. Not to be forgotten, we still have three call option properties in our back pocket, as well as any ROFO assets to become available. Needless to say, we feel very good about how our first year has progressed based on the three key elements of our business model; one, best in sector governance and high energetic management capability; two, high quality portfolio income that is durable and transparent through all cycles; and three, best in sector growth prospects. With that, I’ll now turn the call over John to discuss what we’re seeing in the market. John, over to you.
John Payne: Thanks, Ed and good morning everyone. The market environment for gaming transactions continues to be active and the number of transactions announced by us and the gaming REIT sector more broadly over the past year is a testament to the growing confidence operators, investors have in the gaming REIT model. This quarter we closed on the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace and we continue to make progress towards completing the acquisition of Harris Philadelphia with Caesars and Margaritaville, Boulder City with Pan National, which we hope to close during the fourth quarter. We have no intention of slowing down. And as you've seen from the transactions we’ve announced over the past year, there is no shortage of external growth opportunities currently out in the marketplace. While we are the new guy in the market, we have long-standing relationships within the industry that have allowed us to make progress towards our goals. Those goals have not changed. We continue to work on diversifying on tenant based, expanding geographically in attractive regional markets and growing our Las Vegas exposure; all while creating value for our shareholders. As we have said before, we continue to believe we can further build the portfolio by putting your capital to work. The principles key to our success have been our true independence, our depth of understanding of the tenants underlying business and our focus on executing what we can consider fair deals, deals that are mutually beneficial to both the OpCo and VICI. We believe that the acquisitions we’ve completed and announced to-date have demonstrated this, not only to our operating partners but to our shareholders who we’ve entrusted with their capital. With that, I’ll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. We reported total AFFO of $132.2 million or $0.36 per share for the third quarter. Our earnings for the quarter reflect $232.7 million, which was comprised of $227.3 million from our real property business and $5.4 million from our golf business. Real property business revenue was comprised of $189.9 million of income from financing leases, $12.2 million of income from operating leases and $25.1 million of property taxes paid by our tenants. Our income from direct financing leases for the quarter includes $13 million net change to our investments in direct financing leases, which is a non-cash item. After adjusting for the non-controlling interest attributable to Joliet, our portion with DFL that is deducted from net income should calculate AFFO to $12.9 million. On the cost side, our general and administrative costs were $5.7 million for the quarter. We're thrilled to report that we have completed the previously discussed transition from Las Vegas to New York and reached our steady state run rate for G&A. We continue to expect that cost will hover around $16 million per quarter with slight fluctuations possibly occurring quarter-to-quarter. During Q3, the Company recognized $12.3 million non-cash loss on impairment on certain non-operating vacant land parcels. By way of background it was part of emergence and spinoff from CEOC, VICI inherited approximately 215 acres of non-operating land parcels scattered across the country. All of the land parcels are located outside of Las Vegas and none of the land parcels are component of the operations of our regional property portfolio. As part of our efforts to monetize certain parcels, it was determined the carrying value reported on our balance sheet at the time of the emergence exceeded the fair market value. As a result, we recorded one-time non cash impairment and the reclassified remaining land value of approximately $22 million from investment in operating income to land on the balance sheets. On the acquisition side on July 11th, we completed the acquisition of Octavius Tower for $530.5 million. The purchase was funded with cash on balance sheet. Octavius Tower is operating pursuant to a standalone lease, which provides for annual rent of $35 million and has an initial term that expires on October 31, 2032, with four, five year renewal options. In connection with the closing of Harrah's Philadelphia and the lease modifications, the detail of lease will be amended to include Octavius tower. As has been mentioned, we hope to close Margaritaville and Harrah's Philadelphia and the lease modifications during the fourth quarter. We expect the total net cash outflow for these transactions, including the impact of the $159 million reduction of the Philadelphia purchase price in connection with the agreed upon lease modifications to be approximately $344 million. We expect both transactions to be funded using cash on the balance sheet.  Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $466 million of cash and short-term investment. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate, including the impacts of our interest rate swaps of 4.95% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.2 years. We have no debt maturing until 2022. Based on annualize third quarter adjusted EBITDA, our net leverage is 5 times. With respect to our guidance for the remainder of 2018, the Company is updating its estimated net income per share guidance to reflect the non-cash loss on impairment, which occurred in Q3. And we are reaffirming the AFFO per share guidance for the full year 2018. As a reminder, our guidance does not include pending acquisitions that have not yet closed. We estimate that net income attributable to common stockholders will be between $1.44 and $1.45 per share, and net AFFO per share will continue to be between $1.43 and $1.44 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2018. Finally, regarding the Company’s dividend policy; with the closing of our Octavius Tower, we raised our targeted annual dividend rates of 9.5%; on September 17th, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2875 per share of common stock for the third quarter, which reflected the increased annualize dividend rate of $1.15 per share. The dividend was paid on October 11th to stockholder of records as of the close of business on September 28th. In closing, we continue to make tremendous progress as we execute on our strategy, we believe we are well position to keep growing our portfolio and driving our shareholder value. Operator, at this time we’d be happy to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Daniel Adam with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Adam: Can we talk about the M&A environment a little bit outside of the call right properties and other dropdowns from Caesars. What are you guys seeing in terms of new pipeline opportunities? And as follow up to that, are you seeing opportunities more publicly traded operators or with both public and private casino owner operators? Thanks.
John Payne: So, I’m going to sound a little bit like a broken record for the last two quarters, we’ve been speaking. The activity in the space continues to be strong. We’re out there, obviously the -- as we know, the new kid on the block and we’re making sure that all the operators out there understand our model and are true independence. When it comes to whether they’re public companies or private companies, I’d say there is a mixture of both out there. And again, we’re making sure that we’re out there and it's quite active, whether all be assets that are out there that we’re talking about transact, we don’t know but we’re making sure that VICI's presence is out there.
Ed Pitoniak: Dan, I might just add to that. What we’re benefiting from is the increasing understanding on the part of asset controllers and/or operators. As to what the nature of the capital is that we convey to them if we do a sale leaseback transaction, and that is to say we’re another form of permanent capital. And we believe, in many cases, a cheaper form permanent capital than they could access either through the public markets or other private channels.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Abhishek on for Smedes. There have been a lot of media stories about the state of Caesars from perspective. Can you talk about what this change of control would mean if anything and for your existing leases with Caesars, as well as your call options on the three Harrah’s Casinos?
Ed Pitoniak: I mean just to start with -- to provide context whenever we talk about Caesars. We are in the deformation of a long-term relationship with Caesars. It's a relationship that has at least 34 years to go and in 2052, chances are pretty good if we’re all here -- I mean I think in my age, but then it would be a relationship that continues into the future. In terms of change of control, I think first of all just to emphasize what is perhaps obvious is that Caesars has announced nothing in regard to any potential changes of control. They're obviously undertaking a CEO search as they announced yesterday, but in terms of the technicalities of the change of control. We’re one to take place I'll turn it over to David and John. 
David Kieske: Yes, in terms of the call properties, those are essentially obligations of Caesars and the entity, and those would carry forward if there were any change of control. And then the leases are obligations of the entity as well and we don't have any concern that those leases would be impacted if there were a change of control. And Caesars as our tenant, we're only speculating on what is rumored in the presses as you are. I mean, but we feel good about our tenant relationship we have with our tenants.
John Payne: And I think obviously you know this well Smedes that we're obviously in the triple net space and you have to look past just quarter-by-quarter. But if you do look at the underlying business at Caesars, you look at the quarter two results, EBITDAR was up 13%. This quarter was a little down but they're forecasting for the fourth quarter the outlook looks really strong between I think it was 6% and 16%. Those are those are healthy growth of the underlying tenants business?
Unidentified Analyst: And would it change the way you think about timing of the call options. So would you opt to be more in front to exercise on them sooner rather than later, or is it little different?
Ed Pitoniak: No, not necessarily. Our timing on the call properties will always be based upon our believing it is a very opportune time to exercise a call or multiple calls at any given time over the remaining four years that we have to call them. We do not -- we are not concerned about anything that may happen and how it may impact timing of -- we’ll always do it when we believe it's the best time on behalf of our shareholders to take them down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Stephen Grambling: I guess one clarification just on the impairment. Can you just provide a little more details to where some of that land is, maybe why there was deterioration or maybe it fell under your expectations or maybe that's even the cost of the land? And then also what you plan to do maybe with the rest of the land?
David Kieske: So this is land has been on Caesars' balance sheet for years, and John can speak to how long it's been around. And this is land that Caesars accumulated. Over a period of time when there were potential opportunities to expand gaming and jurisdictions represents a likelihood that we're going to grant it. So this is really non-de minimis land non-operating land. It is not associated with any casino operations. And so we went to -- and this is something that the creditors as far as bankruptcy put within the VICI bucket so to speak. And as we went to start to monetize some of this because it has no intrinsic value to us going forward, we realized the value that was from an accounting standpoint that was on the books that was brought over during the emergence was it's simply different than the fair market value. And so we took a $12 million non-cash write down, there was $34 million in aggregate. I mean, we wrote that down to $12 million but the one time just cleaning up some of the accounting that was done at the time of the emergence.
Stephen Grambling: And then maybe turning to just the overall M&A environment and you alluded to this a little bit. But have you seen any shift at all in property pricing expectations, either due to the rising interest rates or even just gaming sector performance, in general?
John Payne: We have not seen any difference in activity or pricing at this time, maybe it’s a little earlier we'll just have to continue to watch that. But it’s -- the activity has been as the robust as it has been in the previous quarters as I've communicated. So, again we'll continue to monitor, continue to listen to what’s out in the market, but we have not seen a decline in the number of activities.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cameron McKnight with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Cameron McKnight: The question is for Ed or David, or John. In terms of potential accretion from transactions, I mean lot of gaming deals over the past few years have been done with 5% to 8% accretion to AFFO per share. Where do you think that settles down over time? And do you think it settles down at some level below that?
Ed Pitoniak: I think historically, Cam, part of the explanation for that magnitude of accretion is that until recently most of the big trades or big portfolio trades that we’re capable of generating that on block accretion. I think when you get down to single assets, it’s unlikely you’re going to see that magnitude of accretion. And I think at that point you’d be more rightly focused on the cash on cash return of the transaction unto itself as opposed to an EPS accretion per share. Because obviously as each of us as each of the three us get bigger, the accretion per share will become mathematically somewhat harder to achiever and I would evaluate single, especially single asset transactions not only on accretion per share basis, which we will always make sure is positive but also on a cash on cash return of the acquisition in relation to the cost of capital that was required to execute that transaction.
Cameron McKnight: And then, David, in terms of funding M&A. If you were issue seven to 10 year paper today, where do you think that might price?
David Kieske: I mean with our rating are Ba3, BB rating, it's in the mid to high 5s is what the bankers continue to tell us as the rates are moving around, 10 years moves around the books. But the overall debt markets being liquid and fluid still and pricing that would make sense to achieve the accretion that Ed talked about.
Cameron McKnight: And then one last one for John, if I can. John, you’ve been in the gaming industry a long time. What’s your interpretation of what we saw in the third quarter in Vegas?
John Payne: I think people were prepared for numbers. I think we’re going to be quite weaker than that Cam. The numbers that have come out had some weakness compared to prior year but they seem to have exceeded the expectation which was nice to see. It's funny, we’re looking at less about the third, Cam, and onto the fourth and the first and the operators have talked a lot about the strength that they’re seeing in fourth and into 2019, which is great to hear.
Ed Pitoniak: The other thing, Cam, I would just add is that as John's already alluded to we're a triple net REIT, we're going to collect the same rent no matter what happens at the operator level quarter-to-quarter. But nonetheless this is a period where we feel our portfolio strategy of having exposure to both the regional market and Las Vegas is the right strategy for us as a REIT, such that we can confidently distribute cash through all cycles, because as you did see Florence's in their reports -- in the results, Caesars reported yesterday, their reasonable performance for Q3 was very strong. It was about 50% of our portfolio out in the regions, 40% in Las Vegas. Again, we like that balance again not that we live quarter-to-quarter but we like having tenants who have that portfolio disclosure and diversity geographically.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: David just wanted to circle back to the comment that earlier in terms of the $344 million of financing net for the two transactions, including the lease modification. You mentioned largely cash. I think you guys have about $145 million of cash on the balance sheet as of 3Q. And what's the comfortable balance there you guys are willing to keep at the corporate level?
David Kieske: So the one thing we want to point out is that we also have $320 million of short term investments. Those are just simply from an accounting classifications highly liquid investment grade commercial paper with maturities of 91 to 120 days. So, to the extent that two together, that's the 466 that referenced in my remarks. We have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to fund the two pending transactions. As we think about our cash needs on a go forward basis, probably in the $75 million to $100 million range. We want to make sure we get enough cash to cover the next quarter's dividends. We have very little working capital needs. But we want to make sure we're able to continue to fund our dividend and with free cash flow that we generate from our low payout ratio also allows us to be well covered.
Carlo Santarelli: And then just if I may one follow up. As it pertains to you know, obviously, some of the changes that are taking place at Caesars. When you think about the potential for them to be doing M&A on the buy side, going forward. Does any of the decision making there or anything you could potentially be partnering on. Do you believe there might be a little bit of a lag in that right now until things are more settled?
Ed Pitoniak: Only time will tell, Carlo. Again, we have a lot of confidence in the Caesars' board. We have a lot of confidence in the Caesars' management team. I think what you heard yesterday was a continuing commitment to growth over time and very good results. One thing I just want to highlight that Caesars reported yesterday that probably didn't get the attention it deserves is the continuing guest satisfaction improvement that Caesars' continues to generate in terms of net promoter scores and customer service scores. And as real estate and hospitality people with hospitality backgrounds, I put a lot of stock in how happy a tenants customers' are and whenever you have improving happiness, you have a company that has improving prospects. And I think that has implications on how they grow in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sean Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hello, Sean Kelly, is your line on mute?
Unidentified Analyst: This is Ally on for Sean. I know you guys in your prepared remarks mentioned interest is growing in Vegas. Just wondering are there any other regional markets that you think seem appealing right now or ones that maybe you're currently in, and would be interested in expanding in?
John Payne: We continue to look at all opportunities. We’ve talked about expanding our footprint in Vegas, not only on the strip but there was an opportunity to get into the local market there. We like that business. That business continues to grow. We like what we’re seeing. In the Reno market, which we already have an asset there as well and then there is some other regional markets that continue to show great strength and growth in some regional markets that we just aren’t in that we think would continue to diversify our portfolio with assets came for sale, we would be very interested in those assets as well. So that’s a short answer but hitting all the markets we think there is still opportunity for us to look at all of them.
Ed Pitoniak: And maybe just add onto John's comment on a day when we obviously saw very positive jobs support and moreover very positive wage growth, so much of that increased economic vitality is taking place out in the regions and we feel is going to mean good things for regional operators within years to come here.
Operator: Your next question is from Komal Patel with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Komal Patel: Just a couple of quick follow ups. What’s your appetite on taking on larger transactions or potentially multiple properties at once, especially considering the pace of M&A so far has been fairly measured?
Ed Pitoniak: Ken, I think because a lot of that obviously has to do I think the underlying question really has to do with our confidence and our ability to effectively fund larger transactions. I will turn it over to David.
David Kieske : I mean as a basis of any acquisition, it has to be accretive day one for us. And we would not shy away from larger portfolios, just because they are larger. We feel that we have good access to both the debt markets and the equity markets as needed to potentially acquire larger acquisitions if they were accretive, if they made sense with our portfolio diversification and our tenant diversification. So, John has alluded to, there is a lot going on out there and we’re not shying away from anything just frankly given the size.
Komal Patel: Yes, that was actually the direction I was going in, so as a follow up. Is there a level of leverage that you think could be just too high and that would contribute you guys considering using equity for a transaction. Is it something in the six range, 6.5 range something higher than that, that could frame how you think about these potential transactions?
David Kieske : As we’ve talked about, Komal, and as Ed alluded to in some of his opening the remarks, they emergence we are at 8.4 times debt to EBITDA, we are 5.0 times on a net basis today. And we are going to be very discipline in keeping our leverage in the low fives, it's 5 to 5.5 times. There may be times when it picks up slightly north of 5.5 times but we would be hard pressed to ever get 6 times debt to EBITDA range. So we want to be measured and disciplined to make sure we can grow the portfolio accretively and we want to work to acquire assets or portfolios on a leverage neutral basis.
Komal Patel: And then just one last one for me, in an effort to be more aggressive on M&A deals given the landscape. Would you consider using the TRS structure for operating rights if an attractive property comes up, something like one of your public peers recently did? Or do you think that doesn't quite align with your risk appetite?
Ed Pitoniak: I don't think we ever rule it out if it made sense at a given time to do so. I would say generally though, again, we take very seriously as we obviously have to the fact that we're a REIT. And we believe that equity capital invest in us as a REIT in order to receive the distributions it does in the most tax effective way possible from the source income. So again, we wouldn't rule it out but we would always look to see the degree to which we can take any dollar of income that our Company generates and turn it over to our investors in the most tax effective way possible.
Operator: Your next question is from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead, your line is open.
John DeCree: I think you've touched on pretty much all of my questions, but maybe just a housekeeping item, if I missed it in the prepared remarks. Do you have updated timing or time range on the acquisitions of Harrah's and Margaritaville?
David Kieske : As we mentioned, we hope to have everything wrapped up by the end of the year, as Penn guided, similar timing on there in Margaritaville -- on their call in Margaritaville. We’re just working through some final regulatory and loan consent processes on both of those transactions.
John DeCree: And then just to say high level. We've talked a little bit about the M&A environment and your appetite in different parts, but maybe to ask a question a little differently other than obviously ensuring the next deal that you do is economic and value accretive. Are there other strategic priorities in terms of tenant diversity or things that you might be looking for as you scale the M&A environment?
Ed Pitoniak: We’re obviously always going to value tenant diversity. And tenant diversity is not necessarily just an end unto itself. Tenant diversity is a means of getting more exposure to more markets, more operating practices more end user end customer relationships. So again, that will always be a big part of what we're doing. But again it will have more to do at the end of the day with the quality of the market we're buying into, the quality of the asset in that market and the operators' relationship to its end customers. And if that that yields us more and more tenants, we’ll obviously be very happy to have achieve that.
Operator: Your next question is from R.J. Milligan with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
R.J. Milligan: Most of my questions have been asked. I'm curious though as you're having increased discussions for the smaller portfolios or single assets. Is there any change in what sellers are expecting in terms of economics or where you're selling the rents? Just curious how those negotiations have changed possibly from larger deals to smaller deals?
John Payne: Not really change from larger to smaller. I'd answer that question -- it really depends on the operator that we're talking to. As you can imagine, there are different goals and objectives depending on the operator, the property, but it has not changed at all in the recent times. So it's been quite stable. We'll continue to watch. It's been quite active as we've talked about but it really comes down to what is the seller trying to achieve with a possible deal.
Ed Pitoniak: And R. J., maybe just to add a little bit to that. I mean, we -- the big gaming operators, especially the public gaming operators, they’ve come through a wild couple of months here. Post the Q2 earnings announcements, a number of them have seen their stocks get hit pretty hard. And it was all so quick, so volatile, so violet really that I don’t think anybody was able to just rise above that and go okay now we certainly have to re-price everything, because I think the greater sense was what the heck was going on. And only time we'll tell if this was an air pocket that everybody is going to quickly recover from, or if it's something longer-term in nature. We think given the Q3 results you’re seeing from just about every operator out there that there was a wild over-reaction in terms of how the gaming stocks performed over these last two months. And we’ll really find here pretty quickly in equilibrium that as based upon the fundamentally strong performance that they are all showing.
R.J. Milligan: And when we do hit that equilibrium, which we would anticipate greater velocity in terms of M&A and/or the selling of real estate?
Ed Pitoniak: I don’t know if the velocity is necessarily going to pick up. But I think there will be commitment obviously -- or very much flow to the conversations around these potential transactions and a recognition that these transactions do take time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Daniel Adam with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Adam: Just one quick follow up. Can you remind us what the expected AFFO per share accretion is from Harrah's Philadelphia and Margaritaville? And do you intend to update 4Q and 2018 guidance once those deals close? Thanks.
David Kieske : Dan, our follow through would be to update guidance once those deals do close. And just as a reminder, Harrah's Philadelphia would generate $21 million of annual rents and Margaritaville will generate about $23 million of annual rents. So you can do the math on that and I appreciate the outstanding and what that adds to really a full year 2019 in terms of AFFO per share growth, which we think once we get these closed, our shareholders would benefit from a full year of having those acquisitions in our portfolio. So we’re excited about what 2019 brings.
Ed Pitoniak: And maybe just to retake the obvious, because they are being paid for with the cash on hand the $400 million plus of cash that David referred to earlier. Obviously, that rent turns into NOI, turns into AFFO with 100% flow through just about.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Ed Pitoniak: Thank you, Kareena. And thanks everybody for your time today. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress when we report our fourth quarter and year-end results. Thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, that this conference call is being recorded today, August 3, 2018. I will now turn the call over to Jacques Cornet with ICR. Please go ahead.
Jacques Cornet: Thank you, Operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2018 earnings release and the supplemental information. The release and the supplemental information can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties' Web site at www.viciproperties.com. Some of management's comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by their use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intend, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, management will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our second quarter 2018 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer of the company. Management will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Jacques, and good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining our second quarter earnings call. Yesterday VICI marked its 300th day since emerging on October 6, 2017. These have been 300 days in which we have worked very hard to live up to our mission to be America's most dynamic experiential REIT. In these first 300 days, we raised $2.4 billion of equity through our $1 billion equity private placement and our $1.4 billion IPO. We refinanced nearly $2 billion of debt from LIBOR plus 350 to LIBOR plus 200. We eliminated over $1.3 billion of debt that bore a weighted average interest of approximately 6.5%. We de-leveraged from 8.4x debt to EBITDA at emergent to net 4.6x debt to EBITDA at quarter end. We announced nearly $2 billion of acquisitions yielding us $166 million of incremental rent at a net blended cap rate of 8.4%. We grew our last Las Vegas exposure by $122 million of annual rent. We announced our agreement to significantly improve our foundational leases to the benefit of both our tenants and ourselves, which will yield us among other things a 100 basis point improvement in our same-store AFFO annual growth rate. We achieved tenant diversity in record time for our gaming REIT with our recent announcement of partnering with Penn Gaming on the Margaritaville acquisition. We announced our first intended dividend increase of 9.5% in just our third quarter of being a dividend paying REIT. And with the additions of Liz Holland and Diana Cantor, we built an independent board which we believe to be one of the strongest and most diversified in the sector. Lastly, as you know, we're always striving to improve upon and increase our level of disclosures to match those expected of the best-in-class REIT. Towards that goal, this quarter we have introduced our quarterly supplemental. We hope you will find it useful as we continue to update it and improve it in the quarters to come. With this, looked at as a body of work after 300 days, the dynamism our mission calls for. And this dynamism ultimately is about relentlessly creating shareholder value. All our growth these first 300 days is the result of the best-in-class transaction practice that John Payne, our President and COO is building. I'll now turn things over to John so that you can hear from him about the great work he and his team are doing. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. As you can tell by the number of transactions announced by us in the gaming REIT sector more broadly over the past few months, the market environment for gaming transactions continues to be quite active. We view these transactions and the accretive value they've created for shareholders as a testament to the growing confidence in the gaming REIT model. As Ed touched on, we announced three asset acquisitions this quarter. We reconsolidated all of Caesars Palace real estate by acquiring the 668-room Octavius tower, which had been carved out from the rest of the property many years back in a financing related transaction. This acquisition represented a logical step for us not only in that it consolidates our ownership of Caesars Palace, but it also increased our exposure on the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The Las Vegas Strip holds some of the most valuable, sought-after real estate in the world, and we have managed to increase our Strip exposure significantly, adding $122 million in rent since formation with the acquisition of Harrah's Las Vegas and the Octavius Tower. We also announced the acquisition of Harrah's Philadelphia and with it our entrance into the Philadelphia market, the seventh largest gaming market in the U.S. We continue to expect that transaction to close during the fourth quarter of 2018 and when it does, we will diversify our rental income geographically by adding $21 million in rent from that asset and execute on the agreed upon lease modifications associated with the Philadelphia and Octavius acquisitions as Ed already highlighted. Upon closing these transactions, we'll collectively add $56 million of NOI to our portfolio. An attractive net cap rate of 9.5%. Also during the quarter on June 19th, we announced our partnership with Penn National to acquire Margaritaville Resort Casino in Bossier City, Louisiana for implied cap rate of 8.9%. We continue to expect that transaction to close during the second half of 2018. And when it does, VICI will lease to Penn the operations of the property for an initial annual rent of approximately $23 million. As the newest gaming property to open in the Bossier Street market in over a decade, Margaritaville complements VICI's existing footprint in the region. In addition, and as importantly, with this transaction, we've added Penn National to our tenant roster. Penn is a very high quality tenant that is set to become the largest regional gaming operator in the U.S. following the completion of the announced acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment for $2.8 billion. We look forward to working with Penn and expanding our relationship in the quarters and years ahead. As you have heard, this has been a very active quarter for us in putting your capital to work. What has been and continues to be a principal key to our success is our understanding of the tenant underlying business, and our focus on executing what we consider fair deals, meaning, deals that are mutually beneficial to both the OpCo and VICI. We continue to be active in dialogs and scouting for opportunities and we look forward to providing more updates in the future. With that, I will turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Yesterday, we reported total AFFO of $128.8 million or $0.35 per share for the second quarter. Our earnings for the quarter reflect revenue of $221 million which was comprised of $213.5 million from our real property business and $7.5 million from our golf business. Real property business revenue was comprised of $182.3 million of income from direct financing leases, $12.2 million of income from operating leases and $18.9 million of property taxes paid by our tenants. Our income from direct financing leases includes a $13.2 million net change to our investments in direct financing leases, which is non-cash item. After adjusting for the non-controlling interest attributable to Joliet our portion of the DFL that is deducted from net income to calculate AFFO is $12.9 million. On the cost side, our general administrative costs were $7.2 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we continue to incur startup and transition related costs, which we expect to continue into the third quarter as we work towards a steady state run rate for G&A. During the second quarter, we had two nonrecurring items that totaled approximately $1 million related to recruiting and relocation costs associated with the transition from Las Vegas to New York as well as legal and advisory costs associated with the S-11 we filed in May in connection with the December private placement. Our AFFO does include these one-time items in the quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with just over $980 million of cash in short term investments, excluding $13.8 million of restricted cash. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed the acquisition of Octavius Tower for $507.5 million using cash on the balance sheet. In addition, we expect to use cash on the balance sheet to fund the remaining transactions in our pipeline. We expect a total net cash outflow for Margaritaville, Harrah's Philadelphia, and the $159 million reduction associated with the agreed upon lease modification with Caesars to be $851 million. And as we have mentioned, we expect these transactions to close in the second half of '18. During the quarter, we entered into a five-year interest rate swap with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. This serves to effectively fix the LIBOR component on a portion of our term loan B facility at approximately 2.8% and brings our total fixed rate debt to 86% providing certainty to our interest expense over the next five years. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate including the impact of our interest rate swap of 4.93% and a weighted maturity of approximately six years. We have no debt maturing until 2022. Based on annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA, our net leverage is 4.6x. As we looked upon any potential future growth opportunities, we will continue to remain disciplined and opportunistic in how we use our capital using a balanced approach to capital allocation in order to maintain our low leverage profile. This quarter, we have overseen the smooth transition of all of our accounting functions from Las Vegas to New York and as past of this initiative, we have added some exceptional new hires to our internal accounting and legal teams. And as Ed mentioned, we have enhanced our disclosures and added the supplemental to our IR site as we feel transparency is an attribute of best-in-class REITs. We welcome your feedback on the information as we are always looking to improve and help you understand the durability and consistency of our business. Turning to guidance, we are raising our 2018 guidance expectations to reflect the close of Octavius Tower in the current interest rate environment. Note, our revised guidance does not account for the Harrah's Philadelphia or Margaritaville transactions which we have announced but not yet closed. For 2018, we now expect AFFO per diluted share on a same-store basis to be between $1.43 and $1.44 per share. Finally, regarding the company's dividend policy, with the closing of Octavius Tower, we expect to increase our annual dividend to $1.15 per share from the current annual amount of $1.05. This represents a 9.5% increase in an applied annual -- an applied quarterly dividend rate of $0.2875. This increase was expected to be reflected on our next quarterly dividend declaration for the third quarter. Before we open up the call to Q&A, I'd like to turn the call back to Ed for some final remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines to Q&A, we'd like to address what we expect may be on the minds of some and that's the issue of what the second half of 2018 may look like for Las Vegas Strip properties. In the starting point and at the risk of stating the boldly obvious, we are a triple net REIT with rent streams that are fixed for now and grow in the years to come thanks to preordained escalators. We will collect the same amount of rent from our Strip properties in Q3 and Q4 2018 whether our tenant is up, down or sideways over the short-term period. Over the long-term, we believe very strongly in the health of the Las Vegas Strip given economic health, cultural trends, the outlook for low supply growth and continuing innovations in destination marketing and destination experiences from a great operator like Caesars. We would note that regional gaming markets posted growth in June of 5.7%, one of the highest year-over-year growth percentages in recent regional gaming history and we see a growing regional propensity to game as a longer term positive for Las Vegas. At the same time, because of the relative current outperformance of regional gaming versus Las Vegas, it's a good time to be geographically diversified and that's true of both VICI and our tenant Caesars. Finally, we would also point, by comparison, to the reaction of the debt markets to this recent gaming sector news flow. And it's pretty safe to say the gaming debt investors have shrugged this off as a short-term issue in a gaming sector that otherwise has very strong balance sheets and operating prospects. To sum up, as a triple net REIT with irreplaceable beachfront properties and a market leading tenant, we are very excited about being invested in a sector that for a long time to come will produce strong free cash flows for both the tenant and the landlord. And with that, Operator, we will open up the lines to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Ed, can you just talk about your pipeline for acquisitions away from Caesars? I'm curious about the depths [ph] and maybe pricing of the opportunities you're seeing out there?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, thank you, Jeff, and I will actually turn that question over to John.
A - John Payn: Yes, good morning. It's been a very active time as we talked about in our results and it continues to be an active time looking into the rest of 2018 studying opportunities all throughout the market, whether that's regional, whether that's in the national phase as well. So it's been -- continues to be good. We're out there. Obviously, as Ed mentioned, we're 300 days old. So we've been spending a lot of our time introducing ourselves to other OpCos and you can see we did our first deal already with Penn and we hope to continue to diversify our tenant as we look at other opportunities to acquire assets.
Edward Pitoniak: Jeff, I was just going to add to that that as with any transaction marketplace, the more active a marketplace becomes and the more datapoints get established the greater the confidence that the market participants tend to have in transacting. And we would just point to the fact that the last six months have obviously involved more transaction activity than the sector had seen in pretty much the prior four years.
Jeff Donnelly: And beyond casinos, maybe you're not at that point yet, but are you seeing other opportunities maybe outside of the gaming space such as play space entertainment or have you not really looked closely at that yet?
Edward Pitoniak: To be honest with you, Jeff, we haven't looked closely at it yet, but we have positioned ourselves from the beginning as an experiential leisure and hospitality REIT. And we're obviously paying attention to where the culture is going and how people are spending leisure time and leisure spending. And we're looking certainly at all of those areas that have the attributes that we like most about gaming, which starts with experiential complexity, giving the operator more leverage to pull to incremental guest experiences, delight, and contribution. So we're certainly investigating those areas, but for the time being we are very, very excited about the growth opportunities within gaming.
Jeff Donnelly: And just one last one for me, they say always in the hotel sector that more supply is ultimately a negative for all price points in a given hotel market. How do you think about the deregulation of sports gambling, how does that change your perception of the value of the existing regional gaming facilities? Do you think it ultimately has an impact or you think it's kind of a non-event?
Edward Pitoniak: We actually think it has a positive impact. And John can add some more color around what we believe will be the benefit to brick-and-mortar.
John Payne: Yes, we really like it. We think it's going to be a great attractor of new guests to the facility that we have depending on how each state passes the laws. As you can see as states come online each state is kind of implementing or is implementing a different way of brining sports betting to life. But we're being positive on this that it's going to be good for the bricks and mortar casinos that we have in the regional markets.
Jeff Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys.
John Payne: Yes, thank you.
Edward Pitoniak: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Citi. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks. This is [indiscernible]. Can you guys comment on the progress Caesars is making with [indiscernible] in New Orleans?
John Payne: I can take that, Ed. Was the question, you broke up a little bit, was regarding New Orleans and the operating contact extension?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
John Payne: Yes, as you know, just to levels set, we've got an optional on that property that will last five years from our date of formation, which is October, 2017. So we roughly have about four more years while that option -- as you saw, Caesars worked to have a deal with the State of Louisiana to extend their operating contract and work with the state and city and just couldn't come to a conclusion this first time. I believe over the time that our option is good that there will be an opportunity for us to acquire that asset as an extension of the operating contact happens. There's still work to be done. I know it's important -- the tenant important to Caesars to work on this. And as we get more information we'll share that with you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then can you give us some details on the acquisition process for the Margaritaville, Bossier, and how competitive that process was?
John Payne: Sure. It was a competitive process. We were obviously studied that asset. We know the market well or as a team having personally operated in that market for over a decade where the asset, and being the newest asset and the success of that team in Bossier, so -- and we really like the real estate where it's at with the ability to expand. We also have been clear, since the beginning of formation of our company that we were going to work to diversify our tenant. This was an opportunity to diversify and do a deal with Penn. We've known Penn and Tim Wilmott and Jay Snowden for decades as we worked together back in the day of Harrah's. And we think they're great operators. And this was an opportunity to acquire the real estate of Margaritaville, and do a partnership with Penn with them being tenant. It was quite competitive. We had a competitive bid. I think the sellers thought we put together a great team, and we're able to transact on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, everyone. Good morning. John, this one's probably best for you. If you think about where you are today as you debate the call option properties relative to the environment that you're seeing out there for M&A outside of Caesars, how would you say that that dynamic has changed since, call it, three to six months ago?
John Payne: Yes, a very good question. And I'll touch on it, and if David and Ed want to jump in they can. I think we've been clear with our call option since the day we were formed that we see it as a kind of back-of-the-pocket growth opportunities that we'll execute if there's a time where there aren't a lot of other opportunities to acquire assets in the market. I would tell you, I'm busier than I've ever been. And out on the road, and again, as a little bit as a the new team in town I'm out on the road making sure everyone knows who we are and how we think about deals differently than the other two in the space, and so that takes up some time. But there are active deals going on. And we want to be involved, and particularly as we look to diversify where our properties are, and it's quite active. Now, compared to the last six months, I think it's been pretty consistent, which we've been pretty vocal that it's been active. So it hasn't decreased one bit or it hasn't decelerated I guess the way I would say. And it's been consistently good. And we'll see if their transactions can be concluded. Ed, David, anything that I've missed that you want to touch on?
Edward Pitoniak: John, I would just add, and good morning Carlo. I would just add that obviously when it comes to the call properties, Carlo, we've got another four-and-a-half years. We can control the timing of when we execute on those very accretive opportunities at the preordained tenant caps, which we can call them. On the other hand, obviously we cannot control the timing of assets that come to market and whether in auction format or in a -- perhaps a direct reproach to us. So we will prioritize acting on those that are right in front of us, and leave the call properties uncalled if there are those compelling opportunities right in front of us.
Carlo Santarelli: That's super helpful guys, thank you very much.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, it's Stephen. You called out the very strong regional trends at a moment when Vegas commentary has been a bit lighter. How do you generally think about crossover and customer bases across the regional and Las Vegas properties, or asked more directly, are regionals gaining share at the expense of Las Vegas.
Edward Pitoniak: Great question, Stephen. John is best equipped, with his 23 years in the business, to answer that one.
John Payne: Yes, a very good question. Probably a better question for the operators, but I'll put back on my operating hat and give you my thoughts on this. I think you'll go all the way back, Stephen, when Vegas started booming or the regionals started growing. There was a thought that these regional gaming would take away from Las Vegas, which has been the exact opposite, because as the regionals were growing it was creating more customers that could take destination trips to Las Vegas. And Las Vegas did an awesome job of creating reasons for those regional customers. Operators like MGM and Caesars obviously have perfected hub and spoke system where they tie in their loyalty programs, and it's worked well. As it pertains to the regional business, I mean it's exciting. I spent the majority of my career running the regional businesses, and I can't think of the time where halfway through the year the business, I think the last that I saw, Stephen, was that the regional businesses across all of it was up almost 5%, which is really exciting to see. And as we talked earlier on this call, I think that adding sports betting to many of these markets will just continue to attract newer customers and more customers to the facilities. I do not think, and this is one man's opinion and my opinion, that the growth of the regional is taken away from Las Vegas one bit. I think that as you continue to grow the regional Las Vegas will be a place that these customers will want to visit. And if you're a company like our main tenant, Caesars, which has a strong hub and spoke system you'll see customers continue to flow in to their destination markets. And we obviously have two properties in Las Vegas; we have properties in Lake Tahoe which also get helped by the growth of the regional business. So I think it's great to see the top line growth in the regions. And really, you're seeing some top line growth in Las Vegas as well.
Edward Pitoniak: And John, maybe you could just add that the way in which a total rewards customers' increased activity the regionals are seeing will obviously improve their status in ways that may lead to Vegas trips, correct?
John Payne: Yes, absolutely. And Stephen is probably aware of the connectivity of the loyalty programs, that when you're a top customer in these regional markets, you're a top customer when you walk in the doors of Caesars Palace. And that's a big deal, and it continues to flow back and forth. And again, I think it's a big part of why we're so confident, and our tenant continuing to grow in both the regions and also long-term in Las Vegas.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, how do you generally think about the impact of digital or online gaming, if that follows sports betting in a bigger way as the next leg of regulation?
John Payne: Yes, it's something that they continue to have to study. But I think as gambling in general becomes more, I say normalized. I mean when a deal with the NBA is done with a gaming company -- 10 years ago; I'm not sure anyone would ever thought that. So I think the normalization of gaming and the acceptance of gaming in all forms is going to continue to be good, not only for as you're talking about eventually an internet business and those type of things, but really for the bricks and mortars, and we've see that through the history. It's also a different customer. We don't need to go into extensive detail on that. But I think that it all complements itself. And we'll see how it ultimately plays out in these states.
Stephen Grambling: Awesome. Thanks so much.
John Payne: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Hi everyone, good morning. I just wanted to ask quickly about the dividend bump, just to make sure. So I think you raised it, and if I caught it correctly, by 9.5%. Does that include -- I mean, obviously a lot of that is for the acquisition activity. But does that include any change for or slight tweak to your kind of targeted payout ratio?
David Kieske: Shaun, no you're spot on. We increased our ramp by $35 million on an annual basis. We are buying [indiscernible] with all cash. And cash was obviously raised in the IPO. So we're essentially giving the full increase back to our shareholders by increasing the targeted annual dividend. It does not change any of our payouts, still is in line with where we were before, and in like with kind of how we've modeled out the company going forward.
Shaun Kelley: Great. That's all I have. Thank you very much.
David Kieske: Thanks, Shaun.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Pace with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Pace: Hi, guys. Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but one for David, David you talked earlier. I think you mentioned a leverage number of -- I thought you said 4.6 times. So I just want to understand, is that a net number, is that fully pro forma for the cash that's leaving the system in the second-half and the EBITDA that's coming in? And then bigger picture, I believe you wanted to run balance sheet leverage a little bit higher in the five to five-and-a-half times range longer-term, so correct me if I got that wrong. And would that imply for future acquisitions they would be more debt financed than equity financed? Thank you.
David Kieske: Hey, Mike, good to hear from you. The 4.6 net number is as of 6.30, that includes also the cash on the balance sheet at that time. We did close Octavius on July 11th, so cash left the system and cash will level the system, the net $851 million in total for the three assets that we acquired, offset by the lease modification payment. So the pro forma for that, we remain in the low to mid five after utilizing that cash. So our leverage profile and our leverage target does not change going forward. We still intend to run the balance sheet in kind of mid to low fives. And as we assessed each acquisitions it would have to be based on market conditions, and kind of a balance between equity and debt-financed, and market dependant to some extent.
Michael Pace: Great, thank you.
David Kieske: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open.
John DeCree: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a high level, I guess, question/observation that I want to get your thoughts on, Ed or maybe John. As we see the -- we've talked quite a bit about elevated M&A activity in the sector. And coming from both sides, both the REITs, like yourself, and the operators looking to get bigger. As we think about consolidation and there becomes potentially fewer operators in the sector, how do you think about needing to find, similar to what you did with Penn, more operators as there presumably is becoming less fragmented in the industry?
Edward Pitoniak: Sorry, just so we make sure we understand your question correctly, John, are you asking if we're concerned that operator count will decline, and it will make it harder to achieve tenant diversity or…
John DeCree: That's part of the question, as well as just partnering with the OpCos, has there become less of them? Is it important to get a foot in the door with more and more OpCos as you go forward?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes, absolutely. That is their aim. And we certainly believe they've got a strategy to develop more relationships. And certainly we've got, John, an ability to develop the relationships that we believe will yield to deal-flow and ultimately to tenant diversity. Now, I'll turn it over to John to add more color on that.
John Payne: Yes, John, great observation. And it's exactly what has been -- we've been executing our game plan since we started 300 days ago is getting out to make sure all the OpCos in the space, no matter the size, location, where they're assets are, understand who we are. And should they look to be doing transactions to make sure VICI is top of mind, and we get in the door and talking to them. So obviously you know this well, the Penn and Pinnacle transaction is most likely going to close by the end of the year to create the U.S.'s largest regional gaming company, and we're out there, not only meeting with them, obviously when we did the Margaritaville deal. But everyone else that's out there to understand us and over time diversify our tenant mix.
Edward Pitoniak: And John, if I could just add, John, as you know, I have worked across multiple leisure and hospitality sectors. I've worked in ski resorts, beach resorts, desert resorts; I've worked in urban hotels, suburban, airport, every category you can imagine, with all kinds of different operators and management companies. And I get really excited about doing more and more business with more and more gaming operators because I firmly believe, as some of you've heard me talk about, the gaming operators are the best leisure and hospitality operators on earth. When it comes to managing ultimately what the guest experiences, which is the guest experience of time and space. And nobody, but nobody on earth, I believe is more innovative and rigorous and expert at managing the guest experience, time, and space than gaming operators are. And the more business we can do with more operators the more excited we get.
John DeCree: Thanks, guys, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up to get your thoughts on the notion that, are you seeing in the environment from sellers, that the smaller or single-asset sellers are preferring to look for an entire exit, and essentially divest -- get the best valuation. But do they want to get out completely or are you seeing that some may want to stay as even though they're smaller, as OpCos, and stay behind?
John Payne: Yes, John, we're seeing both actually in this space right now. And I think we've communicated to most OpCos we're quite flexible in the type of deals that we can do, assuring that they're fair, that they work for that OpCo and they work for us. But we are seeing both. We're seeing operators that want to exit and have discussions about that, and operators that are looking to monetize their real estate to use for future growth and remain as the operator.
John DeCree: Great. Thanks for the extra color, guys, appreciate it.
John Payne: Absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Kayler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
James Kayler: Hey guys, how are you doing?
David Kieske: Good, James. Good to hear from you.
James Kayler: Good. Just one quick follow-up on the balance sheet, obviously you don't have any near-term maturities from a credit perspective, and the 8% bonds don't become callable until 2020. Is there any thinking or any analysis around whether it would make sense to refinance those earlier just to take advantage of lower potential rates? And if you could just sort of -- how are you thinking about that potential?
David Kieske: Yes, James, it's a fair question and something that we look at regularly. They're trading, you've probably got a screen in front of you, that they're trading $1.10, $1.11, $1.12 somewhere in that area. So right now the MPV analysis just doesn't make sense for us to take that earlier, but it is something we monitor because we know that's a lever we can pull to reduce our cost of capital here something we're highly focused on.
James Kayler: Excellent, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Komal Patel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Komal Patel: Hi, thanks for the question. Just really quickly, have you heard any conversations recently with the rating agencies? You've certainly shown growth and an ability to get some deal done since the initial ratings came out, especially with the start of diversifying your operators with the Penn deal, which I think is kind of an important part to the ratings as well, so, just any update or conversations reflecting your recent action?
Edward Pitoniak: Hi, Komal. That's a good question. We spoke to the agencies in the spring and we will update them here in the fall in kind of our latest events and transactions once we get closer to closing the Margaritaville and diversifying our tenant base with Penn.
Komal Patel: Okay. So, no update at the moment?
Edward Pitoniak: No, nothing at the moment.
Komal Patel: Okay, fair enough. Thank you so much.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you. Thank you, Operator. In closing, we at VICI have made tremendous progress during the second quarter as we continue to execute on our strategy. We have no plans of slowing down. I believe we remain well-positioned to grow portfolio and drive superior shareholder value. Thank you again for your time today. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress when we report our third quarter results. Thank you, Operator.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-04 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jacques Cornet - Investor Relations Edward Pitoniak - Chief Executive Officer John Payne - President and Chief Operating Officer David Kieske - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Michael Pace - JPMorgan Chase & Co. Komal Patel - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties’ First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, that this conference call is being recorded today, May 4, 2018. I will now turn the call over to Jacques Cornet with ICR. Please go ahead.
Jacques Cornet: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the Company's first quarter 2018 earnings release. The release can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties’ website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of management's comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by their use of words such as will, expect, should or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the Company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, management will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our first quarter 2018 earnings release. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Management will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Jacques, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second earnings call as a Publicly Traded Company and the first earnings call reporting a full calendar quarter. Today is day 210 since our emergence on October 6, 2017 and we continue to execute on our mission to be America's most dynamic leisure and hospitality experiential real estate company. The highlight of our first quarter was our successful IPO on January 31 in which we raised $1.4 billion, delevering our balance sheet, improving our liquidity, and greatly expanding our shareholder base. We were also pleased to announce our first dividend in March, and we look forward to continuing to deliver these distributions as the key part of our total return package to investors. David will provide more details on the results, but we ended the quarter with just about $1.3 billion in dry powder available for growth initiatives. We remain hard at work, focused on prospects to advance our strategy around our four key pillars of value: portfolio, tenant, capital stewardship, and our governance and independence. Our pipeline of growth opportunities is healthy. We have three call option properties, which we can take down at our discretion at a 10% cap at any time between now and October 2022. Our relationship with Caesars remains very strong and we continue to work on mutually beneficial opportunities together. And with John leading the charge, we are hard at work developing relationships with other asset operators in the industry. We do not expect that our dry powder will sit idle for any extended period of time and we remain confident in our ability to deploy your capital strategically and in an accretive and in a timely manner. We're all going to ask what inning is it. We can have a healthy debate about what inning the overall REIT sector maybe in, but what about gaming REITs? What inning are REITs in? Let’s start with the fact that the gaming REIT sector is still less than five years old. During that period, there have been two major portfolio trades and five single asset trades that were not renegotiated or otherwise contractually dropped down from the tenants. But what we should all know is that in recent months, the pace of activity has picked up. Market participants, both buyers and sellers, are gaining more confidence than the liquid market is truly developing. We believe this confidence will be key to generating further deal flow as would be the case in any sector. Turning values may trend higher or against the current backdrop of rising interest rates, they may not. In either case, when it comes to the issue of trading values being higher or not, we ask the question, compared to what? When we purchased Harrah's Las Vegas in December, that is $87 million of NOI; we brought that income at 7.7% cap rate. We know of no other real estate sector in which that kind of quality, scale and durability of income can be brought in anywhere near that kind of cap rate. At VICI, we're very confident that we are establishing a real estate transactional practice at truly institutional quality. We worked hard to develop our growth strategy, our acquisition criteria and our relationships with asset controllers and transaction advisors. And thanks to our successful IPO, we have established a cool capital to fund our growth activities for the foreseeable future. That growth capital belongs of course to our shareholders and we will deploy it with great care and great discipline. As a REIT management team, we will be judged as we should be by the quality of our capital allocation. When I answered the original question, what inning is it? Being less than five years old, we say the gaming REIT sector is no later than its third innings and we, VICI, being barely 200 days old are, by definitions in our first inning. We are very, very excited to be in the batter spot. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on the current market environment. John?
John Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. As many of you are aware, the market environment for gaming transaction is quite active. The announced trades in the sector by us and our peers over the last six months are a testament to the growing confidence in the gaming REIT model. At VICI the opportunities that we are currently assessing and the conversation that we're having continue to indicate that our growth trajectory is not going to slow down. We believe the key ingredients to this has been our governance, our keen understanding of the tenant underlying business, and our focus on executing what we consider fair deals or deals that are mutually beneficial to both the OpCo and VICI. We are very active on several opportunities and ask that you stay tune as we look forward to providing updates in the future. With that, I will turn the call over David, who will discuss our financial results.
David Kieske: Thanks, John. Yesterday, we’ve reported AFFO of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. Our earnings for the quarter reflect revenue of $218.3 million, which was comprised of $211.5 million from our real property business and $6.8 million from our golf business. Real property business revenue was comprised of $182 million of earned income from direct financing leases, $4.2 million of rental income from operating leases, and $17.2 million of property taxes paid by our tenants on the leased properties. Our earned income from direct financing leases for the quarter includes a $12.9 million net change to our investment and direct financing leases, which is a non-cash item. On the cost side, our general and administrative costs were $7.3 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we continue to incurred startup in transition related costs, which we expect to continue for the next quarter or two as we work towards the steady state run rate for G&A. Our first quarter G&A includes three items to note. First, $500,000 of severance costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Las Vegas to New York. Second, approximately $600,000 in one-time legal professional and consulting costs associated with non-recurring board advisory work. And finally, $300,000 in recruiting cost as we continue to build out our team. Our adjusted funds from operations includes these items and for the quarter was $125 million and $0.36 per share. Turning to our balance sheet. With the completion of our IPO on February 5, we ended the quarter with just over $980 million of cash, including $13.8 million of restricted cash. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $4.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%, and a weighted average maturity of approximately six years. We have no debt maturity until 2022. Based on annualized first quarter results, our gross leverage to adjusted EBITDA is 5.9 times and our net leverage to adjusted EBITDA is 4.6 times. Our cash balance along with $400 million of availability under our revolving credit facility gives us approximately $1.3 billion of dry powder to execute on our growth strategy. Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with a syndicates of financial institutions and counterparties. The transactions have an aggregate notional amount of $1.5 billion, with an effective date of May 22, 2018 and a termination date of April 22, 2023. These transactions served to fix the LIBOR portion of our Term Loan B at approximately 2.8% and brings our total fixed rate debt to approximately 86% of our total debt, providing clarity to our interest expense over the next five years. Turning to guidance, we expect 2018 AFFO per diluted share on a same-store basis to be between $1.39 and $1.41 per share. We assume a fully diluted weighted-average share count of 364 million shares outstanding at year-end, which reflects the impact of our IPO in February. On March 15, we announced our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, the dividend was prorated for the period commencing upon the closing of our IPO in February 5, and ending on March 31, based on an annual distribution rate of $1.5 per share. The dividend was paid on April 13. With that, we’d be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I do have one question from Mike Pace from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Pace: Hi, guys. Thank you. Just to clarify a couple of comments that you said. Ed, earlier and maybe to go back to your baseball analogy, you said that you guys are very active on several opportunities, and I'm wondering, are these opportunities should we think of those in terms of singles or doubles or something maybe of the larger scale?
Edward Pitoniak: Yes. It’s a great question, Mike, and good morning. We always wants to grow in a sustainable way over time, and as we deliver total return to our shareholders made up of dividend, same-store growth and accretive acquisition growth. We believe we can be very successful knocking out singles and doubles. If those are accretive, if they're going to give us really good risk adjusted return. And the thing we probably emphasize and maybe goes without saying, especially it’s a triple-net REIT. Our deals need to be accretive going in. This is not like I should say, the sector I used to be in the hotel sector where you could underwrite a dilutive going in yield that asset managed or property managed or revenue or yield managed your way to accretion – an accretive running yield over time. So we’re going to be careful. We’re going to be discipline. We’re going to be diligent. Where there are straight singles and doubles to be achieved, we’re going to achieve those and we see opportunities in greater magnitude. As long as accretive, as long as risk adjusted return over time is good and we will certainly focus on those as well.
Michael Pace: And then also you said it would be unlikely that you would sit on cash for an extended period of time. I'm just wondering, what is an extended period of timing for you guys and maybe just in the context of should we expect that cash balance to be there at year end?
Edward Pitoniak: I would say Mike, we would hope, it obviously would not be in year-end, and yes, we're going to take the time to do the best deals we can for our investors. Again, given the fact that they need to be accretive going in. And when you look across the marketplace, there is really two types of deals that are happening and will happen in the future. One is deals in which the owner of the asset, both the owner and the operator of the asset is looking to exit, right, and those maybe marketed or non-marketed processes as it maybe. The chances are they will look for the highest price. The other category is the category of sale leaseback, where the owner operator will stay in as the operator on a sale leaseback basis. And those relationships that take time to develop, those are relationships that we think can and should form the core of our strategy going forward. And so we're going to obviously look at both, and we're looking at both at this time, and again working very hard to execute deals that will provide very good outcomes with that cash available to us.
Michael Pace: Thanks guys. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Amanda Grambling] from GS. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Bill filling in for Stephen. You mentioned before a deliberate approach to acquiring those call option properties that you have - can you just remind us the puts and takes around exercising those contracts either in the near future or over time?
John Payne: Yes, this is John speaking. So we have three call option, there are five years, we have five years from the date of emergence in October of 2017. They are at 10% cap and 1.67 rent coverage, and we need to get Caesars roughly 60 days notice before we take them there.
Edward Pitoniak: And as long as we have opportunities that are not going to be available over the next five years, we are obviously going to prioritize those opportunities to deploy both our management time and our capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That’s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, your competitors doing deals with different tenants, as the competitive dynamics for VICI as an independent REIT shifted it all?
Edward Pitoniak: No, I mean we think – what we think is happening is that the overall gaming REIT model is being validated by virtue of these deals. We congratulate our colleagues in the sector for getting these deals done. We know that at least one of those deals to the long time suggesting and it’s not surprising that it did with the big complex deal. We really do – again point of the fact that that’s finally over, I would say the last six to nine months, a growing recognition of the role that gaming REIT can play in helping to either finance exits or more over finance growth. And I think what exciting to us is that we are in a period now, we're among other things you're seeing the emergence and what we call super regional, who are focused on growing their portfolios, their operating portfolios, growing their footprints across the U.S., and we believe gaming REITs generally and we would hope VICI specifically can be a provider of long-term growth capital to them as they pursue their growth ambition.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Komal Patel from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Komal Patel: Hi, thanks for the question. So following up the on potential M&A, given your infancy in the REIT market, would you be more focused on markets to have a more established track record, or would newer market such as Massachusetts or even international be an option for you as well?
Edward Pitoniak: I think that markets that have good fundamentals are going to be interesting to us wherever they are. I do think for the time being though, we're excited about the magnitude of opportunities that exit for us within the existing gaming states if you will. And again, we have to make sure the deals we do are accretive going in. The triple net model in and off itself requires that and so far as we can under come that accretion will come in the future. These are going to come at the beginning or frankly – probably wouldn’t come at all. So we will evaluate market carefully. We will then evaluate the assets in the market, and make sure they are good assets that have good fundamental real estate investment characteristics, the exact location and quality of the buildings, envelop the quality of the building systems, and quality of the operator and its competitiveness and its market share. So again, we believe we got a good pipeline of opportunity in the well established gaming state and that’s where we believe we’ll get a highest return on management time for the time being.
Komal Patel: Okay. Thanks. End of Q&A
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.
Edward Pitoniak: Thank you, Michelle. In closing, we at VICI are excited at the rapid progress and continue to make in executing our strategy and we have no plans of slowing down. Our growth pipeline continues to be robust and we believe we are well positioned to grow our portfolio and drive superior shareholder value. Thanks again for your time today. We look forward to providing an update on our continued progress when we report our second quarter results. Again, thank you and good bye.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.
