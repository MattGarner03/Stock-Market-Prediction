===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: My name is Marco, and I'll be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Veralto's Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your program.
Ryan Taylor: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations. A replay of this call will be available until May 9. Yesterday, we issued our first quarter 2025 news release earnings presentation and supplemental materials, including information required by the SEC relating to adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we reaffirmed our full year 2025 earnings per share guidance, which now includes our current assessment of the macroeconomic environment, including tariffs and related countermeasures. These materials are available in the Investors section of our website, for varalto.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are also provided in the appendix of our webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis. On that note, I'd like to point out that year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter of 2025 benefited from 3 additional shipping days as compared to the first quarter of 2024. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining our call today. Before discussing our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our 17,000 associates across the world for their commitment to serving customers, driving continuous improvement and safeguarding the world's most vital resources. As stewards of some of the world's most essential resources, we help ensure billions of people have access to clean water, safe food and trusted essential goods each and every day. Dynamic business environments, such as the one we are currently experiencing, provide us with the opportunity to demonstrate the essential nature of our products the durability of our business model and the power of the Varalto Enterprise system. Our team embraces challenges as opportunities to drive differentiated winning outcomes for our customers associates and shareholders. That mindset has propelled us to a strong start in 2025 and prepared us to navigate this dynamic macroeconomic environment we are facing in the near term. In the first quarter, we delivered excellent results across the enterprise, driven by disciplined execution in both segments. And we are actively deploying several countermeasures to mitigate changes in the global trade and tariff landscape and enhance our operational flexibility. I'm proud of our team and our collective performance thus far in 2025. Looking at the first quarter results in detail, building off the operating momentum generated last year, we delivered 7.8% core sales growth, 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our commercial teams executed on strategic initiatives to gain new customer wins and increased market penetration, while also capitalizing on favorable demand across our key end markets and geographies. Our core sales growth was driven primarily by volume and was broad-based across both segments with PQI delivering 8.3% core sales growth and water quality 4% core sales growth. In PQI, positive trends in consumer packaged goods markets supported growth across all key product categories in our marking and coding business and across our digital workflow solutions and packaging and color. Notably, in our marking and coding business, Q1 marked our fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in both consumables and equipment. In water quality, we continue to drive robust growth of our water treatment solutions in North America complemented by steady growth in water analytics sales globally, including double-digit growth in Europe. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 25% and an all-time high. We expanded operating margin in Bodman with incremental margins in line with our long-term framework driven. By high-quality sales growth and efficient operating leverage, adjusted earnings per share grew 13% year-over-year to $0.95. This exceeded our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected sales volumes. I'm proud of our team's disciplined execution to deliver a high-quality performance in the first quarter in service to our customers. In addition to our strong organic growth performance, we continue to make great progress on recent acquisitions. The integration of TraceGains is on track. Sales are growing in line with our expectations, and we continue to invest in future growth. And in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire AQUAFIDES an Austria-based provider of ultraviolet water treatment for $20 million. AQUAFIDES treatment systems are used in drinking water, wastewater and a variety of industrial applications that require high-purity water, including food and beverage and pharmaceuticals. This is a fantastic addition to our Trojan business. It expands our ability to serve European customers with local engineering support and service, while also expanding our UV treatment portfolio with high-quality, efficient fit-for-purpose solutions. We look forward to welcoming the AQUAFIDES team to Varalto and unlocking new growth opportunities together. Looking at core sales growth by geography and end market, growth was broad-based across key verticals and regions. Our commercial teams executed well, leveraging VES tools and capitalizing on the investments made last year to expand our sales, marketing and innovation efforts. Sales growth in Western Europe was robust at nearly 11% with double-digit growth in both segments. In North America, sales grew approximately 8% with high single-digit growth in both segments. And sales in high-growth markets were up 6% year-over-year with PQI sales up high single digits and water quality up low single digits. Taking a closer look. In Western Europe, water quality grew 11.3%. Our water analytics team in Western Europe continued to deliver exceptional growth through rigorous lead generation, funnel management and VES catalyzed commercial execution. And in PQI, sales into Western Europe grew 10.3%, driven by double-digit growth in packaging and color and high single-digit growth in Marketing & Coating. In packaging and color, we saw strong software growth across most packaging applications, including increased mid-market penetration. This reflects increased focus on account management and fit-for-purpose solutions to accelerate software growth. And in Marketing & Coating, growth was driven across equipment, consumables and spares. Moving to North America. Core sales growth was led by water quality with 8.3% growth. We continue to capitalize on increasing demand for our chemical water treatment solutions, which grew double digits in North America. Our chemical treatment growth was broad-based across several industries with the strongest growth in power generation, food and beverage and chemical processing. And we continue to see growth from new data centers as they become operational. Also, sales of Trojan UV systems to municipalities, primarily related to water reuse contributed to our growth in North America. The economic benefits of water conservation, reclamation and reuse continue to provide opportunities for us to expand our business and support our customers' objectives to efficiently manage their water usage. Over the long term, continued North American growth in water quality is supported by attractive secular trends such as water scarcity, water reuse, more frequent severe weather events and increasing demand from heavy water consumption applications such as data centers and power generation. We also continue to benefit from positive market trends across PQI in North America during the first quarter with core sales up 6.9% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by double-digit growth in recurring revenue, specifically consumables and software. This reflects a combination of improved end market demand from CPG customers, VES driven commercial excellence and market penetration from our strategic initiatives. In high-growth markets, core sales grew 6.1%, highlighted by strong growth in Latin America, India and the Middle East. In China, sales grew low single digits, with strong growth in PQI, partially offset by a decline in water quality sales related to timing of ultraviolet treatment installations, which were strong in Q1 2024. Overall, we delivered strong broad-based growth in the first quarter across all of our operating companies. We believe the essential nature of our products, our durable business model and the secular growth drivers across our end markets position us to create value for our stakeholders over both the short and long term. We remain confident that the Varelto Enterprise system will enable us to navigate ongoing changes in the macroeconomic environment with agility and discipline. In addition to delivering a strong first quarter, we implemented several countermeasures to help mitigate the impact of recent tariff hikes and enhance our operational flexibility. This includes strategic pricing road maps, targeted sourcing and supply chain initiatives and shifts in manufacturing footprint, including the addition of Trojan's first U.S. factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This factory opened in February and is designed to support consumables and light assembly for our domestic UV water treatment customers. This expansion creates greater manufacturing and supply chain flexibility for Trojan to support its U.S. customer base. We leveraged the ES tools to prioritize and accelerate the opening of this facility by about 4 months ahead of schedule to help offset potential tariff headwinds. With greater flexibility and the exemption of product imports covered by the U.S. MCA, our current exposure to Canadian tariffs has been reduced significantly. This is a great example of how well equipped our team is to navigate the current macro environment with focus, agility and speed. And we have several levers to pull to mitigate risk while supporting our customers and maintaining business continuity. Our decentralized operating model empowers our business leaders who are closest to our customers to make decisions quickly. Our diverse global footprint and flexible supply chain give us agility and optionality to maneuver quickly. And our leading market positions, direct sales force and the essential nature of our products give us the ability to be thoughtful with strategic pricing actions. Confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments is, in large part, grounded in the Varalto Enterprise system, our proven system for driving growth, operational improvements and leadership development. A core tenet of VES is continuous improvement or Kaizen. As we do annually in the first quarter each year, we completed Varalto's second CEO Kaizen week in February. CEO Kaizen Week, is a long-standing tradition of our enterprise system and personally one of my favorite weeks of the year. This event is culturally important as it helps us stay close to the businesses and understand both their struggles and opportunities helping to catalyze decision-making and prioritize allocation of capital and resources. For 1 week, we immersed 20 cross-functional teams at Gemba where the real work happens at 10 locations across the world to address our biggest impact operates with the participation of Varalto executives. Building off our success last year, this year's CEO Kaizen Week, was designed to help us accelerate growth and reinforce that at Varalto, we are all practitioners of continuous improvement. Among other opportunities, a few of this year's most strategic and impactful events focused on increasing adoption of packaging and color software within mid-market CPG customers, accelerating capture of design input requirements for new product development in water analytics and reducing lead time for consumables in one of our marking and coding product lines. The benefits of any Kaizen week include immediate solutions that are rapidly implemented and yield real-time results. Success is proven by sustaining these results, which we track following the Kaizen events. That concludes my opening remarks. And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Sameer.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the first quarter. Total sales grew 6.9% on a year-over-year basis to over $1.3 billion. Currency was a 130 basis points or $16 million headwind year-over-year and acquisitions contributed 40 basis points of growth, primarily from TraceGains. Core sales grew 7.8%, led by broad-based volume gains across both segments. Price contributed 1.3% growth in the quarter, in line with historical levels. Our recurring revenue grew high single digits year-over-year and comprised 61% of our total sales. As Ryan mentioned, the first quarter of 2025 had 3 more shipping days as compared to the first quarter of 2024. If we exclude the estimated benefit of those ex days, core sales growth in Q1 was still above 5%, solidly in the mid-single digits and our highest core sales growth quarter since becoming a public company. Gross profit increased 8% year-over-year to $805 million. Gross profit margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 60.4%, primarily driven by volume leverage and to a lesser extent, pricing. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points to 25%, an all-time high. Looking at EPS for Q1, adjusted earnings per share grew 13% year-over-year to $0.95 per share. As compared to our guidance, adjusted EPS came in stronger, primarily due to higher sales volumes at both segments. Looking at cash flow in the first quarter, we generated $142 million of free cash flow, an increase of $40 million year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by the growth in earnings. I'll now cover the segment results, starting with water quality on the next page. Our Water Quality segment delivered $794 million of sales up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was a 130 basis point headwind and divestitures resulted in a modest 10 basis points reduction in sales versus the prior period. Ford sales grew 7.4% year-over-year, including 100 basis points from price and 640 basis points from volume. Water quality's volume growth was driven by strong demand for water treatment solutions in our industrial end markets and UV treatment systems in municipal end markets. We also saw good volume growth in sales of analytical instruments, reagents and chemistries to municipalities. Water Qualities recurring sales grew high single digits year-over-year, and equipment growth was up mid-single digits. Adjusted operating profit increased 7.5% year-over-year to $200 million, and adjusted operating profit margin was 25.2% up 40 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, it was a strong quarter for water quality. We expect to see steady growth over the balance of this year given our products are critical to our customers' ongoing operations and generate high level of recurring sales. Moving on to our PQI segment on the next page. Sales in our PQI segment grew 8.3% year-over-year to $538 million in the first quarter. Currency was a 130 basis point segment. The currency headwinds were offset by 130 basis points of growth from acquisitions primarily trace gains. Store sales grew 8.3%, led by volume growth of 6.7% and price increases contributing 1.6% to core sales growth. CQI's core sales growth was driven by both recurring revenue and equipment shipments. Recurring revenue grew high single digits year-over-year, led by consumables and software. Equipment growth also grew high single digits, led by marking and coating equipment. PQI's adjusted operating profit was $153 million in the first quarter, up $14 million over the prior year period, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 28.4%, an increase of 40 basis points year-over-year. The increased profitability was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on volume growth and to a lesser extent, pricing. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. In the first quarter, we generated $157 million of cash from operations. We invested $15 million in capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow was $142 million in the quarter, up 59% over the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in earnings. At the end of the first quarter, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was over $1.2 billion. Net debt was $1.4 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.1x. Our financial position is very strong and provides us the flexibility to be opportunistic in how we deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value. Having said that, we plan to be prudent and disciplined as we navigate this current economic environment. Over the long term, our goal is to continue to create shareholder value with a bias towards M&A. And we have an attractive pipeline of opportunities in both water quality and PQI. Turning now to our guidance. Yesterday, we reaffirmed that 2025 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.60 per share to $3.70 per share. Our underlying assumptions have been updated to reflect currency rates and current assessment of tariffs and trade policies. Our full year guidance now assumes an estimated gross impact from the announced tariff increases of approximately 3.5% of full year sales on an annualized basis, and we expect our countermeasures to largely offset tariff impacts. For the full year 2025, our year-over-year core sales growth target remains below to mid-single digits consistent with our prior guidance. Furthermore, we expect neutral impact to the full year sales growth from both currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures. We expect sales contributions from TraceGains and AQUAFIDES to be largely offset by the AVT divestiture. We are now assuming corporate expense at about $100 million as we control discretionary spending in light of the macroeconomic environment. Given the impact and timing of tariff increases and related countermeasures, we expanded our target range of adjusted operating profit margin. We are now targeting full year adjusted operating profit margin to be flat to up 50 basis points or approximately 25 basis points expansion at the midpoint. We believe this is prudent given the dynamic macroeconomic landscape. And we are targeting free cash flow conversion between 90% to 100% of GAAP net income, in line with prior guidance. Looking now at our second quarter guidance, we expect core sales to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range year-over-year across both segments. And our second quarter 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.84 to $0.88 per share. That concludes my prepared remarks. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer for closing remarks.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Sameer. In summary, we're off to a strong start in 2025 and we are confident in our ability to navigate a more dynamic macroeconomic environment in the near term and are prepared to do so. We believe that the essential need for orthology solutions, our durable business model and the secular growth drivers across our end markets will support our financial performance this year. We continue to leverage the power of the Varalto Enterprise System to drive continuous improvement and bolster our agility. Our financial position remains strong, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to create shareholder value within our disciplined capital allocation framework. We are excited about the bright future ahead for Varalto and the opportunities in front of us to help customers solve some of the world's biggest challenges in delivering clean water, safe food and trust essential goods. That concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scott Davis with Emilios Research.
Scott Davis: Congrats on the start of the year. I hate to do it, but I have to ask on tariffs because that's just so much of our incomings and you guys seem pretty confident in your ability to mitigate, but perhaps maybe provide a little bit more color on the sequencing. I imagine you can't mitigate overnight. This is going to take some time. But I'll put that as kind of an open-ended question that just help us understand how the mechanics behind mitigation and kind of the timing and when you would expect to be fully offsetting the tariffs.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks for the question, Scott. Yes, I think we feel very confident here. Our gross exposure to tariffs is about 3.5% of our sales. And bear in mind that in terms of running Varalto and using VES, we are constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the business, be that operational footprint, pricing, supply chain and strategic sourcing kinds of opportunities. And so in fact, we always have this going on. We've accelerated some of the actions purely around derisking what we see today. But I would reiterate, as I said in the comments, we're well positioned here. So pricing actions have been and will continue to be undertaken. We additionally derisk our Trojan manufacturing facility based in Canada by pulling forward some redundant manufacturing capability into their new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And we continually work to align our supply chain and our sourcing strategies relative to derisking our tariff situation. So bear in mind, too, that we are effectively an asset- light manufacturing operation. Most of our business here is subassemblies and kitting, circuit boards, plastic enclosures, optics and so on. So there's no additional capital needed to create redundant lines or, in fact, move manufacturing lines. And we do that regularly in the normal course of business. On average, we can move a line within a 6-month time frame. Some take longer, but we feel like we're really well positioned here.
Scott Davis: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then if you just think about second derivative demand impacts, I would think Videojet would be a pretty good real-time demand indicator for really just customer confidence and such. What -- have you seen anything in Videojet in April that would lead you to be a little bit concerned about the customer confidence and folks plans on spending money in 2Q and beyond here in '25?
Jennifer Honeycutt: We really haven't, Scott. Demand remains strong for our PQI business and particularly coding and marking as well. So we don't see any demand change in the order patterns. We have just completed 4 consecutive quarters of growth for both equipment and consumables, which follows a good trajectory of consumer confidence and recovery in the CPG markets. The trends between different types of consumer product goods are variable, right, beverages are up, salty snacks are down. And we stay close to the data. This is a volume game for us, right? And so we look at volume on a regular basis in terms of number of codes printed. And we'll continue to watch the market closely. But at this point, we don't have any indication of that softening.
Ryan Taylor : Scott, if I may. And as we're going to look at April, the old patterns are still pretty normal at this point. Interesting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Love to get started here on the tariffs, follow-up to Scott's questions. And just can you talk about the price elasticity, I mean, it's really you've got there's high switching costs for your customers, especially on the water quality side. Can you just talk about the difference between consumables, elasticity versus equipment? And where would be the most risk that you have in increasing prices just if you think about your product line?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks for the question, Dean. This is a dynamic situation that we continue to operate in, and we're relatively surgical in our approach to pricing. So it's going to depend based on the products, the customers in the regions that we're operating in. And so there's really not a one-size-fits-all approach. I will say, as you know, that 80% of our sales goes into food, water and essential goods, and our products are essential to customer operations where the risk of failure is high and the overall spend relative to their operating budget is low. So it's well worth the investment here. And I would say that with 60% of our revenue tied to the consumables business, it's a pretty good relationship, as you know. So we've got the razor-razorblade relationship here. But as you know, our decentralized operating model empowers our business leaders to effectively take pricing actions where they best see fit. And that's going to vary by operating company and product line.
Deane Dray: Great. Just to clarify if you're using surcharges in addition to pricing?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Like I said, Dean, it's going to vary. In some cases, we're using surcharges. In some cases, it's pricing. It just depends upon the business, the product line in the region in which we're operating. But I can say we remain confident in our ability to have our pricing actions be those surcharges or permanent increases to stick, and we believe we're well covered in terms of addressing any tariff impact going forward.
Deane Dray: Great. And just a follow-up, and this is away from tariffs. Do you have any high-level observations on the EPA announcement this week regarding PFOS. There was a lot of hand wringing worrying that there might be some pullback from the enforcement here, especially the 4 parts per trillion, but it looks like it was a full endorsement of the enforcement of PFOS and just any commercial implications for you all? And would love to hear, again, just high-level thoughts.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. Thanks for the question. As you know, we remain excited about PFS in terms of both analysis and treatments, particularly in the area of destruction. We remain active with our minority investment in Axione Technologies, which is a destruction technology or PFOS. Our teams are constantly canvassing the market looking for opportunities to innovate and particularly democratize test so that they can be fit for purpose for utilities and municipalities. So we think we're well positioned here. And as a reminder, there's nothing in our forecast going forward that has any component of PFAS sales, either treatment or destruction in it. I think it remains early days here in terms of how to go solve for this problem, but there's effectively no impact if the EPA decides to pull their 4 parts per trillion or increase it to some other minimum contamination level. We remain committed to this space, and we think there's going to be a need to solve for this in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: I just want to make sure I understand how you guys are thinking about the year and however we can cadence this out. First, the selling days, does that come out of the second quarter? Or where does that bounce out over the course of the year? And then how are you thinking about the seasonality embedded in guidance, all else were relatively normal? Any change more of a top line question here than the bottom line question.
Sameer Ralhan: Mike, thanks for the question. As you kind of think about the 3 [indiscernible] , it's really the impact it's going to be in Q4. So for the full year, there's not an impact. But for second quarter and third quarter on a year-over-year basis, there should not be any change in the number of days. So that's how you should think about that. Despite that, our Q1 was really strong. So we feel really good about the execution of our team and greater than 5% of the core growth, even if we perform on average basis for the potential 3 days. So a really solid quarter. From a seasonality perspective, as you know, our business really does not have a whole of seasonality. You may see a little bit of movement in for based on the budgets that the municipalities may have, things like that, but really from a seasonality perspective, our business is pretty steady.
Mike Halloran: And then probably this is almost two questions [indiscernible] the one, which I admit I had a time. But can you help us bridge between 1Q and 2Q? Relative to the strength of 1Q, even excluding the number of cell days and the benefit, it's still early the quarter, seems like a little bit of a change going in the second quarter. Is that the timing of how the tariffs roll through? And then the second question embedded in that is how does the tariff mitigation work through years? Is it heaviest in 2Q and pretty light, if at all, in the fourth quarter? So if you could just kind of square those two dynamics for me.
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Mike, is yes, there definitely two questions. So let's parse them out. I think first, let's look it from a growth perspective on the guidance. Look, I think Q1 was really strong again greater than 5% core growth, even if you perform on average for 3 days -- 3 extra shipping days. Order patterns in April seems normal. But having said that, there's just a lot of geographical uncertainty from the trade policies. So what you've done is look at a lot of scenarios as you kind of try to rebalance between price and volume. Where we are is it feels pretty good about the low single digit to mid-single digit kind of overall core growth. As you know, we don't guide between the price and volume. So that's how we kind of think about the core growth side at this point. I think it makes sense for us to be stable, judicious from a growth perspective. On the margin side, and that's where your tariff question comes in and how the impact will roll in. We modeled in a little bit of a timing difference between the tariff increases and the related countermeasures. So that's kind of driving and why we've expanded the margin range a little bit. Also in the near term, what we have seen is, like Q1 was really good on the equipment sales, and of course, that so the seed for the future growth. So that's really a great outcome in Q1. We modeled in the equipment sales growing in Q2 as well. So that's impacting on the margin side in the second quarter. And lastly, Mike, it's really math, right? The quantum of the numbers that we're looking at from a cost and then the price to offset that is going to -- we're trying to protect the OP dollars, right? That's where the EPS, we feel pretty good about 360 to 370. But when you try to particularly will be dollars, you're going to have a little bit of an impact just on a percent of the margin side. So that's kind of like really playing into the guide as well. But overall, we feel really good about at this point on the countermeasures and how we're looking at the demand at least sitting here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Obviously 1Q, a lot stronger, I think, than even you all expected or at least guided to. At the same time, it doesn't sound like there was any pull forward or anything like that around the tariff side. So I guess, first, can you help us to understand where that strength surprised you? I mean your business is normally pretty predictable and yet it really came in a lot better than expected. So I guess, what were the big surprises would you say?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks for the question, John. We post spin, and we've been out of the starting blocks now 18 months or so, really had the benefit of reinvigorating VES and doubling down on commercial execution, new product development and making sure that we are operating out of the strongest positions for each of our businesses. And I think what you see coming out of the fourth quarter here is just sustained momentum, right? We made a number of investments in commercial execution. We did some rearchitecting of our commercial teams in some of the businesses. And we doubled down really in terms of driving new product development and delivering fit-for-purpose products and solutions into the space. And I think what you see there is the ongoing momentum in just being disciplined in driving VES and ensuring that we're blocking and tackling each and every day. I don't know that we were necessarily surprised by anything in particular? I think probably Europe came in a little bit stronger, particularly on the water side that we benefited from. But again, that's on the back of really solid leadership, commercial execution of blocking and tackling every day.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And I guess, maybe somewhat related to that, so the margins overall for the first quarter were pretty much at a record level. And I think that was despite what you thought was going to be some pretty heavy equipment, slightly lower margin-type business coming in and you have the trace gains kind of weight of some of the investments there. So I guess how should we be thinking about the margin level that we're at right now and how that progresses through the year? I guess there may be some puts and takes around the tariff timing, but maybe you can help us to think about some of those levers that you're pulling there.
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, John, I just going to look at the Q1 margin, absolutely. Really great execution driving the 25% adjusted OP margins. So I feel really great about that. Some of the things in the Q1 that you kind of look at it from a margin perspective, it's really the fall-through from the volume side. It's the volume leverage that was a big role -- played a big role in driving the operating margin uplift. I would say, as we kind of move on and look at the rest of the year, we've been a little -- we want to make sure that we build in a lag for any timing differences between the tariff increases and the counter measures, that's kind of played in equipment sales, as I said earlier, are rolling to that as well and rest is math. So those are some of the reasons at this point, given there are so many moving pieces, frankly, a lot of the stuff happening real time, as you know on a daily basis with things changing. So we just wanted to be judicious and cautious at this point as we kind of think about the ad side.
Operator: We'll next go to Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I guess my tariff question is going to be around the competitive advantage or disadvantage that you might see from this. Obviously, there's certain competitors maybe in marketing and coding where you're pretty similarly positioned, but maybe some other businesses where you have some competitive advantages or disadvantages. Just based on where supply chain is positioned, where your manufacturing is positioned, et cetera, I would imagine being the big dog on the block in most of these businesses that is more advantage and disadvantage. But are there places where you see this as an opportunity to either use that better positioning to gain market share or to use that better positioned supply chain to [indiscernible] or any areas like that?
Jennifer Honeycutt: I love the question, Nathan. We actually look forward to market dislocations. This is an area where I think we can form really, really well. And that's on the back of just our multi-decade heritage around the Varalto Enterprise system. As I mentioned, we are an asset-light manufacturing business in most cases. And that gives us really a lot of great optionality as to where we manufacture for the benefit of both our customers and to defray. So we feel very good about our position in being advantaged at this time. We feel like we've got great direct to customer sales strength with our 75% direct-to-sales model. It gives us great insight as to what our customers are thinking and doing the problems that they're facing, how we can help solve those problems with them. And likewise, we're always working supply chain. That's just part and parcel to running a global business, and we got a lot of reps here, right? This is reflective memory for us. So we're blocking and tackling. We're using VES, we're remaining nimble. And then when we say opportunities, we seize them with speed and agility.
Sameer Ralhan: And Nathan, if I can just add, are the speed and agility is really demonstrated by how we've been able to set up the Trojan facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan, right? So that's a great proof point of what Jennifer just said.
Nathan Jones: I guess, follow-up then is you said 3.5% of sales across the portfolio, but your business is like half U.S. or a little bit under half U.S. Does that imply that you need 7% price in the U.S.? Or are you deferring that across other parts of the business? And then is it relatively homogeneous? Or are there parts that need significantly more than that, significantly less than that? And do you believe you can mitigate a significant portion of what's that 3.5% total today? And what could you get it down to?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Nathan, as you kind of look at a 3.5 percentage is really sort of a growth estimate. And when you look at that number effectively, it reflects the export as well as the imports, right, in the ports into China. And majority of this is tied to China as we talked about that. Overall, we say we should be able to defray pretty much all of it at Nathan. And it's really 3 things. The sourcing strategy, supply chain stuff that Jennifer talked about. Second is all the manufacturing footprint, given our life manufacturing, we can move things around very fast. All those things are happening to make sure we're in a geographic location where we can serve our customers, maintain the continuity of a survey to customers. At the same time, we can do it very fast. And then lastly, I would say, the pricing. So it's a combination of all 3 is how you should be thinking about defraying this 3.5% that we laid out a gross conservative view. This -- this is not all pricing.
Operator: We go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague: I'm a bit late but I think my team has updated and what you said so far, but pardon any duplication here. But first, just on the asset-light comment though, Jennifer, a lot of that derives right, from not being vertically integrated and sourcing and the like. Do you see, for example, kind of electronic sources of supply where you can divert out of China to other places to kind of put the deal with the input costs on that side of the equation?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. Let me clarify, just because we say asset-light doesn't mean we're not leveraging collective spend for certain commodities. Okay? What we mean when we say asset-light is that we don't have any big heavy monuments for manufacturing equipment that has to be duplicated or rooftops that need to be built in order for us to be able to move supply chain. We have a very capable strategic sourcing team centralized within our corporate organization that works directly with our sourcing teams within the operating companies to create that shared leverage. So that shared leverage shows up in collective circuit board purchases in chemicals, commodities, in plastics, injection molded parts, optics, et cetera. So we think we're well advantaged here in terms of being able to leverage the collective spend but also being nimble and swift when we want to diversify our manufacturing footprint.
Sameer Ralhan: And Jeff, one more point I would add is, as you kind of think from the supplier's perspective, right, there's a lot more flexibility on the supply footprint as well right now versus the first round of tariffs 6 to 8 years back, right? So it's a little different situation as well. So all of us have been working in building that resillency into a supplier base as well. That is a driver in our ability to move fast as well right now.
Jeffrey Sprague: And thinking about what you can do versus what you will do, I mean, is there like a real list of sort of no-regrets footprint changes that you make here? Or are we still kind of tactically maybe leaning more on price at the beginning to see if some of the stuff goes away? Just interested in how you're kind of playing that potential arbitrage there.
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. If you think it from the supply chain and the manufacturing footprint perspective, Jeff, these are no regret moves for us. I think like Trojan one is a great example because of the Baba, we are already working towards and had a strategy to move have a footprint here in the U.S. The tariff situation just help kind of accelerate that. So a number of [indiscernible] things that we have in play, and we are working on pretty close to getting done. We were a big part of our overall strategy for the longer term as well from a physical footprint perspective. So I would say these are no regret moves, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague: And then maybe just finally on the days. I think you addressed it in your opening comments. But could you just elaborate if again or if you didn't, on the impact on the total enterprise consumables business versus maybe sort of product and projects, I assume there are some notable differences there.
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Jeff, this extra 3 days, right, even if you pro forma for that, the core sales growth should be solid, above 5%. The impact, as you can imagine, primarily comes through consumables. That's where you would see it, not in the equipment side. And frankly, if you boil it down all the way to the EPS based on average margins stuff, it's so $0.03 per share impact. So Net-net, if you look at that, I think have sitting here, if you were delivering high single-digit growth and 90-plus EPS, I think you'll all be feeling pretty good. So it's pretty solid execution.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.
Andrew Buscaglia: I wanted to check in on the M&A front. It seems like you guys are -- you got another deal over the finish line, a small one, but I'm curious if tariffs are impacting things either positively or negatively in terms of your discussions.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, they really aren't, Andrew. We remain excited about the opportunities that we have in M&A, both of our funnels for both segs of the house in terms of the two segments are full and actively being worked, where we continue to look at a number of strategic investment areas and we will stay disciplined in our approach. We absolutely will stay close to ensuring that it's a market that we like with the most attractive company assets that play in that space and to ensure that we get them at the right valuation. So we are undeterred in our approach to M&A, and we still have that as a bias for our capital deployment.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. And on the tariff side, can you just clarify, are you a net exporter out of China to the U.S. It's kind of a balance. Look take all the stuff as well, and that's kind of reflected in the 3.5% number. So I wouldn't call it like it's one way or the other.
Operator: We'll next go to Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Dalibor on behalf of Andy Kaplowitz. This first question -- maybe first question, just focusing on the volume component. So Q1 benefited from 6.5% volume growth. But how do you think about volume normalization in the second quarter and second half, particularly in like macro uncertainties and any inventory normalization in your new channels?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. Thanks, Italia. Look, I think, as you know, we are majority direct, right, almost 70% direct to our customers. So we generally have a pretty good feel from the inventory perspective. They're not a whole lot of distribution channels in between -- the buffers in between. So generally, we have pretty good line of sight and doesn't feel like there's any inventory build at this point. It's not also -- not reflected in the order patterns. So inventory is less of an issue as we kind of think about the second quarter and the rest of the year. From a volume perspective, look, as you know, we don't point any specific guide for volume and price. As we drive the price, there could be some impact on the volume. Yes, we run all the different kind of scenarios. Our goal is always to rebalance to make sure we are optimizing the core growth. So from a core growth perspective, low single digit to mid-single digit for the second quarter and the rest of the year is where we feel really good about at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: And then I noted sourcing optimization and standard work improvement for CEO Kaizen, I'm just curious, can you quantify any expected annualized run rate savings from these initiatives? And how and when do you think you'll be able to reinvest and secure these initiatives flow to the bottom line?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. Look, this thing, first of all, the fundamental of any Kaizen event is we want to see the impact now, right? So these are the kind of things that we do execute. We start seeing the results look, as part of the budgeting process. Every operating company has an operating margin expansion. So we fully expect to conduct a continuous improvement, Kaizen events to actually deliver on the commitments that are in the budget that's in the forecast. So these are all kind of part of the guidance that we give to you guys and the Intel is all kind of reflected in that. Overall, from a supply chain perspective, at teen, Natalia, I can tell you, I would say, if we do this thing every day, right? I can tell you, there were a number of supply chain initiatives as well, just around the sourcing side and the procurement side but those benefits are reflected in the guidance and reflecting in the internal budgets we have with each operating company. So there's nothing additional up to that.
Operator: And I'll take our last question from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I know we're going to end the call here. So maybe I'll just combine my 2 questions into one, to be efficient. As you said, multiple times. I know you guys don't like to break out volume and price from an outlook perspective. But when we look at Q1, maybe it's a little bit lighter, 1% for water quality, 1.6% or PQI. It seems like, at least directionally, that's going to go higher given the tariff impacts moving through the year. So just curious if you can -- without giving us the numbers, give us some sense of the cadence as you layer that in over the course of the next few quarters and into year end. And then, I guess, related to that, you mentioned no pull forward in Q1, but are you seeing any signs of any slowdown in real time with all the macro uncertainty and tariff impacts? And sort of what are you budgeting for the expectations around demand elasticity as you see some price increases moving through the year. Is there any feedback real time from customers around whether that might limit some volume upside even through the rest of the year?
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Brian. I'll start with the second question. From a pull-forward perspective. No, we haven't seen anything of notice -- of note, rather, I should say, Brian. This is -- overall, the demand has been pretty good. And I would say, as we kind of look at the order patterns in April, as I said at the beginning of the call, they still seem normal at this point. So we haven't seen any change in the order patterns yet. And from a more pull-forward inventory perspective. As I said earlier, we sell mostly direct. So we have pretty good line of sight in the inventories at the end users. I think things seems to be abnormal at this point. Now we all see what's happening in the macro, and we're prepared for that, and we run different scenarios as we don't think about how we move -- as we increase the pricing, how it may impact volume and all that is reflected in the core growth in the low single digits to mid-single digits, depending on the scenario, price and volume is going to have a little bit of elasticity, but within the range of low single digits to mid-single-digit core growth. Overall pricing, when you look at, Brian, historically, we delivered 100 to 200 basis points. So net-net, on average, we were $1.31 you're absolutely right. As we push pricing, we will move towards the higher end of the range, absolutely, that will happen. But that's being very surgical, right at the end of the day. The goal is to position the business for success for the longer term to help customers maintain business continuity as well. So we're being very surgical, very methodical in how we're kind of pushing. And pricing, as you kind of think of it lastly, I would say, is one of the levers as we kind of think about offsetting the -- as part of the countermeasures after the tariff impact. We have a lot of things in our own control, right? As you kind of think about the manufacturing footprint changes, it's going to have a very meaningful impact on the tariff countermeasures, you think about the supply chain side. Those things are in our control. So we are executing on all those things as well. So think of pricing as one of the 3 elements here. The other 2 elements are within our control, and we are executing on those.
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Brian, and thanks for everybody that joined us on the call today. We appreciate the questions and the engagement. As usual, this is Ryan, I'll be available for follow-ups today and over the next several days. Thanks again for joining us, and this concludes the end of our Q1 earnings call. Thank you.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. Your program is about to begin. [Operator Instructions] My name is Margo and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to Veralto Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your conference.
Ryan Taylor: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations. A replay of this call will be available until February 19. Yesterday, we issued our fourth quarter and full year 2024 news release, earnings presentation and supplemental materials, including information required by the SEC relating to adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we also issued our 2025 full year and first quarter guidance. These materials are available in the Investors section of our website, www.veralto.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are also provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining our call today. I’ll begin with a look back at our 2024 accomplishments, followed by a recap of our fourth quarter performance. From there I will then take you through a detailed analysis of our Q4 results and 2025 guidance. Reflecting on 2024, I am proud of our team for their strong execution in our first full year, as a public company to grow our business, strengthen our portfolio and deliver attractive value creation for all stakeholders. In doing so, three notable accomplishments stand out. First, we delivered on our financial commitments. Second, we increased our growth investments. And third, we demonstrated a disciplined approach to capital allocation, executing strategic actions to improve our portfolio and increase our dividend in conjunction with our earnings growth. Let me expand on each of these. Beginning with our financial performance for the year, we delivered core sales growth, adjusted operating profit margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth above our initial guidance. This outcome demonstrates the durability of our businesses fortified by the Veralto Enterprise System. Our simplification of VES and focus on leveraging high impact tools drove sales growth and margin expansion throughout the year. Our results reflect the benefits gained from our team's engagement in focused time and events and leverage of VES growth tools to enhance commercial architecture, improved funnel management and increased lead generation. Our VES focus combined with increased investments in sales, marketing, and R&D enabled us to capitalize on strengthening demand as the year progressed. This resulted in steady sequential Improvement in volume growth, partly attributable to new customer wins and increased market penetration. Across both segments, we delivered mid-single-digit core sales growth in the second half of 2024. On the strength of this growth and strong underlying margin expansion, we accelerated investments to drive future value creation. Specifically, we expanded our direct sales force, augmented our marketing efforts and accelerated innovation in verticals and regions with high return opportunities. We enhanced our talent through new hires and internal development programs and we increased our investment in innovation with our full year R&D expense up 40 basis points year-over-year to about 5% of sales. Our focus on innovation led to several new product and technology launches across our businesses throughout 2024. PQI led the way with digital offerings in packaging and color and a steady cadence of next-gen technology launches in marketing and coding. Videojet has now launched more than a dozen new products over the past two years. Its latest breakthrough, the 7920 UV Laser Marking System launched in the fourth quarter. This laser enhances usability, adaptability and consistency in coding operations and was met with immediate enthusiasm and demand from customers. We shipped our first unit shortly after the product launched in November and continue to see strong demands here in Q1. The UV Laser is optimized for high-quality, permanent coding, bunch of lighter weight flexible films made from mono-material plastics. These flexible films are among the fastest growing substrates in the packaging industry, due to their high levels of recyclability, further supporting our customers’ sustainability goals. We are excited about this new UV Laser Technology, along with many other products and solutions we brought to the market last year. In addition to delivering our financial commitments and increasing our growth investments, our third key accomplishment last year was executing disciplined capital allocation. In 2024, we took steps to improve our portfolio across both segments. This activity ramped in the fourth quarter as we acquired TraceGains, our first acquisition of size, invested in minority stake in Axine Water Technologies and signed an agreement to sell Advanced Vision Technology or AVT, a print inspection product line in our PQI segment with approximately $40 million in annual sales. As we talked about on our Q3 call, TraceGains was acquired early in the fourth quarter. It is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that enable connected data and digital workflow management for consumer brands. TraceGains’ digital solutions help customers innovate new recipes faster and significantly reduces time to market for new products. Additionally, it helps increased transparency to ingredient inputs for food & beverage safety. The acquisition of TraceGains in combination with our Esko, business strategically expands our digital offering and provides us the opportunity to deliver greater value to consumer brands as they digitize critical workflows with connected data across new product development, compliance and packaging. The integration of TraceGains is going well. Our integration team is executing on all fronts. The customer response has been very positive and the team at TraceGains has quickly embraced VES. TraceGains’ fourth quarter core sales growth exceeded 20% year-over-year and importantly, we are on track with our growth investments. Late in the fourth quarter Esko entered into an agreement to sell its AVT product line. This sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. This divestiture is another example of our stewardship of the portfolio. With Esko’s focus on providing source-to-shelf, digital workflow solutions for our CPG customers, we believe new ownership of AVT will provide the necessary focus to drive its growth and innovation. In combination, acquiring TraceGains and divesting AVT enhances our packaging and color portfolio. Both deals are immediately accretive to PQI’s core growth rate, gross margin and recurring revenue. In Water Quality, we have also taken actions to improve our portfolio. As previously discussed, since we're also spin-off, we have strategically exited thee product lines that were not aligned with our long-term value creation strategy. In the fourth quarter, we made a minority investment in Axine, a provider of electrochemical oxidation technology, used to destroy contaminants in water including PFAS. Our Water Quality team has a long proven track record of developing and commercializing technologies that help customers detect and destroy emerging contaminants. A key part of our growth strategy in Water Quality is developing fit-for-purpose solutions to help our customers meet complex challenges. We believe Axine’s electrochemical oxidation technology provides a promising solution for difficult-to-treat organic contaminants and that our commercial partnership with Axine will accelerate technology adoption over time. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in curating our portfolio in 2024. Moving forward, we expect acquisition growth to be a key value creation lever. The pipelines for both segments are full and active and we continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. Looking now at 2025, we are starting off the year with an improved portfolio, positive trends in our end-markets and a stronger financial position. Demand across our key end-markets has strengthened compared to this time last year highlighted by strong demand for industrial water treatment in North America and improved demand in consumer packaged goods markets globally. For the full year 2025, we are targeting low to mid-single-digit core sales growth with strong incremental margins, solid, earnings growth and strong cash generation and we believe the durability of our businesses, fortified by the Veralto Enterprise System, our competitive advantages that enable us to consistently grow and improve even in dynamic macro environments. Looking at our financial results for the full year 2024, total sales grew 3.4% year-over-year to just under 5.2 billion, an all-time high. We delivered 3.7% core sales growth with 80 points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $3.54 per share. Notably, we exceeded our initial guidance on all three of these metrics and we generated $820 million of free cash flow further strengthening our financial position. We ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash on hand and net leverage at 1.2 times. Overall, I'm pleased with the growth in margin expansion we delivered in 2024. Every operating company across both segments contributed core sales growth with positive volume. Our Water Quality team delivered 3.9% core sales growth with 50 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. They set all-time highs with annual sales of over $3 billion and adjusted operating profit margin of 25%. And our PQI team delivered 3.3% core sales growth with 160 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. They also reached all-time highs with over $2 billion in sales and adjusted operating profit margin of 27%. I'm proud of our teams across the world for their strong commercial and operational execution in support of our customers. We capped off a strong 2024 with solid fourth quarter results. Core sales grew 4.6%, led by volume growth with both segments growing core sales by more than 4%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 9%, year-over-year to $0.95. And free cash flow generation was strong at $263 million in the fourth quarter, further strengthening our financial position. Looking at core sales growth by geography and end-market for the fourth quarter, growth across the enterprise was broad-based across key verticals and regions. And our commercial teams executed well, leveraging our VES growth tools and investments made earlier in the year. North America and Western Europe, which comprise about 70% of our total sales grew nearly 6%. And high growth markets grew low-single-digits year-over-year. In North America, core sales grew 5.8% within both segments. In Water Quality, we continue to capitalize on strong demand for our Chemical Water Treatment Solutions, which grew high-single-digits in North America. From an Industrial end-market perspective, this growth was broad-based with the strongest growth in food & beverage, chemical processing and power generation. We also continue to see strong growth for Trojan's UV systems at municipalities in North. America, primarily related to water reuse. We're also continue to benefit from strong secular drivers in water conservation, reclamation and reuse.as we help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. Over the long term, we expect the secular trends to drive continued growth opportunities, given the scarcity of water today, coupled with more frequent, severe weather events and increasing water usage from industry, such a datacenters, which consume large quantities of water for cooling. It also includes traditional industries, ranging from power generation to food & beverage processing. Both our Water Treatment and Analytics businesses are poised to benefit from increased industrial activity in North America. At PQI, core sales in North America also grew 5.8% in Q4 with mid-single-digit growth in both packaging and color and marking and coding. PQI’s growth in North America was largely driven by strong growth in equipment sales. This reflects the combination of improving end-market demand from CPG customers and market penetration from our strategic initiatives. Specifically, in North America, Videojet focused on new customer wins, differentiated new product launches and VES-driven commercial excellence. In Western Europe, we saw continued momentum with core sales growth of 5.8% year-over-year led by 7.3% growth in Water Quality sales and 4.4% growth in PQI. The sales growth in Western Europe was largely driven by strong commercial execution by our Water Analytics team. Additionally, we drove growth across PQI in both our marking and coding and packaging and color businesses. In high growth markets, core sales increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, led by Latin America and India. In China PQI continued to drive solid year-over-year core sales growth. However, similar to our third quarter performance, PQI’s growth in China was offset by lower sales in Water Quality. This is primarily due to ongoing soft demand for Water Analytics, and a lower level of UV System installations for chip processing, which were exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total company sales into China in Q4 were in line with our quarterly average for the year. We continue to view demand for our products in China as stable at low levels and do not expect China sales to grow in 2025. Overall, we delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, on the back of strong commercial execution, while continuing to invest in future value creation. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Sameer to provide details on our fourth quarter results and 2025 guidance.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Total sales grew 4.4% on a year-over-year basis to over $1.3 billion. Currency was a 50 basis points headwind year-over-year and acquisitions contributed 30 basis points of growth, primarily driven by TraceGains. Core sales grew 4.6%. Our core sales growth was primarily driven by volume, which grew 3.1% year-over-year. Price contributed 1.5% growth this quarter, in line with historical levels. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single-digits year-over-year and comprised 59% of our total sales. The percentage of recurring revenue is in line with 2023 levels. However, it is down sequentially, primarily due to high-single-digit, sequential growth in non-recurring revenue, specifically, Water Testing Instrumentation and Marking and Coding Equipment. Gross profit increased 7% year-over-year to $801 million. Gross profit margin improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 159.6%, primarily driven by pricing. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit margin was flat year- over-year at 23.8%. As Jennifer mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we continue to increase investments in our direct sales and marketing efforts on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, R&D as a percent of sales increased 70 basis points or $12 million to 5.1%. In addition, our cost optimization investments in this quarter increased by about $7 million on sequential basis. These investments are aligned with our strategic growth plans. Looking at EPS for Q4, adjusted earnings per share grew 9% year-over-year to $0.95 per share. As compared to our guidance, adjusted EPS came in stronger, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and a lower tax rate. These benefits more than offset a headwind from currency. As compared to our guidance expectations, strengthening of the US dollar during the quarter resulted in about 2% or approximately $25 million headwind to sales, primarily due to translation of foreign currencies. This led to a headwind of about $7 million to adjusted operating profit or $0.02 to adjusted earnings per share, as compared to our guidance assumptions. In the fourth quarter, we generated robust free cash flow of $263 million or 116% conversion of GAAP net income. Moving on, I'll cover the segment highlights, starting with Water Quality. Our Water Quality segment delivered $811 million of sales, up 3.7% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was a 60 basis points headwind. Divestitures reduced total sales by 60 basis points versus the prior period. Core sales grew 4.9% year-over-year. Water Quality’s core sales growth was led by volume, which grew 3.3%. Pricing contributed 1.6% growth year-over-year. Water Quality’s volume growth was driven by strong demand for Water Treatment Solutions in our industrial end-markets and UV Treatment Systems in municipal end-markets. We also saw a good volume growth in sales of analytical instruments, reagents and chemistries to municipalities Recurring sales grew mid-single-digits and equipment growth was up low-single-digits year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% year-over-year to $207 million and adjusted operating profit margin was 25.5%, marking Water Quality’s highest quarterly margin performance this year. Moving to the next page, sales in our PQI segment grew 5.4% year-over-year to $534 million in the fourth quarter. Currency was a 30 basis points headwind and acquisitions contributed 1.6% growth in the quarter. Core sales grew 4.1%, with volume up 2.9%. Price increases contributed 1.3% to the year-over-year growth in core sales. PQI’s recurring revenue grew high-single-digits year-over-year, with positive momentum across the portfolio. PQI’s equipment sales grew low-single-digits, primarily driven by marking and coding systems. On a sequential basis, equipment sales were up mid-single-digits, driven largely by marking and coding equipment. Breaking this down by business, marking and coding core sales grew mid-single-digits, driven by growth in both consumables and equipment, a strongest growth both in food & beverage applications within our CPG customer base. In our packaging and color business, core sales grew mid-single-digits year-over-year led by growth in both recurring software and subscription revenue. PQI's, adjusted operating profit was $133 million in the fourth quarter, up $10 million over the prior resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 24.9%. That represents a 60 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin over the prior year period. The margin expansion was primarily due to favorable currency benefit as the Argentine peso devaluation in Q4 2023 did not repeat. This benefit was partially offset by increased investments in sales, marketing, and R&D, along with a higher mix of equipment sales and dilution from the TraceGains acquisition. For the full year, PQI delivered 3.3% core sales growth and 160 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Overall, it was a very good year for PQI as we continue to see positive momentum in our commercial execution and end-market environment as we enter 2025. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. In Q4, we generated $285 million of cash from operations. We invested $22 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $263 million in the quarter or 116% conversion of GAAP net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was $1.1 billion. Net debt was $1.5 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.2 times. As Jennifer shared, early in the fourth quarter, we acquired TraceGains at a gross purchase price of $350 million. The deal was funded with cash on hand. We also invested approximately $15 million to establish a minority interest in Axine Water Technologies. Even after these investments, our financial position is strong and we continue to have flexibility in how we deploy capital. To that point, in the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is consistent with our approach to increase the dividend as we grow our earnings. Over the long term however, our bias remains to create long-term shareholder value through M&A. We have an attractive pipeline of opportunities in both Water Quality and PQI. We remain disciplined in our approach as we continue to deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value. Turning now to our guidance for 2025 beginning with our expectations for the full year. We are targeting core sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming core sales growth, consistent with the full year 2024. This assumes pricing in the range of 100 to 200 basis points, consistent with our historical range. We expect net acquisitions and divestitures to be neutral to growth as potential sales contribution from TraceGains is largely offset by the impact of the AVT divestiture. Our full year guidance assumes that currency rates as of December 31st 2024 prevail for the remainder of the year. Based on this assumption, currency is approximately 2% headwind to total sales on a year-over-year basis. This falls through roughly in line with our adjusted operating profit margin resulting in operating profit, dollar headwind of approximately $25 million. This represents an $0.08 headwind to adjusted earnings per share. Our guidance assumes corporate expense at a full annual runrate between $100 million to $105 million. Looking at adjusted operating profit margin, we're targeting 25 to 50 basis points of improvement in 2025. This assumes margin expansion at both segments and total company incremental margins around 40%. Our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2025 is in the range of $3.60 per share to $3.70 per share. This assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Excluding the $0.08 per share currency headwind, our adjusted EPS guidance represents about 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and about 7% growth at the high end of the range and we are targeting free cash flow conversion between 90% to 100% of GAAP net income. This assumes CapEx in the range of 1% to 1.5% of sales and a modest working capital investment to support our growth. Looking now at Q1 2025, we expect core sales to grow in low to mid-single-digit range across both segments. Currency translation is expected to be approximately 2% year-over-year headwind to sales. We anticipate adjusted operating profit margin in the range of 24% to 24.5%. And our Q1 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.84 to $0. 88 per share. This assumes a $0.02 currency headwind. That concludes my prepared remarks. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jennifer for closing remarks.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Sameer. In summary, we capped off the strong first year as a public company. In 2024, we delivered on our commitments, invested in our future and improved our portfolio. We entered 2025 with a more positive outlook on our end-markets and momentum throughout the enterprise. Longer-term, we are confident that the essential need for our technology solutions and the strong thematic growth drivers across our end-markets will provide steady durable growth. And we will continue to leverage the power of the Veralto Enterprise System to drive, continuous improvement and bolster our agility through dynamic macro environments. Our financial position remains strong and we continue to evaluate additional strategic opportunities within our disciplined capital allocation framework of market, company, and valuation. We are excited about the bright future ahead for Veralto and the opportunities in front of us to help customers solve some of the world's biggest challenges in delivering clean water, safe food and trusted essential goods. That concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our very first question from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Natalia Bak: Hi, good morning. This is Natalia Bak on behalf of Andy Kaplowitz.
Sameer Ralhan: Hi Natalia.
Natalia Bak: First question I want to ask is, if you could break down or give more color into how you're thinking about your segments in terms of margin expansion? Do they both grow in that 25 to 50 plus range? And TraceGains weighing you down a bit more in PQI?
Sameer Ralhan: Hey Natalia. This is Sameer. Yeah, I think the - as you kind of think about the margin expansion, it's very similar. In fact, I wish we just can take a step back and look at our overall company guide and how the segments are going to be contributing, for both the segments you should look at the core growth in a very similar place, low-single-digits to make-single-digit and also from the margin expansion perspective, pretty similar contribution coming from both the segments.
Natalia Bak: All right. That’s helpful. And then, second question I wanted to ask is, just curious about the progression of DDR. What specific initiatives have you implemented under VES to drive composition fees and enhanced margin? And how has it been evolving since you went public? Where do you see the most opportunity for further margin expansion in 2025? And how are you balancing those increasing growth investments for both improving margin performance?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Thanks for the question Natalia. I think we feel very good about how we have honed our VES toolset. Certainly, we had a big push in 2024 really to drive growth in commercial execution, but we also drove considerable amounts of margin expansion in just good factory discipline. So, the things that we did in bringing the VES toolset over from Danaher post spin or to really narrow the focus and drive a greater depth of application and competency in the use of those tools. There are 5 or 6 tools that sit in our fundamentals and those fundamentals are relevant to everyone, whether you sit in a function or you sit in an operating company. And so, we feel good about both our deployment there for a commercial application, accelerate new product development and factory focused optimization.
Natalia Bak: All right. That's helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning to everyone.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Hey Deane.
Deane Dray : Good morning. Hey, you all know I have covered the Danaher for so many years. So whenever I hear about growth investments done at year end, that’s really read out of the Danaher playbook. Because it's a good sign you're getting – you are doing it from a position of strength. There's a way to jumpstart the New Year. So, I'm assuming that applies to you all. And if I look at the margin past couple of quarters sequentially down a bit. Is it fair to say that that's the impact of the growth investments? Can you size that impact and anything about the benefits and am I thinking about it at the right way?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah. Thanks, Deane. As you know, some of us here in the room have spent nearly a lifetime at Danaher. And so the playbook there is very familiar. I think it’s right, we took the opportunity here on the back of strong growth to continue to reinvest in the business in areas that we think will set us up for a good 2025. So, that's spot on and maybe I'll turn it over to Sameer to talk about the rest of your question.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer. Yeah, Deane, if you kind of look the sequential margin right, the first one is really TraceGains. Roughly 70 basis points dilutive to the PQI margins, right? But it really sets up really well in 2025 as you kind of look to driving the growth in PQI. The second one is actually, great, as you kind of think about the net equipment sales coming back, so the mix of the equipment in PQI, was little higher similarly in the Water Quality, as well. Again, as the installed base grows, as you know, our future recurring revenue grows. So it’s just great to have that. And last for the point that you kind of made Deane, really as you're kind of think about the investments in R&D, commercial, cost optimization, these things are all as you outlined very intentional, very deliberate actions to make sure that we hit the ground running in 2025. So, I think, as Jennifer also said, playbook is very similar. But our focus is long-term value creation, and if you kind of zoom out for our full year 2025, we delivered 80 basis points in the full year, while ramping up as a full year in the First full year as a public company, while investing in sales and marketing, while investing in R&D, all those things really positioning us, really well as we kind of start 2025. So we feel good about the margin expansion.
Deane Dray : It’s really helpful and I appreciate all those specifics. And the second question, you might - I might be tempted to ask about TraceGains, because that's, kind of the marquee first deal. But I'm actually more interested in talking about the investment in Axine. This electrochemical oxidation technology looks really promising. We’ve spoken with Axine before. They are established. And it looks like it could have good application for on-site PFAS destruction because they’ve already proven the technology in other complex molecules. So, look it’s still early. I get that. I'm most interested in the strategy here of using M&A as a proxy for R&D, because you can make a really smart investment for $15 million with potentially significant payoff down the road. Because your funnel have more candidates – investment candidates like this because pound-for-pound, that’s a great way to be spending your capital.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, thanks for the question Deane. Look, I - we have a number of different levers to pull relative to capital allocation and we look at all sorts of modalities there to create long-term shareholder value. I think we feel good about our level of investment in Axine just relative to proving out the technology, making sure that it matures in the right way relative to the markets that we serve. And we've got a very competent and capable science and technology team that's constantly canvasing the market for good opportunities to engage with other partners, be that in a minority investment or be that outright acquisition. So, I think everything's on the table there.
Deane Dray : Really appreciate it. Thank you.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran : Hey morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Morning. Mike
Mike Halloran : Let’s just start with end-markets and kind of a loose start. What's changed as we sit here today versus the last time we talked, because I think 3Q earnings? It sounds like you're pretty constructive coming into the year. It's just kind of continuation the trends you're seeing then? Or is there anything new that you think has developed over this period of time?
Jennifer Honeycutt : I think it's largely a continuation of what we seen Mike. We've talked a lot about the strength in our Industrial Water businesses, given the number of very thirsty industries, datacenters, power generation and so on. That continues. We're seeing good steady growth in Analytics, as well, particularly in the US, and in Europe on the back of the secular drivers that require clean water for the population that they serve. And then, I think on the PQI side, we see the continued recovery in the strength of CPG markets. We saw actually the sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digits to high-single-digit recurring revenue. We know that that recurring revenue always precedes sort of equipment growth. And now we've seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and equipment sales with in fact, equipment sales coming in better than expected here in the fourth quarter. So we think we're set up well, given the macro and we enter the year here with continued momentum.
Mike Halloran : I appreciate that. And then, when you think about the foundation for the guide for the year, I understand all the moving pieces. You gave a lot of color. Just two quick questions related to that. One, is the cadencing through the year expected to be kind of consistent with normal seasonality? And two, is the assumption that things just kind of hold trend as we sit here today? Or is there any improvement or decel assumed in what your end-markets look like?
Sameer Ralhan: Hey Mike. Yeah, from the guide perspective, as kind of look at the top line of the growth side, it's going to be pretty consistent as Jennifer just said, right? Yeah, from the CPG markets perspective, on a water perspective, you're seeing some good trends. Feel really good about as we're going to enter 2025. Those trends are continuing. So overall, from a seasonality perspective, as you know, we don't have a whole lot of seasonality maybe on the equipment side, instrument side, we see a little more pull through in Q4 as people are kind of managing the budgets. But overall, not a whole lot of seasonality in our business. So, but coming into 2025, we feel pretty good about the trends continuing and then – and the numbers.
Mike Halloran : Great. Really appreciate everyone. Thank you.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks Mike.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Couple questions - I got a couple questions around margins. When comparing the margin expansion in ’24 with ’25, ramped up R&D investments to 40 basis points. So without that ‘24 would have been up like 120 basis points in the guidance for ‘25 on similar revenue growth is ‘25 to 50. But maybe you can just give us some more color on where you got that extra margin expansion in, so that maybe you're not anticipating in 2025? I'll stop there.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, Nathan, I'll start off with that. As you kind of look at it from like 24 to 25, right, of course in the 24 the margin expansion was pretty broad based really as Jennifer said all the way from the factory floor down to the commercial operations and functions. Get offsets a little bit by TraceGains and some of the investments that we continue to make. As we move into 2025, from a price cost differential perspective, we still expect to be positive. I mean, as positive of 2024. We expect that to continue. R&D will be in a very similar level, Nathan. Roughly 5% of the sales, so that trend will we expect to continue in 2025 and that's sort of stuff is really some really targeted investments on the commercial side really into sales and marketing as we continue to drive the growth. So that's kind of like how it’s kind of panning out the 25 to 50 basis points. Still going to be pretty much - pretty broad-based, pretty across the board.
Nathan Jones: Thanks for that. And I guess I'll ask one on incremental margins. Jennifer, you talked about 40% incremental margins in 2025. Eight years probably, it relatively of a small change at low to mid-single-digit growth, but I think originally when the business spun out, you guys had talked about 30% to 35% incremental margins. Just wondering if you can comment on is that’s structurally high now or is it a one-off this year. And if it is structurally higher, what's driven that?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, Nathan, if you kind of look at 30% to 35%, right, that's a long-term view. We expect to make the right investments in the sales, marketing, R&D to continue to position the business for future growth as well, right. 2024, we feel really good about what the teams have been able to deliver. We are north of 45%, close to 50% on the fall through. For 2024, given the kind of investments that we have laid out and have visibility into what we're going to be doing in 2025, we feel pretty good about delivering 40%. All right? So the year the year-over-year depending on some of the Investments things will change, but I think if you think about a long-term value creation frame 30% 35% is a good one to keep.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Nathan.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we'll go to Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please. Go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking questions this morning.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning, James.
Unidentified Analyst: I want to kind of touch on – good morning. I wanted to touch on the CPG market little bit more. I mean, you talked about like continued threshold recovery path here over the last several quarters. So can you provide a little more color on the recovery path like how far are we from like the normalization in our industry? And like what percentage of - like revenue is still missing from the like, last, like normal like date of CPG market?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, I mean, I think the way we look at the recovery of CPG market is, mothball manufacturing lines will be turned back on and those will require spare parts, consumables, that then is followed by equipment upgrades. We are not yet at the point where we're seeing line expansions per se and new builds. So that would be another sort of extension of the recovery. But given the fact that we've seen six consecutive quarters of mid to high-single-digit recurring revenue growth, which means those lines are coming back on and using ink and solvent spare parts, filters and so on and we've seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in equipment sales. It suggests that we're well into the recovery with the prospect of new builds still ahead of us should that happen.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. And I guess, I wanted to understand the like portfolio optimization like initiative a little bit better here. So like how much are left to do here? Like what are some spaces that you can still do and how will like this initiative affect the top-line and potentially margin, like in 2025?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, the way we think about this is that every product line has to earn its right to be in the portfolio. And I think as an independent enterprise, we are tasked with being good stewards of the portfolio in terms of making sure that products that are part of the portfolio and services are at or better than the fleet average and where we've got product lines that are below the fleet average in terms of core growth and operating profit we'll look to make changes there. Now, those changes may be additional investments to get them on the right track. It may be that we attenuate them over time and it may be that we divest them outright. But I think it's safe to assume that we're always looking to improve our portfolio and moving the portfolio towards nominally higher growth rates and increasing margins.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. I will visit there.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll next go to Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Morning, Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia: So I want to ask you a high-level question. You guys had a great year and the stock also had a pretty good year, but it sort of broke down the stock that is towards the end of the year on concerns around a Trump Administration. What that means for your stock I think? And you've got a couple months to think about it now. So I am wondering at first, it was concerns around what it means for Water Quality, but then it kind of morphed into is this good or bad for PQI and you can hear different arguments on both sides. I was wondering, what are your latest thoughts for both segments under this administration.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah. We are certainly operating in a fairly dynamic environment, but from a portfolio standpoint, 85% of our sales are tied to water, food, and essential goods. It's never been out of style to protect public health and safety and regulations to help us do that. But these are issues that are important to everyone, regardless of the political affiliation. So I would say sort of on the water side, because we are endemic to the operation environment of discharging clean water and cleaning up industrial water, waste water and so on, I think we feel like that is still going to be a need, as long as we've got people on the planet, they're going to need clean water. On the PQI side, a lot of what we are focused on there is securing the inherent safety of the food supply chain, right? And, we have a need to or consumer product brands have a need to ensure that what they are distributing to their consumers. You know that the ingredients, the formularies and so on are safe, a traceable, and can be recalled in the event that there's some sort of public health or safety issue. So, we think even in the current environment, we've got strength in both of these businesses. These products and services not only provide essential public health and safety information. But in many cases, the products and services we provide, provide economic benefits to customers, as well. So, again, this is not a CapEx-intensive set of businesses. We are focused on the daily operations and the essential need of our products and services there are we believe going to remain
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah. Okay. And maybe along those lines, with tariffs is part of your guidance implied some disruption around tariffs and can you comment around the latest - your latest thoughts around China, Mexico and, and Canadian tariffs, how that might impact you?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, Andrew, in the guidance, we have not reflected any sort of a sustained impact from the tariffs. Look, it's a very fluid and dynamic situation. But if you kind of step back, we procure our materials from globally. We have a global manufacturing footprint. And over the years through the supply chain disruptions and things that have happened, we feel pretty good about the changes that the operations have made over the last four, five years. So really positioned and fortify our supply chain. So feel pretty good. We are keeping an eye on, just like you guys on the things that are coming out, but overall, we feel pretty good. But if you say, hey, there's a sustained level of tariff changes, that's not baked into the guide.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a couple on the water side. So, you highlighted some of the growth that you were seeing were was really in the food & beverage and on the power side. Those striking is relatively stable markets. So is the bulk of that share gain and if so, I guess, can you help us to understand kind of what drove that? Was it some of the investments you've been making in North America or are there other things that we should be thinking about?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, I mean, I think, we participate in a well-diversified set of markets with respect to our water business and the two that you cite there are certainly the strong growing industrial markets that we experienced in 2024. But the reality is these shift over time and we have good agility in pivoting our sales force to where the growth is coming from. Generally we've been up year-over-year in most of our markets and we continue to feel good about industrial production and the need for our products and services, particularly as reshoring comes back to the US and so on.
John McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then, maybe just one question on the datacenter side. There's some growing excitement around directed chip cooling. There's also just an increase in general use. I guess, can you speak to whether you're agnostic as to how datacenters cool going forward and some of the growth that you're seeing in terms of the opportunities from the datacenter side?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, I mean, I think the predominant focus here for us is our water cooled applications, right? But I would say that we have a very strong science and technology team on the ground that's regularly canvasing the customer base to understand sort of paint points and technology changes. I would say our mid-single-digit growth algorithm is really not tied to sort of single industry here. It's going to be broad-based and we believe that the growth in datacenters and power generation actually needed to run those centers will continue to be a potential - have potential to be a meaningful growth driver certainly throughout our treatment business.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: And next we're going to go to Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Andrew Krill: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Looking at free cash flow, I know the guidance 90% to 100% is a little below your medium-term target of 100% and extra working capital was cited. So just, should we be thinking that’s kind of a one-time 2025 event? And that in 2026, we get back that 100% or so? And are there any other factors you could call out for this year on what’s CPG below 100%?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. Hey, Andrew this - if you kind of look at the free cash flow conversion, yes, we had a pretty solid year in 2024 with a 98% conversion of GAAP net income. As you kind of move into 2025, there are really two things because of which we guided a little bit below. And one of the reasons is on the CapEx site, as you know historically, we’ve been at least for the last three years, we’ve been – CapEx is kind of like close to 1% of revenue. We've guided towards 1% to 1.5% that's a gain mostly tied to some of the growth investments that we are making in our sort of physical asset base. In 2025, some it’s just a good stewardship of the asset base. So as we kind of just looking at the CapEx going to 1% to 1.5% of revenue that's impact of only 4% on the free cash flow conversion. And the other one that we built in is, given the pretty dynamic world macro that we are living in just from the working capital perspective, we modeled it a little bit higher working capital just to support the business and manage all the supply chain things from the tariffs that we are seeing. Those are two – really the two things as things normalize for 2025, of course we expect it to back up.
Andrew Krill: Okay. That makes perfect sense. That is a good segue. Following up on tariffs, have you dialed what your sourcing is maybe for COGS from China, Mexico and Canada? And would any of those particular paint points where are you not in regions or regions sales? I believe some of that like Trojan have – has pretty meaningful cam exposure or just any help or quantification there would be great. Thank you.
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, thanks for the question, Andrew. We started several years ago, full decade certainly to source raw materials and semi-finished goods globally. We got a diversified number of manufacturing locations and we've diversified the supply chain accordingly. Certainly VES provides us the tools to proactively deal with countermeasures for different scenarios. And obviously, we're focused on controlling what we control. Relative to exposure, our primary exposure in Canada is Trojan as you appropriately cited, which is headquartered in Ontario. We have taken actions there to localize consumables and spare parts for Trojan in the US to derisk any supply chain disruption that we would see. It also gives us an opportunity to provide more agility in serving customers. I mean, I think the way to think about this is, is all told Trojan’s annual sales in the US are less than 5% of our total - for all those sales annually. So, we, we think we're well positioned to sort of weather the storm here. And we've got VES on our side to respond with agility and rigor.
Andrew Krill: Great. And just real quick on China, because I think it is 78% of sales it’s a bit bigger than some peers. Is that fair that’s mostly in region for region or that would be like headquarter imbalance?
Jennifer Honeycutt : Yeah, we've spent actually a longer period of time diversifying our supply chain around what we have in China. We have a good deal of in China for China. We certainly wouldn't be disrupted by any tariff changes. But again, we have spent the last several years diversifying that supply chain as well, and think we're well, positioned to be able to address any headwinds that we might see there.
Andrew Krill: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to go back to a couple of margin questions I guess, first off, on, on the PQI side, the 350 basis point margin contraction sequentially. I know part of that seems to be the higher mix of equipment sales. When we kind of back into it, it doesn’t seem to explain the entire bridge. Can you kind of deconstruct the 350 basis points for us across different moving sectors?
Sameer Ralhan: Hey, Brian. This is Sameer. Yeah, as I kind of outlined earlier right, the first one of course is a TraceGains. That's almost 70 basis points dilutive to PQI on a sequential basis. The next one as we kind of talked about some of the cost optimizations actions we took in my prepared remarks I highlighted $7 million higher on a sequential basis. Majority of that is in PQI. That’s 120-ish kind of basis points, little more than that for PQI. And I would say the third one is, as you kind of think about the R&D sequentially up as well as tied to the investments you are making to drive the future growth in the business. On a sequential basis, majority of the jump is actually tied to PQI, as well. And then last one you add is the higher mix of equipment sales which again really help us expand the installed base for our future recurring revenue. So those are the four things, you add them up, you kind of balance out the 300 basis points gap that you laid out.
Brian Lee : Yeah, I guess, fare to assume some of those factors do spillover to the early part. I guess, if I look at the Q1 guide, it implies margins are going to be down a few tens of BPS year-on-year despite the low-single-digit growth. I know some of that is FX, but then your full year guide implies margin growth through the year off of Q1 with the same FX assumption. So, maybe just kind of walk through the margin cadence, what’s happening in Q1 that doesn’t repeat through the rest of the year? What margin gains are you seeing start to play out off of the back of Q1. Thank you.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. No, I think it's going to move from Q4 to Q1, Brian. Not a whole lot of these things are spilling over, right? Look R&D on a sequential basis that should be consistent at higher level. And I would save cost optimization stuff, there's nothing is spilling over into Q1. Really as you kind of look at from anything that's moving from this year to next is TraceGains is going to be as we highlighted, it’s going to be a little bit of dilutive upfront as we continue to drive it's 20% growth business. So we have to make the right investments to make sure we are capitalizing on that. Those investments will be and then the mix, the trends we that we are seeing in the higher mix of equipment sales and PQI continues maybe a little bit of impact from that. But nothing, nothing more than that that’s kind of moving on or spilling over from Q4 to Q1.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Taylor for final remarks.
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Margo, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call. We appreciate the interest and engagement. As usual, we'll be around for follow-up questions. Just reach out to me if you'd like to ask anything to follow-up on the quarter or the guide for 20025. Thank you so much. And that concludes our call. We'll talk to you next time.
Operator: Thank you and this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 08:30:00) =====

Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are also provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining our call today. It has been just over 1 year since we became an independent public company. In that time, I am proud of what our team of 16,000 associates has accomplished to establish a track record of consistent performance, profitable growth and investments for the future. These accomplishments are a testament to our talented team and continuous improvement culture powered by the Veralto Enterprise System. VES enables us to differentiate in the marketplace and is deeply ingrained in our culture. It is the driving force of our daily operations as we strive to deliver results with top talent, continually improve for enduring impact and unlock ingenuity for customer success, all while serving humanity with purpose and integrity. During the past year, we simplified the VES toolkit to focus on the fundamentals bolstered by growth tools, operational excellence and high-impact leadership development. This has fortified our execution and enabled us to better capitalize on durable thematic growth drivers across both business segments. Approximately 85% of our sales support the delivery of clean water, safe food and trusted essential goods. Our customers value our products and solutions because they support critical aspects of daily operations where the risk of failure is high. Our businesses are well-established leaders in their industries with earned authority, large installed bases and intimate customer relationships. These factors, along with our high level of recurring revenue and broad service networks create incredibly durable growth and help insulate us from economic cycles. Our third quarter performance underscores the power of VES and the durability of our businesses. Our teams across the world executed well and delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit core sales growth, robust margin expansion and strong cash generation. And we continue to increase our investments in sales, marketing and innovation to support future value creation. In addition to these organic investments, we have cultivated a pipeline of inorganic opportunities for both segments aligned to our strategy, purpose and disciplined M&A criteria. Early in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of TraceGains, a leading provider of software solutions that enable consumer brands to meet increasingly stringent compliance regulations for food and beverage safety and traceability. Its cloud-based solutions and large network connect consumer brands with ingredient manufacturers. This enables consumer brands to develop new products more efficiently while also monitoring quality and compliance. TraceGains serves a fast-growing market segment and has grown its top line by 20% compound annual growth rate over the past 3 years. This year, TraceGains expect sales to exceed $30 million with more than 95% on a recurring basis and a gross margin of approximately 80%. The financial profile and recurring revenue business model of TraceGains meets our disciplined acquisition criteria and strengthens our PQI segment. TraceGains is highly complementary to our PQI brands and connect digital workflows for our CPG customers across new product development, compliance and packaging. We now can streamline processes for consumer brands from source to shelf to relieve pain points as they work to accelerate time to market. Synergies with Esko's global customer base, direct sales channel and the application of VES represent key value creation levers that we believe will accelerate TraceGains' growth, expand its market presence and improve its operating efficiency. We believe Veralto is the ideal new home for TraceGains and we're excited to welcome TraceGains' associates to our team. Moving forward, we continue to evaluate additional strategic opportunities that align with our commitment to deliver clean water, safe food and trusted essential goods and position us to seize emerging market opportunities with attractive long-term value creation potential. Now, looking specifically at our consolidated Q3 financial results. We delivered 4.6% core sales growth with volume contributing 2.8% growth and pricing contributing 1.8%. Our growth was broad-based across key end markets and regions, highlighted by continued strong demand for industrial water treatment in North America and gradual recovery across consumer packaged goods markets globally. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year to 24%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 19% year-over-year to $0.89 and we generated $215 million of free cash flow, further strengthening our financial position. Looking at core sales growth by geography in the third quarter, sales across all 3 major regions grew in the mid-single digits. In North America which represents nearly half of our total company sales, core sales grew 5.5%, with growth across both segments, led by 7% growth in Water Quality. In Water Quality, we continue to capitalize on strong demand for chemical water treatment solutions which grew high single digits in North America. From an industrial market perspective, this growth was broad-based with the strongest growth in food and beverage and chemical processing. We also continue to see strong growth for UV systems at municipalities in North America. In water treatment, we're partnering with customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals related to water conservation, reclamation and reuse. In our water treatment businesses, we are well positioned to benefit from onshoring or reshoring activity in North America. This includes technology investments such as data centers which consume large quantities of water for cooling. At our PQI segment, core sales in North America grew 2.5% in Q3 with packaging color sales up mid-single digits and marking and coding sales up low-single digits. In Western Europe, core sales grew just over 4% year-over-year with both Water Quality and PQI growing near the company average. The sales growth in Western Europe was concentrated in water analytics and marking and coding. Note that our total company growth in Western Europe included an approximately 50 basis point headwind related to the strategic portfolio actions in our Water Quality segment that we mentioned on prior earnings calls. In high-growth markets, core sales grew 4.5% in the third quarter. We continue to see strong growth in Latin America with core sales up about 10%, led by water analytics, water treatment and marking and coding. Latin America now represents about 10% of our total company sales and we are investing for growth in this region. Within high-growth markets, the growth in Latin America more than offset a modest 3% decline of sales into China. Overall, we delivered terrific third quarter financial results on the back of strong commercial and operational execution. And on the strength of our third quarter performance, we raised our full year adjusted EPS guidance. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Sameer to provide details on our third quarter results and guidance for the balance of the year.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the third quarter. Net sales grew 4.7% on a year-over-year basis to just over $1.3 billion. Core sales grew 4.6%. Currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Our core sales growth was driven by increased volume at 2.8% with positive volume growth across both segments, led by PQI. This marks the second consecutive quarter in which volume grew across both the segments. Price contributed 1.8% growth in this quarter, in line with historical levels. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits year-over-year and comprised 61% of our total sales. We expanded margins at both segments through pricing, improved productivity and cost optimization. Gross profit increased 8% year-over-year to $783 million. Gross profit margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 59.6%, reflecting the benefits of pricing as well as improved productivity and reduced manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating profit increased 13% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points to 24.1%. We delivered strong margin expansion while investing in our sales and marketing efforts to drive future growth. We also increased our R&D investments with R&D as a percent of sales increasing 40 basis points over the prior year period. These investments are aligned with our strategic growth plans and we expect to continue to fund ongoing growth investments. Looking at earnings per share for Q3, adjusted earnings per share grew 19% year-over-year to $0.89. And free cash flow was $215 million or approximately 98% conversion of GAAP net income. Moving on, I'll cover the segment highlights, starting with Water Quality. Our Water Quality segment delivered $801 million of sales, up 3.6% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was a 20 basis-point headwind and divestitures had 20 basis points impact versus the prior year period. In addition, small product lines that we strategically exited in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in approximately 70 basis points headwind to core growth for the Water Quality segment in the third quarter. The headwind from these product line exits has annualized and will not impact our fourth quarter results. Core sales grew 4% year-over-year. Pricing contributed 2.1% and volume growth contributed 1.9% to year-over-year core sales growth. Our volume growth was driven by strong demand for water treatment solutions in our industrial end markets and UV treatment systems in municipal end markets. We also saw strong growth in sales of reagents and chemistries to municipalities. Recurring sales across Water Quality segment grew high single digits. Adjusted operating profit increased 4% year-over-year to $199 million and adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points to 24.8%. Moving to the next page, our PQI segment delivered sales of $513 million in the third quarter, up 6.3% year-over-year. Currency was a 40 basis-point tailwind. Core sales grew 5.7%. Volume contributed 4.3% and price increases contributed 1.4% to the year-over-year core sales growth. PQI's recurring sales grew high single digits year-over-year with continued positive momentum across the portfolio. Recurring revenue increased to 64% of PQI sales mix in this quarter. Breaking this down by business, marking and coating sales grew mid-single digits, driven by growth in both consumables and equipment. The strongest growth was at food and beverage applications with our CPG customer base. In our packaging and color business, core sales grew high single digits year-over-year, led by growth in recurring software and subscription revenue. PQI's adjusted operating profit was $142 million in the third quarter, up $32 million over the prior year period, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 27.7%. That represents a 490 basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin over the prior year period. The margin expansion was driven primarily by pricing, strong operating leverage and cost optimization initiatives. As a reminder, PQI's profitability in the third quarter of 2023 was unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency, particularly the devaluation of the Argentine peso which did not repeat in the third quarter of 2024. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for PQI which further demonstrates the earnings power of our PQI businesses. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. In Q3, we generated $224 million of cash from operations. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter reflects the biannual cash interest payments on our senior notes. We also invested $9 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $215 million in the quarter or 98% conversion of GAAP net income. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was $1.27 billion. Net debt was $1.37 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.1x. As Jennifer shared, early in the fourth quarter, we acquired TraceGains at a gross purchase price of $350 million. The deal was funded with cash on hand. Pro forma for this acquisition, our financial position still remains strong and we continue to have flexibility in how we deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value with a bias towards M&A. We have an attractive pipeline of opportunities in both Water Quality and PQI. We will remain disciplined in our approach as we continue to deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value. Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are targeting core sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis, consistent with the level of core growth we reported in the second and third quarter of 2024. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 60 basis points to year-over-year sales growth. Including the impact of the TraceGains acquisition, we expect adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 24% in the fourth quarter. This represents 30 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating profit margin on a year-over-year basis and is flat sequentially. And our Q4 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.86 to $0.90 per share. For the full year, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.44 per share to $3.48 per share. Midpoint of our updated full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.46 per share is up $0.05 from the prior guidance. Also at the midpoint, this represents year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 8%. That concludes my prepared remarks. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jennifer for closing remarks.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Sameer. In summary, we delivered high-quality growth and margin expansion in the third quarter, further demonstrating the durability of our business, the power of VES and the talent of our team. Across the company, we are executing well and capitalizing on the secular growth drivers across both segments. Based on the strength of our third quarter results, we raised our full year adjusted EPS guidance. And at the outset of the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of TraceGains. Our financial position remains strong and we continue to evaluate additional strategic opportunities within our disciplined framework of market, company and valuation. As we look longer term, we remain committed to creating value through steady, durable sales growth, continuous improvement and disciplined capital allocation. That concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Sameer, I know you want to be conservative but just looking at the Q4 guidance, you're guiding below Q3's core growth. And adjusted operating margin, even as it seems like PQI continues to recover, I know your year-over-year comp in Q4 is a bit more difficult than Q3. And I think you just said you have some minor negative TraceGains impacts in there for Q4. But any other reason why year-over-year growth in margin would be a little down in Q4 versus Q3? Is there just a bit of conservatism in the guide?
Sameer Ralhan: Andy, thanks. Look from the margin perspective, really, on a year-over-year basis, when you look at it, it's really three things that are kind of driving it. The first one is, of course, the TraceGains, the operating impact as well as some of the transaction costs, so that's roughly 30 bps of an impact that you're going to see in Q4. And then the higher corporate costs as they're getting to the run rate tied to some of the onetime costs related to first year activities as a public company. So, that's another kind of a 50 basis point Andy. So those combined are almost 80 bps of an impact on the margin in Q4 and then after that, it's really a mix of equipment sales as the printer sales, we feel really good about some of that engagement with the customers, that equipment volumes coming back, that's going to have an impact on the margin. So those are the really three things Andy which are kind of driving our view on the 24% margin for Q4.
Andy Kaplowitz: And just the growth side, Sameer, like anything to sort of call out there just kind of similar to Q3?
Sameer Ralhan: Similar to Q3, look, when I think the overall sort of demand patterns are very similar on the consumer package, so good side for PQI. We feel encouraged. It's a kind of a steady recovery that we are seeing in the marketplace. And the water again, you saw the -- our commentary around the industrial end markets that we saw in North America that continues. Europe is steady. And I think China, we are all watching. It's just kind of sequentially flat is what you kind of think about from a guide perspective. And just as a reminder, on the growth side, when you kind of start looking from a year-over-year perspective Andy, Q4 was strong in China. So that's going to be a little bit of an impact, Q4 last year. So that's a little bit of an impact. But no, it's almost like a Q3 kind of a quarter.
Andy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then Jennifer, can you give us a little more color into your thought process of how TraceGains is going to help drive growth through revenue synergies in PQI? Obviously, you mentioned source-to-shelf solutions. TraceGains, we know is already growing fast. But are you expecting TraceGains to allow you to take more market share with food and beverage customers in the near term and maybe that enhances your overall core growth. How do you think about that?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, thanks for the question. We're really excited about TraceGains. They provide a cloud-based solution that connect the brands with ingredient manufacturers and help address increasingly stringent compliance regulations for food and beverage safety and traceability. The synergy with Esko allows us to integrate the packaging and the new product development workflows. It also helps improve data integrity and reduce time to market which are 2 critical pain points for customers. In terms of the outlook there, they've been a strong grower in terms of delivering double-digit sales growth since 2022. We would expect this momentum to continue as we think about food and beverage customers being early in their digitization journey. So with the macro of regulatory drivers, consumer safety mandates, we feel really good about bringing this business in and getting synergy with Esko to drive forward momentum and improve our growth profile there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: So first one, just on the CPG side and the underlying trends you're seeing sequentially through the quarter and into 4Q here. Any change in the thought process on how the improvement is coming around on that side of things? I know the content so far has talked about a gradual improvement. Any tone change? And then maybe talk about the moving pieces behind it that give you confidence into '25?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think we continue to be encouraged by the ongoing recovery in CPG but we also see it as slow and steady. Some of our early indicators here are that we've just completed the fifth consecutive quarter of mid- to high single-digit growth in recurring revenue at PQI. And as we've mentioned in prior calls, this is an indication that lines are coming back online that they're being refurbished and now that we've seen two consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in equipment sales, it also suggests that brand owners are upgrading their printer technology and replacing printers that are aging out. So we see continued strength here. We think it's kind of slow and gradual. We're not going to see any dramatic inflection points but we're pretty confident that what we're seeing is good, robust market recovery. And relative to the submarkets, data is a little bit mixed. Beverages are generally up, elective snacks are down but at-home food spend is still a little bit negative. It is improving sequentially. And so we are encouraged by the market indicators but still early days in the recovery and we expect to continue to execute well. I think our recent product launches and newest innovations are also gaining momentum.
Mike Halloran: Helpful. Appreciate that. And then just on the packaging color side of things, now that you have TraceGains in there, broadens out the offering. When you think about that digital workflow that you're trying to accomplish, what are the gaps? What do you feel like is left to fill in and organic versus inorganic? I'm assuming more of that fill in is inorganic. But curious what's left and where you see the air pocket still in the offering?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean, I think it's early, as we said in the digitization journey for CPG customers. There are a lot of sort of disaggregated data flows and needs that they have to tick and tie information. And really, what we're looking to do is to make sure that we're well positioned to solve unmet customer needs and address some of those pain points. So we do see more optionality in the space, both organically and inorganically and we're excited about that in the future.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I guess I wanted to start on a comment you made in your prepared remarks, Jennifer, on having simplified the VES tool set and having that make the business better able to capitalize on durable growth trends. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the kinds of things that you've done to adapt the VES system to Veralto and how you think that positions you to better capitalize and durable growth trends?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think once we came over a little over a year ago, we took a hard look at the tools in terms of which were really material to improving sort of growth and profitability profile, giving us access to markets, accelerating new product development and so on. And so the simplification was really focused around narrowing the field of tools that sit in what we call the VES Fundamentals. And these are tools, it's 5 or 6 tools that are relevant to every function and every business regardless of where you sit in the organization. And it's really a disciplined approach to good critical thinking and problem-solving and how you know that you're winning each and every day, whether you're red or green in terms of visual management and how you're correcting course along the way. We've subsequently fortified that tool set with very select growth tools, operational excellence tools and leadership tools. And so the way to think about this, Nathan, is we've narrowed the tool set to the critical view to drive discipline and focus. And we've made sure that VES is really being used by everyone, all functions, all businesses and so on. So we're excited about sort of the new simplified way of creating focus here. And I -- as I mentioned, we selectively will develop tools as and when the business needs them going forward.
Nathan Jones: And then, I've got one on TraceGains. Can you talk about what the algorithm is you need to achieve out of TraceGains in terms of gross margin expansion to hit that double-digit ROI by year 6? And then I think there's some planned investments to go into that business to drive growth. Maybe just a comment on whether that should be accretive or decretive to earnings in 2025?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I think we really like the growth profile here. Obviously, they've been growing solid double digits here in recent history. We have seen them continue to invest here and we will continue to invest to fuel their growth. They are an early phase business but maybe to the numbers specifically, I'll turn that over to Sameer.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer. Yes Nathan, as you're going to look at from the '25 perspective, the way it stands right now as Jennifer said, given the growth that we're seeing that TraceGains and the investments that we'll continue to make to drive that growth, we expect it to be modestly dilutive. But just to put in perspective, there's a pretty small acquisition. So it's not going to -- it's going to have a minimal impact at best on '25. But we'll walk through the '25 EPS growth bridge when we come back in February and talk about '25 guide.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: There's a major fast food company going through a food contamination situation. I'm not asking you to comment specifically on it but as a use case hypothetically, how does Veralto have positioned in the food chain to be able to identify and do that kind of trace work on a kind of an emergency basis?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Well, as you know, Deane, we've got a broad portfolio of solutions relative to contaminant control and detection. Most of that sits on the water side. Some of that is transferable to the food side of things. Today, most of our analytics really sits on the inorganic side of the business. We do have good technologies to bring to bear in this space. But certainly, when it comes to sort of an acute outbreak of a food-borne issue, we don't play as heavily there than we might play if it was a waterborne outbreak. So we're well positioned certainly in the water space and anything that relates to water. And we think we've got a good play here with the addition of TraceGains and we're excited about how we think about that market going forward.
Deane Dray: Yes Jennifer, I'm not asking so much about the analytics around Salmonella on what the actual contaminant was but just the traceability across the food chain of what producer, there's bar codes, there's shipment data and so forth. And you're part of that chain and that's part of the traceability appeal of Veralto. Just hypothetically, how would that work?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, absolutely. I mean if you're thinking about traceability and following a contaminant or a series of contaminants through the food chain and food cycle, we are well prepared to do that. TraceGains gets us to the traceability of the ingredient information, right? And for brand manufacturers, that's incredibly important in terms of where they're sourcing raw materials. But frankly, our coding and marking business will give you date codes, lot codes and traceability for how to identify where those products have gone and how to actually ring-fence quarantine them and pull them off the market. So we're well positioned here.
Deane Dray: All right. That's exactly what I was looking for. So I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up for Sameer and or Jennifer. You all referenced a disciplined acquisition criteria. And as far as I know, you all haven't really laid this out and wasn't at your Investor Day. What are the hurdles that you set because the expected double-digit ROIC for TraceGains is rather extended versus -- and we get it a SaaS business, it's a different set of expectations versus industrial acquisitions? But just give us a sense of what the acquisition hurdles are as we think about prospective M&A?
Sameer Ralhan: Hey Deane, I'll take that one. From an M&A perspective, as you know, as we look at the opportunity set, it's always deeply rooted in our framework which is market company valuation. And from the financial metrics point of view, things like ROIC growth, margin, cash flow accretion are all very important as we kind of evaluate all the opportunities. It's all about striking the right balance depending on the acquisitions. What I would say is from an ROIC perspective. It depends on the complexity and the kind of deal. For example, if it's a small bolt-on that we are looking at, that will be -- we expect to be a cost of capital by year 3. And if it's a large acquisition, is a technology acquisition, for example, TraceGains is a great example for that, we'll achieve ROIC close to cost of capital by year 5 or 6 [ph].
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Maybe first one for Sameer. You mentioned you're seeing good strength in PQI, some of the equipment sales seem like they're going to start to flow through more meaningfully into 4Q but have some slight margin implications. Can you quantify that? And then given kind of the backlog and visibility you have on equipment volumes into, I guess, 2025, should we expect that level to maybe persist in the PQI margins for a couple more quarters?
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Brian. Thanks for your question. As we kind of look at the equipment side, first of all, from a growth perspective, we expect -- we feel really good about the engagement that we have with the customers right now and all the signals that the teams are getting, we expect the equipment recovery to happen over the next few quarters in 2025. So it's going to be a slow and steady kind of a gradual recovery in the equipment side. From a margin perspective, the way to quantify it is to really look at what the mix was in 2019, right but things will -- a little more normalize on where the gross margins were that kind of helps you quantify a little bit on what the impact may be. But again, things have changed quite a bit. And as Jennifer said earlier, we have simplified VES. We're attacking all these things from a VES perspective. So we'll mitigate any impact as much as we can but it is going to have a little bit of an impact on the gross margin.
Brian Lee: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, maybe just on China. You called it out as a modest headwind on growth this quarter, I think 3%. You're saying it's going to be flat sequential but you had a tougher comp from Q4 last year. Just kind of taking a step back, can you speak to sort of what you're seeing on the ground in China if this is sort of just bouncing along bottom for a little while? Is there any potential for a pickup as you see it in the near term just with some of the stimulus potentially brewing out there? Just any views on kind of the state of the state in China.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, thanks for the question. On an aggregate level, I think the year is playing out as we anticipated in China, really no meaningful recovery or change in sales and demand profile. To use your words, we kind of are bouncing along the bottom. We were down modestly, about 3% year-over-year. But from a segment perspective, we kind of have two different trends here in Q3. We are seeing in PQI modest recovery in both CPG and industrial markets as they reignite their manufacturing activity over there. So we are seeing modest growth there. In Water Quality, kind of a little bit of the opposite. We continue to see challenges in funding at municipal customer sites. And then certainly, from a year-over-year perspective, we had a pretty significant number of orders go out on semiconductor projects from our Trojan business last year. So they had a very strong sort of second half in 2023 that is not going to repeat here in 2024. The good news, if there is some silver lining here, is that we still see strong demand here in the U.S. for semiconductor orders and activity. So a little bit of a shift in terms of where that business is occurring. In near term, we're just not expecting really any overall improvement. It's kind of going to be more of the same.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP.
Andrew Buscaglia: I just wanted to start out with Water Quality, sales very solid. Margins also good but maybe a little bit below what I was forecasting. And I'm wondering if you could kind of dig into the different -- the margin differential with analytics and treatment? It looks like treatment or analytics is lagging a little bit behind treatment. And how do you see that playing out over the next 12 months with how those progressed and maybe the margin impact?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, I'll take that one. If you look at it from a margin perspective, right, you're right. Analytics has been growing nicely. It's a more steady business for us, as you know Andrew. But on the other hand, the treatment side, you've seen some really good growth from the industrial end markets. Analytics tends to be a little higher margin. There's not a huge delta but a slightly higher margin than the industrial and the chemical treatment kind of businesses. So that mix has a little bit of an impact but nothing sort of a major. I would say the only other thing really Andrew, is quarter-to-quarter, means impacts. We'll be making investments, as we said, as we're going to think about growth and the growth opportunities that we see for the business in 2025. We are getting up for those growth opportunities, making those investments on the sales and marketing side. That's really the impact. But beyond that, I wouldn't read too much into it.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. And PQI has been such a great story all year. I'm wondering if a lot of these a lot of analysts like myself don't have a ton of context but in terms of understanding that CPG markets and cycles. How does this cycle feel versus past ones in terms of recovery? Because this tend to be a low single-digit business long term but you can have some big swings to the upside. So what do you -- how do you guys see that playing out this cycle?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, we really like the PQI business. And I think if you look at its history over the past 20 years, we've only had sort of 3 periods of contraction. So it tends to hold up really well through various economic cycles. And what I would say in comparing this recovery to prior recoveries is prior recoveries was more of a V-shaped recovery kind of fast down and fast up. I think what we've seen sort of post pandemic is a gradual and steady progressive sequential improvement, so it's more U-shaped than V-shaped. But we continue to be encouraged by the leading indicators that we see in terms of volume of -- that's published from our top CPG customers and demand continues to consistently grow and that's also supported by the sales out that we've seen from our recurring revenue and then the two sequential quarters of equipment growth. So again, I think it's a slow and steady wins the race here. We're not going to see any huge inflection points but we're encouraged by certainly what we see in the market today.
Sameer Ralhan: Shelby, we're ready for the next question.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank.
Andrew Krill: I wanted to sort of go back to the strong Latin America growth. I was wondering if you could expand a little on like why you think this all of a sudden accelerated so much and has this been years of investment that's kind of finally coming through? And then do you think it's sustainable going forward? And maybe any color on like the margins here, if there are any different than the company average?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, thank you for the question Andrew. We've been really pleased with our performance in Latin America. And we've watched this region closely over the course of the last couple of years here. We've made some commercial investments here to sort of focus the team at capturing the highest growth opportunities. And so I think what we're seeing there is the benefit of some reshoring or onshoring activity as some of the customers look to diversify their risk and insulate themselves from any sort of geographical constraints that they might see in China. But we're also starting to see some benefit from privatization of water utilities in Brazil. That's giving us some good opportunity around how we serve those customers and some changes in business model that help us serve them effectively. So, I think this is a reason for us to continue to stay focused on. As you know, we said in our prepared remarks, Latin America represents 10% of our total sales and it's growing well for us.
Andrew Krill: Anything on just the margins or should we assume they're kind of similar to the company average?
Sameer Ralhan: It's very similar Andrew, I think nothing dramatically different.
Andrew Krill: Got it. And then, going back to the broader M&A pipeline discussion. Just wondering if you -- as I think TraceGains came through, just is there like a theoretical limit to the number of deals you think the company can handle per year? And I guess, in terms of maybe bolt-ons, is there a number? And if you did a larger, would you expect to kind of take your foot off the gas with bolt-on?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks for the question. M&A is fairly episodic. We don't necessarily control the timing here. But what we can say is we're excited about the level of activity and engagement we have for both sides of the house. Funnels for Water Quality and PQI are both very full and we continue to be heavily engaged in this area. We don't set thresholds or limits to what we can digest here by way of number of deals or size. It stands to reason that we feel well prepared to be able to execute on our M&A playbook and bring in deals of various sizes and scale as and when we find the right intersection of market company and valuation. So again, this is an area that we're excited about. We don't have any preset thresholds but we will capitalize on the opportunity as and when we're able to go after deals that meet our stringent criteria.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano: I just wanted to touch back on the margins on Water Quality. I know Sameer mentioned some of the puts and takes there. But if I look at year-on-year growth it was pretty strong. Price is pretty good. and you had some divestments which I assume are lower margin than the fleet average there. So like the leverage there, obviously, it was up 10 bps year-on-year. Can you just talk through like the lack of leverage in the quarter and like what, if anything, are kind of more onetime in the quarter that might go away if you were to keep growing at this pace?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Joe, I'll take that one. If you look at from a margin perspective, right, on the Water Quality side, we talked a little bit of the puts and takes but still the fall-through is close to 30%. So as you kind of think about from a long-term growth algorithm perspective in the 30%, 35%, so they're pretty close. And that's also, as we said, we are making investments in the sales and marketing side in that business as we're going to think about how we orient ourselves to capture the future growth. And then when we move to PQI, the fall through has been really good. It's a little over 100%. And even if you pro forma for the onetime, I think there's only one thing that you can think about onetime item and that was in 2023, Q3, the Argentine peso impact. Even if you pro forma on that, the fall through in PQI has been close to 80%. So net-net at the company level, we are a 60% kind of a fall through. So overall fall-through has been good. And as we kind of move into the '24, I kind of laid out some of the puts and takes on the margin side. So there's nothing one-off items kind of thing here, Joe, that are impacting the margins.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then on CapEx, like can you talk about the long-term needs of the organization? It's still -- it's extremely light kind of percentage of sales and even if I was to apply all the CapEx to just Water Quality, it's still pretty low. So what should that kind of balance out as a percentage? And then just add one quick one on TraceGains afterwards.
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. I mean if you look at the CapEx side, it's really -- we are not a very capital-intensive business, as you know, right? It's a pretty asset-light model. The strength of the business is driving the values really through -- on the R&D side and the commercial side. That's where you see the investments and then the impact on the P&L side. But from a CapEx, 1% to 2% is how you should think about that. It really comes down to the projects, depending on how they're going to pan out from a timing perspective. But 1% to 2% is the right way to thinking about the CapEx for us. We're running a little light this year.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then just last on TraceGains. You mentioned the combination with Esko. I'm just curious, like from a customer standpoint, how does this work? Like are you -- are these independent offerings that are being pitched separately? Or are you going to be able to get TraceGains through the Esko platform like I'm just curious as to what the customer experience is to have that whole totality of the -- from source to shelf?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes, thanks for the question. I think the way to think about this is we will serve customers in the way that they want to be served. One thing that we do see is Esko has got great strength at the enterprise level and TraceGains has got great strength kind of at the mid-market level. The cross-pollination of the two will catalyze sort of expanded share of wallet, I think, at customers and give them more solutions to their sort of digital integration challenges that they're working with today. So it will vary by region. It will vary by customer but we feel good about the combination of the two going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Damian Karas with UBS.
Damian Karas: Sameer, sorry if I missed this, did you quantify how much of a headwind the Water Quality product exits were to the third quarter sales?
Sameer Ralhan: I'm sorry, Damian, can you repeat that?
Damian Karas: The Water Quality product exits.
Sameer Ralhan: It's roughly 70 basis points on the growth side, Damian.
Damian Karas: 70 to the segment, 50 to the total company 50 bps; that's helpful. I wanted to ask you guys, so there's some updated regulations requiring a lower threshold for lead and copper in drinking water systems that were finalized earlier in the month. Just curious if you think that, that's something that could have a meaningful impact on your business? I mean, is there a good way to kind of think about that? I think there's 10 years to meet the requirement. Would you expect implementation to happen sooner rather than later? Or is that the type of change that everyone kind of just waits until the last minute to address?
Jennifer Honeycutt: So Damian, the way to think about this is our analytics business is 4 to 5x the menu of anyone else in the market. We've got the broadest portfolio with decades of innovation in this space. We are already well positioned with our technologies associated with detecting lead and copper. So unless there is an increase in frequency of testing which there may be on the margin, just to validate, we would expect this to just be business that we get in the normal course of running the business. So, I wouldn't think about this as a huge opportunity for increased sales. There may be a period of time of sort of marginal increase in testing, just to verify what you've got in place. But we're already well positioned here with our existing technologies.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research.
Brad Hewitt: So as we think about the M&A pipeline more broadly, how should we think about the distribution of the funnel as it relates to the time required to get to 10% ROIC? Would you expect the majority of targets are kind of more in the 4- to 5-year time frame you get to that 10% ROIC rather than the 6 years for TraceGains?
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, it's a pretty broad range, right? As we kind of talked earlier, the pipelines are pretty full on both sides of Water Quality and PQI but it's really a mosaic of opportunities as you're going to think about, Brad, some of our technology investments which are going to be on the longer side. And at the same time, there are a bunch of bolt-ons and the larger transactions as well. So bolt-on should be on the quicker -- on the closer side, it's a pretty broad range. I wouldn't say it's skewed one way or the other.
Brad Hewitt: Okay, that's helpful. And then, curious how important entry multiples are in your decision-making process for M&A? And how do you think about the triangulation between entry multiples and what that implies for business quality versus the path to 10% ROIC?
Sameer Ralhan: Look it's really about value creation, Brad. It's the input, as you said, the entry multiple and what we can do with the business, how we can fuel the growth or drive the margin expansion to the application of VES. So it's a combination of all those things. I would say our focus is ultimately doing transactions, adding things to our portfolio which drives long-term value creation. So, everything kind of starts from that.
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Brad and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. This is Ryan Taylor. We are at the hour time, so we're going to conclude the call for this time. I'll be available for any follow-ups. Please reach out to me if you have any further questions. We really appreciate the engagement and support and joining our call today and we'll talk to you next time.
Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: My name is Leo, and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Veralto Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your conference.
Ryan Taylor: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations. A replay of this call will be available until August 9. Before we begin, I'd like to highlight a few recent disclosures. On July 24, we issued our 2024 sustainability report. That report can be viewed on our main website under Sustainability or on our Investor website under Corporate Governance. Yesterday, we issued our second quarter news release, earnings presentation, and supplemental materials, including information required by the SEC relating to adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, our Form 10-Q was filed yesterday. These materials are available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining our call today. I want to start this call by recognizing the engine behind our strong second quarter results, our more than 16,000 associates around the world. Their strong execution and support of our customers drove our growth and improved profitability during the quarter. Nine months into our journey as an independent company, we are hitting our stride and delivering winning outcomes for our stakeholders. A key catalyst has been increased rigor in deploying the Veralto Enterprise System. As I've shared before, VES is a key competitive advantage for Veralto. It drives continuous improvement, accelerates innovation, and enables us to win in our markets. Every day, at all levels of our enterprise, our teams leverage VES to solve problems rapidly and drive sustainable improvements. Our increased rigor in deploying VES has helped drive growth, expand margins, and ensure that we deliver on commitments. Our second quarter results demonstrate the benefit of this increased rigor, while also highlighting the durability of our businesses. We delivered core sales growth across both segments, led by better-than-expected positive volume and price increases in line with historical levels. We expanded margins at both segments through strong operating leverage, improved productivity, and cost optimization. Based on our strong execution in the second quarter and an incrementally more positive view of our end markets, we have raised our full year adjusted EPS guidance. From an end market perspective, we are capitalizing on secular growth drivers across our industrial and municipal markets in Water Quality. In water analytics, our commercial initiatives are accelerating volume growth and market penetration, particularly in consumables. And in water treatment, we continue to see strong growth, driven by our customers' water conservation, reclaim, and reuse initiatives. On that front, ChemTreat was recently recognized as Industrial Supplies & Services Supplier of the Year by one of the largest global beverage companies. ChemTreat is playing an integral role in helping this customer achieve its sustainability targets through wastewater projects that support the reclamation of hundreds of millions of gallons of water annually. In PQI, we are encouraged by ongoing recovery in consumer packaged goods markets and improved sentiment from brand owners and packaging converters. In our marking and coding business, recurring revenue grew mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Notably, sales of marking and coding equipment accelerated during the quarter and grew on a year-over-year basis, with good traction on new product launches. One of those new products is Videojet's 2380 large character inkjet printer, which launched in early April and is off to an impressive start. This printer is designed for use on sustainable packaging materials, such as corrugated cardboard and other porous materials. Second quarter sales of the 2380 printer exceeded our expectations and we continue to build momentum through a robust sales funnel. In our packaging and color business, second quarter bookings were strong, driven in part by the success of new software launches unveiled at recent trade shows and industry events. At the Drupa Trade Show, our Esko, Pantone, and X-Rite teams jointly showcased their latest innovations and highlighted our seamless packaging workflow software and hardware solutions. At the event, Esko unveiled its S2 platform, a multi-tenant cloud-native platform that provides cloud computing, data sharing, and artificial intelligence. All Esko applications connect to this platform, giving all key stakeholders in the value chain access to live data and identical information wherever they are in the world. This integrated ecosystem will empower customers to compress workflows, harness cloud technology and artificial intelligence to accelerate speed-to-market with vital integrated color accuracy. This new technology helps our customers save time, reduce waste, and ensure brand fidelity. These workflow improvements help our customers minimize the environmental impact across their supply chains and achieve their sustainability objectives, while providing safe foods and trusted essential goods to their customers. This is a great example of the alignment between our product innovation and our purpose. Our work at Veralto is inspired by our unifying purpose, Safeguarding the World's Most Vital Resources. We live in a world with big challenges and Veralto plays a significant role in solving many of them. Helping customers ensure clean water, safe foods, and trusted essential goods for billions of people across the globe motivates all of us at Veralto each and every day. It inspires our associates who are drawn to Veralto because of the role our products and solutions play in helping preserve the planet, how we care for and invest in our people, and our efforts to minimize the environmental impact of our own operations. And it's easy to be inspired by the work that we do at Veralto. In 2023, our team helped ensure 3.4 billion people around the world had access to clean water for daily use, treat and recycle 13 trillion gallons of water, save 81 billion gallons of water, and ensure product authenticity and safety by helping customers mark and code over 10 billion products every day. In addition to these positive and enduring contributions, I want to highlight two important commitments featured in this year's Sustainability Report. First, in support of our commitment to minimize the environmental impact of our own operations, we disclosed our 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and committed to a 54.6% reduction goal by 2033. Second, in support of our commitment to drive a responsible supply chain, we set an initial target to have 40% of our supplier base certified through the EcoVadis program. EcoVadis is one of the leading sustainability rating agencies and will help us measure, assess, and improve the impact of our supply chain on the world. The role our products play in preserving the planet and the targets we have committed to achieve embody the culture and are made possible by our people. Our people are the most important part of our strategy and we invest heavily to recruit, develop, and retain the most talented and diverse team possible. Our 2024 Sustainability Report published earlier this week contains more details about our commitment and ability to deliver positive, enduring impact, and drive sustainable outcomes for the benefit of humanity. Now turning to our Q2 financial results. Before getting into the details, it's important to highlight a key underlying strength of Veralto, and that is the durability of our businesses. Approximately 85% of our sales are related to water, food, and essential goods. These are large attractive markets with steady growth, driven by strong secular trends. Our customers in these markets have an essential need for our products and solutions to support critical aspects of their daily operations where the risk of failure is high. Our durability is further bolstered by a razor-razorblade model, which drives a high level of recurring revenue, further catalyzed by VES. The CEO kaizen events we kicked off in Q1 are a strong proof point. These events, which focused on value-accretive growth, have already had a positive impact on our 2024 performance, evident in our second quarter results. On a consolidated basis, we exceeded our guidance on all fronts, with 3.8% core sales growth and 24% adjusted operating profit margin. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.85, up 6% year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. And we generated $240 million of free cash flow, further strengthening our financial position. Looking at core sales growth by geography in the second quarter, sales in the North America and high-growth markets grew in the mid-single digits and sales into Western Europe were essentially flat. In North America, core sales grew over 5%, driven by both segments. In Water Quality, we continued to capitalize on strong demand for our water treatment solutions, which grew high-single digits in North America. This growth was broad-based across most industrial verticals, with the strongest growth in food and beverage, mining and power generation. We also continue to see strong growth for UV systems at municipalities in North America. In Water Treatment, we're partnering with customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals related to water conservation, reclamation, and reuse. Our water treatment businesses are also well positioned in North America to support onshoring or reshoring activity, including tech operations, such as semiconductor fabs and data centers. Relative to North America, our PQI segment grew 3.5% in Q2. Packaging and color grew mid-single digits, with marking and coding up low-single digits. In high-growth markets, core sales grew by more than 4%. We continue to see strong growth in Latin America and India. And in China, core sales grew low-single digits year-over-year. In Western Europe, core sales were essentially flat year-over-year, including 50 basis point headwind related to the strategic portfolio actions in our Water Quality segment that we mentioned on prior earnings calls. Excluding this headwind, core sales into Western Europe were up modestly. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Sameer to provide more details on our Q2 performance and our guidance.
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the second quarter on Slide 8. Net sales grew 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to about $1.29 billion. Core sales grew 3.8%. Currency was an 80 basis points headwind or approximately $10 million. And the small divestiture of Salsnes was a modest headwind. Our core growth in this quarter was balanced, with both volume and price increases driving our growth. Price contributed 2% growth in this quarter, in line with our expectations and historical levels. Volume grew 1.8%, with positive volume growth across both Water Quality and PQI. This marks the first quarter since the second quarter of 2022 in which volume grew across both segments. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits year-over-year and comprised 62% of our total sales. We expanded margins at both segments through strong operational leverage, improved productivity, and cost optimization. Gross profit increased 7% year-over-year to $774 million. Gross profit margin improved 230 basis points year-over-year to 60%, reflecting the benefits of pricing, as well as improved productivity and reduced material costs. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points to 24%. We delivered strong margin expansion, while investing in our sales and marketing efforts to drive future growth. We also increased our R&D investments, with R&D as a percent of sales increasing 20 basis points over the prior-year period. These investments are aligned with our strategic growth plans and we expect to continue to fund ongoing growth investments. Looking at EPS for second quarter, adjusted earnings per share grew 6% year-over-year to $0.85. And free cash flow was $240 million, down from the prior year, primarily due to standalone public company costs and cash tax payments, which were not incurred in the prior-year period. Moving on, I'll cover the segment highlights, starting with Water Quality on Slide 9. Our Water Quality segment delivered $777 million of sales, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was an 80 basis points headwind and the divestiture of Salsnes had 40 basis points impact versus the prior-year period. In addition to this divestiture, small product lines that were strategically exited in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in approximately 80 basis points headwind to core growth for the Water Quality segment in the second quarter. Despite this headwind, core sales grew 4% year-over-year. Pricing contributed 2.4% and volume growth contributed 1.6% to year-over-year core sales growth. Our volume growth was driven by strong demand for water treatment solutions in our industrial end markets and UV treatment systems in municipal end markets. We also saw growth in sales of lab instrumentation, reagents, and chemistries to municipalities. Recurring sales across the Water Quality segment grew mid-single digits. Adjusted operating profit increased 5.5% year-over-year to $192 million, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 24.7%. The increase in profitability and margin reflects strong pricing execution, leverage on volume growth, and improved productivity. To a lesser extent, our adjusted operating profit margin also benefited from a favorable sales mix this quarter. Moving to the next page, our PQI segment delivered sales of $511 million in the second quarter, up 2.7% year-over-year. Currency was a 70 basis point headwind. Core sales grew 3.4%. Positive volume contributed 2% growth and price increases contributed 1.4% to the year-over-year core sales growth. PQI's recurring sales grew mid-single digits year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter with growth across the portfolio. Recurring revenue increased to 63% of PQI sales mix in the second quarter of this year. Breaking this down by business, core sales growth in our marking and coding business was in line with the segment, driven by growth in both consumables and equipment. This growth was driven by both CPG and industrial end markets. In our packaging and color business, core sales grew about 3% year-over-year, led by growth in recurring software and subscription revenue. PQI's adjusted operating profit was $141 million in the second quarter, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 27.6%. That represents a 100 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin over the prior-year period. This was another quarter of margin improvement for PQI, driven by the strong operating leverage, particularly on the recurring revenue growth and productivity improvements. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $251 million of cash from operations and invested $11 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $240 million in the quarter, or 118% conversion of GAAP net income. As of June 28, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was just over $1 billion. Net debt was $1.6 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.3 times. In summary, our financial position is strong. We have flexibility in how we deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value with a bias towards M&A. Turning now to our guidance for 2024, beginning with our updated expectations for the full year. We increased our full year guidance to reflect our strong second quarter execution and incrementally positive view of our end markets. For core sales growth, our target remains low-single digits, however, we are trending towards the high end of low-single digits. Through the first half of 2024, core sales growth was 2.8%. For the second half, we are targeting core sales growth in the low to mid-single digits range, similar to what we achieved in the second quarter. Looking at adjusted operating profit margin for the full year, we now expect to deliver approximately 75 basis points margin expansion year-over-year, which would put our full year adjusted operating profit margin at about 24%. This implies an incremental margin or fall-through of around 50%. For adjusted EPS, we raised our full year guidance range to $3.37 to $3.45 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 7% growth year-over-year and is $0.11 or about 3.5% higher than our previous guidance. And our guidance for free cash flow conversion remains in the range of 100% to 110% of GAAP net income. Looking at our guidance for Q3, we are targeting core sales growth in the low-to-mid single digits on a year-over-year basis. At the midpoint of our Q3 guidance, we are modeling a core growth rate similar to second quarter. We expect adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 23.5% in the third quarter. This represents 100 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating profit margin on a year-over-year basis. And our Q3 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.82 to $0.86 per share. At the midpoint, that represents double-digit year-over-year growth. With that, I'll hand the call back to Jennifer for closing remarks.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Sameer. In summary, we are executing well across the company with greater focus and rigor using VES, and we are capitalizing on the secular growth drivers in our key end markets. We delivered a strong second quarter across the board, with core sales growth approaching mid-single digits, continued margin expansion, and strong cash generation. Based on the strength of our execution and positive view of our end markets, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance. As we look longer term, we remain committed to creating value through steady, durable sales growth, continuous improvement, and disciplined capital allocation. That concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hey. Good morning, Jennifer, Sameer, and Ryan.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning.
Scott Davis: I've got to ask -- good morning. I got to ask about the gross margins just because they've been so incredible, strong. Is -- A, I guess, is 60% the new normal or is that just more of kind of a shorter-term impact? And second, maybe I heard the word price in the context of pricing power more on this quarter and last one, too, than we would have thought in the past. And are you finding there's just more pricing power in your markets maybe than you thought you had before and that's driving that 60% gross margin. Is that a fair takeaway?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. Scott, let me just touch on the margin and then I'll have Jennifer just talk about the price. On the gross margin side, it's really been really in -- the increased rigor on VES really driving the execution side. Frankly, it's been lots of singles and doubles that are driving the margin here. And also, as you see, we are benefiting a little bit from the recurring revenue here, right? The mix is more towards consumables to the spares, which is impacting and helping us on the margin. The packaging and color business, as you know, that tends to be on the software side with a little higher margin. So, that's helping us. So, those things are helping us. I would say, you should expect the gross margins to come in a little bit as the growth rate equilibrates between the equipment and consumables overtime. But we feel really good about 60%, but I think once the transition happens, we'll be more in the high-50% or 59% growth range.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. And I think, Scott, what you're seeing relative to price is our ability to sort of hold the value of our products in terms of commercial excellence related to VES. So the teams commercially are executing well around the world, but we have seen price normalize to historical levels, which we believe fit in the range of 100 bps to 200 bps.
Scott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. And just I feel obligated to ask about M&A. I know these things are lumpy and it's hard to kind of talk about it, but any update on maybe your pipeline and your enthusiasm about the assets that are out there?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. We remain pretty convicted about our M&A approach. We've got really robust funnels for both PQI and Water Quality. We're looking at a lot of assets and we're actively engaged in our market activity here. But consistent with what we've said on prior calls, we're really going to stay close to our heritage and the disciplined capital allocation around market, company, and valuation. So we obviously like businesses that have similar operating models and secular durability, financial profiles that look like us, and certainly businesses where we think VES can add value. So we're active here. We're excited about the space. We're working hard kind of on both sides of the fence, and more to come.
Scott Davis: Yeah. Best of luck. Congrats on the first two quarters here of the year.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Good morning. Hey, I'll echo…
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Scott's comments, that's a clean quarter, kind of hard to find anything to quibble about. So maybe I'll start with product quality. Your primary competitor had some similar results yesterday in terms of strong aftermarket, but it looks like your printer sales are stronger. I know the 2380 sounds like that was a boost. Just can you comment on the mix and the go-forward, especially with the recovery expected in the consumer packaging goods?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Deane. Our PQI businesses in the main are performing well. I think you see that both in terms of our marking and coding businesses. You also see it on our color and packaging side. We're not going to comment really on competitors' activity, but what we can say is, our marking and coding businesses are performing well and I think in line with the recovery of the consumer packaged goods market. So we see this fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit recurring revenue growth. And we also see, as you rightly point out, Q2 marking the return of growth in equipment sales. And so, this follows a nominal recovery that we see when we're coming out of a down cycle where consumables and by way of inks and solvents and spare parts and so on recover before equipment does. We're excited about the funnel that we have for equipment. And certainly, as we talk to our CPG customers, they are -- their sentiment is more positive in terms of the future outlook. From a packaging and color standpoint, we've just finished the Drupa Trade Show, where we got a lot of positive response in terms of the products being launched there, mostly around our S2 native-cloud, digital integrated solutions. This really helps reduce time-to-market for the brands. It also helps mistake-proof relative to the information that they're passing around between their functional departments. So, funnels are healthy on both sides. The market recovery in terms of CPG itself is a little bit lumpy. We do see mixed results across various CPG categories. But certainly, we're encouraged by the market indicators and I think our teams are executing well with recent product launches, and our new product innovations really are gaining momentum.
Deane Dray: It's all very helpful. And just a geographic question. Just for both businesses, what was the sense of demand in China and the outlook? The expectation is that you all have a very defensive type of mix there, but will you feel any of the ongoing pressures in the economy over the next couple of quarters?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I think, Deane, our view of China hasn't materially changed from quarter-to-quarter. I think we believe that China has stabilized related to the end markets, but we don't expect to see any meaningful recovery in China this year. I think for state-owned or state-sponsored municipalities, funding is still extraordinarily tight. So we're not seeing much money flow there. I think long term, China is anticipated to improve. It's got a large and aging population. Those folks are going to require clean water, safe food, and trusted medicines. But our China team has stepped up to the challenge here in the slower growth macro and we continue to ensure that we have a China business that's creating incremental value for Veralto.
Sameer Ralhan: And then, Deane, from a guide perspective, effectively, you assume China will be sequentially flat, right? So, as you know, we were down quite a bit in the Q3 and Q4. So you're going to see a little bit of an uptake on a year-over-year basis as we kind of get into the second half, but sequentially, it's effectively flat.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning, Andy.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Andy.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Jennifer, Sameer, you raised your revenue guidance by $100 million for '24, I think, versus last quarter's forecast. So, maybe just give us a little more color into what markets are better than you expected. I know you just talked about Videojet equipment starting to accelerate. What are you baking now -- baking in now for the second half of that improvement? And then in Water Quality, is it more that water treatment is driving continued strong momentum, or are you seeing more improvement in water analytics?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I mean, I think we see strength across the board, really. We benefit, I think, from a couple of areas here. One is just the markets that we're in and the quality of the products we bring to market being part of the essential nature of customer operations. I think the deployment of VES and the increased focus that we have as a standalone company continues to help us execute well commercially. From a macro standpoint, on where the demand is occurring, water and municipalities, particularly in US and Europe, continue to execute on project backlog in terms of improvements to their respective plants and their run rate business is steady. We do see some nice pockets of growth coming for our water treatment businesses and see some tailwind and some benefit from things like CHIPS Act in terms of build out their data centers, which are requiring an extensive amount of water in their cooling towers. And those kind of two markets really benefit our ChemTreat and our Trojan businesses, respectively. So we're seeing good sort of solid, steady, robust demand really for both water treatment and Water Quality.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then Jennifer, just going back to M&A, like, I know timing is always difficult, but would you expect to get something done this year? And then under what conditions would you do a larger deal where you may potentially raise equity?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I think you are right that M&A is clearly episodic. We can't guarantee the intersection of when we will see market, company, and valuation come together. As we've mentioned in the past, we're going to stay disciplined to that approach. We have to like the market, right? It's got to be adjacent or near adjacent to where we play. The company has got to be a strong company that has secular drivers that we value under the umbrella of Safeguarding the World's Most Vital Resources, and we got to be able to get at the right price. I think right now, valuations are still a little bit inflated. So we're looking at the intersection here, but we've got to fundamentally get to all three of those variables. And all I can say is, we're working hard in this area.
Sameer Ralhan: And Andy, just going to look, think about the equity side, it's just one of the components of how we think about funding any transaction. The main thing is value creation, right? Anything that can ultimately help us create long-term value, we'll look at all forms of funding, as we have kind of talked in the past. Main thing for us as we're going to think of any kind of funding is maintaining investment-grade balance sheets. That's sacrosanct for us.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on the free cash flow side. Obviously, a really strong quarter for you there and hitting kind of conversion levels that are above what you're certainly looking for the year. I guess, can you help us to think about what drove that? And if that -- if we see more things that you can kind of wring out from, whether it's a working capital side to kind of keep that level elevated for the next couple of quarters, how should we be thinking about that?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, John. Thanks for that. As you kind of look at the free cash flow conversion, quarter-to-quarter, it can vary. As you know, we have the bond payments that come in, in the first quarter and the third quarter. So that gets -- impacts timing of the cash payments. So I would say, when you look at the free cash flow conversion, really look at it on a full year basis. Overall, given the strength that we're seeing in the business, the execution, we feel pretty good about delivering 100% to 110% free cash flow conversion, that's off GAAP net income.
John McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then just a question on SG&A. It took a reasonable jump up, somewhere in the 7.5% kind of range. I guess, can you help us to think about how much of that is just general labor, inflationary type trends versus the corporate side, where now you're a public company versus investment for growth? I guess, how should we be thinking about the various buckets there?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. I think it's -- let's take it in two buckets, right? One is -- first, on the business side, as we kind of told you, right, at the beginning of the year, we will be we -- are investing in the sales and marketing side to really drive the growth of the business, and you've seen that kind of really coming through or flowing through the numbers in the first quarter and second quarter. John, inflation is there a little bit, I think, just like everybody else. There's nothing outsized. But it's -- these are really heads that are added more on the sales and marketing side to drive the growth, and you started seeing a little bit of the impact and more in the 2025 that you're going to see. So I would say, on the business side, we are more or less in a normalized state, so to speak, and SG&A as a percent of revenues. On the corporate side, we were very judicious in how we bring the cost in. So what you're going to see is more of a run rate view of the corporate expenses in the second half of the year. So there's going to be a little uptick in the second half versus the first year that you're going to see on the corporate side, but that should normalize in the second half. So, nothing extraordinary on that front.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Halloran of Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Mike.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So, just some thoughts on the product rationalization side of things, some of the initiatives you're doing there. Maybe just how far along do you think you are in that journey in general? Have most of the areas been identified already, or do you think that there's more to come on that side of things?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I think, Mike, what you've seen us do here is just pruning around the edges, right, and this is actually part of standard work that we do day-in and day-out in managing the portfolio of the businesses. It's not an -- it's not something that we look at on an episodic basis. We're looking at this all the time. So, I would say, when we see opportunities for continued portfolio evolution to get us a stronger portfolio, focused in the higher areas of growth with higher margin and recurring revenue, anything that falls materially far away from that profile is something that we'll take action on. So we feel good about the portfolio we have today. We'll continue to prune around the edges as and when we see that it's appropriate to do so.
Mike Halloran: Makes sense. And then just to follow up on, I think, Andy's question earlier, when you think about the greater confidence going into the back half of the year, has anything actually changed, or is this just about starting to see the momentum into this year, first quarter, and is actually having to materialize that gives you extra confidence? In other words, has there any -- been really any change in your thinking about how these end markets are going to progress?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Well, I think we've come out of a pretty tumultuous several years following the impact of the pandemic, Mike. And we saw a lot of whiplash, right, in terms of price and volume and demand cycles and consumer spending and what they were spending on and so on. I would say that our confidence is built more as a function of an enduring steady state for our Water Quality businesses, driven by the secular drivers that we've talked about and an incrementally improving macro here for consumer products, goods markets. 85% of our revenue goes into water, food, and pharmaceuticals, and provided that those markets are steady or improving, we're going to see that benefit.
Mike Halloran: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess…
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee: The first one on -- hey, Sameer, good morning. Sameer or maybe Jennifer, you mentioned during your prepared remarks some favorable mix, I think, in the Water Quality segment that might have helped margins. Can you elaborate any -- on that, and is that something that either you can quantify or, as you think about the next few quarters, is that expected to persist.
Sameer Ralhan: Hey, Brian. Yeah. I'll take that one. The mix comment is really around consumables. We've seen a good amount of consumable uptick that's driving it. As you've seen, our recurring revenue is almost at 62% right now and that is predominantly mix and a little bit of spares and the -- some of the SaaS software side, but predominantly consumables. If you recall and go back into the history, when things are more normalized, that tends to be in the high-50s, right. So that kind of helps you dimensionalize now the transition as the volume comes back on the printer side, in PQI, instrumentation side, on the Water Quality side, it's going to be a multi-quarter journey as we kind of move. So, you're not going to see a big variation quarter-to-quarter, but that sort of 62% versus high-50s is the way to dimensionalize the change over time.
Brian Lee: All right. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then I know you're talking about improving end markets kind of across the board. Jennifer made some comments around the strong backlog trends in Water Quality. Can you maybe talk a bit more specifically around -- I think you had comments in the release about strong bookings in packaging and color. Our understanding is that that's more of a short cycle business. So, where is the visibility? Are those the areas where you're seeing trends improving as well? Just kind of any commentary on the short cycle side of your business? Thank you, guys.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. Relative to packaging and color, as we mentioned, we've just concluded our Drupa Trade Show. That's a trade show that runs once every four years. And given the pandemic, this is the first time that show has been conducted in eight years. So there were some really good kind of pent-up demand that we saw there. But I think our solutions and, particularly those around innovation that we're providing in the S2 cloud-native digital integration of the workflow has got the attention of a lot of brand owners, because they are under pressure to compress their development cycles and ensure the integrity of the information that they're working with, which gives every user of that system access to the same information. So we had a great showing there. The teams -- all three teams in terms of Esko, Pantone, and X-Rite really did a great job there. And I think the -- outside of the enthusiasm generated in Drupa, the recovery of the CPG markets will lend itself to new product releases and new product innovations from brand owners. So they are getting ready. They have a number of projects that they're considering in terms of new product releases and so on and so forth. And so, this is the front end of that. And I think we're well positioned to be able to help them with their solutions.
Brian Lee: Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on.
Operator: We'll move next to Brad Hewitt of Wolfe Research.
Brad Hewitt: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Brad.
Brad Hewitt: So, I guess, I wanted to start on the margin side of things. Your guidance implies about a 50 basis point step-down in margins in Q3 versus Q2 despite the fact that revenue, I think, should be flat to slightly up sequentially. And then also your trade show expenses should step down quarter-over-quarter. So, just curious if you can talk about kind of the drivers of the sequential margin pressure there.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, Brad. This is Sameer. Effectively, really two things here. The first one is the mix comment that you made earlier. Our mix is pretty rich in consumables and recurring revenue right now. We have started seeing some good, encouraging signs on the equipment side. We said in the second quarter, we finally see -- saw a positive revenue growth on the equipment side. So we've modeled in kind of a decent equipment growth in the Q3 and second half of the year. So mix impact is what's kind of flowing through here. And the other one I would say is really on the corporate side. As we kind of get into the second half of the year, we are going to be getting more towards the run rate expenses on the corporate expenses. So that's impacting the margin side as well. So it's really those two things that are impacting the margin.
Brad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, going back to the long-term incremental margin framework of 30% to 35%, I know that includes kind of some reinvestment in the business. But just given the strong execution on VES since the spin, as well as the implied 50% incremental margins this year despite volume growth kind of in the 1% to 2% zone, does that give you confidence on perhaps something more like 40%-plus incrementals going forward over the medium term?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. No. Thanks for that. Look, I mean, it's first of all, really kudos to all our teams, all our 16,000 people that are really helping drive this kind of fall-through that you're seeing, right? Really proud of what we've been able to achieve this year. But as you kind of think about 30% to 35% is really on the -- over the longer term, right? We do want to incorporate in that long-term value creation algorithm, a healthy investment mix from the sales side, from R&D side. So I think from a long-term value framework perspective, I think still 30% to 35% is the right way to look at it. But I think -- and in the near term, really good performance and execution of the teams is driving a fall-through close to 50%.
Brad Hewitt: Great. Thanks, Sameer.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: I guess, I'll follow up on that last question. You guys have made it pretty clear that you intend to continue to invest in growth here. Can you talk about what you think the growth rates will be in kind of investment in commercial resources, investment in sales, investment in R&D kind of over the next several years rather than just any one year to the next?
Sameer Ralhan: No. I think as you kind of think about long term, Nathan, these investments should be supportive of the mid-single digit growth framework, right? And that is 4% to 6% kind of a range, as we have kind of talked about. So as when we think about that mid-single digit growth framework, we do reflect the incremental contribution coming from these investments on the sales and marketing side, as well as on the R&D side, right? This is a technology-heavy business as you kind of think about in the commercial execution business. So those investments are key as we kind of think about long-term sustainable value creation.
Nathan Jones: So, you would be looking at kind of that kind of mid-single digit growth in those investments as revenue?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah.
Nathan Jones: Now, look, the other question I had…
Sameer Ralhan: It kind of depends, right -- just to make sure, Nathan, right, it -- on average, right, this is a cumulative thing that we're looking at. Of course, the new investment should be incrementally driving higher growth from their side, but some things fall out of the portfolio, too.
Nathan Jones: Got it. The other question I wanted to ask is on the recycle, reuse, reclaim market driver. I think that is likely to be a pretty considerable driver of investment from industrial water users. So I'm hoping you could talk a little bit more about where Veralto plays, kind of how much of your revenue that makes up where you think it could go to over the next five-year to 10-year kind of time frame, long-term growth rate you're expecting out of that, just because I think that's going to be a pretty good driver of incremental demand.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Nathan. We do see great demand here in recycle, reclaim, and reuse. The businesses most impacted by that certainly is our Trojan business who is well positioned there to help customers with their sustainability initiatives in this space. ChemTreat also has a play here. And certainly, if you're going to be moving water around, you're going to have to test it as well. So it does create some opportunity for our analytics businesses. But the primary beneficiary really of this opportunity would be our Trojan business. And frankly, we see this space growing probably mid-to-high single digits for the foreseeable future. Lots of industries are under pressure to achieve their sustainability targets, and we're well positioned with solutions to help them.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Krill of Deutsche Bank.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Krill: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to circle back on margins again from a little bit more of the medium-term perspective. I know there's been a lot of discussion just that the company has meaningfully more opportunities to improve margins than might be improved -- appreciated by investors. Just can you update us any of, like, the findings you've had since the spin on that and whether you would consider explicitly quantifying those at any point? And then would you also say, is there more opportunity in one segment versus the other or do you think it's kind of similar? Thanks.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. Andrew, thanks for that. As you kind of look at the opportunities on the margin expansion, right, this is -- the work that the teams have been doing on the procurement side, really our folks on the front lines and the shop floor, on the factory optimization, so these are lots of singles and doubles. As I said earlier in the call, it's not one or two factors that are driving this margin expansion. And that, frankly, really is the beauty of the kaizen culture, right? That's where you're going to see the margin contribution coming in. Those efforts really that the teams have been doing and execution that is happening is giving us the confidence to really up the bar on the margin expansion for the full year or we have -- instead of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, what we've said -- raised the guidance to is 75 basis point margin expansion for the full year this year. So that should get the full year pretty much close to 24% on the operating earnings margin.
Andrew Krill: Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then can you give us an update on the situation in Argentina and maybe just how much contingency, if you will, you have left in your guidance for the full year? And then, I guess, depending on how that shakes out the rest of the year, how that could help or hurt PQI margins in the back half? Thanks.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. Very brief, right, Andrew, as you kind of look at Argentina, as we said at the Q1 call, we did the Blue Chip Swap to really insulate any impact on the historical cash that really drove the impact last year. But as you kind of move into this year, effectively, our exposure is much smaller, and that's reflected in the guide.
Andrew Krill: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia of BNP.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: I'm just looking at your guidance and trying to map out the ranges. And looking at the high end, I'm wondering kind of what's contemplating or what informs the high end of your guidance? Because it's difficult to get there. So, you either need sales to accelerate for some reason or maybe you have some extra margin expansion in your back pocket. I guess, of those two or what -- what's behind that high end is my question.
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. No, thanks for that. It really comes down to how you're going to think about the CPG markets, right? CPG markets are evolving, incrementally becoming positive, but it's a pretty fast-changing views that we are seeing. So I think, as you kind of look at the guidance range, one of the big drivers is how we kind of think about the CPG markets and the impact they will have on the on the PQI topline. I would say -- if there's one thing I can say, that's one of the key things. And then on the margin side, right, I mean, there's always the raw material price versus raw material contribution we always look at. We believe we have baked in a pretty prudent view here. So, any benefit from that will be more enduring towards the high end of the range.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. That's helpful. And yeah, I wanted to ask, any update on the PFAS regulation opportunity in terms of whether anything new around your discussions with customers or -- I know you guys are talking about product development. Just what's the latest there?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. We continue to be interested in this space. But as you know, this is an incredibly difficult and complex problem to solve. We believe that we're well positioned, given our 70-year history at Hach for democratizing tests and analytics and our long track record at Trojan for developing treatment solutions. So we continue to invest in this space and stay focused there, but real fit-for-purpose solutions that are focused on at-site or in-line testing and at-site real-time destruction of PFAS are going to be -- remain a difficult problem to solve. But we're focused on creating winning outcomes for our customers that have fit-for-purpose solutions. So, still a few years away here, but we are interested in the space, as we are with sort of all of the micro-contaminants that come into the regulation frame.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano of TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was interested in the industrial growth commentary. It's just we're not hearing that in a lot of places, right? Industrial data is pretty bad and most companies, we're seeing orders decline. So it was interesting and good to see that there. Can you kind of -- what's driving that? Is it new project ramps? Is it -- like, is it optimization at existing facilities? Like, what's the nature of this kind of growth there? Because it does seem somewhat unique.
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I think what you're seeing here is that there's really three things that differentiate us from other industrials. We play in the end markets with really attractive and kind of non-optional secular growth drivers, right? So, when you've got a business that's 85% of our sales into food, water, and pharma, it's -- these are not elective areas of testing, right? So these are really durable markets. And as a consequence, the way our businesses have been built are durable in turn. 60% of our recurring revenue or 60% of our revenue is kind of in this recurring revenue space. It's a razor-razorblade business model with high-margin consumables. And these products and services that are deployed for our customers are essential parts of their operation. So, if they choose not to use our products or they choose not to treat and measure and monitor and so on, the cost of failure to them is high, because we're really tied to sort of product quality and public health. So the last thing I would say is, VES provides a competitive advantage for us really in terms of differentiating us relative to talent growth and continuous improvement.
Joe Giordano: And then just last for me on the margins. So, we touched on this a bunch, but with gross margins at 60%, it's excellent. If I look at the spread between gross margins and EBITDA, 30% in SG&A seems a little high, like you're a newer company. Like, long term, what's like a real -- realistic level that that should normalize out at?
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah. Joe, I'll take that one. It's really the sales and marketing, right? If you -- just to take you back, effectively, when you look at the P&L, it really aligns with how we create value in the business. It's more driven by investments in R&D, it's a technology-driven business, and then on the commercial side, right? The secret sauce, what we believe and our competitive strength, is a direct business model that effectively does result in the sales and marketing that you -- impact that you see on -- in the numbers. Overall, we feel really good about our business model that is more direct, and it really drives a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd be happy to return the conference to Ryan Taylor for closing comments.
Ryan Taylor: Thank you, Leo, and thanks for everybody that joined us on the call today. We really appreciate your engagement and the discussion. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any more follow-ups. Thanks again for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone, have a great day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: My name is [ Shelby ], and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Veralto Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
 [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your conference. 
Ryan Taylor: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. The replay of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations. A replay of this call will be available until May 8, 2024.
 Before we begin, I'd like to point out that yesterday, we issued our first quarter news release, earnings presentation and supplemental materials, including information required by the SEC relating to any adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. These materials are available in the Investors section of our website, www.veralto.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis.
 During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.
 Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you all for joining our call today. The first quarter of 2024 marks our second consecutive quarter of solid operating execution as a stand-alone company. We are driving steady, profitable growth and continuous improvement through greater focus and accountability using VES fundamentals, basic blocking and tackling.
 For Q1, we delivered 8% adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, driven by 2% core sales growth and 90 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and we exceeded our guidance across the board. Our financial performance reflects our culture of continuous improvement and demonstrates our ability to deliver on commitments.
 From an end market perspective, we are seeing healthy trends across our key verticals. In our Water Quality segment, we continue to see positive secular growth drivers across industrial markets, particularly in North America, along with steady demand at municipalities. And in our Product Quality & Innovation segment, we are seeing modest signs of recovery in consumer packaged goods markets.
 Most notably, PQI's recurring revenue grew mid-single digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. Equipment bookings for marking and coding started to show signs of recovery late in the first quarter, and we continue to see encouraging trends at some of our large CPG customers led by food and beverage.
 Based on our first quarter results and improving market trends, we continue to expect our core sales growth rate to modestly improve sequentially throughout the year.
 Looking at our full year guidance, we are on pace to deliver low single-digit core sales growth and are trending toward the high end of our adjusted operating margin range of 50 to 75 basis points of improvement over 2023. As a result, we have modestly increased our full year adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion guidance. Sameer will cover that in more detail a bit later in the call.
 Confidence in our ability to deliver on commitments is, in large part, grounded in the Veralto enterprise system. Our proven system for driving growth, operational improvements and leadership development. A core tenet of the VES is continuous improvement or Kaizen.
 During March, we completed Veralto's first CEO Kaizen week as a stand-alone company. CEO Kaizen week is a long-standing tradition of our enterprise system and personally one of my favorite weeks of the year. The purpose of this year's CEO Kaizen week was to drive value-accretive growth. For one week, we immersed 12 cross-functional teams at Gemba where the real work happens across 6 businesses in 5 countries.
 The Veralto executive team worked alongside associates in our operating companies to solve some of the most complex challenges and yield high-impact results. For example, this year's event included increasing customer engagement in North America and EMEA to drive incremental sales growth of Hachs consumables.
 Improving the customer buying experience at Videojet to accelerate key growth initiatives and using lean conversion tools for make-to-stock products at a Hach distribution facility in North America to optimize efficiency, improve on-time delivery and meet increasing customer demand. The benefits of any Kaizen week include immediate solutions that are rapidly implemented and yield real-time results. Success is proven by sustaining these results, which we track following the Kaizen event.
 From a big picture perspective, this year's CEO Kaizen week, fortified our ability to deliver on our commitments to key stakeholders and reinforce that at Veralto, we are all practitioners of continuous improvement.
 Turning now to our financial results for the quarter. Core sales grew 1.8% year-over-year, led by price increases across both segments and modest volume growth in our Water Quality segment led by our industrial water treatment businesses. Notably, both segments delivered recurring sales growth in the mid-single digits year-over-year, increasing our percentage of recurring sales to 61% of total sales in the quarter. As compared to our guidance, we exceeded core sales growth expectations due to strong commercial execution and better-than-expected volume at both segments, particularly within consumables.
 On the margin front, we delivered 90 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion primarily through price execution, productivity improvements and cost optimization. Adjusted EPS was $0.84 per share up 8% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, and we generated over $100 million of free cash flow, further strengthening our financial position.
 Looking now at core sales growth by geography for the first quarter. Sales in North America grew over 3% year-over-year with sales in high-growth markets flat and sales in Western Europe down about 1%. In North America, we continue to see strong growth in our water treatment businesses across industrial verticals, including food and beverage, chemical processing, mining and power generation.
 We also continued to see strong demand for municipal customers for UV treatment systems. In Western Europe, core sales were down modestly year-over-year, primarily due to timing of UV system projects and the strategic portfolio actions in our Water Quality segment that we mentioned in our Q4 earnings call. Apart from these 2 items, core sales in Western Europe were steady year-over-year in both segments.
 In high-growth markets, core sales were essentially flat year-over-year as growth in Latin America and India was offset by low single-digit decline in China as anticipated. Despite the year-over-year headwind in Q1, we believe our end market environment in China has stabilized.
 That concludes my opening remarks. And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Sameer for a detailed review of our first quarter financial performance. 
Sameer Ralhan: Good morning, everyone. I will begin with our consolidated results for the first quarter on Slide 7. First quarter net sales grew 1.8% on a year-over-year basis to about $1.25 billion. Currency was a modest benefit, offset by the divestiture of Salsnes product line. Salsnes was a small commodity filter product line in our Water Quality segment that was divested in January.
 Core sales growth in Q1 was 1.8%. Price contributed approximately 2% growth in this quarter, in line with expectations. This aggregate price increase is also in line with historical levels. Volume was down a modest 40 basis points year-over-year. This was better than we expected, primarily due to higher sales volumes of consumables and both segments during the quarter. Gross profit increased 6% year-over-year to $747 million. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points year-over-year to 60%, reflecting the benefits of pricing as well as improved productivity and reduced material costs.
 Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year. and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 90 basis points to 24.5%. We delivered strong margin expansion while investing in our sales and marketing efforts to drive future growth. We also increased our R&D investment to 4.8% of sales, up 20 basis points over the prior year period. These investments are aligned with our strategic growth plans and we expect to continue to fund ongoing growth investments.
 Looking at EPS for Q1. Adjusted earnings per share grew 8% year-over-year to $0.84, and free cash flow was $102 million, down from the prior year. This decline is primarily due to cash interest payments that we did not incur last year prior to our spin-off.
 Moving on, I will cover the segment highlights, starting with Water Quality on Slide 9. Our Water Quality segment delivered $749 million of sales, up 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was neutral and the divestiture of Salsnes had 10 basis point impact on sales this quarter versus the prior year period. In addition to this divestiture, we strategically exited small product lines in our Water Quality segment in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 As we previously mentioned on the earnings call in February, Exiting these product lines resulted in approximately 60 basis points headwind to core growth for the segment in this quarter. Despite this headwind, core sales grew 2.8% year-over-year as compared to 11% core sales growth in the prior year period, bringing the 2-year core sales growth stack for Water Quality segment to about 7%. Pricing contributed 2.6% to core sales growth and volume was up 30 basis points year-over-year.
 This is the first quarter of volume growth for Water Quality since Q1 2023. Our volume growth in this year's first quarter was driven by strong demand for our water treatment solutions in industrial end markets and UV treatment systems in municipal end markets.
 Recurring sales across the segment grew mid-single digits, highlighted by increased sales of reagents and chemistries used in our analytical instruments at municipalities in North America. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% or $16 million year-over-year to $186 million. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 150 basis points RECONNECT to 24.8%. The increase in profitability reflects solid pricing execution and improved productivity. Moving to the next page.
 Our PQI segment delivered sales of $497 million in the first quarter, up modestly versus the prior year period. Core sales were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis as price increases of 1.5% were largely offset by 1.3% decline in volumes.
 Recurring sales grew mid-single digits with growth across the portfolio, increasing the mix of recurring sales for PQI to 63% in Q1. In Packaging and Color, sales were up low single digits year-over-year, highlighted by growth in recurring software and subscription revenue. In contrast, marketing and coding sales declined modestly, reflecting lower demand from CPG customers as compared to Q1 2023.
 This decline, however, was less than what we had anticipated in our guidance. As Jennifer mentioned, we continue to see modest signs of recovery in CPG markets with consumable sales up mid-single digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter and equipment bookings showing pockets of improvement.
 We remain cautiously optimistic that CPG volumes will improve sequentially as the year progresses. PQI adjusted operating profit was $139 million in the first quarter resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 28%. This was a strong margin performance for PQI and demonstrates the earnings power of these businesses.
 Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. In Q1, we generated $115 million of cash from operations and invested $13 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $102 million in the quarter. Note, this included about $57 million of cash interest payments, which we did not incur in Q1 2023 prior to our spin-off.
 At the end of the quarter, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was $827 million. Net debt was $1.8 billion resulting in net leverage of 1.5x. In summary, we further strengthened our financial position during the quarter and have ample liquidity. This gives us flexibility in how we deploy our capital to create long-term shareholder value with a bias towards M&A.
 Turning now to our guidance for 2024. Beginning with our updated expectations for the full year. As Jennifer mentioned, we are on track to deliver our target of low single-digit core sales growth at the enterprise level and in both segments. We're targeting 100 to 200 basis points of price, consistent with historical pre-pandemic levels. From a sequential perspective, our guidance assumes that year-over-year core sales growth increases modestly quarter-to-quarter through 2024.
 Looking at adjusted operating profit margin, our target remains 50 to 75 basis points of improvement this year. Based on our Q1 performance, we are trending towards the high end of this range. Given our Q1 results and current view on margin improvement for the year, we have increased our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.25 to $3.34 per share, up from our prior guidance range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. In addition, we increased our free cash flow conversion guidance to a range of 100% to 110%.
 Looking at our guidance for Q2, we are targeting core sales growth in low single digits on a year-over-year basis, with adjusted operating margin of approximately 23% and our Q2 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.75 to $0.80 per share.
 That concludes my prepared remarks. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Jennifer for closing remarks before we open up the call for questions. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: In summary, as a stand-alone company, we have increased focus, discipline and accountability across all levels of the enterprise, which has elevated our level of execution. We are driving continuous improvement and investing in future growth as our end market environment gradually improves. We are off to a positive start in 2024 with solid growth and strong margin expansion in the first quarter.
 Our financial position remains strong and we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital deployment with our primary focus on strategic acquisitions with attractive returns.
 Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving commercial excellence, continuous improvement and disciplined capital allocation to create shareholder value while safeguarding the world's most vital resources.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. I want to thank you all again for joining our call. And at this time, we're happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: The 60% gross margin is a pretty incredible number when you really think about the mix of businesses you have. But should we think about this as kind of high watermark or would you think about it as more of a step up into a new level of entitlement? How do you guys think about it? 
Sameer Ralhan: Maybe I'll take that one, Scott. Overall, as you got to look at margin perspective, some of it comes down deliver of a mix. I think it's still going to be in the 58% to 60% kind of ZIP code.
 As Jennifer mentioned on the call earlier, we saw good sort of a rebound in the consumables in both sides that really helps us on the margin side, both in the Water Quality and PQI side. But as kind of equipment starts coming back at the rest of the year and the second half of the year, we should be in that 58% to 60% kind of ZIP code. 
Scott Davis: And just following on a little bit to a comment you made, Jennifer, on increasing accountability. I understanding has always been that the Danaher business system always drove a pretty high level of accountability. How have you tweaked it to even raise that to a different level? And what kind of changes have you made when you think about just tightening things up for the assets that you have here? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think it's always challenging to provide an equal level of focus across a very, very large enterprise like Danaher has I think a smaller, more nimble $5 billion business, obviously, allows us to focus exclusively on these businesses, whereas there were many more factors sort of previously with the life sciences and diagnostics side in Danaher.
 And so some of the things that we've done here is we've just -- we've raised the level of not only expectation but visibility to how we're operating, the tools that we're using by way of VES, and we're really focusing on the critical few.
 Every business is a little bit different. Their evolutionary maturity is a little bit different. And as a result, we focus on using fit-for-purpose tools in our VES toolbox to make sure that we're elevating the level of performance of each of those businesses. 
Scott Davis: Congrats on the quarter. Good luck this year. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Jennifer and Sameer, how are you feeling about the PQI recovery at this point? I know you mentioned North America and Western Europe, you continue to see signs of recovery. You talked about equipment demand coming back late in the quarter. Maybe you could elaborate on that equipment trend. Have you seen follow through in that food and beverage recovery that started, I think, in Q4? And how are you factoring in China-related growth in that segment for the rest of the year? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. We're really encouraged by the PQI performance here in Q1, particularly around our consumable revenue stream or recurring revenue. Is this the third sequential quarter that we've seen mid-single-digit growth there. And with regard to sort of how those markets, particularly in food and beverage, recover from a downturn, we will always see the consumable revenue stream ramp first.
 And that's as a result of CPG customers coming back online that were previously mothballed they're getting those lines running, they're refurbishing equipment. And so we always see that leading our equipment growth. Now on the equipment side, we did see some nice pockets of growth relative to orders late in the first quarter. And so this is sequentially encouraging and very closely maps to the pattern of what we would have seen with consumables recovery first, followed by equipment recovery. 
Sameer Ralhan: Andy, only other thing I would add from a guide perspective, we're building equipment recovery more in the second half, while the owners, as Jennifer mentioned, in March, were very encouraging, good discussions with the customers that those business teams are having but we're still cautious and we are building into anything on the equipment side in the second half than in the second quarter at this point. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then maybe a similar question on the Water Quality side, Obviously, you've talked about strengthening industrial business for a while now. Maybe talk about the resilience of that. Are you seeing North American municipalities on the Hach side spend anymore? Is there -- do you see any risk of higher rates, maybe impacting that side of the spend? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. So the nice thing about our business, Andy, is it's largely an OpEx-focused set of businesses. So interest rates, CapEx approval cycles we are minimally impacted by. And because we operate at the high end of the value continuum in terms of being integral to operating municipal water plants. We see steady spend there.
 And following the pandemic when municipalities were kind of in lock down relative to their levels of investment. They are starting to execute on their project backlog. And that means that as they execute on that activity. There will be more analytics and testing required for refurbishing plants and getting going on those improvements.
 So we continue to see good demand here that's continuing to recover municipalities. And we also have a variety of opportunities here in water reuse and recycling, reclaim activities as well. So we're encouraged by the muni markets that are starting to recover and look forward to continued execution there. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. 
Jeffrey Sprague: Hey Jennifer, just first on just kind of the M&A side of the equation. Obviously, a couple of quarters out of the box here probably kind of a solid year. So to think about it given the time line of the spin. Just wonder how the pipeline is coming together. Do you see things that are actionable. And do they lean towards one segment or the other? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. This is everyone's favorite topic, I think. We are 207 days post spin, I think, today. So it's still early days here. But I have to say, we have a very, very robust process and a strong pipeline of activity, both in the Water Quality side, the PQI side with a number of opportunities that we're considering.
 We are going to stay disciplined here, consistent with our heritage and focus on making sure that we're going after the right markets, strong companies within those markets and making sure that they come at the right valuation. We continue to like businesses that have similar operating model, durability and financial profile to those that we have in the portfolio today. Businesses that can drive VES, or if they can utilize VES for continued improvements in growth in margin.
 And certainly, our bias towards M&A is an important catalyst here going forward. But we will continue to maintain the rigor and the discipline that we have inherited from our history. And as always, M&A is a little bit episodic. We do see more opportunities opening up relative to actionability as the year progresses. And so we are encouraged by that. 
Jeffrey Sprague: And then maybe unrelated and for Sameer. Given that maybe kind of the consumables versus equipment mix doesn't really shift a whole lot until we get into the second half of the year. Why is it that margins would be down sequentially Q1 to Q2 on sequentially higher revenues? 
Sameer Ralhan: As we go from Q1 to Q2, Jeff, this is -- really ends up -- the first thing is the second quarter ends up being a seasonally heavier trade show activity quarter for us. So the operating expenses do go up seasonally just for us in Q2 and Q1. And that's kind of -- I would say, applies to both the segments. The other fact that is just some of the corporate spending. As we said at the beginning of the year in February, right, we just want to be very cautious and judicious as you bring in the corporate expenses, from a stand-alone company perspective.
 So some of that is just how we're pacing in and slowly in the second quarter, some of that just going to ramp up. And lastly, I would say, as Jennifer mentioned, we are investing on the SG&A side. And in Q1, we did make investments. We're going to start seeing more run rate impact as you move into the second quarter. So it's really a combination of those 3 things that's driving the sequential decline. 
Jeffrey Sprague: Does it bias towards one segment or the other? 
Sameer Ralhan: No, it's pretty universal across the board. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Halloran from Baird. 
Michael Halloran: So following up on Jeffrey's question, as you became a stand-alone company, did you have to change processes lean in any way from an organizational perspective with incremental resources, whatever, to essentially build the muscle on the M&A side, obviously, a little bit less prioritized at Danaher?
 So is there anything that you've had to do to build that up more than what you had done when you came in here and centralization of resources. And then I guess the second part is how integrated is that with your R&D functionalities as we see here today? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: So clearly, standing up -- a stand-alone company does require a corporate organization to support it. Previously, tax and treasury and all of those functions were taken care of for us. But with respect to sort of the M&A trajectory, we were very deliberate in bringing in top talent in our strategy and sustainability function and our corporate development function. Both of those individuals that sit on my staff have long-standing histories within Danaher building strategy and executing on M&A. Insofar as the muscle building within the operating companies themselves.
 We have upskilled the capability for our leadership within the operating companies to be able to performed strong due diligence, look at effective ways of integrating and so on. So we spent actually quite a bit of time here in both the ramp up to the spin and following the spin itself. 
Michael Halloran: And the second one is just kind of putting the commentary together on the Water Quality and the PQI side as far as starting to see some green shoots in specific areas or recovery in specific areas. How much of that is embedded from here from a guidance perspective? Are we talking relatively normal sequentials, or is there an assumption for an improved backdrop as we get through the year and just had some context? 
Sameer Ralhan: Hey Mike, yes, I'll take this one. Essentially, it's pretty kind of a gradual sequentially improving quarter-by-quarter that you just built into the guide at this point. As I said earlier, really what we're building is this point for -- in the near term is really more on the consumables side, still that trend slowly kind of building equipment side, it's really more in the second half of the year.
 So there's a little bit of a macro backdrop helping us some of the equipment side coming back, but it's going to be pretty moderate sequentially kind of going up, but on a year-over-year basis, as you can imagine, from the Q3, Q4 will be better. That's how the math works. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: I appreciate all the color and specifics in the slides in your prepared remarks. I'd like to get a very specific question in Water Quality, if I could. So the new EPA regulations on PFAS, the 4 parts per trillion is really -- as that pushes the testing technology limits. And right now, it's still you have to use a prohibitively expensive mass spec, no utility really can afford that.
 So is the industry any closer, are you all any closer to what might be a more economical test because all this is going to be seeing incredible demand over as of now, as of 2 weeks ago. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. Great question, Deane. We knew that the EPA was headed towards a 4 parts per trillion limit of detection here. So that's not fundamentally new news for us. What is new news there is the time line for compliance with [ Salsnes ] in 2027, but you are right that this is a phenomenally difficult and complex problem to solve in a fit-for-purpose way. Right now, the way to solve for this is water sample set to centralized lab, run through GC mass spec, answers come back, a couple of weeks later.
 In the meantime, the municipality has discharged tens, if not hundreds of thousands of gallons of water. We are investing in this area. We do believe we have a right to play here. Hach unit of itself has over a 70-year history of innovating in the analytics space. We've got a broad portfolio there. And certainly, on the water treatment side, particularly in UV applications, we've got great expertise there as well.
 But I would say this is a long game here with solutions that are not imminent, but we're probably still a couple of years out here in terms of identifying and developing fit-for-purpose technology that addresses both detection and destruction. We think that winning is going to require both.
 And right now, the analytical test options, as you say, are not fit for purpose in terms of being at plant. And frankly, destruction technology is not readily available either. There are products out there, granular activated carbon being one of them that can capture PFAS but what happens when you refresh those resin beds, you're just moving the PFAS to some other place like a landfill. So it's going to be a long journey here, but we are investing in a number of organic activities and are open to inorganic options as well. 
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And I fully appreciate that time line that you've suggested that's everything that we've heard as well. There's a question between wanting something and there's a demand -- industry demand versus the practicality given the complexity of the molecules. But I really appreciate the color. And I'm so glad to hear you mention destruction as well because that's an opportunity.
 And then just for a follow-up question, and I'll echo Scott's comments about that 60% threshold on gross margin and how big a deal that is. And I remember when Danaher hit that level as well. And just one of the ways that you might be able to boost that further I know your business model is a direct to customer on the -- overall and especially on the Hach consumables where you just would think there'd be more of a distribution angle to this, which would lower that cost of getting the reagents to the customers.
 Just where does that stand? Is that a nonstarter? Or is that something you've explored? I know in some countries, you will use distributors just because it's not practical to have direct, but just where does that stand? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think you're right, Deane. We do and will use distribution for our analytics businesses in certain countries. They tend to be areas where we don't have critical mass in terms of staffing up the full capability of selling direct. We think it's actually a good thing to sell direct. And it's part of what I would consider to be the secret sauce because we have that long-standing technological applications knowledge.
 And it's that customer intimacy and the insight to their processes, their process control, their analytics needs, they're unmet, that the problems that have yet to be solved that give us great insight and creates the flywheel of feedback loop from our sales and service organization to our new product development organizations that help us continue to innovate and evolve the product portfolio to solve unmet customer needs.
 So we are not inclined to sort of steer away, if you will, from our direct sales model just from a margin benefit standpoint. We think there's lots of opportunity by virtue of applying VES, and working on mix. The teams are doing a great job here in delivering margin as a result of just good operating and execution, right? The factories are running better, procurement teams are pushing back on inflationary pressures, and we're doing far fewer spot buys. So we had a number of other levers that we can pull relative to margin without compromising the secret sauce of customer intimacy. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. 
Andrew Krill: I wanted to ask on -- going back to price and price costs more specifically. Just can you give us an update on what you're assuming there? I think we've heard from several companies like transportation, labor, certain raws all continue to be pretty inflationary.
 So is the guide assuming you can stay price cost positive, like on a margin basis or just dollars? And anything there would be really helpful. And if there's any big difference by the segments? 
Sameer Ralhan: Andrew, I'll take that one. Essentially, from a price, from a guide perspective and the future look perspective, we're modeling in price in line with historical norms. So it's 100 to 200 basis points. This quarter, of course, as things are rolling off, we came in a little bit towards the high end of that range. But I think from an outlook perspective on the guide perspective, 100 to 200 basis points is a good way to model.
 On the raw materials and the material side, look, I think it's a pretty broad mix of kind of things that we buy all the way from semiconductor, some of the circuit boards down to stuff in plastics and think of those nature that's kind of tied to commodities. I would say the operating discipline and the VES really helping us kind of manage that, I think, has been a big differentiator. That's going to really reflected in Q1. And the question that Scott and Deane had us over the gross margin side.
 We saw a big uplift from that side as well. I think really, going forward, having the operating discipline, making sure we are doing less of the smart buy I would say, inflationary pressures are there. We are managing, managing them really well, but it's also about the operating discipline to make sure we are minimizing any smart buys, which can really have a big impact on the market side.
 So I would say pricing. We're doing the value in used pricing, and it's showing up in the market side for the price side, there's a lot of discipline that all starts all the way from operating discipline. 
Andrew Krill: And then for a follow-up on free cash flow conversion, it's nice to see the conversion boosted for the year from 100% to 110%. Just any more insight into like what changed to give you cost through 1 quarter? And looking ahead, should we be maybe thinking of like 100% conversion as kind of a lower like legacy Danaher was very consistently over 100%. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. Andrew, if you look at free cash flow conversion, right, just as a reminder, we do give the conversion on the basis of the GAAP metrics, right, not on any kind of adjusted metrics. So essentially, when you look at that, just add the amortization and the share compensation or the stock-based compensation, I think based on all that stuff, we should be a little bit on the 100%, a little over 100% but really going towards 100% to 110% range this quarter for the full year for us. That guidance is really driven by getting more conviction on the margin side.
 As Jennifer mentioned, our margin will be towards the high end on the 50 to 75 basis points that kind of flows down, that gave us a more conviction. And also, there's a noncash charge in there as well, right, this quarter that's flowing to the GAAP net income, which is tied to the sales divestiture. So that's kind of just from a math perspective, and adds to the cash flow conversion as well. But overall, it was better operating performance. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. 
Nathan Jones: I'm going to follow up on Deane's question on distribution, but I'm going to come at it from the PQI side because I would have thought there might actually be some more opportunities to leverage the distribution model and maybe reduce the cost to serve on the PQI side than on the water side, potentially maybe in lasers where there's not the same kind of consumable revenue or some of the smaller customers that maybe don't need thatkind of super high level of service from you guys. So any commentary you could make on maybe the potential from that side of the business to leverage distribution a bit more? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think it's probably the same answer as for water. I mean we do have distribution and we do consider use of distribution depending upon where we're selling in the world and what types of products are in the portfolio. This is something that we always consider in terms of when we when we decide to make investments and which product lines actually require a more significant level of applications, knowledge and insight.
 But I will tell you that like in water, there are pretty significant insights to be gained from understanding customer problems in a direct way for any kind of customer who's on the packaging and color side or on the marking and coding side. And it actually spurs a great deal of our innovation.
 You will recall from our fourth quarter call that Videojet launched 7 new products last year. They additionally launched another 2 in the first quarter, and these are on the back of innovations for direct to customer feedback. So I continue to be a little bit biased here towards our direct model because I do think it creates a customer intimacy required to have those untapped insights relative to some of the problems that they face. But we do use distribution, and we selectively consider that in the course of every strategic planning cycle. 
Nathan Jones: I wanted to ask a follow-up on recycle and reuse in industrial markets, which is a market, I think, has significant growth potential over the next 5, 10, 20 years and would certainly be a market that's right in the bull's eye for a lot of your water quality business. So maybe some commentary on trends in industrial recycle and reuse markets, what you're seeing going on there and what the opportunities are for Veralto to play in those markets? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: This is a great question, and absolutely. We see a great deal of activity, interest and growth potential in both recycle and reuse. And it's one that is pan-operating company, I would say, across our water quality businesses. So the intersection of ChemTreat, Trojan and Hach, can all play in that space. And in fact, do have conversations amongst themselves and amongst the sales folks in the field relative to solving those kinds of applications.
 But increasingly, by virtue of the importance of ESG amongst our customers. We do have them coming to us saying, "Look, my company has just said, I've got to use 25% less water and of the water that's not used in the process. They've got to recycle 50% of it, right? So can you help me with both reduction and recycling.
 And those are great -- those are sweet spots for us. We've got a great product portfolio that can be deployed to these applications. And so we continue to be excited about the space. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Perles. 
Andrew Buscaglia: So I just wanted to check on the Water Quality side, you're talking about really strong industrial demand in your guide -- you did much better than your guidance. I'm wondering what changed, I'd say, from December, January to what transpired throughout the quarter? And then just the sustainability around that? What's driving that really? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean I think we still see pretty strong industrial output here, particularly in North America. I think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do see food and beverage coming back, which across the portfolio is the largest continuous industrial segment that we play in. But likewise, chemical processing, mining and power generation all continue to be strong.
 We do see opportunities around the reshoring activity as well as the world becomes a little bit more fractured relative to its trade relationships, and so that's providing great opportunity, particularly with respect to microelectronics and the CHIPS Act and so on. So we do see a good macro environment here, particularly in North America for our industrial sector. 
Andrew Buscaglia: A lot of little things it sounds like. Yes, yes. And you got a lot of questions on M&A. Obviously, that's where a lot of interest lies. I'm wondering if you can comment on your margins, especially in Water Quality are quite high. How are you thinking about margins as you add M&A to your portfolio? Is there enough out there where you could see some accretion or generally long term, is this not really -- should we not expect those margins to stay where they are if you're adding deals? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Andrew, as we've kind of stated in the past, and when it comes down to M&A, it really -- we follow a very disciplined and rigorous approach around markets, companies and valuation with respect to the financial metrics, it really is a combination of multiple factors, right? We look at ROIC, we look at margin, what's are the things that we can add to the portfolio that can drive overall core growth and create synergies, how do we apply VES into the acquired businesses to really create the differentiated value.
 So it really comes down to the value creation potential and ultimately, that's based on a combination of all these different financial factors that we kind of look at as part of our rigorous process. So I wouldn't really focus on one metric versus the other. It really comes under the combination of all to see how they will create long-term value. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. 
Brian Lee: Lots has been covered on the call. So maybe just a few follow-ups, I guess, on PQI. Can you remind us how far out does your visibility extend on the equipment backlog and then the recent strength you're seeing in bookings? And then also maybe remind us what are the mix implications? You kind of alluded to them, but mix implications for margins in PQI as you move through the year. And it does sound like equipment will grow relative to consumables, how should we think about that in the context of margins? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean, I think what we see here is visibility for equipment in the 60- to 90-day time frame, right? This is the short-cycle business. So a lot of our confidence around equipment here in the second half is a product of history, right, where we see cycles of food and beverage and consumer packaged goods sort of decline in recovery. We see typical patterns, which is pretty intuitive of the inks and solvents, spare parts, consumables recovering first as these lines are brought back online and then equipment following when funds are available to do line expansions, equipment upgrades and so on and so forth.
 So you do see in the guide that we've projected a rebalancing of kind of consumables and equipment here in the back half of the year. And so we've accounted for that. 
Brian Lee: And then just one on Water Quality. I think a couple of questions ago, you were talking, Jennifer, about the demand in water reuse, water recycling somewhat from an ESG footprint from a growing subset of your customers. I think there's also a growing subset of customers and industries here levered to power gen growth. We're seeing low growth on the grid in the U.S. especially. First time in a while really seeing some positive inflection.
 So can you kind of give us a sense of from your vantage point, the different technologies, product sets you have the microelectronics sector, how much of the mix it is? And then it seems like there's just incremental volume growth opportunities there. Maybe if you could just speak to that a little bit. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: So the business that is -- benefits most from the CHIPS Act and microelectronics is Trojan that sells UV treatment systems in for high-purity -- ultra-high-purity water. That water has to be exceedingly pure given the manufacturing requirements for semiconductor wafer fab. But there are pockets of other equipment and analytics and so on that get sold into that space. But we've really seen some nice growth in our UV treatment business as a result of sort of the onshoring or reshoring of fabs here in North America as well as the ones that continue to be built in China. 
Sameer Ralhan: And Brian, the only other thing I would add to that is as you're going to look at the bid activity that our teams are seeing, we're seeing a pretty healthy bid activity that's kind of tied to the reuse point that earlier Nathan had as well on the municipal side and then on the semi side on the -- for the UV treatment system. So the bid activity is actually pretty good on both sides. That kind of tie back into the Trojan business. 
Operator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ryan Taylor for any additional or closing remarks. 
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Shelby, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and engagement. As normal, I'll be available for follow-ups today and throughout the next coming days and weeks, should you want to talk, please reach out to me. And at this time, we'll conclude our call. Thank you so much again, and we'll join you next time. 
Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: My name is Shelby, and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Veralto Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your conference. 
Ryan Taylor : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on the investor section of our website later today, under the heading Events and Presentations. A replay of the call will be available until February 21, 2024.  Before we begin, I'd like to point out that yesterday we issued our fourth quarter news release, earnings presentation, and supplemental materials, including information required by the SEC Regulation G, relating to any adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. These materials are available in the investor section of our website, www.veralto.com, under the heading quarterly earnings.  Reconciliations of adjusted figures and all non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis.  During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our most recent SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer. 
Jennifer Honeycutt : Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. 2023 was a historic year for Veralto as we successfully executed our separation from Danaher and delivered a record level of sales, high single-digit earnings growth and strong free cash flow in a dynamic macro environment.  From a segment perspective, our teams in Water Quality achieved a record level of sales and operating profit despite headwinds in China. And in Product Quality & Innovation, our teams held sales and profitability flat year-over-year despite headwinds from consumer packaged goods demand and the Argentine peso.  I'm proud of our team for their resilient effort to grow and improve our business, while supporting our customers and helping to ensure the safety of water, food and medicine supply chains across the world.  We finished 2023 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering core sales growth in both segments, solid operating margin expansion, and robust free cash flow generation. From a segment perspective, we saw continued growth across industrial markets in Water Quality and early signs of stabilization in consumer packaged goods markets and product quality and innovation.  As we begin 2024, we are in a strong financial position and are cautiously optimistic about the near-term trends in our end markets. Over the long term, we remain focused on compounding earnings and cash flow through steady core sales growth, continuous operating improvement, and value-accretive acquisitions that yield attractive returns.  Our team is tremendously excited about the significant opportunities to create future value for shareholders, while also having an enduring positive impact on our world through our unifying purpose of safeguarding the world's most vital resources. We are unwavering in these commitments and confident in our ability to achieve them collectively.  Looking at our full year 2023 results, sales grew 3.1% year-over-year to more than $5 billion, an all-time high. Core sales grew 2.6% following two consecutive years of 8% core growth and we delivered 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.  Adjusted EPS grew 7% year-over-year and free cash flow generation remained strong with free cash flow conversion at 109%. We ended the year in a strong financial position with more than $760 million of cash on hand and net leverage of 1.5x.  Overall, I'm pleased with the steady growth and improvement we delivered in 2023 despite headwinds from lower volumes in consumer packaged goods markets, a slower economy in China, and the devaluation of the Argentine peso.  In addition to delivering solid financial performance, during 2023 we bolstered our leadership talent, realigned our commercial teams, and continued to optimize our portfolio and launch several new technology solutions. Over the past year, we increased the rigor around our innovation process and have started to see early benefits.  A great example to highlight is Videojet, our marketing and coding business which launched seven new products in 2023 to fortify and expand its leading technology position. These launches included differentiated technology in both our continuous inkjet and laser offerings.  In inkjet, Videojet launched the new 1580 C, which prints pigmented color codes without increased maintenance, enabling superior uptime, while delivering crisp, high-quality contrast codes. And in laser, Videojet launched its 3350, which features our new smart focus technology, allowing increased flexibility for seamless product changeovers with no manual intervention. These new products demonstrate our innovation focus on solving customer problems, and we are excited about their growth potential.  Turning now to our financial results for Q4. We delivered 1.7% core sales growth year-over-year with 50 points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 9% adjusted EPS growth. Core growth of 1.7% exceeded the top end of our guidance due to strong execution by our teams in both segments and better than anticipated demand, particularly in food and beverage consumer packaged goods markets where volume started to turn positive.  We are encouraged by the signs of stabilization we saw in the latter part of 2023. It's important to recognize that we are still in the early stages of recovery here. We are cautiously optimistic about the CPG markets at the outset of 2024 and remain prudent in our expectation of steady sequential improvement in demand as this year progresses.  Q4 sales into China were also better than anticipated, down only 3% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially, a nice recovery from Q3 to Q4. Versus the prior year period, both segments delivered core sales growth through continued strong price execution and to a lesser extent volume growth in our water treatment solutions, particularly for industrial applications. Adjusted operating profit grew 5% and margins expanded 50 basis points to 23.8%.  We delivered strong underlying margin expansion through price execution, cost optimization and improved operating performance driven by the Veralto Enterprise System.  Adjusted EPS was $0.87 per share in the fourth quarter, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $316 million or 24.5% of sales, and we generated $241 million of free cash flow at just over 120% conversion.  Our Q4 financial performance reflects our ability to navigate a dynamic macro environment and is a testament to delivering results and meeting our commitments through the Veralto Enterprise System.  Looking now at core sales growth by geography for the fourth quarter, we grew about 5% year-over-year in North America and over 2% in high growth markets, more than offsetting a 2% decline in Western Europe. In North America, we continue to see strong growth in Water Quality highlighted by our water treatment businesses.  ChemTreat grew sales in the high single digits with broad-based growth across industrial end markets and continued new customer wins. And at Trojan, we continue to see growth in North America, driven primarily by demand from municipal customers for our UV systems focused on wastewater discharge regulations and contaminant destruction in drinking water.  Trojan also continued to see steady growth in its Aria Filtra product line serving industrial customers in North America. This is a great example of renewed strategy and strong execution driving value accretive growth.  In PQI, core sales in North America were flat as modest growth in marketing and coding was offset by a decrease in sales of packaging and color hardware equipment. In Western Europe, we also saw moderate declines in sales of packaging and color hardware equipment. Demand for water analytics and treatment was steady in Western Europe across both municipal and industrial customers.  Fourth quarter sales into high growth markets were up 2% year-over-year as most single digit growth in Latin America and strong double digit growth in the Middle East and India offset a 3% decline in China. For the full year, we delivered growth across the three regions led by 4% growth in North America and 2.5% growth in Western Europe. These two regions represent more than two-thirds of our total sales.  Sales in the high growth markets were up 1% in 2023 with strong growth in Latin America, the Middle East and India more than offsetting a high single digit decline in core sales year-over-year in China.  That concludes my opening remarks, and at this time I'll turn the call over to Sameer for a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance. 
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the fourth quarter on slide eight. Fourth quarter net sales grew 3.3% on year-over-year basis to $1.29 billion. Our core sales were up 1.7% and currency contributed 1.6%.  We continued to execute well on pricing, which contributed 3% to sales growth in the fourth quarter over the prior year period. You can see this benefit in our gross profit, which increased 5% on a year-over-year basis to $746 million. Gross margin was 57.9%, up 90 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter.  Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year, and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points to 23.8%. As Jennifer mentioned, further devaluation of the Argentine peso was a significant headwind that we offset in Q4.  Late in the fourth quarter, the Argentine peso declined by more than 50% relative to the US dollar. This reduced the value of our cash-on-hand in the region and led to a significant chart quarter in the PQI segment.  On a year-over-year basis, the impact of the fourth quarter was $17 million or 130 basis points to our total adjusted operating profit margin. And for the full year, it was a $29 million headwind or 55 basis points headwind to the adjusted operating profit margin. We ended 2023 with approximately $15 million of cash and $5 million of accounts receivable in Argentina. We continue to evaluate options to mitigate the impact of further devaluation while serving the needs of our customers in the country. The net EPS impact from the Argentine peso devaluation was approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter.  Despite the headwind, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 above the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. We also delivered strong cash conversion in the quarter. We generated $241 million of free cash flow, representing free cash flow conversion of 121%.  Moving to the next chart, I'll cover the segment highlights, starting with Water Quality. Our Water Quality segment delivered $782 million of sales, up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was a 1.3% benefit. Core sales grew just over 2% year-over-year as compared to 9.5% core growth in the prior year period, bringing the two-year core growth stack for Water Quality to about 6%.  Pricing contributed 4.2% to core sales growth in Q4, 2023. We continue to see strong demand for our water treatment solutions, with steady growth across industrial markets at ChemTreat and high demand for Trojan's UV systems in both municipal markets and in the semiconductor industry, where manufacturing of chips requires ultra-pure water.  And in water analytics, as expected, we experienced lower year-over-year demand in China, where municipal budgets continue to be impacted by reductions in government funding. On a positive note, sequential sales for water analytics in China have been consistent now for three consecutive quarters.  Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year, with margins up 150 basis points to 26%. The increase in profitability was across all key businesses in the Water Quality segment and primarily reflects strong pricing execution and improved operating productivity. For the full year, Water Quality delivered steady, profitable growth, with core sales up 5% and adjusted operating profit margin up 80 basis points to 24.5%.  As Jennifer mentioned, 2023 marked a record year for Water Quality, with sales over $3 billion and adjusted operating profit of $746 million, both all times high levels on an annual basis.  Moving to the next page, our PQI segment delivered sales of $506 million in the fourth quarter, up 2.9% versus the prior year period. Currency was a 1.8% benefit. Core sales grew 1.1%, as 1.8% benefit from pricing more than offset modest volume declines from the prior year quarter, primarily related to CPG markets. While still down year-over-year, demand from CPG customers steadily improved during the quarter and came in better than our guidance assumptions. Additionally, sales into China came in better than anticipated, up 1% over the prior year quarter.  From a product perspective, core sales in both marketing and coding solutions and packaging and color solutions grew in line with the segment at about 1% year-over-year. PQIs recurring sales grew mid-single digits year-over-year, with growth across every major product line, an encouraging sign.  We continue to see signs of sequential stabilization across PQIs and markets, led by increased demand from our food and beverage customers. That said, we are still in the early stages of recovery here and are cautiously optimistic about CPG volumes as we begin 2024.  PQIs adjusted operating profit was $123 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 24.3%. These results include the unfavorable impact from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. That impact resulted in 330 basis points of headwind to adjusted operating profit margin on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter, and 145 basis points headwind to the full year.  Excluding the impact from the Argentine peso devaluation, for the fourth quarter PQIs underlying operating profit grew low double digits year-over-year, and adjusted operating profit margin expanded to about 28%. And for the full year, PQIs underlying profit grew in the high single digits on flat sales, and adjusted operating profit margin expanded to about 27%. Strong pricing execution and benefits from cost optimization actions were the primary drivers of improved underlying profit and margin performance.  For the full year, PQIs sales and profitability were essentially flat year-over-year, a great result considering the significant headwinds from destocking and lower volumes at consumer packaged goods customers, a challenging economy in China, and the currency devaluation in Argentina. The teams within the PQI segment were able to withstand these headwinds to turn in a great result for 2023, with positive momentum building as we enter 2024.  Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter we generated $263 million of cash from operations, and invested $22 million in capital expenditures. Pre-cash flow was $241 million in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 121%. This quarter again demonstrates the strong free cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. Note that we did not have any cash payments related to interest costs in Q4, 2023. Beginning in 2024, we will have interest payments in the first and third quarter. At year end, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was $762 million. Net debt was $1.9 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.5x.  In summary, we further strengthened our financial position during the quarter and have ample liquidity. This gives us flexibility in how we deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value. Our bias as you know, is to drive compounding growth in earnings and cash flow, through investment in high ROIC organic growth opportunities, aligned with secular growth drivers in both of our businesses, and strategic acquisitions that drive long-term value creation.  Within our framework, we also maintain flexibility to return capital to shareholders. In line with the capital allocation framework, we declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share for the fourth quarter.  Turning now to our guidance for 2024. Beginning with an expectation for the full year, we expect core sales to grow low single digit on a year-over-year basis. This assumes low single digit growth across both of our segments. We are targeting 100 to 200 basis points of price, consistent with historical pre-pandemic levels.  Our guidance assumes corporate and other expenses of about $100 million, reflecting the full annual run rate of standalone costs. Looking at adjusted operating profit margin, we are targeting 50 to 75 basis points of improvement this year. This assumes 65 to 90 basis points of operating profit margin improvement across the businesses and approximately 25 basis points benefit from lower exposure to the Argentine peso.  These benefits more than offset a 40 point headwind from the full run rate level of corporate and standalone company expenses. Our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2024 is in the range of $3.20 per share to $3.30 per share. This assumes an effective tax rate around 25%.  From a sequential perspective, our guidance assumes that year-over-year core sales growth steadily improves quarter-to-quarter through 2024, with core sales growth in the first half of the year relatively flat, and core sales growth in the second half up low to mid-single digits.  Looking now at Q1, 2024, we expect core sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. At segment level, we expect core sales and Water Quality to be flat to modestly positive, and core sales in PQI to be flat to modestly negative. As a reminder, Water Quality core sales growth was 11% in Q1, 2023, resulting in a tough year-over-year comparison.  Additionally, turning of the portfolio, which resulted in the shutdown of small product lines in Water Quality, represents 60 basis points headwind to core sales growth for the segment and the quarter. We anticipate adjusted operating profit margin in the range of 23% to 23.5%, and our Q1, 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS is $0.73 to $0.78 per share.  That concludes my prepared remarks. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Jennifer for closing remarks before we open up the call for questions. 
Jennifer Honeycutt : Thanks, Sameer. In summary, we successfully executed our spinoff from Danaher and are off to a great start as a public company. In 2023 we delivered 2.6% core sales growth, 50 points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and 109% free cash flow conversion. Solid operating results amid a dynamic macro backdrop and against a tough comparison relative to 2022.  Going forward, we are focused on delivering our commitments, driving continuous improvement, and executing disciplined strategic capital allocation that creates long-term value for shareholders.  As an independent company, we are benefiting from increased operational focus with 100% of our capital available for strategic growth and value creation. We are confident that the durability of our businesses, the essential need for our technology solutions, and the strong secular growth drivers of our end markets will provide steady growth consistent with our historical track record.  The combination of our leading brands, proven value creation playbook powered by VES, and the strength of our balance sheet differentiates Veralto and positions us to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value.  And as we look to build our future, we are unified and inspired by our shared purpose, safeguarding the world's most vital resources. Our talented diverse team is excited about the bright future ahead and the opportunities to drive value creation for shareholders by helping customers solve some of the world's biggest challenges while having a positive enduring impact on our environment.  That concludes our prepared remarks. I want to thank you again for joining our call, and at this time, we are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. 
Scott Davis : Hey, good morning everyone. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Scott. 
Scott Davis : Looks like China is still a little bit sloppy for you guys. It has been for everybody else too, so not a big surprise. But any color, what your folks there are telling you. Any sense of if we're closing in on a bottom here or what you think in the next couple quarters on a sequential ramp? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, I mean I think in the fourth quarter China came in a little bit better than how we were anticipating. We saw some nice growth in our Trojan UV systems, really related to semiconductor chip manufacturing. We did anticipate municipal markets to be down, and as expected, they were year-over-year, but we have seen now three quarters of consecutive stability in that market.  I think going forward in 2024, I think we're pretty much near the bottom, and we anticipate steady sequential performance improvement stability for the second half of 2024. So a little bit more of the same. We'll see year-on-year sales decline during the first half, which we expect to improve throughout the balance of the year. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah Scott, maybe I can just add from the guide perspective, the way we model China is effectively, as Jennifer said, sequential improvement, but for the first half of the year, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind for us. And in the second half, we're going to start stabilizing and be a little positive. So that's how we're going to think about China in terms of a guide. 
Scott Davis : Okay, helpful. And then just changing gears, I know I don't want to over read this, but Sameer, in your prepared remarks, you just mentioned something about returning – potential for returning capital. Still I would imagine the focus is on around M&A.  So perhaps just an update on what you're thinking on an M&A pipeline and likelihood or potential of transactions in 2024, and how you guys are feeling about that part of the equation. Thanks. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, I think the return to capital to shareholders, obviously we have an ongoing continued bias towards M&A. We did announce in the fourth quarter a $0.09 dividend, but our pipeline for M&A and both Water Quality and PQI remain strong with a number of opportunities being considered.  So we're going to maintain as we said before, a disciplined approach that we've inherited from Danaher in terms of it's got to be the right market, the right company at the right price. In terms of valuation, we do have a whole variety of different kinds of assets that we're looking at, but we do like targets that have a similar operating profile in terms of the durability of the business model.  And we like businesses that we can improve in terms of margin expansion through the use of VES. So yeah, we are fully committed to long term shareholder value through the capital deployment. 
Scott Davis: Well, Freudian slip. Best of luck in ’24 and congrats on the start, CEO. Thank you. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: That's 23 years of Danaher coming through, Scott. Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Dean. 
Deane Dray : Maybe we'll start with more of a housekeeping question just in terms of Veralto still being a new company. Can you characterize and frame some of the frictional costs that might still be running through the P&L like transitional services? And I know you did some portfolio line shutdown of that European filtration separation business. It really was an outlier in the portfolio. But just kind of frame for us what might be those frictional costs that are there now and what the timing might be. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah Dean, let me just start with the frictional costs. I think as we kind of said in the guide, starting Q1, we should pretty much start seeing the run rate costs on the standalone company basis, that's a little of the corporate function. So $100 million in the corporate number that you have in the guide kind of really represents the run rate. So beyond that, there's no sort of a major frictional cost, although one-time costs are pretty much done as well.  On the TSA side, Deane, as you said earlier, this was a very clean separation from a TSA perspective. So there's very minimal in terms of dollars, like it's a nominee matter. So I wouldn't think about any kind of remaining frictional costs per se.  On the portfolio side – then on the portfolio side it's roughly 60 basis points, in fact as we said on the Water Quality side. So again, you can do the math. It comes down to $15million, $20 million-ish kind of headwind, kind of actions that we took.  Really cleaning up some of the product lines as we inherited some of the filtration assets from Danaher. We are as good stewards of capital just sitting back saying, hey, every product line has to earn its place in the portfolio, and some of the product lines and geography combinations just did not meet that hurdle, so we took some actions. But that is a minor sort of a regular portfolio cleanup frankly. 
Deane Dray : I know there's a continuous review, but are most of those cleanups done at this point? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah. I mean, the two minor strategic actions we took amounted to about $20 million in annual revenue. We look at the portfolio on an ongoing basis and I would say that there's nothing material that needs to be done from a transformation standpoint. But we will continue to sort of prune and invest as appropriate, where we see the growth opportunities and the required return on investment. 
Deane Dray : Great. And then just second question, but a bit related, you mentioned filtration. I'd be interested in hearing a bit about Aria Filtra. I mean, this was a fabulous brand within Danaher as Paul Water, one of the leaders in membrane filtration. Just give us a sense of where and how are you positioning this business in Veralto, either strategically, kind of what end markets and what opportunities for growth do you have? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, you bet. Well, as you cited there, the Aria Filtra business is the rebranded Paul Water business, and we've actually pivoted how we're investing in this business. We're seeing very strong demand, particularly in critical applications for drinking water and portable reuse.  So when it comes to recycle reclaim, it's an essential technology, and certainly in the macro that's become a more important part of water conservation. But we have repositioned this product line to allocate resources to highest return opportunities with more focus in North America and additional investments in mobile water treatment. 
Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: You bet. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. 
Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Andy. 
Andy Kaplowitz: Jennifer, Sameer, can you give us more color into what you are seeing in product quality focused markets? I think you had guided to download and mixing the digits Q4 yet, as you said you came in over 1% core growth. And core growth accelerated relatively significantly versus Q3.  We know comparisons are a bit easier, but you did mention the early signs of recovery, particularly with food and beverage packaging customers. So could you elaborate on what you're seeing? Have you seen continued recovery as we started Q1 here? And I know you suggested lessening the budget growth for the segment ‘24. Is it just a tough comparison that is leading you to guide to flatten down for Q1? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, so thank you for the question. You know, I think what we said here as we came out of Q3 that customer destocking had largely been completed. We are 75% direct-to-customers, short-cycle business, so we don't have a lot of inventory sitting in a lot of intermediary depots.  But what we did see in Q4 is the sales of PQI consumables by way of ink solvents and spare parts growing mid-single digits year-over-year, and we're also hearing from customers in the market that some of the leading indicators have turned positive.  Now, this is predominantly in certain sectors of the food and beverage markets. But as price and volume in consumer packaged goods and groceries and the like start to rebalance, those lines are coming back online, and we're starting to see some of that volume start to increase as that equation rebalances.  So, we do think that we'll continue to see a steady sequential recovery over the course of the year, but I think we're being prudent and modestly optimistic about how to think about that. 
Sameer Ralhan: And Andy, if I can just add a couple of comments as it relates to the guide. We expect steady recovery in the CPG market sequentially, but overall being cautious as we kind of look at the commentary from the CPG customers and also what we're seeing in the channel.  So from an overall year perspective, we're modeling in low single-digit core growth for the business, but the volume is going to be a tale of two halves. Effectively at this point, from a guide perspective we're modeling in low single-digit decline in the volume side, and that essentially means accelerating into positive low single-digits in the second half on gradual market recovery. So that's how we're kind of modeling it in the guide. 
Andy Kaplowitz: Okay, very helpful. And then maybe a similar question on the Water Quality side. It was also there in your guide in Q4, but still has been slowing a bit year-over-year. Comps are getting a little easier. So are you still seeing some reticence on the part of U.S. municipal customers?  I guess it's more focused on HARP there, but is it really China just slowing you down for HARP? What's going on in the U.S.? And do you have visibility toward Water Quality getting back over all the mid-single-digit levels of growth at some point in ‘24? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, I mean it's probably the comp challenge, right. I think in the first quarter here is the last of our really tough comps on a year-over-year comparative basis. But in North America, we saw nice growth and continue to see nice growth for demand of our UV Trojan systems, and this is particularly related to reuse treatment for potable water.  We see demand for analytics steady on a year-over-year basis, and saw some increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Europe, we see steady demand there coming out of Q4. I do think China is still a little bit suppressed in terms of its demand, although we're seeing a sequentially stable demand throughout the third quarter here.  Year-over-year demand was down in China just due to lower government funding relative to 2022, but we're cautiously optimistic about the sequential improvement over the course of the coming quarters in China. We don't think it's going to get any worse and we've had a positive start here in January right out of the gate. So it's a little bit variable across the geographies, but we see good demand for where investments are happening. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, and Andy, just one quick point I would add to that is, as you're going to think about Water Quality, in the Q1 it's a very tough comp, as Jennifer just mentioned. And also, most of our broad portfolio does not have any seasonality, but Water Quality is one where we do see a little bit. Q4 tends to be strong as the budgets are finishing up the municipalities and similar institutions kind of making decisions.  Q1 at the beginning of the year, people are a little predescent to how they kind of think about spending on the budget. So there's a little bit of seasonal element into Water Quality, not a whole lot, but that's something to keep in mind as well, and that's kind of baked into the Q1 guide. 
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the detail. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Good morning, Mike. 
Mike Halloran: Maybe we could have a similar conversation. How you are thinking about the margins, given the separation and moving pieces around everything. How do you think about the jump-off point into ‘24 from a margin level? Is the fourth quarter, if you adjust for the deval, the right way to think about the two segments? And then how do you think about cadencing through the year in 2024? Should you just kind of follow that revenue pattern you were talking to or is there a different pattern to think about? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah Mike, I'll take that one. As you're going to look at the margin profile, we had a pretty strong finish to Q4. But as you kind of move from Q4 into 2024, for the full year we expect to deliver 50 to 75 basis points. There's going to be sort of a sequential improvement through the year.  In Q1, as you can imagine, we're going to probably see the biggest impact, the run rate of the stand-up and the corporate costs. So that's going to have a tough compare in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. You're also making some select investments in both Water Quality side and PQI side, more oriented towards growth in the sales and marketing kind of initiatives, which are going to impact Q1.  But overall, as you're going to think about for the full year, we expect to deliver 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion. And that includes roughly $40 million of headwinds that's going to come from run rate corporate expenses and the stand-up company costs. So 50 to 75 with a margin, or with a fall-through of roughly 40 basis points is how we're going to think about it. 
Mike Halloran: Okay. And I might have missed this, and I appreciate that. What's the interest expense expected to be this year? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, interest expense, you should think of Mike, roughly $140 million on a run rate basis for us. That includes a little bit of a benefit from the interest income, but overall $140 is a good assumption for modeling purposes. 
Mike Halloran: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you, everyone. 
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. 
Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. 
Jennifer Honeycutt:  Good morning. 
Nathan Jones : Question first on PQI. I think it makes sense that you would say the recovery in consumables first. Can you talk a little bit about what would be a typical lag time before you start to see improvement on the equipment side from that improvement in consumables? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, I think it's typically a couple of quarters. It certainly depends upon the individual company and customer, but generally I would say that it's around two quarters. 
Nathan Jones : Okay. And then I wanted to follow-up on Deane's question about Aria Filtration. A couple of the comments that you made there, sort of lead me to questions about the strategy there. Are we looking at some kind of outsourced water model, water as a service model, where you are kind of able to leverage the footprint you have in testing to build that kind of a business up? Is that the kind of thing that we're talking about with the changing strategy of that business?
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yeah, I mean certainly every business will take a look at its portfolio and position it to be – to fully meet the needs of the customers and certainly align with where the opportunities are. That is not currently in our purview, but remains to be something that could conceivably be considered in the course of sort of moving the strategy along. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, the strategy point Nathan is more around really focusing around geography product combination, so this is not a complete wholesale change in strategy. Just want to highlight that.
Nathan Jones : And just the last one on price-cost, you said 100 to 200 basis points in 2024. Are you assuming that that's neutral to margins or slightly accretive to margins? 
Sameer Ralhan: No, I think overall maybe slightly positive, Nathan. I think when you look at the overall contribution to the margin, I think it's helpful to just have a look at holistic basis. On a holistic basis it'll be 50 to 75 basis improvement of the margin. It's going to come through a combination of price and volume, and frankly, some of the cost optimization initiatives just as far as continuous improvement are going to bake into that as well. So that will result in a pretty healthy fall through of 40%. 
Nathan Jones : Awesome. Thanks very much for taking my questions. 
Sameer Ralhan: Thank you. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: You bet. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Andrew Krill : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to the 1Q margin guide of 23% to 23.5%. It just seems like a pretty big step down sequentially versus the around 25% in 4Q if we add back the Argentina number. I know I mentioned this is in a very seasonal business and there's a little bit more corporate cost, but just anything else going on sequentially and maybe any help by segment on margins? Thanks. 
Sameer Ralhan: Yeah, Andrew, maybe I'll take that one. As you're going to look at the sequential margin specific to Q1, there are really three things at play. The first one is the ramp up of the standalone company cost and the corporate cost. As you know it's going to have the toughest year where you're comparing in Q1 for us. That's going to be an impact. Even in Q4, we were pretty judicious in how we're going to bring in some of the costs related to the standalone company costs. So Q1 is where we're going to start seeing the full run rate.  And as I said earlier, the second one is going to be on the select investments that we are making. I think as we kind of look at the opportunity landscape in both Water Quality and PQI, there are some select growth investments we want to make that will impact Q1, and the benefit of those investments should start flowing through the P&L in the second half of the year.  Lastly I would say, just at the beginning of the year, water is slower to start given that Q4 is much stronger, and that's always going to have a margin decrement, right. So a combination of those three things is really driving it. There are no major in materials otherwise impacting the margin.  Overall, if you kind of again step back and look at the full year, we expect to deliver 50 to 75 basis points. We feel pretty good about delivering that. So I think in the margin, sometimes quarter-to-quarter there can be some variance, but it's good to step back and look at the full year. 
Andrew Krill : Great. Then just a quick follow-up. I know in the intro comments, I think there's a lot of discussion on the innovation, new products for this year. Is there any way you can quantify how much of a benefit that might be in 2024? And is it more focused on one segment versus the other? Thanks. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: I think across the board, we generally see about 4% to 5% of sales spent on R&D and innovation. That has been the case throughout history, and we're carrying that forward as part of the model as well. I do think what we have as an independent standalone company, a more acute focus on where those dollars go in terms of really driving to investments that are high return and strategically compelling from the standpoint of solving customer problems. So you can think about that average as being spread pretty evenly across both Water Quality and PQI. 
Andrew Krill : Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. 
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Shelby. This is Ryan Taylor. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year earnings call today. We appreciate your engagement and your support, and we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you. 
Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Shelby, and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Veralto Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Ryan Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Taylor, you may begin your conference. 
Ryan Taylor: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call.
 With me today are Jennifer Honeycutt, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sameer Ralhan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Today's call is simultaneously being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain available until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will be available until November 10, 2023.
 Before we begin, I'd like to point out that yesterday we issued our third quarter news release, earnings presentation and supplemental materials, including information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures. These materials are available in the Investors section of our website, www.veralto.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.
 As it relates to non-GAAP measures, I want to highlight that we are presenting adjusted operating profit and adjusted EBITDA on a standalone basis, including incremental standalone costs as estimated by management for all periods. We are also presenting adjusted diluted earnings per share, including incremental standalone costs and interest expense related to our new capital structure. Reconciliations of adjusted figures and all non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the webcast slides. Unless otherwise noted, all financial metrics relate to the third quarter of 2023, and all references to variances are on a year-over-year basis.
 During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our most recent SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they're made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jennifer. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone.
 We appreciate you joining us for Veralto's first earnings call as an independent publicly traded company. The third quarter 2023 marks a significant milestone for Veralto as we successfully completed our separation from Danaher. We accomplished this in just over 12 months from the time of announcement, a truly remarkable achievement.
 During the third quarter, we filed our Form-10, issued our 2022 Sustainability Report and hosted our first investor event. At that event, we described key attributes that differentiate Veralto, along with our framework to create long-term shareholder value and our disciplined approach to strategic capital allocation. I'm proud of our team for their extraordinary effort related to the separation, while also driving solid operating execution in support of our customers. Through the first 9 months of this year, we delivered core sales growth of 3%, expanded adjusted operating profit margin by 50 basis points and converted 105% of that income into free cash flow.
 We ended the third quarter in a strong financial position with over $425 million of cash on hand and net leverage below 2x. Given our financial position and strong free cash flow profile, I'm pleased to share with you that we expect to announce a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share in Q4 2023. We are off to a great start as a public company, and there is positive energy throughout Veralto. Our team is tremendously excited about the significant opportunities in front of us to create value for shareholders.
 Before we dive into the results of the quarter, I'll open with a brief overview of Veralto for those who may be new to our story. Veralto is a global leader in water and product quality with essential technology solutions, and a proven track record of solving some of the most complex challenges we face as a society.
 Our annual sales are approximately $5 billion, and we are organized in 2 reporting segments; Water Quality and Product Quality & Innovation, or PQI for short. Our Water Quality segment represents about 60% of total sales, and is positioned at the high end of the value continuum with leading brands in water analytics and water treatment.
 Our POI segment represents about 40% of sales, and is a leader in marking and coding technology, as well as packaging design and color solutions. Across both segments, our key brands are leaders in their respective industries with long track records of innovation, commercial excellence and continuous improvement. Our global team is more than 16,000 strong, and we serve over 225,000 customers by leveraging our scientific expertise and innovative technologies to help our customers solve complex challenges.
 Our technologies and services play an integral role in our customer's operations and are typically used in production environments where the cost of failure is high. Approximately, 85% of our sales are tied to water, food and medicines. We help our customers ensure drinking water is pure, foods and beverages are authentic and medicine is safe to consume.
 Turning now to Q3. Our team delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic macro environment as we continue to face headwinds from broad weakness in China and lower demand for consumer packaged goods. Pricing remained favorable, but continues to moderate towards historical levels both sequentially and year-over-year as supply chains normalize and inflation flows. Additionally, we are proactively improving the efficiency of our cost structure, while maintaining a healthy cadence of R&D and growth investments.
 In the third quarter this year, we delivered $1.25 billion in sales, of which 59% were recurring. Core sales growth was 1%, following 11% core growth in Q3 2022, bringing our 2-year core growth stack to 6%, in line with our historical mid-single digit growth rate. Adjusted operating profit margin including incremental standalone cost was 22.4%, and adjusted EPS was $0.75 per share.
 Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million or 23.1% of sales, and we generated over $230 million of free cash flow, or 113% of net income. This performance reflects our ability to navigate a dynamic macro environment, and is a testament to delivering results with the Veralto Enterprise System.
 Looking now at core sales by geography. On a combined basis, core sales grew 3.5% in North America and 2.5% in Western Europe. In high-growth regions, core sales declined 5% due predominantly to weakness in China, where our core sales declined in the high-teens. In North America, our growth was led by Water Quality and highlighted by strong growth across our water treatment businesses with modest growth in water analytics.
 In water treatment, sales volumes at both ChemTreat and Trojan increased year-over-year, ChemTreat saw steady growth across industrial end markets and continue to win new customers through technical expertise and strong commercial execution. At Trojan, we saw good penetration of our UV systems at municipalities, along with strong growth from our mobile rental program at Aria Filtra, the former Pall Water brand.
 For PQI, core sales in North America declined 2.5% as modest growth in marking and coding was more than offset by a decrease in sales of packaging hardware and color equipment. In Western Europe, water quality delivered 5.5% core sales growth with PQI flat. In water, core sales growth was led by high analytical instruments and consumables, with Germany and France contributing the highest growth.
 At PQI, marking and coding sales were flat and modest growth in packaging design software was offset by lower sales of color equipment. When we look at high-growth markets, modest growth in Latin America, India and Eastern Europe was more than offset by the sharp decline of sales into China. In China, core sales for Water Quality were down high-teens, with PQI core sales down more than 20% year-over-year. These declines reflect broad weakness in China's economy.
 Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing weakness in China and lower year-over-year volumes in global consumer packaged goods to persist. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain confident in the attractive secular growth drivers for both Water Quality and PQI, and our ability to grow core sales in the mid-single digits over the long term.
 At this point, I'll turn the call over to Sameer for a detailed review of our third quarter financial performance. 
Sameer Ralhan: Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone.
 I'll begin with our consolidated results on Slide 8. Third quarter net sales grew 3% on a year-over-year basis to $1.25 billion. Our core sales were up 1%. Currency contributed 1.5%, and acquisitions contributed 0.5 point to overall sales growth. We continue to execute well on pricing to mitigate inflationary pressures. Pricing contributed 3.5% to sales growth in the third quarter over the prior year period. You can see this benefit in our gross profit, which increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $723 million. Gross margin was 57.6%, up 70 basis points from the prior year third quarter.
 Adjusted operating profit was flat year-over-year. Note that on an adjusted basis, both quarters presented here include incremental standalone costs. Adjusted operating profit margin was 22.4%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher SG&A related to growth investments and labor cost inflation. We generated $232 million of free cash flow, representing 113% conversion of GAAP net earnings.
 Moving to the next chart. I'll cover the business segment highlights, starting with Water Quality. Our Water Quality segment delivered $772 million of sales, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Currency was a 1% benefit. Core sales grew 3% year-over-year as compared to 16.5% growth in the prior year period, bringing the 2-year core growth stack for Water Quality to about 10%. Pricing contributed 5% to core sales growth in the period, offsetting the impact of lower overall volume.
 On a positive note, we drove increased volume in water treatment across ChemTreat and Trojan businesses, which was more than offset by lower sales volume in water analytics businesses, weakness in China across both municipal and industrial customers, representing the biggest impact. Adjusted operating profit increased 3% year-over-year with margins down modestly due to an increase in growth investments and higher labor costs. Note that adjusted operating profit for both periods presented here includes an allocation of incremental standalone costs. Through the first 9 months of the year, core sales in Water Quality are up 6%, with adjusted operating profit margin up 60 basis points, a strong 9-month performance.
 Moving to the next page. Our PQI segment delivered sales of $483 million in the third quarter, up 1% versus the prior year period. Currency was a 2.5% benefit, and acquisitions contributed 1% to the year-over-year growth. Core sales decreased 2.5%, reflecting the impact of lower demand for consumer packaged goods and weakness in China. Pricing was a 2% benefit in the quarter, partially offsetting the impact of volume declines across the product portfolio in the PQI segment.
 From a product perspective, core sales of marking and coding solutions were flat, whereas core sales of packaging and color solutions were down 7% on a year-over-year basis. Again, on a positive note, recurring sales for our marking and coding business were up about 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Based on the customer insights, we believe destocking of consumables has largely run its course, and we're beginning to see signs of stabilization sequentially in some of the end markets of our marking and coding business. That said, we expect lower demand in broader consumer packaged goods markets in China to persist through the balance of the year.
 Over time, we are confident that we will return to our historical low to mid-single-digit growth rate for PQI. PQI's adjusted operating profit that includes incremental standalone costs for the third quarter was $110 million, and adjusted operating profit margin was 22.8%, down 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Improved pricing and benefits from cost optimization actions were offset by lower core sales volume and higher SG&A related primarily to growth investments and labor costs.
 Additionally, devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter had an unfavorable impact on PQI's adjusted operating profit and margin. Excluding this discrete currency impact, PQI's adjusted operating profit margin would have modestly improved year-over-year. Through the first 9 months of the year, core sales in PQI were down 1.5%, with adjusted operating profit margin up 60 basis points.
 Turning now to our financial position on the next page. During the quarter, we generated $243 million of cash from operations, and we invested $11 million in capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow was $232 million in the quarter, or 113% conversion of GAAP net earnings. This quarter again demonstrates the strong free cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. Note that we did not have any cash payments related to interest costs in Q3. Going forward, we'll have semiannual interest payments in the first and third quarter of the year. As of September 29, gross debt was $2.6 billion and cash on hand was $426 million. Net debt was just under $2.2 billion, resulting in net leverage of 1.8x.
 In summary, we strengthened our financial position during the quarter and have ample liquidity. This gives us flexibility in how we deploy capital to create long-term shareholder value. At our Investor Day, we discussed our financial policy and capital allocation framework. Conceptually, our framework is grounded in driving compounded earnings growth, while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.
 Our bias is to drive compounding growth in earnings and cash flow through investments in high ROIC organic growth opportunities, aligned with secular growth drivers in both of our businesses and strategic acquisitions that drive long-term value creation. Within our framework, we also maintain flexibility to return capital to shareholders. In line with this capital allocation framework, we intend to initiate a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, starting with the fourth quarter of this year, subject to approval by the Board of Directors with respect to each such dividend.
 Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, on a consolidated basis, we expect core sales to be flat to down low single digits year-over-year. This assumes an ongoing weakness in China across both segments. In our Water Quality segment, we expect core sales to be flat year-over-year with another tough comp, given 10% growth in Q4 last year.
 In the PQI segment, we expect core sales to be down low to mid-single digits. This decline is expected due to the ongoing weakness in consumer packaged goods end markets on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate adjusted operating profit margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. That's about 100 basis points to 200 basis points better on a sequential basis. Our guidance for the adjusted diluted earnings per share is in the range of $0.79 to $0.84. Note that adjusted earnings per share excludes amortization expense, assumes Q4 tax rate of approximately 25% and reflects diluted shares outstanding of approximately 250 million.
 For the full year, we expect core sales to grow low single-digits on a year-over-year basis. This assumes mid-single-digit growth at Water Quality and low single-digit decline at PQI. And our adjusted EPS guidance for the full-year 2023 is in the range of $3.11 to $3.16 per share, assuming an effective tax rate around 25% and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 247 million.
 Our adjusted EPS guidance excludes amortization expense and includes incremental standalone costs and annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $140 million. Despite the dynamic macro environment that Jennifer outlined earlier on the call, our teams remain focused on controlling what we can control to drive core growth and deliver on our targets for the fourth quarter.
 With that, I'll turn the call back to Jennifer. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Thanks, Sameer.
 In summary, we successfully executed our spin-off from Danaher and are off to a good start as a public company. Through 9 months this year, we have delivered 3% core sales growth, 50 points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion and 105% free cash flow conversion, solid operating results amid a dynamic macro backdrop. And yesterday, we announced our expectation to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. Going forward, we are focused on delivering our commitments, driving continuous improvement and executing disciplined strategic capital allocation that create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
 In closing, I want to reiterate our long-term value creation framework. Over the long term, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit core sales growth with incremental margin fall-through in the 30% to 35% range, and we expect 100% free cash flow conversion annually. We intend to complement core growth with disciplined strategic acquisitions. We are confident that the durability of our business, the essential need for our technology solutions and the strong secular growth drivers of our end markets will provide steady growth consistent with our historical track record. The combination of our leading brands, proven value creation playbook powered by the Veralto Enterprise System and the strength of our balance sheet differentiates Veralto, and positions us to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value. And as we look to build our future, we are unified and inspired by our shared purpose: Safeguarding the World's Most Vital Resources.
 Our talented, diverse team is excited about the bright future ahead and the opportunities to drive value creation for shareholders by helping customers solve some of the world's biggest challenges while having a positive enduring impact on our environment.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. I want to thank you again for joining our call. And at this time, we're happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Halloran with Baird. 
Michael Halloran: Congrats on a good public -- first quarter as a public company. So let's start on the margin side here. Maybe you can give some context on why the healthy sequential uptick from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on the margin line. Any help you could give us by segment would be great. And then is this the right jumping-off point, adjusting for seasonality and revenue levels and all that? But is this the right jumping-off point as we think about 2024? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Mike. This is Sameer. I'll jump in on that one. As you kind of look at the sequential margin improvement, that's primarily driven by some of the cost optimization things that we've been doing, especially in PQI and also the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation in Q3. We have not assumed that in Q4. It's a one-off item in Q3. So majority of the uptick that you see on a sequential basis going from Q3 to Q4 will be in the PQI segment. 
Michael Halloran: Got it. And then -- but is that the right thought process then for next year? I mean, is the fourth quarter more representative run rate as you think about things relative to the third quarter? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yes. If you're going to look at some of the costs, things like standalone costs, we are ramping from Q2, Q3. They're going to be on a more run rate basis in Q4. So, they're going to start reflecting. But overall impact from the demand of sales, [ we aim to be ] ultimately close to the margin as well. We'll give that guide, view as we are going to get the guide early next year for '24. 
Michael Halloran: Makes sense. And then on the PQI side, some comments about certainly softness in China. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody, but you also commented on the destocking side of things on the consumable side. So, a couple of things. One, could you just give us some thoughts on how you think this demand picture plays out as we look on a forward basis? But also in the fourth quarter, is the thought process that sell-in and sell-out are a little bit more balanced from a portfolio perspective? Or is there a little bit more to come? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. Relative to PQI, I think what we're seeing is signs of sequential stabilization. Again, in the prepared comments, this is really focused on sort of the improving consumable sales. We believe this is attributed to customer destocking being largely complete and resuming order rates more in line with run rate ordering, albeit at lower overall volume. So that said, as we think about the fourth quarter, consumer packaged goods volumes, we still expect to be net negative on a year-over-year basis, changes in consumer behavior relative to inflationary pricing means that these folks on the customer side are going to be doing fewer production runs and smaller batches. And that said, we still have a pretty variable and highly uncertain environment in China as well. 
Michael Halloran: That makes sense. And last one, if I may, on the Water Quality side of things. It certainly seems like if you exclude the China part of the business, where there's just broader-based weakness that there's a lot of stability across the portfolio here. Maybe just talk about how you think about the economic sensitivity of that segment, excluding the China piece? It certainly seems like that's built to be a little bit more resilient here. 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean, certainly, our biggest downdraft in volume in water was attributed to our China business. I think what we see here is we see some relatively good growth on the treatment side. Certainly, Trojan benefiting from the CHIPS Act. We've got ChemTreat that's seeing good positive momentum in sectors such as energy, agriculture and metals. On the muni, demand side for municipalities is a little bit softer. Municipalities are really focused on making sure that they are focused on regulatory compliance, and so their order patterns are consistent with that. But they're still holding off a little bit in terms of plant upgrades and investments related to optimization. So process optimization is still a little bit lackluster, but solid demand still in the municipal regulatory compliance side. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Congrats on the launch. Jennifer, Sameer, maybe just a little more color on PQI margin in Q3 and really the trend over the last several quarters. I know you mentioned the currency issue in the quarter. You also talked, I think, in the presentation around growth investments, labor inflation. But is there just inefficiency in a region such as China that's holding you back? Or would you expect to see margin recovery as China gets better maybe next year? 
Sameer Ralhan: Yes, Andy. Thanks for the question. Look, I think overall for the PQI side, overall, yes, in general, the volumes are low. You're going to see some impact on the absorption side. But overall, the biggest impact actually was a currency one. So, that's why I highlighted that in my prepared remarks. And just to frame that for you, essentially, the impact if the Argentina peso devaluation impact you remove, actually PQI would have been up by almost 60 basis points. So that gives you just a sense of how big the impact was going from 22.8% to almost 24.2%.
 So, that is one of the biggest impact. And that, of course, is a one-off and we don't expect that to occur in Q4. And also, we did some cost optimization actions. As you know, we don't take those costs out, adjust those costs out. So the benefit of that, you're going to start seeing in Q4 itself. That's why I earlier said that you're going to start seeing a sequential improvement in Q4 in PQI, and that's driving big chunk of the overall company sequential improvement that we laid out in the guidance. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: That's great, Sameer. And Jennifer, just -- I want to follow up on your comments on municipalities sort of holding back, I guess, at Hach. Seems like that's happening in North America. We know you have tough comps versus last year. But sort of what gets them to sort of accelerate to get back to, I would assume that you still think Hach could grow mid-single digits across the cycle. So what do you need to see to sort of get that to happen? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I mean, I think some of these supply and demand nuances will start to level out. There is good funding available with the Infrastructure Bill here in North America. We're seeing a robust growth here for our municipal business in Europe. So it's really more of a matter, I think, of sort of the global economic environment and sort of a steady recovery of industrial markets. But we hold to the mid-single-digit performance for Water Quality going forward. These are essential solutions for people around the world. So, we think the underlying macro is a little bit choppy right now, but the secular drivers remain strong. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Got it. One more question, if I could. Like, how are you thinking about the M&A pipeline, the potential timeline of your first deal as a public company? Do you need a bit of transition time to execute as a public company before you consummate a bigger deal? Or could we expect M&A to ramp up sooner versus later? And maybe are there any particular areas of interest as you sort of come out on M&A? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. Our pipeline across both Water Quality and PQI is strong for M&A, and we've got a number of opportunities that are currently being considered. We do not anticipate that we will require a lengthy ramp time as a public company. We have executed the spin with a remarkable level of discipline and focus on the back of the learnings that Danaher had from its prior spends, and we feel pretty good about where we are positioned.
 That said, we are going to take a very disciplined approach to M&A, just as we would expect from our heritage at Danaher. We're going to make sure that it's a market that we like with companies that have similar operating model durability and financial profiles where VES can drive growth and margin expansion. And we've got to be able to get at the right valuation. So we believe, obviously, this is going to be an important catalyst for value creation over time, but we will maintain similar rigor and discipline as we've seen amongst these businesses as part of Danaher in the past. So, timing is always difficult to predict. M&A is episodic, but we are in the market and working a number of opportunities. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. 
Michael Anastasiou: This is Michael on for Joe. Yes, I was just curious, as you look towards the fourth quarter, what customers might be telling you around the potential for a budget flush? What does the guidance kind of assume versus historical patterns? 
Jennifer Honeycutt: Yes. I think that remains variable based on what industries, markets we're talking about. We do see some of our customer segments that are use it or lose it kinds of budgets. And we would expect that we will see some of that here in the fourth quarter, albeit at probably lower rates than we have seen sort of historically in the pre-pandemic era. 
Sameer Ralhan: And Joe (sic) [ Michael ], maybe if I can add a little bit is as we talked at the Investor Day, right, we are lot more tied to the operating budgets to the -- of our customers rather than capital side, so that kind of helps us as well as you're going to move forward. 
Operator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Ryan Taylor for any additional or closing remarks. 
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Shelby. This concludes our third quarter earnings call. We thank you very much for joining us. I'll be available over the next several days for follow-ups should you have any additional questions. Thank you once again, and that concludes our call. 
Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
