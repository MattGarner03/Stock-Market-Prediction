===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to Vistra's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the floor over to Eric Micek, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you for joining Vistra's Investor Webcast discussing our first quarter 2025 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra's senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All references to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth throughout this presentation refer to ongoing operations, adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the Investor Presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also today's discussion contains forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the Investor Presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Eric. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2025 operational and financial results. 2025 is off to a strong start for Vistra. We remain excited about the demand growth trends we are seeing across our markets, and we believe Vistra is poised to serve the growing needs of customers in numerous ways. While there has been a bit of turbulence the last few months in the macro environment, the administration is prioritizing AI and attempting to find ways to unlock America's leadership in this area. The hyperscalers have continued to affirm or even increase their CapEx investment levels with respect to datacenter investments. We believe to meet this growing load, it will require increased power generation from not only new assets, but existing assets as well. While there are policy challenges to solve, we see a growing willingness on the part of all stakeholders to come together on solutions that will serve new large loads while minimizing impacts for existing customers. Vistra is very well-positioned to be a leader with respect to these solutions and to benefit from the tailwinds in our sector. Beginning on Slide 5, the team worked diligently across the business to maintain last year's strong momentum into 2025. As you can see from our results, our team was able to deliver, achieving adjusted EBITDA of $1,240 million for the quarter. Consistent execution from generation, commercial, and retail was key to this success, highlighting the strength of our integrated business model and our one team approach. We continue to believe that a diversified portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear and gas, combined with a best-in-class retail business and a strong commercial set of capabilities, creates a superior and resilient business model for navigating volatile power markets. We are reaffirming the guidance ranges for 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth of $3 billion to $3.6 billion, both introduced on our third quarter 2024 call. Moving to 2026, while we have not updated our 2026 adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity, we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly above the floor of $6 billion. Our confidence in our ability to deliver this outlook is primarily underpinned by our continued strong operational performance and our comprehensive hedging program, where we have successfully hedged approximately 95% of our expected generation over the 2025 to 2026 timeframe. We continue to believe our comprehensive hedging program, which focuses on locking in value during periods of volatility, ensures a more stable and resilient earning stream across varying economic cycles. Turning to Slide 6, our four strategic priorities continue to be central to our long-term success while driving strong operational and financial performance. As highlighted earlier, our integrated business model and comprehensive hedging program deliver consistent results and enhance visibility into our earnings potential while providing a significant downside protection to our near-term outlook. The excellent teamwork across our business is central to the successful execution of our strategy. Operationally, our generation team achieved another strong quarter of commercial availability at approximately 95%, enabling us to perform for our customers during multiple winter storms in both our PJM and ERCOT markets. On the retail side, we achieved another quarter of organic growth in the Texas market after a strong 2024, demonstrating the consistency and strength of our retail business. Switching to capital allocation, we maintain a disciplined approach of returning capital to shareholders, investing in select growth projects that achieve mid to high teens returns on capital, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with a long-term net leverage target of less than 3x. As part of this approach, we continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned approximately $6.3 billion to our investors through share repurchases and common stock dividends. We grew our zero carbon business, including through the acquisition of Energy Harbor, and we achieved our long-term leverage target. As part of this program, we expect to return at least an incremental $2 billion in total through share repurchases and dividends through the remainder of 2025 and 2026. On the subject of growth, we have two equipment queue positions for our Permian 1 and Permian 2 peakers, and we have an attractive cost profile given the timing of when we placed these orders. We believe these projects with build costs of approximately $1,000 per kilowatt are advantaged relative to current estimates for peakers of more than $1,500 per kilowatt. We will continue to evaluate the returns for these projects and assess market reforms, including legislative activity in Texas and elsewhere, as we determine our best path forward. With respect to the strategic energy transition, we continue to execute on our strategy of utilizing existing land and interconnects to opportunistically complete solar and energy storage projects. This quarter, we continue the construction on our Oak Hill, Texas and Pulaski, Illinois sites in support of our contracts with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively. Once online, these facilities will add over 600 megawatts of renewable capacity to our portfolio. Our Oak Hill site is approximately 90% complete and on track for a fourth quarter 2025 commercial operations date. The Pulaski site is approximately 20% complete and on track for a fourth quarter, 2026 commercial operations date. We also began mobilizing for construction on our Newton battery and storage site in Illinois. This site will add over 50 megawatts to the region with a planned commercial operations date in 2026. Importantly, cost structures for these projects remain insulated from recently announced tariffs. Moving to our nuclear portfolio, feasibility studies are underway for potential nuclear uprates. As we noted last quarter, initial estimates indicate the potential for uprates across our nuclear fleet of approximately 10%. We expect to finalize these studies over the next year with target online dates in the early 2030s. You can expect future updates from us as we evaluate these opportunities and prioritize projects. Moving to Slide 7, we continue to see electricity load growth as providing a structural tailwind for our sector. Similar to the summer and winter peak load growth highlighted in our fourth quarter results call, quarterly weather normalized load in the PJM and ERCOT markets continues to see accelerating growth trends. Our analysis suggests the sources of demand growth are durable and diversified across industries, with data center power demand being a key driver, but not the only one. Importantly, electricity demand growth has historically proven to be fairly inelastic over varying economic cycles, and we don't see recent concerns around economic growth impacting the structural change in demand that we see in today's power markets. While this growth provides an exciting opportunity for Vistra to serve customers in new and varied ways, the wide range of projections has garnered the attention of policymakers across the country, not only in competitive markets, but in vertically integrated markets as well. We continue to believe the actual level of load growth will compound annually in a low to mid single digits range through 2030 across our markets. This is consistent with what we shared last year on our Q1 results call, and now we see this dynamic playing out. While this is a strong level of growth compared to the past 20 years in most areas of the country, we believe this demand can be reliably and cost-effectively served. Because grids are built to serve the highest demand during so-called super peak hours, the electric grid remains underutilized for most hours in the year. ERCOT's a perfect example, where peak load has been approximately 85 gigawatts, but the average load is approximately 53 gigawatts. We think this excess capacity during most days of the year provides a unique opportunity to meet a large portion of the pending load growth with existing capacity. In the 1% or less of the hours that are super peak hours, which typically occur in peak summer or winter weather, there are relatively straightforward solutions like demand response, use of onsite backup generation at the customer's location, and higher utilization of existing assets to meet these needs. It is our view this combination can allow for new load to come into our markets in an orderly fashion and be served cost effectively. Over time, as the load continues to grow, there will be time for additional investment in generation and transmission to serve customer needs. Importantly, given the market backdrop and the load growth materializing in the near-term, existing dispatchable assets will be essential to delivering the resource adequacy grid operators and customers expect. We believe Vistra with its large and flexible fleet of generation assets, combined with own sites that can bring new generation is well-positioned for this environment. Our large CCGT fleet with nearly 20 gigawatts of total capacity, which currently operates at average utilization rates of approximately 55% to 60% can run at substantially higher capacity factors, improving grid utilization and lowering unit costs for customers. Our approximately two gigawatts of simple cycle peakers have the quick start capabilities to ramp up as load materializes, further contributing to grid reliability. On development, the diversity of the Vistra generation portfolio allows for multiple types of capacity additions through both the expansion of existing assets and development of new projects. Upgrades at existing gas plants in ERCOT and the coal-to-gas conversion of our Coleto Creek plant represent near-term opportunities to add megawatts to the grid at attractive unit economics. Other opportunities like the previously mentioned Vistra Zero or nuclear upgrade projects represent longer term prospects for capacity additions. Policymakers are also working on solutions to address the growing number of large loads that plan to connect to the grid. Importantly, whether these large loads connect directly onto the grid or co-locate with a power plant, the amount of power they consume and the net supply and demand balance are the same in either scenario. We will continue to work with policy makers and large load customers on solutions that meet all customer needs, including those of our residential and small commercial customers. We continue to advance our discussions with large load customers on various power solutions. And we are optimistic about regulatory developments and our ability to serve these customers. With the Texas legislative session ending in early June and the PJM regulatory process related to the FERC co-location show cause order potentially concluding this summer, we are ready to navigate the evolving landscape and believe we are well-positioned for success. VISTA remains committed to supporting a reliable, affordable, and sustainable grid, and our integrated business is poised to serve customers with growing needs. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to provide more details on our first quarter results, outlook, and capital allocation. Chris.
Kristopher Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9, Vistra delivered first quarter results in 2025 that were approximately 53% higher year-over-year compared to Q1 2024, achieving adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1,240 million, including $1,056 million from generation and $184 million from retail. The significant year-over-year increase was partially driven by the inclusion of two additional months of Energy Harbor's generation and retail results, given the transaction closed March 1st of last year. Generation also benefited from our comprehensive hedging program, which delivered averaged realized prices nearly $4 per megawatt hour higher compared to the same quarter last year. A better weather backdrop in January and February also led to higher capacity factors across our PJM and ERCOT assets. Turning to retail, the business continues to realize benefits from strong customer counts, margins, and supply management as our consistent product development combined with strong brand recognition drove higher year-over-year customer additions in our key markets. Similar to generation, retail results were also bolstered by favorable weather in our Texas and Midwest Northeast markets compared to the first quarter last year, which was negatively impacted by the warmest winter on record. As a reminder, due to higher hedge power costs in the winter and summer months, we expect the majority of adjusted EBITDA for retail to be realized in the second and fourth quarters. Depending on the shape of those power costs throughout any given year, the expected relative contribution from each quarter is subject to change. Notably, our expectation heading into the year for Q1 2025 was significantly higher than the first quarter results for retail in 2024. Moving to Slide 10, we are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $.5 billion to $6.1 billion and our adjusted free cash flow before growth range of $3 billion to $3.6 billion. We believe the reaffirmed outlook for 2025 demonstrates the earnings resiliency afforded by the diversified model especially in light of our outage at Martin Lake Unit 1 and our MOS landing batteries being offline. Turning to our outlook for 2026, as Jim mentioned, we continue to see our outlook develop positively. We are increasingly confident in an adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity outcome for 2026, approaching mid to high $6 billion and even possibly $7 billion. We expect to provide guidance for 2026 later in the year, likely on our third quarter call. As always, our guidance and near-term outlook remain supported by our comprehensive hedging program. For 2025, our gross margin remains highly hedged, with approximately 100% of our expected generation already sold. For 2026, our hedge ratio increased from approximately 80% to approximately 90% as our commercial team took advantage of market opportunities. Finally, turning to Slide 11, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 163 million shares at an average price per share of just under $32. This reduction has notably led to a 49% increase in our dividend per share since the dividend paid in Q4 2021 to the dividend paid in Q1 2025. Regarding our balance sheet, Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits just under 3x adjusted EBITDA in line with our long-term target of below 3x. In terms of future capital deployment, we will maintain a disciplined approach towards further deleveraging, investment for growth, and shareholder return. We expect to invest just over $700 million on solar and energy storage projects in 2025, including the previously discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft, along with our Newton site, which we began preparing for construction this quarter. Based on our current project pipeline, we anticipate a reduction in solar and energy storage development CapEx for 2026, subject to change with any new offtake agreements. As a reminder, we expect to fund a significant portion of our growth expenditures with third-party capital, including non-recourse loans. We continue to believe these projects are a great opportunity to leverage existing sites to increase the proportion of our contracted EBITDA at attractive returns while limiting the impact of our cash available for allocation. Lastly, we believe Vistra continues to be well-positioned to create sustained long-term value. The resilience of our business is evident in our strong results and reaffirmed earnings outlook amidst increased market volatility. Our team is focused on our core mission of lighting up lives and powering a better way forward. We remain confident in our ability to be part of the solution to address our country's growing power demand in the coming years, and we look forward to the months and years ahead. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, Shar, good morning.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning, Jim. Jim, I couldn't get a sense on the preparations [ph]. Just on Comanche Peak, deal conversations, are you waiting specifically for co-locations at this point or could you be moving ahead with front of the meter and virtual PPAs in the interim? And the reason why I ask is one of your peers noted yesterday that FOM and BTM pricing is harmonizing in their customer conversations, which I think is counter to what Vistra has been messaging in the past. So just a little bit of a sense there, thanks.
Jim Burke: Sure. Well, Shar, I think what I've tried to mention on previous calls, and I know we've covered a lot of ground, really, for the past year's worth of calls, that no two deals really are going to look alike. I think the customer needs really dictate that. And for some areas of the country, the front of the meter may actually be as good of an opportunity set as co-location. From our perspective, when we've looked at the deals that we're working on with many customers, they're still looking at co-location as a potential speed advantage. And again, that's going to depend on which part of the country and how clear are the rules. I think from our team's perspective, the activity level has not slowed down. We remain very engaged with a number of these opportunities and we're very pleased with the progress we're making. There is still a desire for clarity because as we mentioned on previous calls, you have to contract through these deals, which are long-term deals, 10 to 20 years, and new contracts need to anticipate how rules and regulations are going to play out. So to the extent the rules and regulations can become clearer, it'll make the ease of contracting these, I think, a little bit more straightforward. As far as pricing, a lot of these customers look at alternatives around the country. So what is the next best alternative to either a front of the meter location or co-location with existing assets? And that includes co-location potentially with even new assets, all of that creates a price spectrum. And I think we've talked about the fact that there is going to be a spectrum of prices out there. I don't think there's enough deals signed to say that one deal is going to equal another deal because there just really, frankly, haven't been that many deals announced. And so I think it's too early to say that front of the meter and behind the meter is harmonizing from our perspective, but I also think no two deals are going to look exactly the same. And I don't think we should expect that. These are sophisticated customers. The markets all have different nuances in terms of their design and their ability to deliver for the customer. And I think our ability to price that is going to be our ability to work with that customer that we can meet their needs. And so what I'm excited about is that the hyperscalers have either reaffirmed or increased their CapEx. So we're still talking about nearly $2 trillion between now and 2030 that the major four players intend to spend. And the administration is prioritizing AI. They're setting a tone that we've got to win the AI race. So we've got to make co-location work. We've got to make front of the meter work. We need to be able to build new assets as well as utilize existing ones. And so that's how we're approaching it, sure.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. That's actually very consistent in the past. And then, Jim, just lastly, I know this is not an easy question to answer, but just on general deal timeline at this point, does SB6 finalization, does that unlock a Comanche deal?
Jim Burke: I think SB6, the end result of SB6 will unlock a lot of things. We don't know how SB6 is going to frankly turn out. I mean, there's a hearing today. It's the first time it's being picked up in the House. And as we've covered in previous calls, Texas could attract a lot of load if we're able to lay out clear rules and regulations. And I think that could unlock a Comanche Peak deal, but I think it could unlock a lot of deals, including front of the meter deals. SB6 deals with both. And so we're active on SB6 as are our peers, as is the large customer coalition is very active on this. So the session ends in early June. The goal obviously would be to get clarity around that time frame and I would expect that you will see some things announced shortly thereafter with the view that the deal parameters and the kinds of things that folks are trying to contract around would become more clear.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks again, Jim. Very helpful color. Appreciate it as always.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Shar.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead with your question.
Julian Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time. Guys, maybe just to follow-up a little bit here on what you guys are saying about '26 here and $7 billion. Can you guys comment briefly on '27? I mean, the curve has been moving around. Obviously, the opportunities that you guys are seeing also moving around, but -- any shall we say initial commentary that you guys would really be willing to provide?
Jim Burke: Julian, it has been I think I use the word turbulent in the prepared remark. So it is moving around. I think the good news is that that turbulence has showed strength before some of the concerns around the economy, and that has bounced back. And so our team has been actively hedging, as you've heard the update that Chris gave. And I think I mentioned on the last call, and Chris was giving a nod to this in his remarks, '26 is looking strong and we see '27 and even '28. We see that holding similar strength. We're not hedging, obviously, as far out as you would -- as you'd like to because the depth of the market isn't always there to be able to hedge as far out, but the earnings profile is strong. So even with some of the anticipated coal retirements that we have, we see the strength of our current asset base becoming more valuable. The curves are reflecting that. And I think that the earnings power looks very consistent from our point of view.
Julian Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So just to make sure I understand, you presumably had some degree out in '27 here incrementally, but given even with the open position, the mark-to-market looks somewhat similar to what you're seeing on the '26 as it stands today. And I'll only hold it to you today.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Julian. I appreciate that, and the answer is yes.
Julian Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. All right. Well, that's my two questions. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead with your question.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. I'm just going to make a comment at first. So when we listen to your prepared remarks, it's hard to tell that you have this upside potential, probably once in a generation, coming from AI. I mean, I know it might be just a different style of communications. But again, it would be hard to guess that there is this upside potential ahead of you. And -- so, again, is it just because you're trying to manage our expectations? Is it that something has changed? Is it that you don't want to commit to a certain timeline? Again, I'm at a loss why you don't sound a little bit more upbeat.
Jim Burke: Well, Angie, I appreciate that. I would say we take the -- this responsibility of how we think about messaging to our shareholders and how the complexity of this marketplace is a reality. I also think these large scale customers, and we see it in the interconnect queues throughout the country, as we've communicated before, they have lots of opportunities. We think these interconnect queues, and I think all of our peers have described this at some level, they may be overstated anywhere from 3x to 5x what might actually materialize, either in regulated markets or competitive markets. So I just respect the customer's ability to develop on multiple fronts around the country. It's our job to compete to win that deal. And that's exactly what we're wired to do. But we respect the fact that we have competitors and we respect the fact that even regulated markets are competing for this load. I mean, competition benefits customers. And I fully respect that. I've spent 25 years in the competitive market side and I understand the ferocity of competition. So I have had a style here and it's been, I think consistent from a team perspective that when we have something that's ready to disclose, we will. And I can assure you of that. And we're working extremely hard to have something to disclose. But until that happens, it's just not been my style to predict. Just given the fact that these customers are sophisticated, have choice, and until you're at the finish line, you're just not there yet. So that's, I think, Angie, the color that I would provide.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. So just taking it may be a step forward. For example, your '26 guidance, you're very heavily hedged. You have a capacity auction that comes with a pricing floor. I mean, the math is relatively simple looking at your disclosures, and again, incorporating even the floor, and that would be well in excess of that $6 billion plus you're showing me -- I understand that Chris alluded to it could be even ahead of $7 billion and again you are as unlikely that '26 is going to be impacted by any of the potential AI-related deals and yet you're not updating the numbers?
Jim Burke: Yes Angie, I think we covered this a little bit last quarter. I think from our perspective there are still some uncertainty So we're not ready to provide actual guidance. I mean you wouldn't expect us to provide guidance for next year and so when we're -- there -- those things again, we still have some open length. We still have the capacity auction to clear. I mean there is a distance between the floor and the cap, and we still have some hedges to perfect. So we're not ready to provide guidance. We've tried to give as much color as we can. We just want to think it makes sense to get back on schedule where we provide guidance, any update for the current year, and then guidance for the next succeeding year, and then maybe in addition to that, a midpoint opportunity outlook for the following year after that. We expect to do all that on the third quarter call. So we're just trying to get back on that schedule where we don't update guidance every quarter, or -- but we're still, as you said, in our remarks, we've leaned in pretty hard to say that we're significantly above $6 billion. We just haven't changed the number on the page. And I think you'll see us, again, return to that third quarter update, formal updates for guidance in multiple years.
Angie Storozynski: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Hey, Jeremy. Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with, I think, kind of a two-pronged question, if I could. Just wondering, with PJM and the auction collar now approved, just how you think that sets up new build incentives, PJM, next few years here? And wanted to contrast this backdrop in PJM versus Texas and wondering if you could expand a bit more, I guess, on the Texas backdrop as you see it in data center proliferation there and the state desires to be a big player. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on the contrast there.
Jim Burke: Sure. Look, the clear that occurred last July in PJM was a good clear relative to the three previous clears. And we talked about that, that that's a material increase in the capacity clear and it actually garnered attention of a number of policy makers. And again, a lot of that is relative to the prior clears that had occurred that were quite low and drove a lot of retirements in PJM. One thing that I think is interesting is that one clear, I think, has actually provided some incentive for this reliability resource initiative, which garnered a lot of attention in PJM, where 27 gigawatts applied at about 9,000 megawatts or 9 gigawatts awarded. And that's really on the basis of, we have a one clear that was in the 270 range, and now we have a cap and a floor, which means the boom bust cycle of the auction is a little bit more stabilized. And I think that sends a good investment signal. You might recall over the last 10 years, 30 gigawatts of gas fire generation have been built in PJM through the capacity auction. So I think, if anything, price signals matter. And price signals have shown in PJM that when they're appropriate, people bring investment. When they're too low, people retire assets. And I think that's normal. I also think price signals matter on the energy side, not just the capacity side. And that price signal for energy can also encourage customers to conserve and effectively help the grid manage supply demand. So I think PJM with the cap in the floor for just the next two auctions is a good bridge to what we hope the quadrennial review and what I think could happen in the future is the continued signals that PJM wants to send to build new resources, knowing that there's still a lot of coal that's going to retire in PJM. In ERCOT, I would say there has not been the same level of commitment to sending the price signal for dispatchable resources. There have been attempts for market reforms. Most of those have been put on hold. There's still a little bit of work to do on one of the key ancillaries, the DRRS ancillary, this Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service. Those details aren't known yet, but I think from the standpoint of Texas is open for business, Texas wants people to invest, and what we've seen is that the batteries and the solar have been viewed as the better way to invest in generation in Texas. The question I think will be going forward is if this data center load comes, it's our view that the first almost 8 to 10 gigawatts of that can actually be served with the existing capacity already in our cuts. I think that's one of the key things that policymakers are looking at is if we can bring the 10 gigawatts, is what -- is really what our estimate of ERCOT might add in data center load between now and 2030. If we can bring that and utilize existing resources, then all we need to worry about is the super peak hours. And there has been legislation in Texas offered to help customers use their backup generation in a way that would be helpful from a grid reliability perspective. And I think that's a key. I think that is a key to an unlock. And the goal from a affordability standpoint for all of these grids across the country ought to be that if capital investments have already been made in generation and capital investments have already been made in transmission and distribution, as a society we should fully utilize those resources because that's the lowest cost way to serve all customer classes and not just focus on new build transmission, new build generation, because we have a lot of excess capacity on the grid as we see it. So we have talked about our peaker projects in Texas because we have a good queue position. The economics don't quite pencil for the peakers yet. We're still going through the test process and it's too early to say how that will turn out. But I do think the peakers probably make a little bit more sense than the combined cycle build at today's investment signals. But obviously it's a competitive market so people can bring whatever resources they think makes sense. But that's how I would describe the policy environment at this point, and I'll turn it over to Stacey to see if she's got anything she'd like to add on color for those two markets.
Stacey Doré: Yes, sure. Well, I think Jim captured the key points, and I agree that Texas is focused on figuring out how to be a leader in that data center effort and attract the load growth that can come with those customers. And I think what they're grappling with, as Jim referenced, is really how to solve the very few hours of the year that we may not have excess capacity. And I'm really pleased to see the efforts of the legislature to come up with bills that address that by giving, for example, customers that bring backup generation some assurance that they can run that backup generation during grid emergencies and not be subject to environmental enforcement. I'm pleased to see the efforts of the legislature on things like HB14 where they were trying to pleased to see the efforts of the legislature on things like HB14 where they were trying to give support for the development of new nuclear. So I think there are some good efforts underway to ensure that Texas can continue to be a leader in these areas. With respect to PJM, we're very pleased with efforts in some of our states like Ohio to recognize the value of dispatchable generation and to ensure that generators have the smoothest path possible to getting approval for new dispatchable generation and other types of projects that can bring megawatts to the grid. So I think we see a lot of efforts to recognize the value of reliability and dispatchable generation, and we continue to be highly engaged in those efforts.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Stacey.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for all the details.
Operator: Our next question comes -- go ahead, Mr. Tonet.
Jeremy Tonet: Sorry, just one more question. Just wondering if -- when you're looking to sign new contracts for data centers, does that ever interfere with the ability to conduct buybacks? I was just wondering about the pace of buybacks amidst this volatility.
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes, thanks, Jeremy. I would say that our buyback program is, it would not affect that. Our program is generally consistent. We expect to have a consistent bid in the market pursuant to a 10b5-1. And so we -- the main goal is to maintain a consistent daily bid in the market. So we've been doing that pursuant to that 10b5-1 over time. And you can see that as you look back when we negotiated and announced the Energy Harbor deal or the purchase of the minority interest, we have never paused the share buyback program since we started it in 2021, and we don't expect to. So we keep it going through open -- closed windows and in periods where we might have material nonpublic information.
Jeremy Tonet: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And now our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
David Arcaro: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, David. Good morning.
David Arcaro: Hey, Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on your outlook for market prices, I guess, as you talk about better utilizing your existing fleet, demand response, maybe backup generation and using that for the market. What does that mean for the outlook for power prices?
Jim Burke: Sure, David. It's one of the things that I think will help make sure the grid stays reliable is that these price signals, again, not just capacity but energy drive behavior, both on the supply side and the demand side. I think the key is that people recognize that signals do need to actually be sent and there's always a policy desire to have low prices. And that's important from an affordability standpoint, but it also you have to have signals every now and again to ensure reliability. I think from our view, the forward curves still do not assume the level of build out from a data center standpoint that we think the CapEx budgets for the hyperscalers suggest. And I think that's just a reluctance, I think, to, one, put those kind of bids in there at that point because it takes time to materialize. I mean, we're a year past the announcement of the first large co-location deal and it hasn't made it all the way through the approval process at FERC. So things just take longer. But if the CapEx budgets play out the way we see them playing out, you're going to see the demand side build in forecasts that I don't think are reflective, even when we say 3% to 5% of a compound growth rate in ERCOT, we don't see that in the forward curves. Let alone the projections that we've seen come from the ISOs in various markets. So I think demand response is important, but demand response should be coming in at the price signal that it should come in at, which is usually higher than where real-time prices have been settling for the last year to 2 years. So I view those two things as complimentary, David. I think backup generation is still an expensive asset to use, but it should be used when the grid needs it, and that's usually in a higher price environment. That's how markets should work. And I think that is a well-functioning marketplace. And I think when you try to do it through mandates or alerts, I don't think you're going to get the same customer behavior because customers do respond to economic incentives. And that's the beauty, I think, of competitive markets is it does send that signal. I just don't think those signals are out there fully yet in the forward curves. It is our view.
David Arcaro: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that. And then, separately, I was wondering, Jim, how much time are you spending in DC. recently, just given all the political gyrations going on? Are there -- what issues are you focused on most at the federal level? I'm curious whether you might be kind of making efforts to differentiate the IPP space on issues where you might have a different view from say the traditional regulated utility on federal issues here?
Jim Burke: Yes, well I do spend quite a bit of time in DC. I think the idea that this administration has been looking to sort of unleash the American Energy Dominance Council and look at how do we treat energy as a strategic resource. We have always talked about reliability, affordability, sustainability in that order, and that's how we've messaged for years. I think that's very consistent with the executive orders that have come out so far. What we're trying to do is look at how do the executive orders potentially then manifest themselves and whatever rules or laws that would spawn from those that can affect markets. It's my belief that the best design ultimately for this is to have markets basically do resource allocation in most categories, including electricity. It's not our philosophy that any of us are going to guess exactly what the winning technology is going to be, what is the right level of investment. So I'm concerned that if people get approval to spend a lot of money, and for some reason it's more spent in infrastructure than is needed on a given timeframe, customers could bear that. Competitive markets put that risk on shareholders. I think that's where that risk belongs. And so our message and that, the message of I think the competitive space is that, let us do the best we can to meet customer needs and put shareholder capital at risk. And that's a different model than where the regulated market design is today. And I do think that we're going to need transmission and distribution to be built. But as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a lot of capacity on the existing system. And if we can find the best places to unlock where that excess capacity is, that's a winner for everybody. And price signals will help do that, whether that's congestion price signals, capacity price signals, or wholesale energy price signals. So I'm spending a lot of time educating about the markets because this is a very fragmented industry, developed over a 100 years into a highly fragmented space that I think is hard to create a one size fits all policy. But since more than half the country's megawatt hours and wholesale are competitive, we have a huge playing field. And so I just want to make sure that we're able to tap that huge playing field and that if we do this right, I think the competitive market should get more than their fair share of this load growth opportunity. And I think Texas has a chance to get more than its fair share of this load growth opportunity coming from data centers.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Yes, thank you for all the color. Appreciate it.
Jim Burke: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Steven Fleishman: Yes. Hi. Good morning. For what it's worth, I think your under-promise, over-deliver way of doing things is the best anyway. So, appreciate that. I guess just first on the data center kind of demand and maybe just to try to get a little better color on that, Jim, how would you characterize your views on that today versus maybe the year-end, call a couple months ago, because it seems like some better conviction and on-demand pricing tone, but just maybe characterize it relative to where your head was a couple months ago in the year-end call.
Jim Burke: Yes, perfect, Steve. Thank you. I actually have increasing confidence over the last couple months and frankly even over the last year. I think what's happened is folks again shareholder capital is being used by these hyperscalers which they don't take lightly and they are spending it and they're recommitting and they're increasing their expected levels of investment. That gives us increasing confidence that there's going to be opportunity and then it's just where does that opportunity manifest itself. To me it all starts with a customer and they are the targeted customer base that everybody is seeking to partner with. So in the last couple months, of course, even if you go back earlier in the year to DeepSeek, I mean, there's just been this whole level of uncertainty. And I think the commitment through it, which we've kind of been down and back up again as a sector, I think is highly encouraging. Having said that, we are talking about nearly $2 trillion of CapEx from these top four companies, plus other capital others will spend. And they need to be good stewards of that capital. And I think the business model of AI is still proving itself out. I think that is, folks have conviction, but everyone is looking for the conviction around the revenue models and the ultimate sustainability of those CapEx levels. But given the level of interest in the discussions we're having and the stage at which our discussions are, we see increasing confidence from the customer base out there. And so I do think, Steve, that it's in a better place than probably where we were just a couple months ago.
Steven Fleishman: Yes. okay. And then two more -- two other questions. First, just on the -- given the range that you're talking about for 2026, Chris, just could you give us a sense of cash available beyond the kind of current buyback commitment? Just -- because you would think there'd be more room on your credit metrics at those kind -- at that kind of EBITDA level. Unallocated cash, yes.
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes, Steve, as you say, the cash generation power of the business continues to support a lot of optionality. If you -- and we've said this, we've talked about this before. We'll stick with the lower projections, but even if you just look at our public, what's out there publicly, if you assume $5.8 billion of EBITDA in 2025 and $6 six billion, only $6 billion in 2026, and you apply the 55% to 60% conversion rate that we talk about, I mean, you can get there through all of our commitments to about a $1.5 billion of cash that we have not yet allocated to anything for '25 and '26. So as you increase that number from 2026, and you continue to put the 55% to 60% conversion ratio, you know, you can see that number getting into the $2 billion range of cash that we still have to allocate.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then last question, just with the Trump administration executive order on coal, any kind of updated thoughts on your coal retirement plans could any of them. I know there's other rules and commitments related to those, but just could you give us any color on that?
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes, Steve I think the most immediate impact that we see is the potential for some of the MATS, the Mercury Compliance to be pushed out a few years, which would really affect Martin Lake and Oak Grove, which are two large Texas sites that don't have retirement dates. As you know, the three sites in Illinois and the one in Ohio, those retirements are driven by other state and federal environmental rules, which are currently still in place. So unless there's a change there, the executive orders in and of themselves don't change that timeline. We are looking at some potentially being coal to gas conversions. There's also a notion in the executive orders about they want to see some equivalent megawatt hour outputs if you do that conversion. So there is a lot going on there, Steve, and I think it's pretty dynamic. But certainly the emphasis on reliable resources sticking around longer is something that we have messaged for quite some time. But the framework needs to acknowledge there still are existing laws that we have to abide by, and we'll see how that develops.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just Jim -- hey, Jim. Thank you, thank you, sir. Just your thoughts on Senate Bill 6, as it currently says, in the past, you've kind of talked about the load curtailment provision, you've highlighted that. Just trying to gauge that, if it passes in its current form, what does that mean for future data center deals? Is that a bottleneck? So just any thoughts or color you could share there, please.
Jim Burke: Well, if it passes in its current form, I do think that the concerns that we've expressed before, we still share. I think the large customer coalitions, particularly data center coalitions, are expressing some concerns around things like the disconnect switch and again the control that they would like to have of their own assets. They're willing to participate in some of the demand response and the load shifting to manage a reliable grid. But I do think there are concerns that the customers have around some of these provisions. From our perspective again co-location we think is an advantage to meeting customer needs and co-location is still getting a separate kind of focus in the version that the Senate passed. And our view is, is since the reliability situation is the same between a front of the meter and a co-located load, in fact, we don't have to build out the same level of transmission to serve it. It's actually a very efficient way to serve these large load customers and again, take advantage of assets already being paid for by customers on the grid. Having said that, if SB6 moves forward in its current form, folks are innovative, folks work through it, we'll be one of those companies working through it. But as I said, I think Texas has a chance to get a disproportionate share of this large load. And these are huge economic development opportunities. So I think if Senate Bill 6 is considered in the House, and there's some revisions that we can work through in the House, I think it would set Texas up extremely well to win the AI race. But as I mentioned, the hearings today, it's too early to predict where that goes. But I think our comments from previous calls still are relevant, but I think there's time to work through some of the potential changes.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it, Jim. Thank you. That's very clear. Then just really quickly, if I may, pivoting to PJM and FERC, just are you in settlement discussions currently with the T&D operators there in that region? What does that say? And then as we think about Texas here, Senate Bill 6 getting resolved in June, what do you think is the timeline for getting some clarity there in the PJM area, in particular? Thank you.
Jim Burke: We actually did not just -- it's just interesting, but we didn't file sort of seeking settlement discussions. We thought the record was ample at FERC and the back and forth between PJM and FERC set up well, we thought for a decision to be made. Now we're always willing and able to get into any settlement discussions. But this has been a long time coming. And I think everyone's ready to move forward. And I think that's the most important thing. And I think we still expect that whether there's settlement discussions or not, we could see clarity coming in the next, I think, couple 3 months is possible. If the settlement discussions drag it out from there, I'd say kind of shame on all of us as an industry, because again, we have to meet customer needs and these customers are moving forward. So we should be able to get there is our view. Senate Bill 6, as you know, would be wrapped up hopefully by the end of the session here in Texas in that first week of June. So I think over the course of this summer, I think we have a chance for both markets to potentially have more clarity than they have at the moment. And I'll turn it over to Stacey to see if there's anything she'd like to add.
Stacey Doré: Yes, the only thing I'd add on the FERC co-location docket is, as Jim said, we did not participate in the request for settlement discussions, but we did provide some very specific solutions to FERC that we think they could simply adopt on the record and move us forward. And that's what we're interested in, is speed of resolution. It's notable that the transmission owners, they filed and they did not file in support of settlement discussions either. They said they were open to them, as we all would be, if settlement discussions are ordered, but their position is that no changes are needed to the tariff. So I think FERC has a clear record before it of the parties' various positions, including PJM, and we would really urge FERC to make a decision on the very full and complete record before it.
Jim Burke: And I'd just add, Durgesh, that FERC did acknowledge our filing, that co-location is specifically allowed in the PJM marketplace. We just need to work out the tariff issues. I think that was sort of lost in the process with the back and forth, but co-location is a viable model. We just have to get the details ironed out.
Durgesh Chopra: Yes, that was clear. They're clearly supportive of co-location. That's good. Stacey, is there a timeline when FERC needs to rule on this thing by? As it currently, I mean, there's so many deadlines. I'm sorry if I'm forgetting, but just what's the next milestone for the FERC to kind of take action here?
Stacey Doré: Yes, I think, Durgesh, that there -- FERC has a lot of flexibility in terms of when it rules, but I think what we would point to is FERC itself saying that it understands the need for urgency here and that it would hope to rule within a couple of months of completion of the filings. And so, if it does not go down the settlement path, then I think we could see a result, a ruling this summer. If it does order settlement, that probably does take an additional 60 to 90 days before FERC comes back in and makes a decision as a result of any settlement discussion. So again, that's why our preference is for FERC to rule on the record before it. But if they decide to order settlement discussions, we'll of course participate and try to reach the best solution that we can. But I think if they were to order settlement discussions, you'd see a result more like at the earliest late summer or maybe fall.
Durgesh Chopra: Thank you so much. Really appreciate the time.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Durgesh.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Jim Burke for closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Yes, thanks, Jamie. I want to thank everybody for joining. As we covered, 2025 is off to a fast start, and I really want to thank our team for their continued execution and service to our customers and our communities. It's an exciting time for the industry and it's certainly for Vistra and we have a lot to do. We look forward to the next update. Thanks for joining and have a great day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Vistra Corp.'s Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing star then zero on your telephone keypad. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you for joining Vistra Corp.'s investor webcast discussing our fourth quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release.

They are joined by other Vistra Corp. senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call if necessary. The earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All references to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth throughout this presentation refer to ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra Corp.'s website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slide two of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risk of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 operational and financial results. 2024 was a transformational year for our company, defined by growth and execution. In the past twelve months, we closed on a unique acquisition, adding three new nuclear sites and one million retail customers with nearly two thousand team members joining the Vistra Corp. family. We completed a twenty-year license renewal for our Comanche Peak nuclear power plant and secured two large power purchase agreements for a renewable pipeline. Our retail business grew and reached performance levels not achieved in the past two decades at competitive markets. This was a result of our one team mindset at Vistra Corp., and I'm excited about what we can achieve in 2025. Turning to slide five, Vistra Corp. delivered another strong year of financial and operational performance, resulting in full-year adjusted EBITDA of $5.656 billion. This outstanding financial performance, which the team achieved despite a mostly mild year of weather in our key markets, exceeded the top end of our original guidance range even before considering the $545 million benefit from the nuclear production tax credit that we recognized in the fourth quarter. This consistent execution from our team across generation, commercial, and retail, supported by a focused corporate services team, delivered reliable power and customer solutions that reflect the strength of our integrated business model. We believe the performance achieved in 2024 is proof that a diversified portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear and gas, combined with a best-in-class retail business and a sophisticated commercial team, produces a superior business model for operating in volatile power markets. Moving to our longer-term outlook, we are reaffirming our guidance of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow before growth of $3 billion to $3.6 billion that were introduced on our third quarter call. As you can see, we are also maintaining our outlook for a 2026 adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of over $6 billion. While we have the potential to be significantly above this amount, there are still a number of variables in play, including final approval of the 2026, 2027 PJM auction parameters and remaining hedging activity required to take us above the current hedge level of 80%. We expect to provide more clarity on our expectations for 2026 later this year. Finally, during 2024, Vistra Corp. positioned itself to deliver significant capacity additions at our key markets to meet the coming load growth. This starts with the megawatts we can bring to the grid most quickly. Augmentations of existing gas assets in our Texas market, totaling approximately 500 megawatts. These upgrades represent an effective and efficient use of capital to add capacity to the market, especially in the hours when it's needed most. Completed nearly half of those upgrades in 2024, and we'll finish the remainder in time for this summer. We also announced the expected conversion of our Toledo Creek coal plant to a gas fuel plant once it ceases coal operations in 2027, enabling it to operate beyond its previously announced retirement date. In addition, we adjusted the 2025 retirement date for Baldwin, extending operations to 2027, which will help reliability concerns in MISO. We are developing contracted solar and battery projects in a number of competitive markets, moving to new gas build as we announced last May, are in the early stages of development for two natural gas peakers totaling up to 860 megawatts of capacity. While we continue to target a commercial operations day for these units in the middle of 2028, the ultimate decision on construction will depend on our view of the economics, including any market reforms being considered. Turning to slide six, our four key strategic priorities remain central to our strong operational and financial business performance. As highlighted on the previous slide, our integrated business model and comprehensive hedging program provide increased visibility into our long-term financial outlook. From an operational perspective, our generation team achieved another year of strong commercial availability at approximately 95% for our gas and coal fleet. Our nuclear fleet also delivered a solid result with a capacity factor of 92%. We are excited about the work that's already been done to form a nuclear fleet operating model, and we believe we have opportunities going forward with respect to our operations performance improvement efforts. Our team continues to deliver high commercial availability, particularly in hours when it's needed most. The most recent example being the winter storms in February of this year, where the team achieved commercial availability of approximately 96% across the fleet nationwide. On the retail side, the team delivered an impressive result driven by strong customer account growth, in disciplined margin management, despite milder weather in most of our markets. Switching to capital allocation, we remain disciplined in our approach to allocating shareholder capital through a strategy that balances return of capital and investment in growth. As part of this approach, we continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned approximately $5.9 billion to our investors through open market share repurchases and common stock dividends. We expect to return at least $2 billion in total through share repurchases in 2025 and 2026, which includes the additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced last quarter. Also closed on the highly accretive acquisition of the 15% misprovision minority interest. That acquisition, which represents a significant investment in our nuclear and renewable generation assets, as well as our retail franchise, simplifies our business model and increases our proportion of zero-carbon revenue streams, all while balancing financial leverage. Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position is ahead of expectations communicated during our third quarter call, with net debt at the end of 2024 below three times adjusted EBITDA. We expect further deleveraging through 2025 and 2026. With respect to zero-carbon growth projects, we continue to execute on our strategy of utilizing existing land and interconnects to opportunistically complete solar and energy storage projects. As part of the strategy, we completed and brought online two solar and energy storage facilities at our Baldwin and Coffeen sites in Illinois as part of our Illinois coal to solar and energy storage initiative in the fourth quarter. We have also begun construction at our sites in Oak Hill, Texas, in support of our contract with Amazon, and Pulaski, Illinois, for a contract with Microsoft. Once online, these facilities will add over 600 megawatts of renewable capacity to our portfolio. Moving to our nuclear portfolio, we have engineering studies in process with initial estimates indicating the potential for upgrades across our nuclear fleet of approximately 10%. We expect to finalize these studies over the next year with target online dates in the early 2030s. Before I continue, I'd like to take a minute to address our Moss Landing site in California. As you know, one of our facilities on the site, the 300-megawatt phase one battery storage facility, experienced a fire. We are grateful there were no injuries, and the event was managed safely by our team and first responders. And we appreciate the support of the community. Other facilities located on-site, including the 100-megawatt phase two battery storage facility, 350-megawatt phase three battery storage facility, and the 1,020-megawatt combined cycle gas plant were not damaged by the incident. The combined cycle plant has since restarted and resumed normal operations. The other two battery facilities will remain offline until we've had sufficient time to evaluate them in light of what is learned. We will continue to work with the community and state leaders on our path forward, including the remediation of the phase one facility, with safety remaining the team's highest priority. Moving to slide seven, we continue to see real-time load growth at our primary markets. Similar to the 2024 summer peak load growth highlighted in our third quarter results, actual load growth, weather normalized in PJM and ERCOT, the 2024, 2025 winter peak, also exceeded historical rates. This included new records for winter peak load of 145 gigawatts in PJM, exceeding winter storm Elliott by approximately 9 gigawatts, and approximately 80 gigawatts in ERCOT, exceeding last year's winter storm, Heather, by approximately 3 gigawatts. Energy usage in these markets is growing even faster than peak demand, indicating likely future acceleration and peak load growth as these numbers converge. We continue to believe the level of growth across both markets confirms our view that load growth is already ramping, and the most recent updates to load forecasts from PJM and ERCOT reflect these accelerating growth trends. PJM and ERCOT have consistently revised long-term forecasts upwards, and that is certainly a bonus sign. We will keep an eye on the ramp rates as we go. Importantly, the source of this expected load growth remains diversified across industries, with power demand related to AI data centers being only one aspect of the growth in large load sources. The magnitude of expected load growth has raised the level of discussions with differing views on how to solve projected declines at system-wide reserve margins. Over the last few months, there has been significant regulatory and legislative action related to market design in both PJM and ERCOT. Generation interconnect queues across the country remain heavily weighted towards renewable projects, which do not provide the same reliability benefits as dispatchable resources. While there have been some short-term actions taken by policymakers, long-term market structure questions remain. Recent developments with respect to the PJM capacity auction will provide some clarity, but continued delays and persistent regulatory uncertainty have made it difficult for generators to respond in a timely manner. FERC's recent 206 order, which we believe indicates the collocated load in PJM will continue to be permitted, is a step in the right direction. However, there are a number of questions to be answered, and clarity may not be provided until this summer. In Texas, policymakers remain concerned with grid reliability and the challenges of meeting the forecast for rapidly growing load. We appreciate policymakers' concerns about grid reliability. It's a message we have consistently reinforced for many years. However, the market reforms to incentivize new generation have been limited or shelved, which is leading to a heightened concern about new large loads. Recent legislative activity in Texas is raising some questions with both generators and large load customers, particularly data center customers. It is still early in the legislative process and is not yet clear whether customers will pause or change any of their siting decisions for data centers in ERCOT while the legislation is under consideration. But we see workable pathways to a resolution. With the proper policy framework, our competitive markets can welcome the load growth and the economic development that accompanies it. We can build generation faster and at a lower cost than other areas of the country. The utilities build out the needed transmission. The team at Vistra Corp. will continue to work with policymakers and regulators on these key issues. This is a big opportunity for the areas of the country that find a way to do this well. It aligns with our national interest. In competitive markets, our view remains to let markets function by sending the proper supply and demand signals. Load growth by itself is a market signal that can incentivize generation. As we've discussed on previous calls, we expect load growth to come from many sources, including residential, onshoring and manufacturing, oil and gas electrification, as well as data centers, including those focused on AI. Regardless of the demand source, we believe a new paradigm of load growth is already occurring, and we expect it to continue. With that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide more info on our outlook and our capital allocation. Kris,
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide nine. As a reminder, on our first quarter results call following the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we initiated guidance for 2024 combined adjusted EBITDA with a range of $4.55 billion to $5.05 billion, including $700 million expected to be contributed from owning the Energy Harbor business for months. Despite the lower cleared prices and the mostly milder weather we've experienced throughout 2024, we delivered adjusted EBITDA excluding the nuclear production tax credit, of more than $300 million above the midpoint, more than $50 million above the top end of that range. Including the nuclear production tax credit, our adjusted EBITDA was more than $850 million above the midpoint and more than $600 million above the top end. Notably, the ten-month contribution from Energy Harbor, including the nuclear PTC, exceeded our $700 million expectation by approximately $200 million. As you would expect, the adjusted EBITDA overperformance in 2024 adjusted free cash flow before growth of approximately $2.888 billion, implying a conversion ratio of approximately 57% from adjusted EBITDA. As we've stated previously, we didn't expect the 2024 nuclear PTC to begin impacting cash until 2025 at the earliest. Looking forward, we continue to target a conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth of at least 55% to 60%. Moving to slide ten. Despite the potential impact from the Moss Landing fire, including the uncertainty around the timing and treatment of insurance recoveries, which we expect to total up to $500 million, we are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion, our adjusted free cash flow before growth range of $3 billion to $3.6 billion. Looking forward to 2026, as Jim noted, we continue to have high confidence in an adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of over $6 billion. As always, our guidance and long-term outlook remain supported by our comprehensive hedging program. Since our third quarter call, our 2026 hedge ratio has increased from 64% to 80%. Our commercial team continues to be opportunistic in taking advantage of periods of power price strings and volatility to protect our gross margin. Turning to slide eleven, we provide an update on the progress of our capital allocation plan. Our share repurchase program continues to generate significant value for our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 160 million shares at an average price per share of approximately $30.46. Notably, this reduction in our share count has led to an approximately 48% increase in our dividend per share since Q4 2021. Moving to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2024, our net leverage was below our stated long-term target of three times adjusted EBITDA, despite closing the acquisition of the 15% vest revision minority interest on the last day of the year and recognizing the remaining payment obligations as debt. Going forward, we expect to continue to manage the balance sheet in a conservative manner. Finally, we will remain disciplined in the deployment of capital towards further deleveraging, growth, and shareholder return. To that end, we expect to spend just over $700 million on solar and energy storage projects in 2025, including the previously announced solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft. Based on our current pipeline of contracted projects, we expect a moderate step down in solar and energy storage development CapEx for 2026, but this could change as additional offtake agreements are executed. Of course, we will continue to pursue opportunities to fund a significant portion of our growth expenditures with third-party capital, including nonrecourse loans. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $1.3 billion to our shareholders in each of 2025 and 2026 through dividends and share repurchases. Even after taking that into account, we continue to expect to have at least $1.5 billion of incremental capital available for allocation through the end of 2026, that we highlighted on our third quarter call. As a reminder, this amount is based on an assumed $6 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2026, so we see potential for significant upside. We are excited for the opportunities in the coming year, believe Vistra Corp. remains well-positioned to take advantage of the growing energy dynamics in our primary markets. We believe the significant amount of cash that we generate, combined with our disciplined capital allocation program, will continue to add substantial value for our shareholders. With that, operator, ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, Shar. Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Morning, Jim. So obviously no surprise on the line of questioning here, but I guess what color can you provide on the timeline for a deal at this point? I mean, can you at least bookend it? Should we see something by midyear, year-end, 2026? I guess and then what's the primary impediment on getting a deal done as the Texas legislature? Is it FERC and PJM, something else? Appreciate it. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Shar. I think we had a sense this question might be coming. I would say assuming this is an M&A and it's about data center deals, because there's multiple deals that we need to have all the time. But I will tell you that on the data center side, it's important, I think, to elevate the dialogue from the simple nature that there's just a contract to be signed. The flavor of the deal matters. So you can assume that we're speaking to all the major hyperscalers and that we're actively engaged with them, and the major data center developers. But they're flavors of complexity. So the virtual PPA, which would be a front of the meter, those are relatively straightforward deals to execute. We have a number of discussions going on with those. Those do not offer, we think, the same margin potential as the more complicated deals, which do involve colocation, it's with existing assets or new assets. When you think about that, because it's a new concept, there's a lot of terms and conditions including the risk sharing. That goes into that partnership because you're making a ten, fifteen, twenty-year commitment. And you see not many deals have been announced that have actually been colocation related. We think common deals offer a lot of benefits for not only the data center customer in our fleet, but the market overall the overall customer base because it not only provides speed to market for the customer, it can result in lower transmission build-out. That the grid absorbs today the customer may be willing to pay for that speed, pay for the reliability benefits. But because it's fairly complicated, it's elevated to the discussion in all regulatory and policy-making circles. So FERC, of course, has been active on that, and we have seen some positive progress there. Texas has just recently filed legislation. Trying to sort out how do they think about front of the meter, and colocation deals? And customers are aware of that. So when we're talking to these customers, they want to be viewed as constructive. They want clarity. On these rules. And so I think the timing of an announcement will also be dependent at some level on when we get clarity on how these deals can move through the process, both in PJM and in Texas. It wouldn't prevent us from signing front of the meter virtual PPAs, but I think the deal that you're speaking about and that folks want to see is where the marriage of the load and the generation asset is approximate. Because that makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons. And that complexity, I think, has raised, I think, the level of discussion at the federal and state level as well as our customers. But we are in this discussion every single day. We feel good about the direction of travel on it, but it's still something that we've got to actually get over the finish line before you'd see us announce something.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And it's just fair to assume that Comanche Peak is probably the lowest hanging fruit versus Davis Besseil or Beaver Valley, etcetera? Is that in your discussions, is that where the focus is?
Jim Burke: I would say there's interest in both markets for different reasons. I would say the Comanche Peak opportunity is probably right now considered the most attractive for a variety of reasons, but I think it's also one that is from the standpoint of having the amount of land we have and the ability to bring that on pretty quickly, just the construction timelines in Texas, working with the wires companies to make sure that we're set up we think is probably the fastest execution that we have across the portfolio.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect. And just lastly, just on a commercial question, obviously, this CDR was very bullish for power, but the moves in the forwards have been a little slower than what we may have expected. We just hit a winter peak demand last week. Can you just talk a little bit about what the commercial team is seeing in the outer years of the forwards and maybe just how that impacts your positioning? Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Jim Burke: Sure. And, Shar, that leads to also the question of if you were to sign a long-term deal at a power price, what do you think is a fair power price? But if you don't think the forwards today reflect the load growth that everyone is worried about, then you got to be thoughtful about what's the right price to be selling a ten, fifteen, twenty-year deal, especially if it's a fixed price construct. We don't think that the forwards, while they have moved up, in the last couple of months, and I'm speaking about ERCOT, they've actually turned a little bit on the outer years in PJM. So we're not seeing exactly the same direction in those two markets. But speaking of ERCOT, since you referenced the CDR, we don't think the kind of load growth that's in the officer attestations or even if you haircut it by 50%, we don't think that's in the forwards fully. And so we're going to be thoughtful about signing up a valuable asset that's producing power and selling on a routine basis at a level that's producing very strong earnings like we just covered in 2024. And so our commercial team thinks that while we're starting to see some of that response, we don't think it's fully in there. And that colors the discussions we have with customers. Because they also are trying to figure out what does the forward look like, what's going to happen with the inflation reduction act, are the solar and batteries going to continue to come at the same level, and all of that affects the supply-demand signal that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So we're bullish, of course, because our fleet is well-positioned. But I think the signals that are there if you were just taking the forwards, we'd be a lot to just be signing that up on a ten, fifteen, twenty-year basis and be comfortable that we can tell our shareholders that that's fair value.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And I appreciate it. But, Jim, that's actually very helpful, and I think it's something that investors should think about as your views around power and contracting. So thank you so much on that. Appreciate it.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Shar.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate the time. Look, maybe just to follow-up on where Shar left it and some of the comments that you made. How do you think about the additionality? Right? And I mean that in a more complex sense of you know, is there a need immediately or over time? To add to existing sites? I mean, obviously, we see sort of the intent of SP6 in summer stacks. We see some of the commentary. How are you thinking about managing that both in the PJM and ERCOT narrative? And how does that figure into your planning? And then I gotta follow-up on the guidance here quickly.
Jim Burke: Yeah. Julien, thank you for the question. When you think about this twenty-four by seven load that is the profile that the data centers expect to have, and then you look at a grid like ERCOT, we're only tight certain hours of the year. So the question, I think, that we're trying to work through with policymakers is what problem are we trying to solve? And I think the problem that we're trying to solve is that if this load continues to come on aggressive in ERCOT, with its current portfolio of resources, can it add a lot more load and not worry about any reliability impacts particularly to the residential customer base who has traditionally been part of any load shed protocol. In fact, even first, in the load shed protocol. And I think that's very fair. To elevate that concern. But since we're talking about a few hours of the year, summer and winter and likely even more winter than summer, all of these data centers expect to be bringing one for one backup resources. That's unlike any other customer class. So what we're working through is on those limited hours of the year, can the backup resources with proper notification can those backup resources be utilized? And if they can, and we can get the clarity of that with the environmental rules, then we can solve a problem. In this in the super peak hours. And I don't think it takes new combined cycles just to solve this problem. Okay? I think we've got a very active and diversified portfolio of resources we need to have flexibility to use that backup. I think that is gaining some interest and I think that's something that policymakers are open to. But I think we've also got to be clear that they have to have high reliability and fidelity of power. And so that leaves the notice process, and they've got to be prepared to shift to that. In some of the legislation that's been proposed, it's unclear if there's going to be notice if there's, for instance, a disconnect switch that somebody else can trigger. And so we need to work through some of those aspects. But I think the concept that there's actually excess capacity most hours of the year on the grid. Our combined cycles run at 50% to 60% capacity factor. So the issue is not the average day. The issue is really about super peak hours, and that's what we're focused on.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. So you still think something could happen this year though, right after the summer for legislative session? And PJM resolution.
Jim Burke: I certainly hope so, Julien. I will tell you though, and tried to message this on previous calls, these customers have a lot of options. Everybody's talking to them. They have markets all over the country. Obviously, they have international opportunities, but even in the US, I do expect that we're going to get something done but I respect their ability to negotiate and work their option set, and they're sophisticated. And so having just the land and the interconnects and the gas turbines and, look, we have two slots coming, you know, for turbines in 2026 and first quarter 2027. We're as early in the queue on that, but when I look at it, they still have choices where they're going to go, and we have value in those assets. And that needs to marry up. And so, yes, I do expect to make progress, and I think policymakers and legislative clarity here would help.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you again, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey. Thanks so much. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, David. Good morning.
David Arcaro: Morning. I was wondering, are you able to discuss or give a rough range of kind of what pricing levels that you might be thinking or discussing out there with potential deal structures? We had some suggestions from a peer of yours yesterday wondering if you would give any color around how that compares to your own discussions.
Jim Burke: Yes. For a lot of reasons, I don't think I'm comfortable talking about pricing in a competitively sensitive kind of category that we're in. And, obviously, it matters on the value proposition. So I mentioned on the earlier response, a string sort of front of the meter virtual PPA, I'd expect to have a lower margin assumption because it's a less differentiated product. You might get paid for some emissions attributes, like if it's a carbon-free energy credit or of sorts, but you can capture some of that value. Colocation on an existing resource where you're offering speed to market for a customer, if you can execute on that, I think you would potentially see the highest margin. The one that I think is unclear at the moment is if you pair new generation with a new customer, and they need to take a take or pay, especially if it's not grid-connected, there could be a premium that the customer has to pay to make that whole model work but it may not be a margin. It may just give you your required equity return and maybe not a lot of extra, but that took a lot of investment. You know, for you to bring that about. So the sweet spot as we see it is understanding what value proposition you have with your fleet and then figuring out is there a place where you can meet in the middle. With a customer for what you provide. And I think that's what Vistra Corp. has that differentiates it from many others is that we've got a lot of operating assets with a lot of land. We can do a coo on existing sites but we can also go to sites that we have over fifty that don't have power plant assets on them. We could build new there. We could partner with a customer. That isn't typical what's the what can you do to help us in 2027 with our needs? Those packages look like 2029 and 2030. And they're interesting. But they're not as actionable to the customers that we're speaking with.
David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Then wondering if you could give an update on the prospects for potential gas plant colocation. You know, what's the interest level in those assets from potential counterparties, how do you see the size of the opportunity within your fleet?
Jim Burke: David, you guys have heard a lot from me. I'm going to turn this over to Stacey Doré, who's been leading this effort. You've heard from her before on previous calls. And I'd like for her to give you a sense of the variation of the models we're talking about with gas plants so you have a sense of how we're attacking it.
Stacey Doré: Thanks, Jim. Hi, David. I think we talked a little bit on the previous call about the fact that we are seeing interest in our existing gas sites primarily from the data center developers at this point. And I think there are a variety of ways to arrange those deals. Typically, you're going to need a grid connection at a gas plant, so you're going to have to go through the same regulatory approval process that you would even for a front of the meter interconnection. So that adds some complexity and time. You probably need to be able to add some, maybe, batteries and other backup gen to replicate the reliability that the customers need. And a lot of our gas sites don't have quite as much land associated with them as, say, a nuclear site. So you have the challenge of thinking about, you know, where the data center will be built. You know, having said that, we're progressing a lot of those conversations on a handful of our sites in detail, you know, working on agreements to bring those projects to fruition. And in addition to that, we are in a number of conversations about building new gas for data centers as well with and without grid connections and in various markets. So we have a number of conversations going on that are at the papering stage. And as Jim referenced earlier, you know, those agreements can be complex but we are optimistic about our ability to bring those projects to a close.
David Arcaro: Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Sullivan: Hey. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, Michael.
Michael Sullivan: Hey. Why don't you just ask on, you know, the forward outlook and maybe why the decision to continue to mark off of November curves. And then when you talk about the certainty needed for a 2026 rate to give a formal range there, is it more so you need to see the auction results or just more clarity on the rules and parameters?
Jim Burke: Yep. Michael, I'll start, and now it's Kris to provide some input. But when we say six billion plus, and I think I've toned it in my remarks, we're very confident about six billion and so there's ranges around that. The issue that we have is that because we don't have the auction clear and the parameters aren't set yet and we're not fully hedged, whatever next bump we give you or the market, I should say, they're going to be asking for the range around that, and we really want to be in the process of giving the next year guidance. On the call that we have in the third quarter. And I think you can assume that the earnings power of the business looks much stronger than the six billion plus for 2026. And we don't see that tailing off in 2027 and 2028. So I'm going to ask Kris to provide his color on this, but I think Michael, it's really more about what's the right cadence for providing the updates not simply there are a couple variables moving around, but let's...
Kris Moldovan: Yeah. I agree. I think it's the cadence, and it's also we continue there are some variables that we're waiting on. You mentioned the capacity auction. We're still even though we're 80% hedged in 2026, that leaves approximately 45 terawatt hours of generation that's open. And so, you know, I think as we continue to have and we get some more clarity on the auction parameters, you know, later this year, we'll be in a position as Jim said, it's once we start moving the number, then we get into ranges. And so we're hesitant to do that at this time. As for the curves, I think you'll see that historically as we reaffirmed guidance, we haven't updated the know, we say that it's still based on the curves because we're reaffirming the guidance that we gave before. But you can assume that we have considered changes in curves and all the factors that go into it when we go ahead and reaffirm, it's typically I mean, this is obviously early in the year, and we don't typically move guidance at this point. So we'll wait until later in the year to adjust guidance. But I would read into the fact that we're still basing it on November fourth curves where we're certainly to get to the reaffirming stage thinking about all the puts and takes that have happened since we put out that guidance.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Appreciate it. Look. All the color there. And then kinda related to that, but more on the policy side, two questions. I guess, what should we think about the likelihood of the cap four proposal passing for the capacity auction? And then in Texas, I mean, you talked about customers having choices and options and the like. Is there any particular provision in SB6 as it stands that you think would push them away from Texas?
Jim Burke: Yeah, Michael. Great question. On the first, I think we feel the cap and floor is likely to be approved. You know, we've seen, obviously, stakeholders weigh in. We've seen IMM comments. So I think that's likely for the next two options. And I think that that brings some of the volatility around the marketplace, which has you've seen. We've had low clears for the last three auctions until this most recent one, and then that's the only one that makes the news. You know, the load clears were not newsworthy, but they were having real impacts, you know, on bringing capacity and asset retirements. On Texas, yes. There are things in SB6 that are certainly helpful for the marketplace. The idea that we need to understand what's really in the interconnect queue from a load standpoint and maybe raising the bar so that we get more clarity about the load forecast. If it's a really low bar and folks are worried that we're going to see the grid double, you know, by 2030. It causes concern when the next deal gets announced for a data center because the view is that we need to solve all the way up to 150 gigawatts. We have not. That has not been our view. You've seen us for many quarters suggest that the load growth, while robust, is not a double-digit CAGR. On peak demand each year. We see it more in the 3% to 5% peak demand range. So bringing clarity to that and getting a load forecast, I think will help policymakers who are trying to figure out how big of a grid am I solving for? And frankly, the Talend Amazon deal what it really did because that data center could be fun of the meter. It's still the same load as it would be if it's sitting next to a new plant. It just catalyzed the conversation on resource adequacy. It really wasn't about colocation, and there's always going to be a question about is there a transmission charge that should be paid or not. Setting that aside, the concern was do we have a resource adequacy issue? And that's what a large colocation deal really brought to light. In Senate Bill 6, part of how they're looking to solve that is to put requirements on customers larger than 75 megawatts to shed load during critical peak hours, which we agree with. And we think the customers that we're talking to are preparing in their designs to be able to do that. I think when you get to something like a remote disconnect switch, that's unusual and would only exist for these customers. And that's something that gives them pause because they're going to spend tens of billions of dollars. And they need to know that they're in control. Of those assets, and they're more than willing to work as we are with the policymakers to give them comfort that with notice of what these weather events they do give you some notice. So all we really need to do is get to some adequate notice. And we can move forward. The final one is the transmission charges. We just need clarity on them. They just want to know, are they going to get something that's commensurate with the transmission and grid utilization? There's a revisiting potentially of the four coincident peak methodology. That probably does need revisiting. Because some company some customers are able to either reduce their load or turn on backup and minimize their transmission exposure, which means those costs go to other customers, including potentially residential customers. And since we serve nearly five million customers, we're sensitive. To that as well. So there's a lot in that bill. You know, there's a hearing going on today. About it. They're going to get a lot of feedback. But I would say clarity is what we need, and then this disconnect, this remote disconnect I'd say, is one of the things that we hear from the customer side is very concerning is they're not seeing that specific approach in other markets right now.
Michael Sullivan: Appreciate all the thoughts. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. Thank you. So maybe first, I mean, just taking a step back. So it doesn't sound like gas deals are waiting for any regular clarity. It's just more about contractual arrangements. So, you know, why haven't we heard of any gas deals? Is it that, you know, you mentioned in the past some sort of a portfolio deals. Are they associated with some of the nuclear deals that you're working on, and that's why we haven't heard of those? Or is there some reluctance either by the off-takers or you to contract these gas plants, you know, at current terms or the terms that they are offering?
Stacey Doré: Right. Angie, hi. This is Stacey. Thanks for the question. I would say that the gas deals that we're working on, the colocation deals with existing assets are waiting on regulatory clarity as well. I mean, the same uncertainty that is applying to behind the meter or collocated deals in PJM, for example, with the FERC proceedings would apply whether the asset is nuclear or gas. Because the question really that's being asked is, you know, what is the transmission charge, if any, that has to be paid on those deals? So, PJM's willingness to move forward with necessary study agreements, for example, applies whether it's gas or nuclear. Similarly, in Texas, Texas with SB6, you know, all of the provisions in that bill that could affect collocated loans would apply whether the asset is gas or nuclear. So I do think the same regulatory clarity that Jim referenced that we need and customers need to move forward on any colocation with existing, with new, if it's grid-connected. All of that will be necessary for these deals to ultimately be understood well. And in terms of the portfolio approach, that I've mentioned on the last call, we are still in discussions with a number of parties, including some financial backers and capital providers. About those kinds of approaches. I would not say that those conversations are holding up particular deals because we also have discussions about specific sites that continue on in parallel. And so all of those conversations continue on a daily basis, you know, in detail with a lot of work being done in terms of on the customer side as well as our side understanding the physical attributes of those projects, the regulatory timeline, as well as the commercial terms.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then on the nuclear deals, so, you know, it was my understanding in the past that, you know, as long as at least directionally you understand how to structure these deals, you might proceed with them even before we have, you know, rules in place. You know, if only because, for example, there would be some time lag between any potential deal announced and when you would be asking, you know, FERC for any ISA amendments. Has that changed? Did this approach do we are we waiting both in Texas and at FERC for the final rules to be passed? Before any deals can be announced.
Stacey Doré: Yeah. Thanks, Angie. We are not waiting necessarily on full clarity from either FERC or Texas before we announce the deal. Having said that, you know, while all of these proceedings are going on in the background, it raises questions in the commercial discussions about things like who's going to be, you know, taking the risk on a change of law. You always have change of law provisions in contracts that you have to negotiate. But when you're in the middle of actual legal proceedings that are contemplating changes in law, it just heightens the discussion around those kinds of terms. In addition to that, you know, I think we've referenced before that we do have what we believe to be a final necessary study agreement at Beaver Valley, and we are continuing progress on that project. Again, on the ground and with customers. But I believe that PJM does feel that they need some additional clarity from FERC to actually file an amended ISA. Having said that, that doesn't prevent us from continuing to work both with PJM, the customers that we're talking to about Beaver Valley, and then just with our own team on doing the development work that has to be done to directly connect a data center to Beaver Valley or Comanche Peak. So all of that work continues on. There is no pause. There is no, you know, waiting until we have an absolute answer. But having said that, the regulatory process does affect the discussions, and I think we're both sides, both us and the customers are trying to work through that and figure out how we can contract around some of the unanswered questions.
Jim Burke: And, Angie, what I'd like to add, thank you, Stacey, is underpinning some of the reaction to the Amazon talent deal and even the filing of SB6 in the hearing is still a view that co-locating load with a plant is a concern for the grid. But having an equal amount of load sitting one mile down the road from the plant is not a concern. For the grid. And physics those are going to be the same supply-demand and reliability concerns either way, and we need to solve for the supply-demand in both cases. But I do believe that the customers are sensitive that they want to be viewed as I'm bringing economic development, I'm bringing jobs, I'm bringing capability that we think net multiple states want to be a leader in. So they want to be welcomed in that context. The fastest speed to market or the colocation deals. But if you read the commentary and you read the concerns, there are views that that is somehow taking megawatts off the grid. But the same size data center one mile down the road is not taking megawatts off the grid. That fundamental difference of view drives a lot of the discussion, and it's our job along with other stakeholders in the process to be as clear as we can be about what the supply-demand effects are. Load is load, and we need to have adequate supply. The colocation of that does not change that fundamental supply-demand balance, but I think it's still an awareness that the customers have right now that we need to get that thought more clearly articulated in the way we inform policymakers and engage with them so that those kinds of deals are viewed as actually net beneficial because they will likely result in less aggregate transmission build-out just to put something in front of the meter. And that could get uplifted to all customers. So there's a discussion here about the pros and the cons, and both are going to be on the grid. We've said that multiple times. There's going to be a lot that's going to be done in front of the meter regardless, and there should be some. We think there should be a fair amount done through colocation because it's efficient in effect.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. It's just that I think we would have hoped that this discussion has already taken place given that it's been almost exactly twelve months since this was kind of deal with the house. No. So and I understand that this is somewhat of a contentious topic, but still, you know, time is of the essence as you know.
Jim Burke: Yep. Real quick, Angie. We share your view. Hundred percent. And partly, our business model, as you know, is no matter what is getting built out on the grid, whether it's front of the meter, and it's done by the hyperscalers, the colo providers, oil and gas, our assets are positioned to see benefit from demand growth. In addition, we'd like to capture this value if we can capture it. If we for some reason, this gets delayed or it's just difficult to capture, we're going to capture a lot of value with our business the way it set up today because we are net long. Generation beyond our retail requirements. And so I think we're set up well for that, but we agree with you. We thought we'd be further along as industry. In some of the fundamentals on this discussion, but we aren't yet. We're going to have to keep working it, Stacey.
Stacey Doré: Yeah. Angie, I would just add to that. I'm yeah. I thought it was interesting that in the FERC 206 order that came out last week, which is setting this colocation topic for us finally on a schedule, which we're optimistic about and we think is a positive step forward, and we hope to have some clarity from FERC in the next five to six months on that. And I appreciate it. We appreciated the commissioner's focus on urgency because to your point, you know, you would we would have hoped we would have figured out this conversation by now because at the end of the day, we've all said we this just has said, the customers have said, that we believe that, these collocation collocated loads should pay some cash aspect of grid charges for whatever services they're using, but that can be different. Based on the configuration of a particular project, and that needs to be taken into account. And I think FERC is finally setting up a process to consider that. They did recognize in the order this exact point that that Jim is making, and we've briefed to this point ourselves, which is that there is no resource adequacy difference between front of the meter load and behind the meter load. They both five hundred megabyte data center uses five hundred megawatts of power, whether it's behind the meter or in front of the meter. So I think FERC recognized the argument that there is no resource adequacy difference as the same time, they pointed out that what they believe policymakers are concerned about is the timing of collocated load bringing the load faster than what is happening in front of the meter. And that's exactly why the customers are interested in it. So that's the disconnect that we have to solve is the customers want to get online fast. They're willing to pay for that. That in a behind the meter configuration. At the same time, policymakers are concerned about resource adequacy, and they, you know, are concerned that allowing this colocation will bring resources on load on faster than the utilities can get it on in front of the meter. And I think we all owe it to the customers and to economic development and to what's best for the national interest figure that out and to make sure that we have the appropriate procedures to allow colocation. And the last thing I'd say is that, you know, first order first press release on the order was also positive in the sense that it pointed out that the purpose of that 206 proceeding is to decide how to appropriately allow colocation. So that was definitive in our view that FERC knows and wants these colocation projects to move forward, and we just need to figure out what the rules of the road are.
Angie Storozynski: Good. Thank you.
Operator: The last question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey. Thanks for squeezing in there. First, quick clarification. I think, Kris, you mentioned the $500 million associated with Moss Landing. What is that exactly? Is that the insurance coverage? Is that the cash payments? What were you referring to there?
Kris Moldovan: Yeah. The $500 million, we have an insurance policy that covers the Moss Landing battery assets and it's got a limit of $500 million and our expectation at this point is that we would receive up to that $500 million limit on that insurance policy.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. Got it. Okay. One of the news outlets kind of was calling it as the cash payout from that. So I just want to clarify that. Okay. So that's the insurance policy. Okay. Thanks. And just, Jim, just one thing I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on is assuming that we get clarity from Texas, from FERC, on colocation. It's smooth sailing going forward. One of the things you mentioned is the disconnect between, you know, on the between how you're seeing forward prices versus how your customers are seeing forward prices, and, obviously, you have been prudent just signing these long-term contracts. How do you get around that? So assuming just fast forward to second half, we have all the clarity in the world. But there's still a disconnect between where forward ERCOT prices might be in 2028, 2029. What do you think of it to be? What's your customers? How do you get around that?
Jim Burke: Sure. First of all, I don't think there's a single clearing price for these deals like there is sort of like a real-time price of power. So I think it gets to the site characteristics, the nature of that transaction with respect to, say, speed to market, and any other benefits as Stacey laid out, any risk sharing and things that we're bringing to the table as part of the structure. So there are a lot of customers that we talk to. Some are in better shape during certain time periods of, like, the next five-year horizon. And so depending on different customers' motivation, where in the country they want to be, the speed with which they want to get there, that's why this is actually part a time-consuming exercise is it's really all one-to-one. Conversations that you have to have. There isn't really an option for all of this to happen and clear. I do think it's going to be a spectrum, and speed does matter. Not only the speed to actually bring these assets online, but in these conversations and getting to term sheets. We're pretty conservative, Durgesh, and that's my fault. But when things are real, they're real, and they'll be announced. And it's just hard to see underneath the hood because you're not here to see what we're doing and the kinds of activity that's actually happening on a daily basis and the engagement we're having. And I know that's frustrating for folks, but I'd like to think that what we have focused on for the, you know, for many years and will continue to do so as we call it putting points on the board, which is where you know you have something definitive. And we could move forward and give our shareholders confidence. And that's just not where we are yet on these deals, but we're working hard to get there.
Durgesh Chopra: Thank you, Jim. I appreciate your commentary discussed it. Thanks.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Durgesh.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Thank you everyone for joining. You know, 2024 was a very strong year, and I really want to thank our teams for their continued execution and service to our customers and community. Some of that can get lost, as we talk about just what's next in the horizon, but this was a really strong year, and folks deserve the congratulations for their execution and also signed up for a strong 2025 and beyond. And I expect we're going to create value in a variety of ways as demand continues to accelerate. I know we're going to see a lot of you on the road and we hope that we get to see you in person soon. Thank you for joining, and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Vistra’s Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's Investor Webcast discussing our third quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2024 operational and financial results. It has been an active year on a number of fronts, and I'm very proud of what the Vistra team has been able to deliver so far in 2024 while setting the stage for long-term value creation. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to recognize the Vistra team for another quarter of hard work and strong operational performance. Through their efforts, we achieved a solid quarterly financial results of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.444 million despite a continuation of the milder Texas weather we have experienced most of the year. The consistent execution from our team across generation, commercial and retail delivered reliable power and customer solutions that reflect the strength of our integrated business model. As you may remember from our second quarter results call, we indicated our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA was trending toward the upper end of the guidance range. I am pleased to report that with the results announced today and our outlook for the fourth quarter we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $5.0 billion to $5.2 billion with a midpoint above the upper end of our previous range. We are also raising and narrowing the guidance range for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. As we noted on our previous results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, as we await clarity from treasury around the interpretation of gross receipts. However, based on year-to-date settled prices and the forward curve for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the nuclear PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be approximately $500 million. Moving to our longer-term outlook. We are introducing guidance ranges for 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $3.0 billion to $3.6 billion. Notably, our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $5.8 billion is higher than the $5.7 billion upper end of our previously communicated range for 2025. While our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 is not currently expected to benefit from the nuclear PTC at any significant amount due to the current level of forward price curves we do expect the availability of the nuclear PTC to provide downside protection in the event prices settle lower. For calendar year 2026, although our current hedge percentage has increased to approximately 64% of expected generation, a meaningful amount of gross margin variability remains. Further, the delay in the 2026, 2027 PJM capacity auction, including the potential modification of the associated auction parameters create some additional uncertainty. For these reasons, we are maintaining our outlook for our 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of over $6 billion with line of sight to potentially be meaningfully higher. Finally, the third quarter marked an active period of capital allocation and capital returns. On September 16, we announced the acquisition of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest from our minority investors. We believe this acquisition will be highly accretive to our shareholders with an implied transaction multiple of less than 8 times enterprise value to EBITDA, 100% ownership upon closing at year-end and financial flexibility allow through an extended payment schedule. In addition, the significant share price weakness we experienced in late August and early September resulted in an uptick in repurchases and we were able to execute in the quarter. In all, we repurchased approximately $400 million of shares in the open market in the third quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $83 per share. Combined with the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest acquisition, which we view as similar to a forward share repurchase program with a deferred payment schedule, we were able to allocate a combined approximately $3.5 billion to the repurchase of our equity at an average indicative purchase price between $80 and $85 per share, roughly a 30% discount to our recent share price. Turning to Slide 6. Our four key strategic priorities remain integral to our strong business performance. As we have previously stated, we believe our integrated business model and comprehensive hedging program, provide our stakeholders increased visibility into our future financial performance. From an operational perspective, our team continues to deliver. Our generation team achieved overall commercial availability of approximately 96% for our gas and coal fleet. Our nuclear fleet also had an outstanding quarter with capacity factors averaging approximately 98% for the period as we continue to make great progress on our integration efforts. On the retail side, the team continues to outperform through both strong customer count performance in the Texas and Midwest Northeast markets as well as disciplined margin management. Finally, we are seeing persistent growth in our large business market segment through longer-term customer relationships as a result of providing solutions to meet customers' goals, including sustainability objectives and budget certainty. Switching to capital allocation, we remain disciplined in our approach by targeting a significant return of capital and executing on attractive growth projects like the Energy Harbor acquisition, while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. As part of this approach, we continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned approximately $5.4 billion to our investors through open market share repurchases and common stock dividends. Chris will cover capital allocation in more detail later in the presentation. But you will see that we expect at least an additional $1.5 billion of capital available to allocate through year-end 2026. This number is net of our current capital responsibilities including the recently announced provision, 15% minority interest purchase and the recent Board authorization for an additional $1 billion of share repurchases expected to be executed by year-end 2026. Speaking of the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with net debt at the end of the third quarter at approximately 2.7 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although our net leverage is expected to move slightly above 3 times with the closing of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, we expect it to fall back below 3 times in 2025. Moving to energy transition. As you know, our approach continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined returns for our shareholders. The Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase is a great example of this strategy as we view the transaction as an attractive investment in our carbon-free assets and retail franchise. In addition to repurchasing the minority interest in our best-in-class retail business. Through this acquisition, we will increase our ownership of nuclear generation by approximately 970 megawatts and across our four sites at an average price of approximately $2,100 per kilowatt. We believe this compares very favorably to per unit cost for other nuclear generation alternatives such as plant uprates, new build, or additional M&A. Finally, the acquisition will result in an approximately 200-megawatt increase in our solar and storage capacity assets and we look forward to continued growth in this business through the disciplined execution of our existing project pipeline. As highlighted on Slide 7, and this year alone, we have seen numerous announcements of major manufacturing and data center additions by company spanning across industries. These announcements have spurred heightened awareness and projections of power demand growth. Some grid operators have already raised their expectations for demand growth through midyear updates while numerous industry observers have published forecasts reflecting an acceleration in power demand across the country. We also discussed this growth dynamic on our first and second quarter calls, specifically highlighting many of the drivers of power demand growth, including the build-out of large chip manufacturing facilities, partially due to the CHIPS Act the electrification of oil and gas load in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the reshoring of industrial activity and, of course, the build-out of data centers. As shown in the bar chart on the left, actual weather adjusted loan growth for 2024 in PJM and ERCOT not only exceeded historical rates, but is trending towards long-term forecasted levels. We believe the level of growth across both markets confirms our view that low growth is already occurring, and we expect it to continue. While there has been a lot of focus on FERC's rejection of the amended talent interconnection service agreement, or ISA, we believe there will be multiple paths to resolve any issues as it relates to that project and other similar projects. FERC's ruling was narrowly based on the commission's view that the ISA failed to meet previous FERC precedent, leaving the door open for a refiling of a streamlined ISA. Nothing about FERC ruling prevents us or other generators from contracting with customers who are seeking to co-locate for their needs. We will need to address open issues and find the path to FERC approval of interconnection service agreements, which we believe is doable. As we've stated before, there will be many large load opportunities that will have a variety of configurations, whether located next to a generation facility or in a more traditional front of the meter configuration. We don't believe there will be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, and there shouldn't be as customer needs will vary. This transmission is to meet these needs and that of our broader customer base just as we do today. I'm sure we will discuss this more in the Q&A, but I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our third quarter results, our outlook and capital allocation. Kris?
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9. While the third quarter did not benefit from the same weather opportunities as last year, which we estimate added approximately $300 million to our earnings in the third quarter of 2023, Vistra was able to deliver solid results due to excellent operating performance and execution by our generation retail and commercial teams. Despite lower cleared wholesale prices compared to last year, our flexible generation fleet continued to perform extremely well and maximize available opportunities. Turning to retail. As expected, third quarter results reflected higher power costs compared to 2023. However, year-to-date results are meaningfully higher compared to 2023 as the team continues to deliver strong customer count and margin results. Finally, our third quarter 2024 results for both generation and retail benefited from the inclusion of Energy Harbor, which we estimate to be approximately $165 million for generation and approximately $35 million for retail. Moving to Slide 10. As Jim noted, we are raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $5 billion to $5.2 billion. We are also raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. Although our team is executing at a high level across the business in 2024, this latest increase in our guidance range is primarily related to the performance of our retail business. Moving to 2025. The improvement in our outlook is attributable to increased expectations for both our generation and retail businesses, specifically as it relates to retail, we have previously communicated that we expected this business to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion on an annual basis. Due to several factors, including the addition of Energy Harbor, and sustained growth in residential demand in Texas and large business market demand across the country. We now expect the annual adjusted EBITDA contribution from this business over the next several years to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. However, for 2024, we do project our retail results to come in above that range due to a few tailwinds that are onetime in nature. Switching to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, the midpoint of our guidance range implies a conversion ratio of approximately 58%, comfortably in our previously indicated long-term target range of approximately 55% to 60%. Of course, our guidance and long-term outlook remains supported by our comprehensive hedging program. Our commercial team continues to be opportunistic in taking advantage of recent power market volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 96% for calendar year 2025 and approximately 64% for calendar year 2026. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value for our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 158 million shares at an average price per share below $2. Notably, this reduction in our share count has led to an approximately 46% increase in our dividend per share since Q4 2021. Moving to the balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, our net leverage was comfortably below our long-term target of 3 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although we expect that ratio to move slightly above 3 times when we close the acquisition of the 15% minority interest, we expect to delever quickly and be comfortably below 3 times by year-end 2025. Importantly, our business remains well capitalized and we continue to manage the balance sheet in a conservative way, as evidenced by the recent upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BB+ by Standard and Poor's. Finally, we will continue to be opportunistic, yet disciplined in the deployment of capital towards growth. To that end, we expect to spend approximately $700 million in 2024 and 2025 as we execute on our development project pipeline, including the recently announced solar projects for Amazon and Microsoft. Of course, we will continue to pursue opportunities to fund those expenditures with third-party capital, including nonrecourse loans. Finishing on Slide 12. Based on our guidance for 2025 and our current expected 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of at least $6 billion as well as our expectation that we will continue to achieve our targeted long-term ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion rate, we project to generate a meaningful amount of capital through year-end 2026. We also expect our net leverage, excluding our nonrecourse financings to reduce materially as our earnings power improves, providing additional capital flexibility. As you can see, our current capital allocation plan through year-end 2026 continues to focus on shareholder return with over $6.5 billion allocated to the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, common and preferred dividends and expected open market share repurchases comprised of the approximately $2.2 billion remaining under the existing authorization through 2026, including the additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced today. However, despite the significant amount of capital already earmarked for shareholders, we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of incremental capital available for allocation through the end of 2026. Because this amount is based on $6 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, we see the potential for upside to this amount. As highlighted on the previous slide, over the last 3 years, we have been significant buyers of our common stock, including jump starting to repurchase by issuing preferred equity. However, it is important to remember that the decision to repurchase our stock was only one aspect of our capital allocation framework, we sought to balance capital return, maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet and executing on an opportunistic growth. We expect this framework to continue to guide our capital allocation decisions, not only through year-end 2026, but also over the longer term. Importantly, our return thresholds for both organic and inorganic growth have not changed, and we remain disciplined in choosing the opportunities we pursue. I do think it is also important to note that we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield, especially when compared to the average free cash flow yield for companies in the S&P 500 and we continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys. It's actually James [ph] on for Shar. Good morning and thanks for the time. So I guess maybe just coming back to the Susquehanna ISA and some of your prepared, I guess, how has the rejection impacted your customer conversations in the past week. One of your peers sounds committed to co-locations and other maybe more focused on front of the meter. I guess, where do you fall kind of within those soup polls? It sounds maybe a little more like colos, but just any more color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Jim Burke: James, we were disappointed with the ruling last Friday. But I think if you look at our discussions on this topic in the past, we've acknowledged that these are complicated deals. They take time they're large even by the standards of the customers that we're talking to. Then if you look at the quantity of deals that this country is going to do, the vast majority of them are going to be front of the meter. It's unique to have the large sites that we have and have an opportunity to do a co-located deal. We think there are multiple paths forward on this. We're not 100% sure how the other parties that are obviously active on that particular ISA you're going to want to pursue it. But nothing precludes us from still moving forward with our plans. I would acknowledge that everyone is looking at these types of issues and how do we work through them because they are they are novel. I mean some of the co-located deals even that we've done, they were smaller. And so when things are of this scale, there are more questions that need to be answered. But we think there's multiple paths forward. We can go into some details as to how we think that might play out. But our conversations are still continuing. We still have a number of really good options, both with our nuclear sites as well as gas sites and potentially the new build. And so I don't think that this is a load profile and a customer base that is going to slow down in aggregate. I just think it comes down to which areas of the country are more open to this? Are they able to attract this load because it's a huge economic development opportunity and we'll have to see how that plays out? And it could play out differently in different parts of the country. So I just think that's where we are, and it's a process. And we're going to work through it with our peers in the industry, the vertically integrated utilities. Obviously, the ISOs and any of the other stakeholders as we need.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then maybe just kind of piggybacking on that. If we could touch on your thoughts around additionality. Just we heard some commentary from certain members of the PUCT in recent weeks kind of calling for it. So I guess at this point, do you think a colo and ERCOT like Comanche Peak would have to come with additionality? Maybe just some more general thoughts there. Thanks.
Jim Burke: Yes. I do think there are a couple of issues obviously at play here. One is resource adequacy in general, right? So even without the additional data center load that could come to, say, Texas in this example, James, that you mentioned it, there have been questions about whether there's adequate price signals for new investment regardless of just the data center load. In fact, the data center load over the next 5 years to 6 years, will probably not be the largest source of load growth in ERCOT. It just so happens though when you start talking about the data centers, it looks like 1 big chunky load coming at a time, so it gets the attention. As you know, we've put out our announcement of our intention to add megawatts in ERCOT, both with the Coleto Creek conversion as well as the augmentation of existing gas sites, those two alone are going to bring 1,100 megawatts. The peakers are projects that we're still developing still need to see some of the market reforms come to fruition to make those economic or contracts, contracts that could come from bilateral contracts with customers can make those kinds of projects feasible. So I don't think this is a discussion that you can solve with just a rule because we've got multiple customer classes coming that are bringing additional load requirements to ERCOT. But I do think that the objective of the customers that we're talking to, they want to see resources at it. They're not looking to see the grid become tighter and tighter either. So we are very active in the discussion about what additional resources we can bring potentially even in addition to the ones we've already announced. And we hope that if that is a compact that works for all the stakeholders that could help set a confidence that welcoming the load to Texas or any part of the country is actually going to send the investment signal for the supply side and having discussions about whether we may or may not want the load can actually create its own problems. And so we've seen many cycles in this industry. People are prepared to invest and build if the signals are there. I think this is more than just a typical load coming to the market. This is a unique opportunity for regions of the country and specifically for the U.S. to lead on this topic for such a critical load and use its artificial intelligence. And I hope we all see it that way. And that's been our main focus in our discussions with policymakers.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thank you, James.
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey thanks, good morning.
Jim Burke: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Hey, maybe a little bit of a follow-up on that on your comments there, thanks. Very helpful. We heard yesterday from Encore that they're seeing over 80 gigawatts of data centers looking in just their service territory, at least in the pipeline. I mean just given that scale, there's just got to be a bunch of approaches, maybe diversity of approaches that these data centers are going to consider. And so maybe just given that, like what are you seeing as the interest in co-location at your gas plants in ERCOT? And then wondering if you could elaborate, too, on just that new build idea? Like are there -- are you in conversations with potential data centers that you might be able to partner with contract with a new plant build as well?
Jim Burke: Sure. David, great question. I'm going to start, I'm going to ask Stacey Doré, our Head of Strategy, to comment on this. She's working on these types of opportunities on a very near full-time basis. It's certainly an active time for all those types of conversations. I'd start with load forecasts have been obviously extremely robust in ERCOT, CenterPoint put out some information about the kinds of load growth they're seeing in their territory, certainly Encore through the separate call yesterday, and ERCOT itself has revised middle of the summer, it's long-term load forecast. We've been a bit more conservative only because we believe still it's hard to understand the full duplication that could exist not only within a state, but even across the country because folks are looking for PaaS to get speed to be able to bring this load. And so they're exploring all options. I do think that demand, if we can satisfy it, I do think Texas is probably as well positioned as any part of the country to satisfy that demand. And we certainly want to be part of that, not only on providing the relationship for the load, but the potential addition of resources. So I'd like for Stacey to provide some color on the types of conversations we're having and how we're working with Encore, with CenterPoint with ERCOT to make sure that we can all solve this together.
Stacey Doré: Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, David. So we are currently pursuing deals at multiple sites in our portfolio. We're also having some early conversations with some of the developers about a kind of portfolio approach where with one customer, we might be able to pursue colocation deals at multiple sites and combine that with even building some new generation. We have -- we're in pretty detailed customer discussions at some of our nuclear sites. There's a lot of interest, obviously, in the nuclear side. But we have ongoing conversations with several different development companies, about a handful of our gas sites, both in PJM and in ERCOT. And we're in early discussions with some of the hyperscalers about nuclear uprates, and some new build as well as Jim mentioned. And then finally, we're in discussions with two particular large companies about building new gas plants to support a data center project. So as you can see, these discussions just take a number of forms with multiple companies around multiple sites. And of course, we're including stakeholders in those conversations as well from policymakers to the applicable transmission distribution utilities. As we've said before, the diligence process for these deals takes a long time. It's an intense effort because these are very long-term commitments to purchasing power. And so we're devoting a lot of time and resources to these discussions, but we're excited about the opportunity, and we believe that the -- whether it's Texas or other states that we operate in, Pennsylvania, Ohio, these are jurisdictions that are really interested in welcoming this load because of the economic development it brings. And so it's a multiparty conversation for all of these projects.
David Arcaro: Thanks for that. It makes sense just given the staggering scale here that so many options are under consideration. And I guess, maybe to ask it more directly to in terms of Comanche Peak. Have you seen Comanche Peak becoming better positioned here just after seeing the FERC challenges that have popped up in PJM? Like has urgency increased there? And just would be curious your latest thinking on what the timing of a deal could potentially be?
Stacey Doré: Yes. Thanks, David. So we -- our discussions on Comanche Peak have been ongoing for some time, and there certainly is interest in in that location because of the speed-to-market advantage it has even before the FERC decision, frankly. I mean ERCOT and ERCOT is one of the fastest interconnection processes in the country. And the state prides itself on that, the TDUs and ERCOT as well working together to get load interconnected as an advantage in Texas. So certainly, the fact that ERCOT is not subject to the FERC jurisdiction and the order that came out last Friday has continued to make Comanche Peak an attractive site, but it was before the FERC order as well. So in terms of timing, it's hard to say exactly when we could conclude discussions on that side because, again, there's a lot of work to be done. There's a lot of stakeholders to involve not just ERCOT, policymakers Encore, who is the local TDU at that side, but local officials as well. So there's a lot of conversations to have, and we're well into that deep into that process and continuing to pursue that opportunity, and it's a great opportunity for Vistra and for customers.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Fleishman: Hi, I guess I'll dare ask one other question on this topic, which is just Texas has emphasized availability of resources at kind of emergency or peak times and the like. Do you see solutions in ERCOT where you could have the generation even if it's co-located, available for kind of the more sensitive periods?
Jim Burke: Yes, Steve, we do. We have even noted, I think, in previous discussions, customers are learning how they can also manage their load during sort of emergency conditions. So whether it's something around a load response or whether it's the backup generation that could be also configured at the site. Again, I think these large customers, I think they're responding to some of the questions that they're receiving and the concerns around resource adequacy, and they're showing that they want to be part of that solution. So that is, again, to Stacey's earlier point, why these discussions do take some time, and they're complex is there's a lot of variables that we're managing. So I do think there's going to be some flexibility there, Steve, and I think that will help multiple stakeholders become comfortable with it.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then on the -- we just obviously had this big election result. And I'm just -- I know it's two days in, but just the -- any kind of thought process on what this means for kind of both new build gas and then also for your coal fleet?
Jim Burke: Yes, Steve, I'd tell you the election prediction business is tough, and so is the policy prediction business. It's -- I guess some of the thoughts that we are working through the GHG rule, and that's already being challenged, obviously, legally and with the DC circuit. There's -- that could potentially be revised at some point. And you can see that with this administration, that affected not only the coal units, but also new gas. And so that's something that -- we'll have to see how that plays out, and that could still take some time to play out, but that does appear to be more open at the moment, at least in concept. But getting back to this resource adequacy topic and also just the administration changes, it's hard to look at 30, 35-year assets and look at the changes that happen policy-wise on a 4-year cadence, and see through all of that. That's a difficult thing for investors to do. One of the things I like about our business model, and I don't think this is something we talk about a lot is that we're a pretty diversified company. We have geographic diversity across major markets in the U.S., different jurisdictions, all obviously, competitive markets but we have a broad technology diversity. The largest part of our fleet is gas-fired generation, but then it's nuclear and a coal business that's continuing to decline and a growing solar and battery business. So we have a lot of diversity in technologies and in line of business. You heard today, the retail business is large and growing. And that tends to be complementary to the generation business. So it's really hard to look at first and second order effects of potential policy changes, but I think we've demonstrated that we're flexible as a company and that will take opportunities that the market presents us and execute on it. So I view this as -- I wouldn't say this is normal course for Vistra, but this has been a lot of our history in the competitive market is having to adapt. And so we are obviously open to the technologies that you've mentioned. It's a big part of our portfolio, and we'll have to see if that if some of those get some extended life opportunities, but too early to call.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then one last quick one. You added the mention for 2026 of potentially meaningfully above the $6 billion. I don't know if you care to define what meaningfully means and the like or just in the event that -- in the event that the PJM auction just were to price where it did the last auction, is there any kind of more color you could give about that? Is that the main driver? Is it really more ERCOT pricing? Just any color would be helpful. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Steve, I'm going to let Kris take this one. Good question. We know words matter, and that would be one that you pick up on. So Kris?
Kris Moldovan: Yes, Steve, I think it's a combination of those things. I think, obviously, as you look at it, we're only -- we're 64% hedged. We're making progress in that area. But even if you look at our 2025 guidance, there's a good range around that. It's 5% plus or minus around our 2025 guidance, and we're 96% hedged there. So as we look out to 2026, and we see 64% hedged, you can imagine that our range around that is a little bit wider. And you also mentioned the PJM auction, that's an area. So we think it's still prudent to say $6 billion. I think if the auction comes in where we where it came in the last time and as we hedge a little bit more, we have built in some protection against those things potentially going against us. So you could see some upside. And I think that we're not going to we're not going to state where we see the upper end, but you can imagine that we've built in a little bit of upside to that if those things -- as we hedge more and as we see the auction results come in.
Steven Fleishman: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I just wanted to pick up, I guess, on the diversified footprint as you mentioned there. Just wondering how you think about the ERCOT versus PJM opportunity set at this point in time, particularly in light of the Town ISA ruling granted it's early days, but do you see things like this kind of starting to favor ERCOT more at the margin?
Jim Burke: I don't think so, Jeremy. The capacity, again, the ISA is one dimension, but a capacity market construct in PJM is something that I think creates a real opportunity to send a price signal and encourage investment, whether that's some assets that are on the grid to not retire or to bring new assets and obviously meeting the load growth that PJM is now forecasting that market design does not exist in Texas. And that's something that from a capacity market discussion, where it's an energy-only market. And so it has been a bit more volatile in terms of you might have a really strong summer in 2023, but we've had weaker clears in 2024. So if you were putting batteries on the grid right now in 2024, you're probably wondering if you're going to get a return on those batteries, whereas you might have felt really good about it heading into the summer of 2023. So the ISA is only one dimension. It's important to note that load is low. If this load comes into PJM, whether it's behind the meter or front of the meter, it's load growth a capacity market should send a signal like it did at the end of July, but there was intervention coming on the heels of that that's now led to a request for a 6-month delay. Again, as I stated earlier, if these markets would consistently run their opportunities for the auction in the case of PJM. And for Texas being clear about signaling wanting the load to come, I think these price signals would be there. There'd be investment opportunities in both of them. But right now, PJM has a more structured way of valuing capacity and signaling in a forward curve basis, the need for that capacity then does the ERCOT market.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood on the PJM capacity auction there. But maybe coming back to the power curves, how do you see that evolving over time? Do you think that demand is really reflected in future pricing there? Or how do you see that kind of evolving?
Jim Burke: Yes. That would get more to sort of a fundamental view of where do we think the curves are relative to this load growth. And I would say, it feels to me and Steve Muscato, our Head of our Wholesale and gen business can chime in here, but it feels to me that the curves are not factoring in all of this load growth at this point that there's a lot of forecasts out there, folks are going to want to see more data points that is actually coming to fruition. And we try to put in our presentation, we're seeing that we're on this curve of load growth. We put that in for what we're seeing in 2024. But as noted earlier in some of the questions, there's massive load growth being forecasted by the ISO as well as the wires companies. I would not say the curves reflect all of that coming in at this point. And I think just some of the recency of this summer is also weighing on the curves. And Steve, I would like to have you add some comments to that.
Steve Muscato: Sure, Jim. I think people are extrapolating what I'll call historical load growth from the last 2 or 3 years of between 3% to 4% over the peaks. And I think they're putting that forward in their models. It really gets down to how much of -- I think someone mentioned the ENCORE study with 80 gigawatts of data. So how much of that actually gets in? And will we exceed the historical trends that we've seen before. And I also do think there's some recency bias. Unfortunately, power is only liquid may be out until 2028, 2029, it's hard to see beyond that, and there's not a lot of activity. And so the recent clears we saw, I think, this summer have weighed a little bit because I think people also try to figure out there's a very large asymmetry in pricing in Texas that we've seen both in the winter and in the summer. And one of the areas I think you'll see Traders focus on more in the future is what kind of premium do you put on winter because even if batteries continue to come into the market, which I think they're going to be challenged because they're -- as you mentioned earlier, Jim, they're cannibalizing the revenue streams. Right now, there's so many of them, there's more batteries in the market right now. Then the ancillary services can handle, which is their primary source of revenue, not necessarily under arbitrage. And when you mix that in with a winter event that's not just 1 or 2 hours in duration. I think you may see some more scarcity come into the winter curves going forward.
Jim Burke: And thank you, Steve. And I'd like to add, Jeremy, just two other dimensions. This was the first month that we've seen where the new additions in the queue for solar and storage and wind were actually less than the number of projects canceled or moved into inactive status. So I do think markets have a way of over time, rationalizing economics. The other thing I think that's weighed on the curves was the curves looked very attractive in the sort of May 2024 time frame. And I think the test the quantity of the test interest and the discussions of continuing TEF or even having a larger TEF. I'm sorry, I'm saying TEF, Texas Energy Fund. That is something that I think the markets are struggling to figure out how to handicap and look at is that only going to be an incentive for new generation only? Or is that going to send a signal to keep existing generation online. And so there's still a lot to sort out, I think, on the TEF because we're still in early stages with the due diligence process, and we're going to enter a legislative session next year. And I think folks are trying to figure out what is the state going to do if they're going to actually increase that quantity of assets qualifying for TEF or if they're going to let the market send a price signal to try to bring that investment. And I think that's still too early to call.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. That was kind of getting to my last question here with regards to TEF and just your project development activities in ERCOT, especially with the tough considerations that you said there, could you just, I guess, update us overall on your thought process?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes. We did submit two peakers as part of the TEF application. Basically, each party that was selected, was selected for one project. So one of our two peakers was selected. As we stated when we made the announcement in May and have continued to stay since then, we want to see the actual development from a market design standpoint make progress. We -- our reliability standard has been developed. It's not linked to a requirement if we fall below a reserve or there are concerns around reliability is not linked to a market mechanism to procure additional resources in the market, but at least the reliability standard has been designed and will be studied on a periodic basis. The PCM performance credit mechanism is now hard capped at $1 billion. It was a net cap. So presumably, that could mean a lower overall quantity of resources being dedicated to a performance credit mechanism. And there are some discussions about even that being challenged potentially in the legislative session. So I think that in the ancillary services like the dispachable reliability reserve service are still to be figured out. Real-time co-optimization is in flight as well for ancillaries and energy that could be bearish for some price formation. And that also speaks to how do we incentivize resources to come into the state to meet the load growth. And I don't think we have all that figured out yet in Texas. And I think that's work that we've got to do as an industry so that we can continue to meet the need. We've designed our projects for the peakers that we're continuing to move forward. The team is working on all the efforts we need on site as well as with our key partners. But we also have off ramps to both of those peakers if the market developments that we need to see don't occur. And we hope that's not the case because we'd like to bring those peakers, but we've got to make economic decisions. And we're still not there yet.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So maybe first on 2026, maybe even 2027. So just wondering if by then, by 2026, 2027, you would expect to have any meaningful EBITDA impact from those data center deals, be it colocations or virtual PPAs? And also, if that changes the way you're hedging your especially baseload units in those outer years?
Jim Burke: Yes, Angie, thank you for the question. I would say it's tough to see it being meaningful in 2026, 2027 simply because of the physics building out what you need to on the ground and then obviously powering the site as resources, servers chips become available and installed. And that's after the study processes have to be done on the front end. And so the time line for these, you could be in a 4 to 5-year process before you're putting a meaningful amount of power to a co-located facility. So I think time line wise, it's not really affecting how we're thinking about the hedging in the more near term sort of this 2026, 2027. And if it did, we'd start layering it in, in a more -- we're pretty open, still obviously, 2027, more than 2026. So we hope that opportunity is there to be layering that in, but I would not say from a guidance perspective or from a hedging perspective, it's in the horizon that we've been talking to the market about in terms of our direction here for our earnings power.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then changing OpEx. So a lot of discussion, obviously, in interest in your nuclear plants. You have many more gas plants. Can you just give us a sense directionally about the pricing differential for nuclear assets versus gas assets? Is it as simple as just the carbon-free attributes or again, just even directionally, how these prices compare and the discussions that you have with the data centers. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Yes. Thank you, Angie. I would say we aren't able and really would prefer not to share pricing differences by asset class. But I will say that in previous calls, I've mentioned that customers look at this as a list of preferences. There's things that they are seeking that are more ideal including location and what kind of energy needs there might be for cooling, right? So there's all sorts of variables that are going to go into the equation of how valuable is this to a customer in speed and land and water and other variables are going to play into their willingness to pay under certain circumstances, more or less for different locations. And so I would not expect -- I could be wrong, but I would not expect the gas assets to have the same premium as nuclear because of the carbon 3 24/7 attributes of nuclear. But there is an openness to gas that we're encouraged about. And I think the flexibility of being able to work with these assets is attractive for a number of parties, including co-location partners that aren't directly the hyperscalers themselves. So I think I'd like to leave it at that, Angie, but I think that's the way we're thinking about it.
Angie Storozynski: And then last one, I know I promised Eric, just one question. But could you comment about the transmission capacity around your PGM assets, especially the especially Beaver Valley. So for example, if there were to be a need for a virtual PPA in like in front of the meter deal for that asset, is the transmission sort of overbuilt around it? Or do you have to wait for upgrades?
Jim Burke: Yes, I'll start, Angie, and I'll ask Stacey for her views, but we sit in a pretty balanced area where we are from a congestion point of view with locations we have, the three locations there in PJM. There's still going to be study processes and efforts to connect load even if there is a perceived capacity available on the transmission system because there is still studying to be done about what adding load and particular spot is going to do to the whole system. And I don't think we view it necessarily as it's going to be faster or slower if there is some capacity or not, I think it's probably going to be slower if it's fun of the meter versus co-located. And I think that's what we need to work. Again, we may end up doing both in the area in that region of the country. Stacey, anything you'd like to add to that?
Stacey Doré: I would just add that at Beaver Valley, we do have a necessary study agreement. It's already been studied that a load could be co-located there without negative impact to the grid. And so I agree with Jim that it's the benefit of colocation and the reason customers are pursuing it is for speed to market. So it will be faster than front of the meter. Having said that, again referencing what Jim said, earlier, there will be plenty of front-of-the-meter connections as well. And to the extent as we do with all customers that we can serve those customers with for their front of the meter connection, we're certainly open to those discussions and having some of those discussions as well.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. I want to thank the team for their continued execution and service to our customers and communities. We appreciate we're having this call in a very dynamic time. And I can just assure you our team is focused on delivering. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we certainly hope to see you in person soon. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Vistra Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's Investor Webcast discussing our second quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2024 operational and financial results. Beginning on Slide 5, you can see the team has been hard at work across multiple parts of our business. Through their efforts, we achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.414 billion, a very strong second quarter against a backdrop of lower wholesale energy prices across the country. While results benefited from the inclusion of the first full quarter contribution from the Energy Harbor businesses, consistent execution from our generation, commercial, and retail teams played a major role in this achievement. Specifically, our diversified portfolio of generation assets produced record levels of power for our customers while completing the planned outages needed to prepare the fleet for the crucial summer months. Our retail business led by our flagship TXU Energy brand delivered year-over-year growth, while producing solid margin performance and maintaining a top score on the PUC of Texas power to choose scorecard. Finally, despite the weather volatility across the country in general, power prices cleared below our hedge levels. Through strong execution of our comprehensive hedging program by our commercial team, our second quarter results reflect the solid performance anticipated when we set our expectations for the year. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4.550 billion to $5.050 billion. Based on performance to date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver towards the upper end of this range. As we noted during our first quarter results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit or PTC, given the uncertainty around the interpretation of gross receipts in the regulations. However, based on where prices settled in the first seven months of the year and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be upwards of $400 million. Moving to our long-term outlook. Our integrated business model, which combines critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in the current volatile and growing markets. Given our hedging activity over the past several months and the recent 2025-2026 PJM planning year auction results, we are raising our estimated 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million to $5.200 billion to $5.700 billion. Similar to our 2024 guidance, our range of 2025 ongoing operations mid-point opportunities excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC. However, it is important to note that we believe the nuclear PTC will provide downside support for such range of opportunities and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including PTC estimates in our forecasts. Underpinning the improvement in our outlook is our focus on our four key strategic priorities outlined on Slide 6. Our integrated business model leverages our diverse portfolio of generation assets coupled with our strong retail brands to deliver more consistent results as evidenced by our second quarter performance. Our core tenant of one team continues to foster not only teamwork, but drives learning and best practices across all aspects of our company to create a culture of continuous improvement, including at our recently added PJM nuclear sites. As discussed on the previous slide, our commercial teams continue to execute on our comprehensive hedging program to provide visibility into the earnings power of the business, while also providing meaningful downside protection to our long-term outlook. While our current 2024 guidance and long-term outlook both exclude any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, we believe the availability of a nuclear PTC de-risks a substantial portion of the earnings potential of our nuclear assets, making them increasingly more valuable. Switching to capital allocation, we view this as a critical responsibility and we will remain disciplined in our allocation process. We continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned approximately $5 billion to our investors, including $4.25 billion of share repurchases through August 5 of this year. We expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout 2024 and 2025. Moving to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong with net leverage at the end of the quarter at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. We continue to expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. On energy transition, we continue to be opportunistic in executing on a renewable development pipeline. We began construction on two new large scale solar projects, one in Texas and one in Illinois. To ensure full off-take from these facilities, we executed new long-term power purchase agreements with two of the world's leading technology companies, one with Amazon and the other with Microsoft. We are excited to partner with these well-known companies to provide carbon free electricity for their operations. Moving forward, our development opportunity pipeline remains robust. Our large geographic footprint across the country, which encompasses more than 70 sites with grid interconnects and thousands of acres of land for development, provides ample opportunities to meet customer needs for a particular energy technology or to co-locate operations. Our approach to the energy expansion continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined project returns for our shareholders. We have highlighted this approach in our most recent sustainability report, which we published on July 31. We are proud of the approach we take to sustainability, which ensures that we are reducing our emissions while also creating a sustainable business strategy for all of our stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7. We see a potential significant supply gap emerging in the largest markets we serve. During our first quarter results call, we outlined the potential multiple drivers of future demand and these include the reassuring of industrial activity partially due to the CHIPS Act, the build out of data centers, whether behind the meter or in front of the meter, increased electrification of commercial, industrial and residential loads and strong population growth, particularly in Texas. In addition this demand growth, we believe current environmental policies will drive significant retirements of dispatchable thermal generation, notably coal plants, through the end of the decade, creating a supply/demand gap. Many of these policies are driven by decisions at the state level and are less influenced by federal policies. Supported by PJM's recent market reforms, the higher clearing prices for the 2025/2026 capacity auction are beginning to signal to competitive market participants, including investors who can respond to this supply gap. While it is only one auction clear, capacity revenues over time can help offset lower wholesale energy prices, which have softened in the outer year since our last call in May. Generation units are long-lived assets, and a consistent, predictable market framework focused on reliability is necessary to attract capital for new dispatchable supply. The Texas market relies almost exclusively on the wholesale energy price to incentivize new generation, and we have seen a lot of volatility in these forward curves. Policymakers have recently created the Texas Energy Fund to provide lower cost financing and completion bonuses for up to 10 gigawatts of new gas fuel dispatchable generation. This does provide some financial support for new build, but we believe forward price signals and market reforms will be necessary to attract sufficient equity capital to build new gas fuel generation. However, in a competitive market, as has been the case in Texas for nearly 30 years, there will be many market participants and investors to evaluate their opportunities and decide their best path forward. As we announced in late May, we are targeting up to 2,000 megawatts of dispatchable gas fuel generation additions at ERCOT. This includes 500 megawatts of augmentations at existing facilities, nearly half of which we have brought online already this summer, and up to 600 megawatts from the conversion of our Coleto Creek coal plant to a gas fueled unit, which will take place after the plant's retirement in the middle of 2027. These investments represent accretive opportunities for our company while preserving good paying jobs for our fellow Texans. We also submitted our application in July for the Texas Energy Fund financing for up to 860 megawatts of advanced peaker plants in West Texas. As noted in our announcement, we are in the early stages of development of these plants as we monitor the successful implementation of key market reforms focused on grid reliability as well as sufficient market signals. These key reforms include a suite of ancillary services, the performance credit mechanism, or PCM, and an effective reliability standard, a first for Texas. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders to shape a robust framework for investment in Texas. Looking broadly across the markets we serve, the interconnection queues are largely filled with wind, solar and battery resources for a number of reasons, including tax incentives, state policies and the preferences of large customers. The combination of low growth coal plant retirements and additional intermittent resources will require both baseload and flexible dispatchable units. Vistra is well-positioned with its diversified fleet and we will continue to work with policymakers, customers, and communities to ensure their energy needs are met reliably, affordably, and sustainably. This is what drives our purpose at Vistra and our team is excited about the future set of opportunities. And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris?
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9, Vistra delivered another strong quarterly result with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.414 billion including $625 million from generation and $789 million from retail. This represents an approximately 40% improvement year-over-year and brings our year-to-date ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $2.227 billion. Notably, the performance of generation and retail year-to-date, together with our forecast for both businesses for the remainder of the year are driving our confidence in Vistra's ability to deliver 2024 aggregate results towards the upper end of the guidance range. Focusing on year-over-year results despite continued mild summer weather in Texas and lower wholesale prices across competitive markets, the generation team once again capitalized on the volatility in the quarter by optimizing the run profile of our generation units, including ramping down and buying power from the market when economically appropriate. The team's ability to perform in a variety of market conditions is made possible by the consistently high operational performance, the diversity and the flexibility of our fleet. Turning to retail, our second quarter results benefited from the continuation of higher counts and margins cited in the first quarter. Additionally, as expected, due to the evolving seasonality of underlying power costs, the retail team delivered a significantly higher portion of the expected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024 as compared to 2023. Finally, our 2024 results for generation of retail have benefited from the inclusion of the former energy harbor businesses, which benefit totaled approximately $200 million for the second quarter and approximately $260 million year-to-date. The contribution from these businesses for both the second quarter and year-to-date results was primarily driven by the PJM nuclear fleet, which accounted for approximately three quarters of the contribution in both periods. Moving to Slide 10. We have seen significant volatility in forward power price curves in the last several months. However, our commercial team was able to take advantage of this volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 86% in calendar year 2025 and approximately 55% in calendar year 2026 at what we believe to be attractive prices. As Jim noted earlier, given our current hedge positions in 2025, combined with the prices realized in the recent 2025/2026 PJM planning year capacity auction, we increased our estimate for the 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million. Although forward power prices have generally fallen since our first quarter earnings call, the additional hedges we have executed and the 2025/2026 PJM auction results continue to give us confidence in our estimated 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity of more than $6 billion even before we update our assumptions for the upcoming 2026/2027 PJM planning year capacity auction. Notably, as is the case with our 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, which could be meaningful. Finally, we continue to target a conversion rate of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth of 55% to 60% for 2025 and beyond, excluding any upside from the nuclear PTC, which is generally expected to benefit adjusted free cash flow before growth at least one year after being recognized in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. As a result, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026, which we expect to discuss in more detail on our third quarter results call in November. Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value to our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 135 million shares or approximately 29% at an average price per share of approximately $27.50. Despite the increase in our stock price in 2024, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. To that end, as Jim noted, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, and at least an additional $1 billion in 2026. Moving to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, despite the additional debt that was required to close the Energy Harbor acquisition in the first quarter of this year. We expect it to return to below 3x by the end of 2024. We continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, not including the benefit of margin deposits below 3x. As Jim discussed earlier, we are excited to announce the two long-term power purchase agreements with Amazon and Microsoft for two new large scale solar facilities. As a reminder, we expect to fund approximately 60% to 70% of our solar and energy storage capital expenditures with non-recourse financing. We remain committed to our opportunistic approach to our solar and energy storage growth strategy and continue to target levered returns of mid-teens or higher for these projects. Finally, as we highlighted in the first quarter results call, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $135 million of such dividends in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance in the first half of the year and we remain committed to executing against our four strategic priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning, Jim. Jim, just in light of the PJM capacity print, would you consider investing in new gas or storage and RTO at this point? I mean, do you think one or two more prints at this level are sufficient to attract new entry? Does this kind of change any of your thinking regarding any potential coal to gas on the Sunset fleet? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Yes. Shar, it's a great question. PJM has been working on market reforms for quite some time, and we've talked about that on previous calls. It's a long process, and I think they've made great headway in looking at the sort of contribution that different resource classes, like dispatchable, can provide. And I think we saw that reflected in this most recent clear. It is only one auction, of course, and not long enough out in the future to be starting a new project because they are behind, obviously, and they're catching up on the number of auctions in the next couple of years. This December will be another interesting signal. We think it can clear at or above where this most recent clear was just given some of the fundamentals. And I think that does make PJM attractive. I think that's one of the things that PJM is offering now is a signal towards assets that provides us reliability benefit. We have a number of sites in PJM operating. We obviously have some coal plants, we could look at potential conversions at some point to gas. And I think others will look at that as well. But it is a good signal. Shar, it's still early stages, but I think a lot of progress has been made there.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just, Jim, on 2026, right, obviously, you reiterated the mid-point opportunity, but we saw some trade-offs between the curves falling in the blowout PJM capacity number.
Jim Burke: Right.
Shar Pourreza: But the question is like, would you have been at that $6 billion figure before the auction results? Maybe if you could just put a little bit of a finer point on the ranges around the year, even directionally? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, good question, Shar. So when we first announced the $6 billion plus, we were talking about this on the May call. Curves were actually quite strong at that point in time in the market in Texas and PJM, frankly, across the country. As you know, the curves have come off quite a bit. We were about 50% hedged on that call. Now we're about 55% hedged. So we have seen some gross margin for particularly the unhedged portion, erode some of the 2026 earnings. But we had a sense because of our open position, Shar, we wouldn't have put $6 billion plus out if we couldn't handle some volatility in the curves because that's just the nature of the business we're in. With this clear, obviously, that captures only part of 2026 and this auction coming up in December will capture the other part of 2026. We did not revise the 2026 number. As you noted, we did revise 2025. I think with these -- with the clear we've had, in this upcoming clear, we are strongly above the $6 billion plus figure, but we're going to refresh that next quarter. When we come out next quarter, we'll give you a 2025 guidance number, which is not what we've provided today. We merely reflected the auction clear for 2025, and we'll give more visibility into 2026. But the business has been very resilient. And I think these -- the diversification of our fleet, plus having the retail business, the earnings power of the business is strong.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just one more quick one. Just on the FERC Technical Conference, I know you guys have been obviously super vocal in the Susquehanna ISA amendment process. Has that -- the technical conference, has that slowed any of the conversations you've been having with customers around co-location opportunities? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Hey Shar, it has not slowed. The conversation is down. I think, first of all, these conversations are numerous. They are not only are there a lot of customers having -- that we're having conversations with, but they're having conversations with a lot of potential suppliers like ourselves. We're making really good progress with our customers. We're in due diligence for a number of sites. Clearly, this process, including a technical conference will -- it is of interest to folks. But these are some long-dated conversations and these are sizable decisions that folks are making. If they contract for one of our larger sites, for instance, they could be approaching $1 billion a year in power costs at a single site. So these take time to evolve, but it has not slowed the pace of play. I think there's going to be plenty of data center load behind the meter or co-located and also front of the meter. I think there's going to be plenty. And I think they're evaluating these customers are evaluating all their options. So we'll see how the technical conference goes. We're clearly in support FERC approving this amended ISA. We think the record is very clear on that, but more to come, and we're going to stay active, as I know all of the market participants will. But this is a really big opportunity for our industry to meet customer needs. And frankly, create a lot of jobs, a lot of economic development, and I hope as an industry we don't get in our own way here and that we're able to see that this load growth is really beneficial for our economy broadly. And we expect these conversations to stay active until we get to a decision with a couple of key customers, which we're pretty optimistic about.
Shar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys so much. Much appreciated. See you again.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Shar.
Operator: The next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So just continuing on this topic of the co-locations and general, the load growth. So we're seeing some raised conversations from wires on the utilities and competitive markets, PJM, in particular, they are seemingly concerned about the load growth and reliability of the electric service over the next couple of years as this load materializes. And so that led to some concerns about potential interventions in competitive power markets, regulated new build, you name it. And that seemingly is not just response to the new build projections, but also to this last PJM capacity auction. I mean, it's somewhat concerning, right, because the same parties were not raising their hands to support merchant power plants when power prices were super low. And seemingly, it should be a cyclical market where we should spikes in power and capacity prices to incentivize new build. So I mean, how do you manage this narrative? Do you sort of rush your assets to contract them to protect them against any sort of market interventions? Is it just -- do you think that this is just a rhetoric that will pass? Is the basically the pull so big that all parties can benefit? I mean my take has been that just -- that goes to show that wires on the utilities know that the best way to benefit is through generation assets, but I'm just going to wonder how you're going to approach that.
Jim Burke: Yes. Angie, there's a lot in that question. It is something we think about quite a bit. The beauty of a competitive market is anybody can build generation in a competitive market, and that includes the regulated utilities as long as they're doing it in the competitive market context. That framework has shown over the years to over $80 billion has been invested by competitive companies in PJM since the market opened over $100 billion has been invested by competitive companies at ERCOT since the market opened. This is the first clear, as we just talked about, that has shown real life in quite some time. And while it looks like it's 9x to 10x higher than the last clear, on average is bringing maybe 40% to 50% of what you would need to build a new gas plant. This is not a clear that in and of itself without energy margin makes all the math work from an investor point of view. I know the regulated utilities feel a need to serve their customers with a reliable product, and we feel that need as well. That is a core tenant of our strategy. I think there's plenty of investment opportunities on the transmission and distribution side to not only serve new load but to connect the new generation resources. And that queue has been slow to develop in PJM, and I know PJM wants to accelerate that. So I still go back to what I said just a minute ago, I don't think we should be worried about, are there some ancillary services that need to be paid or some wires charges that need to be paid. The customers we're talking to, want to pay for the services that they're being delivered, whether that's on the wire side or the generation side. I think there's plenty of opportunity for all of us to work together to not only make this an economic opportunity for our respective companies, but to meet the customer need. That's ultimately what we're doing here is meeting a customer need and I think we're going to all have to work together to do it. But it's something that I think, Angie, is going to unfold through time. Nothing happens in the power market as fast as the technology space would like it to. And frankly, as fast as we would like it to. So I think we just need to keep the dialogue open and work through these issues. But we think there's plenty to go around for this to be a real boom for all stakeholders.
Angie Storozynski: And then as far as your approach to those co-location deals and any other long-term contracts, I mean it seems like you were taking this portfolio strategy. But I'm just wondering, it almost feels like the time is of the essence, not just about the time to market for tech companies, but also as far as regulatory scrutiny of these deals. I mean, don't you think that maybe it would be worth pulling forward some of these transactions not to wait for all of the reviews to happen just to announce these deals on like a plant by plant? Again, in other portfolio announcements, but just plant by plant deals, again, if only because there could be more risk to future deals as well as these co-locations happen?
Jim Burke: Yes. I think, Angie, the regulatory questions obviously are getting some attention, but I still view this as a customer-driven event. The customers are going to want to sign these contracts and get comfortable with the resources, the location, the speed with which they will energize the terms under which we'll do business. So it isn't just up to our company to just move quickly. It's up to our company to be responsive to customer needs, and we need to work through the necessary filings and the studies to make that happen. But if the customer pull is there, I think Vistra is going to be right there with any of the other parties to be able to meet this need. But I also think the regulators are doing the job they need to do, which is ask questions. And I think the response that's been provided in the amended ISA has answered those questions, and we're optimistic that, that will get approved. But this is not simply up to Vistra in terms of how fast Vistra wants to move. There are real customers here with real resources that they're committing just like we'll be committing and those conversations take time. These are complicated deals, and they're valuable for all of us. But we hear your question. I just think that it's not just a one-way direction for Vistra to control. I think this is something that we need to work together to get it done on the right time frame.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And the last one, you mentioned both behind the meter and in front of the meter co-location. Do you have any preference? I mean, it almost feels like in front of the meter co-location would have addressed some of the concerns raised in Talent's ISA?
Jim Burke: Yes, absolutely. I think -- first of all, I think there's going to be both. There is -- this is -- the frustration, I think, that comes into this discussion at times from players is everybody views these as one or the other. There's so much load growth, and if you follow what folks are looking at, not only for data centers, but other sources of electrification and reindustrialization there's going to be a lot -- the vast majority will be front of the meter. There's just no way to meet all of these needs behind the meter. So we view that as load growth in either way and that is going to help supply demand kind of fundamentals. The behind the meter piece is just a unique opportunity really for us to co-locate much like other large customers have done for the last 20 years, and we can provide a speed to market advantage because there should not be the same level of resources needed to build out on the transmission side simply from a time frame perspective. When if we've got the land and the ability to provide them the reliable product that they're looking for, we should be able to contract and earn a margin for doing so. So I think both of those are valuable opportunities, Angie, and we're pursuing both with our customers.
Operator: The next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much. Could you give an update on your latest views on newbuild in ERCOT, how that's going to shake out? How much could we see as we think about this TEF, the final proposals there? And in your view, are prices high enough when you look out the curve to really justify the economics of newbuild?
Jim Burke: And David, great question. So a couple of things there. I do think the curve is coming off in the last couple of months, just starting there in and of itself is a different view than where we were even sitting in the first week of May. And so if you just simply look at the curves, these projects are challenged. And I think we're a long -- a net long generator as a company. We have a lot more generation length than we serve retail load. So if we only were looking at the curve and the curve is not that liquid, so you can't overreact to the curves in early May, and you can't overreact to the curves here in early August. But on a curve-only basis, the Texas market is a different investment construct than other markets in the country. And I think the legislature recognized that. That's why they pass the test, and then the Sunset Bill last session, they also put in a couple of other things to work on some reliability reserve service, which is a new ancillary, and they also codified the performance credit mechanism. So in our view, what the Texas legislature did, would say we need to provide some low-cost financing to encourage gas plants to be built. And that has a maximum of 10,000 megawatts. So regardless of how many had notification of interest and how many are in the application process, the max is 10,000 megawatts. That was expected to have $10 billion of funding to back it. And right now, they have funded $5 billion. But it's likely the additional $5 billion could come, before the next session or during the next session, to fully fund up to the 10,000 megawatts. Our view is that low-cost financing and some completion bonuses alone would not make these projects justifiable. The lower cost of financing is helpful, but you still need adequate revenue to be able to make these projects work. So the market reforms we believe are very important part of the overall package. And when we made our announcement in May about the 2,000 megawatts, we're comfortable proceeding with the augmentations. We're comfortable proceeding with the conversion of Coleto, and we don't have any test requests for that, and we expect the -- given the economics of those, those would move forward. However, we did file for TEF for the two new peakers, and we think that the TEF loan is, again, helpful, but we also still need to see the revenue construct that the market reforms are intended to help address. We don't know how those are going to ultimately shake out because there's been so much interest in the TEF that I think some folks believe that maybe that's enough to address the concerns around grid reliability in Texas. We're not sure how much of the TEF generation ultimately gets built. I think it's too early to tell. But for the long-term, not only to incentivize the right reliable -- reliability assets, but also to preserve the reliability assets that are currently on the grid, some of which are aging quite -- to quite long lives, 40, 50 years plus, there needs to be some revenue signals. Not all stakeholders in agreement on that. The advocacy from the large industrials and commercial customer base is very price sensitive, very cost sensitive. This is a market that values low energy prices. So I don't know how the stakeholder process will ultimately work out. We're going to monitor that from here, and we're very active in it, and we'll see how it develops throughout the session. But I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to come to fruition, especially if some of the market reform aspects are not supported through the end of the process, consistent with the Sunset Bill at SB3.
David Arcaro: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it.
Jim Burke: Thank you, David.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Just to maybe follow-up on that last question on the TEF. Could you give us a better sense of like when the go/no-go decision might need to be made by you and others through this process for whatever the curves? Yes, when do you have to make a decision really?
Jim Burke: So at the end of August, we expect to hear who's been selected from a due diligence perspective to move forward with the TEF process. So on the loan and bonus program, Steve, I think all market participants will hear by the end of August, whether they make it to the next round. And then the due diligence process can take time. And ultimately, there will be an award made for the loans, and we'll have to see from a timeframe perspective, how quickly those monies will be made available. I believe they need to be dispersed. I'm going to look to stay through real quick by late 2025. And our timeframe, Steve, in terms of our decision making is that we have engineering work, we have site work, we have the interconnect process we're working through. We anticipate a go/no-go decision on some of these -- on the peakers to line up probably closer to early next summer. And then we'll have a lot more information at that point in time. But that's the timeline as we see it. And obviously, we expect to learn more, and we'll be active in the market and the stakeholder process between now and then.
Steve Fleishman: That's helpful. And then a couple, I guess, maybe numbers questions. You -- thank you for that disclosure of the $400 million that you would have had from nuclear PTC in 2024, roughly, if you included it. You then say for 2025 that it would provide downside support? Does that mean that on average right now for 2025 you are above the PTC floor? Are you just trying to kind of -- you're not really -- you're just saying that because you're not quantifying it yet. Just could you give more color on that?
Jim Burke: Sure. Steve, your question depends on which week we're talking about. Literally, right at that PTC floor, and then as of August 5, we're right below the PTC floor. So I think the way we can obviously change our annual views day-to-day, week-to-week like this. But our communication in that range was we merely wanted to reflect the capacity revenue flow through, so that you could see that it's not needed to cover some other underlying softness in our business. We feel strongly about 2025 as we did before, and we're adding the $200 million for the capacity revenues. The downside protection comes in, and if curves stayed exactly where they are, maybe we get a little bit more PTC upside. But certainly, if curves came off, you would get a lot more PTC protection. And that's really what we're communicating for 2025, it's not only have we raised the range, but we feel the PTC provides some downside protection that's valuable. You're going to see it in our 2024 results, if the regs come out the way we think they are, we're giving you that $400 million number over and above the upper end of the range that we're communicating for 2024. So that's how it works. It isn't always an in-the-money tool, but it certainly provides the downside protection that should give our investors some comfort.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then one last question. Just on the upside from the PJM auction in 2025, the $200 million increase. That seems somewhat less than we would have calculated just based on the actual auction outcome. Could you just talk to maybe some of the offsets that might be in there?
Jim Burke: Yes. So when we look at putting out our numbers for 2025, that we had already disclosed last quarter, we had a revenue assumption on an auction clear -- embedded in that than half, Steve, what the auction clear turned out to be. So we've already have a starting point in the 2025 numbers. And then if you look at how our business works, particularly in the retail piece on residential, you do some forward sale of not only energy, but capacity. So those are not as long dated of the deal, particularly in the residential space, but you have some of that, which effectively is a fixed price commitment for customers. So you wouldn't expect that to pass-through at the full value. Some of the commercial industrial contracts would pass-through. But on residential, it is not typical to be passing through the capacity piece. So when you see the $200 million, obviously, that six months of the planning period. And then, of course, there's 2026 benefit as well. By the time you get to the 2026/2027 auction, there's even less retail that would be -- that would have forward sold capacity. So you would see even more flow through at these levels of clear as you move forward.
Operator: The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey Jim, good morning. Thanks for give me time.
Jim Burke: Hey, Durgesh.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning. Hey Jim, I hate to put you on the spot, but the burning question every time we talk to you on the earnings is, when are you going to sign a data center co-location opportunity? This has been asked to you before several times, but just any more color you can share on timing? I understand there's a lot of moving pieces. Just trying to understand whether we can see something this year? Or how are you thinking about potential announcement and timing there?
Jim Burke: Yes. Durgesh, it is a hard question to answer, and I don't mind being put on the spot. I can only answer the question the best I can, which is, these are large complicated deals and they do depend on not only our desire to get one done, but the customers' comfort with getting these deals done. I do think some of the details we're working through extremely well. We have strong engagement and due diligence processes but we know that they're having conversations with multiple parties, not just Vistra. So there's a lot of work in the industry from a power generation as well as the hyperscalers and co-locators, and I do think that there's going to be a process of the funnel working its way down to realistic options. For example, with the questions being raised in the PJM environment regarding the amended ISA. Well, ERCOT does not have that same jurisdiction. So there's a Comanche Peak on a relative value perspective, step up in the process, and we're seeing some interest in Comanche Peak and even as these discussions with PJM have started to become more public on that amended ISA. So Durgesh, it's a dynamic market. It's about the best thing I can say to that, and we're moving as fast as we can, but it does take the customer side to be comfortable with this. As I mentioned, these are very large complicated deals. So our fundamentals of our business, Durgesh, they don't depend on doing a lot of data center deals. I think the supply/demand fundamentals that we've talked about, they're there, whether they're front of the meter or behind the meter, it's just a unique opportunity for a company like ours with so many sites and so many opportunities to partner directly with customers, it is upside. And we have not baked that into our forecast and our views. And so -- but I can tell you we're a competitive bunch that our team is working as hard as we can to get to a deal.
Durgesh Chopra: Great. Thank you for sharing that color. My second question is that just as we -- there's a lot of chatter around a hard landing scenario here, a bad recession, what does that mean? I know the long-term power supply demand dynamic is a major tailwind for you. But what does that mean near-term implications on power prices and then for your business?
Jim Burke: We've been through some economic shocks a number of times in our 24 years as kind of a competitive company. Obviously, the near-term, and when I say near-term, the next two years to three years, we feel really strong about our ability to generate consistent returns. But as you move out into 2027 and beyond, our business is going to be more open to the macroeconomic environment. That's not only power price and natural gas price levels, but also just the customer demand is the demand there. We have a very healthy baseload business and a very healthy residential business that tend to be pretty recession proof. And most of our business that's commercial and industrial, we don't have contracts where we're taking sort of the swing or the load risk in that. We tend to sell more take-or-pay or fixed quantity type products to those customers. So I think our business is set up well, Durgesh. I think it's a business that has shown that even when things get soft, we're able to back down some of our units, buyback hedges in the marketplace cost effectively, earn margin, whether we're generating or whether we back down. So I think we've proven the resiliency in the business model, but certainly, long-term, it make you think about your capital allocation and your investment, if you really thought we were at a prolonged sort of downturn. But that is not -- that's not anything we'll worry about in this near-term planning horizon.
Durgesh Chopra: Thank you. I appreciate the discussion.
Jim Burke: Thanks, Durgesh.
Operator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, it's actually [indiscernible] for Julien. Hope you are well doing, Jim and Kris. So to follow-up on the data center side, I know you haven't signed anything yet. But maybe can you comment on how the discussion on pricing for these potential contracts has evolved to start evaluating contracts with data center providers? Like the value of reliable baseload capacity is getting more and more recognized. You just had the PJM capacity auction. How do you see pricing trending? And how does that play into your level of comfort into signing a long-term deal?
Jim Burke: Yes. Well, we are a competitive company and pricing is a sensitive topic to be discussing on our earnings call. But I would say that the customers that we are engaged with understand the value of -- particularly on the nuclear units, they understand the value of the carbon-free attribute. They understand the value of reliability. They understand the potential speed to market benefit and they're willing to pay for that. I mean, again, you're in a competitive process. So other people are offering that, that have similar resources to Vistra. So this is, again, a buyer and a seller needing to reach agreement on what that value is. But we are having those conversations, and I think those are moving along well. Ultimately, there's more options than just the nuclear fleet. The gas fleet is also part of the conversation, and they provide other benefits for customers. They wouldn't necessarily be paying the same premium for the carbon-free attribute. But obviously, the gas assets provide reliability. They provide the opportunity to potentially be grid connected in some cases and use the renewables that are on the grid to optimize price for the customer. So there's a lot of variables to this that are going to be deal and customer-specific. But the capacity clear was noted. I think that's something that a customer, whether front of the meter or behind the meter, they're going to be looking at these kind of capacity clears as something that load is going to need to pay. And so I do think that it was a little bit more unclear before this last auction, that the auction revenues might actually be more than what they've been in previous auctions. I think this auction and the parameter shaping up for this December, show that there is actually a need for more supply in PJM. And so we'd expect the clears to stay at that level or higher, and we know that customers are savvy and they see this coming from a power cost perspective.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then lastly, we've been talking a lot about new builds, but these take time to come online. How do you think about buying existing assets? Do you see any opportunities out there? How wide the sort of bid-ask spread has been today?
Jim Burke: Yes. We have actually grown our business considerably through acquisition. And I think the history of the IPP sector, unfortunately, has been that brand new assets usually end up trading at a discount. In many cases, the IPPs themselves have not stayed financially solvent and folks have picked up those assets much more cheaply in the aftermath. And so you see that even with a recent sale that was announced of a competitive fleet, largely PJM, where those assets are receiving a value that one could argue is still $0.50, $0.60 on the dollar for new build. And I think that's the challenge with when people look at ERCOT forward curves and we talk to partners about an off-take agreement on a gas plant, for instance, they might look at the forward curves and say it's still cheaper to be leaning on the market and buying on the market than paying for a brand new asset with a return requirement. That's true whether that's a regulated asset or in a market or that's true, whether it's in a competitive market. So I think we have shown an ability to pick up assets and integrate them and earn the synergies, and we're still open to doing that. There are more assets coming to the market. I think people have seen the value of these gas assets have improved, but they haven't improved to the level that it costs to do new build. And that gap is not closed meaningfully. And so yes, we will be active. We always are active in looking at opportunities. But we'll be looking to see if those two things converge down the road. But right now, there is still a delta.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, Jim and congrats on the quarter.
Jim Burke: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Yes. I just want to thank everyone for joining. I want to thank our team for their continued execution and service to our customers and our communities. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we'll continue to work hard to power through the summer months here and deliver on our strategic priorities. And we hope to see you in-person soon. So have a nice end of your summer, and we'll talk to you again on our next quarter call in November. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Vistra First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our first quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There, you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. 
 Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. 
 Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. 
 Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
 I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. 
 I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke. 
James Burke: Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our first quarter 2024 results call. This call is taking place in conjunction with a major milestone for Vistra, namely the first day of inclusion of our stock in the S&P 500. I want to recognize the hard work of our Vistra team and the support and patience exhibited by our shareholders as this is a result of both strong execution over time, bolstered by improving market dynamics in the power sector. We are pleased to be included in the index and excited about the future prospects for Vistra and its stakeholders. 
 Turning to Slide 5. Before we cover the positive results for the quarter, it's worth noting that we see a significant increase in Vistra's long-term outlook. Our team has been hard at work to ensure Vistra's best positioned for the increasing power demand fundamentals while providing reliable, affordable and sustainable power to our customers. 
 Continuing the theme of execution, our integration teams were hard at work during this quarter with the closing of our acquisition of Energy Harbor on March 1. We were ready on day 1 to unify under the Vistra name and welcome our new colleagues. 
 The core theme throughout the integration process has been 1 team, and we believe that is crucial to a sustainable, high-performance organization. The sites are working closely with each other to share best practices and create a culture of continuous improvement. As a result, the teams identified the potential for several operational and performance improvements throughout the nuclear fleet. 
 As Kris will cover later, including the expected financial benefits of these improvements and the additional synergies we've identified, we now expect the run rate adjusted EBITDA contribution from Energy Harbor to exceed $1.1 billion beginning in 2026. 
 Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned to our investors approximately $4.6 billion, including $3.9 billion of share repurchases through May 3 of this year. We continue to view our shares as an attractive investment and expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout '24 and '25. Crucially, our balance sheet remains strong, enabling the ongoing capital return plan. 
 Our net leverage finished the quarter at approximately 3x, exceeding our expectations indicated on the previous quarter results call. We expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in solar and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. Our Baldwin and Calpine sites where construction began earlier this year on paired solar energy storage facilities are good examples of this strategy, and we expect these to be online by the end of the year. Finally, we've completed our first nonrecourse financing in Vistra Zero, providing attractive capital for our growing portfolio of operating renewable assets. 
 Moving to Slide 6. We achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $813 million, a 47% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. As you can see, many of the themes contributing to results last year continued into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter of 2024 again reflected the benefits of our comprehensive hedging program as the warmest winter on record in the U.S. led to lower-than-expected cleared power prices across the country. Specifically, while power prices in the markets we serve cleared below $30 per megawatt hour on average for the first quarter, our first quarter results reflect an average realized power price of over $50 per megawatt hour. 
 In these volatile weather environments, which included a winter event in mid-January and then mild weather in February and March, our generation team once again delivered with another strong quarter of commercial availability at approximately 98%. Being flexible with, not only daily operations, including ramping down when economics signal us to do so, but rescheduling planned outages to optimize opportunities enabled the business to deliver strong results. 
 Finally, the retail team delivered another positive quarter of customer count growth across our Texas and Midwest and Northeast geographies. With the acquisition of Energy Harbor now complete, we're initiating a guidance on a combined basis for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4,550,000,000 to $5,050,000,000 and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $2,200,000,000 to $2,700,000,000. It's important to note that this guidance excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, given the uncertainty around how it will be implemented when the regulations are issued later this year. 
 However, based on where prices settled in the first quarter and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the PTC could add a significant amount to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range. 
 Finally, you will note that the implied conversion rate from ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth for 2024 is below our stated target of 55% to 60%, primarily due to a couple of timing impacts. We expect to return to our target 55% to 60% range in 2025 and beyond. 
 While we are not providing guidance to reflect specific ranges for Vistra Vision and Vistra Tradition, our view is that each is expected to contribute roughly half of our adjusted EBITDA over time. However, given the business mix and current capital structure, you can expect Vistra Vision will convert adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow before growth at a higher rate over time, roughly 60% to 65% compared to Vistra Tradition, which we expect to convert at a rate of approximately 50% to 55%. 
 Turning to Slide 7. There has been much discussion in recent months about the substantial power demand growth forecast, including from the potential build-out of data centers and other sources of electricity demand. Third-party research indicates data center-related activity could approach 35 gigawatts of additional demand by 2030. However, our teams also see multiple additional potential drivers of demand in the geographies we serve. These drivers include: continued reshoring of industrial activity as evidenced by multiple large chip manufacturing site build-outs, partially due to the CHIPS Act; increased electrification of commercial, industrial, and residential load across the country, as evidenced by the expectation of approximately 20 gigawatts of additional power demand in West Texas by 2030; and strong population growth, particularly in the state of Texas, which has been steady at 1.5% to 2% per year. 
 With these drivers, we see the potential demand outcome skewing higher, albeit with a wider range. In their most recent report, PJM's load growth expectations through 2030 doubled from their 2023 estimate. In Texas, recent reports from ERCOT suggest load growth from 2030 in a wide range from as low as 1.6% per year to as high as 6% growth per year or even higher if more than half of the large loads recently discussed to ERCOT actually materialize. 
 The trailing 10 years has been approximately 2.5%, and that was before some of these more recent drivers of the Permian electrification, the CHIPS Act, and the data center demand. This increase in demand across the country will need to be served by an electric grid that will continue to see coal plant retirements in all markets. The Inflation Reduction Act will continue to incentivize wind, solar, and battery resources, and we will also need gas-fired generation to back up those intermittent sources. 
 The new greenhouse gas rules issued from the EPA on April 25 are expected to make it more challenging to economically build baseload combined cycle gas turbine facilities. But we expect those rules to be litigated, and it's unclear what the final outcome will be. 
 Natural gas peakers could be a solution that threads the needle of environmental rules and demand needs. In addition, it is likely that existing assets will need to run at higher capacity factors to meet overall annual energy needs as more coal retires. We see Vistra is well positioned for these trends, given our diversified portfolio of reliable and sustainable assets in growing markets. 
 As you can see on Slide 8, the forward curves have moved up considerably in both the Texas and PJM markets on the improved demand outlook, particularly on the longer end of the curve. As an example, ERCOT North around-the-clock fixed price forwards for calendar 2026 increased over $7 per megawatt hour or approximately 13% since we last provided guidance in November 2023. 
 For 2027 and 2028, the increases were even more significant. In the past, we've commented that the backwardation and forward curves did not reflect the tighter grid conditions that we expected to result from continued load growth and planned thermal asset retirements. 
 With the recent improvement in both forward power prices and some additional market interest in transacting further out on the curve, we believe the market is beginning to recognize these dynamics. As I stated at the beginning of the call, our integrated business model, which combines increasingly critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in this dynamic and growing market. 
 As a result, based on recent market curves, we are currently estimating a combined ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. In addition, while significant uncertainty to both the upside and downside remains for 2026, given our 2026 hedge percentage which is approximately 50%, we have line of sight to an ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of more than $6 billion. Like the 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear PTC, and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including any of that potential benefit. 
 Even without the inclusion of any PTC benefit, the improvement in near-term and long-term outlook for Vistra is expected to result in a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026. 
 And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris? 
Kristopher Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. 
 Turning to Slide 10. Vistra delivered strong first quarter results in 2024 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $813 million, including $841 million from generation, offset by negative $28 million from retail. This represents a $259 million improvement, nearly 50% year-over-year. 
 For generation, despite another quarter of mild weather conditions, including the warmest winter on record, our comprehensive hedging program, combined with the team's ability to optimize our flexible assets enabled another quarter of strong results. 
 Turning to retail. As was the case in 2023, the first quarter result was within the range of what we expected. We continue to see higher hedge power costs in the winter and summer months due to entry year shaping and therefore anticipate substantially all of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters. We believe continued strong accounts and margins in the first quarter position retail well for the balance of the year. Finally, our first quarter results benefited from the inclusion of 1 month of Energy Harbor, which totaled approximately $60 million for generation and retail combined. 
 On Energy Harbor, we provided an update on the integration process on Slide 11. As Jim mentioned earlier, the team has made significant progress integrating the businesses despite a later-than-expected closing. In the short time since completing the acquisition, the team has identified approximately $150 million of timing and gross margin benefits that are expected to be realized in 2024. These benefits are expected to bring the in-year 2024 contribution from Energy Harbor to approximately $700 million, which compares favorably to our 10-month contribution estimate. 
 Turning to integration benefits. We've previously communicated expected run rate synergies of $79 million by year-end 2024 and a run rate of $125 million by year-end 2025. Based on the efforts of the teams completed to date, we are increasing the amount of expected run rate synergies by $25 million to a total of $150 million. 
 Further, when we first announced the acquisition of Energy Harbor, we highlighted our core competency of integrating generation assets, citing the achievements of our Operational Performance Improvement, or OPI, program following the Dynegy acquisition. I am pleased to report that this program continues to deliver, with the teams having identified opportunities for more efficient operations across our nuclear fleet that we expect to lead to $50 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA improvements by year-end 2026. Importantly, we expect these additional opportunities to be achieved with little incremental capital spend. 
 Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 12. As of May 3, we executed approximately $3.9 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. In line with our statements on the fourth quarter 2023 call, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025. With the long-term update provided today, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and thus continue to believe share repurchases to be a sound use of our capital. 
 Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week our first quarter 2024 common stock dividend of $0.2175 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the dividend paid in Q2 2023 and an impressive 45% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x. As Jim stated earlier, we expect to return to below 3x by the end of 2024 and continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x. As you may have seen, we successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes at the beginning of April. These notes were issued primarily to fund our 2024 maturities and are not expected to increase our overall leverage levels. We are very pleased with the transaction and view the tight issuance spreads as recognition by bondholders of Vistra's well-positioned business model and favorable outlook. 
 Finally, the first quarter of the year was an active period for Vistra Zero. Our team began construction activities at 2 of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. Notably, despite the current inflationary environment, we continue to expect these projects to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. 
 Importantly, we took the initial step in developing the long-term capital structure of the Vistra Zero Renewables business, closing on a nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero. The $700 million term loan, which was also well received, is the first step towards our goal to fund our solar and energy storage growth with a combination of free cash flow from operating renewable projects and nonrecourse financings. 
 Finally, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $100 million in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. 
 We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance to begin the year, and we remain committed to executing against our 4 strategic priorities. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Jim, not to sound like a broken record here, but obviously, the moves we've seen in sparks, does that change your thoughts around maybe Tradition's stand-alone viability and potentially separating the 2 companies sooner rather than later or kind of vice versa? And then maybe at the very least, should we expect more details around resegmentation with the roll forward later this year as the moves in the curves can obviously change kind of that top level disclosure you just provided between the 2 segments or it's just not a priority? 
James Burke: Sure. Thank you, Shar. Yes, as you've noted, the sparks have obviously increased. Fixed-price power has also increased. This discussion about the value of tradition, which I think has come into focus a lot in the last 2 months, has been really positive for Vistra overall. As you note, the Vistra Tradition business is a key part of how we integrate our model overall. So we have a very large retail business that we have in Vistra Vision, and a lot of that business is residential. Residential has a level of usage that can vary with weather. And that's something that the asset side in Vistra Tradition supports extremely well.
 On the Vision side, we, of course, have a large nuclear fleet and our storage and solar, but that will not help us with the intraday and some of the weather swings that we would see in the seasons. And so Shar, I think what we were hoping to happen is happening, which is the Vistra Tradition side is being recognized for being highly valuable. I think there was months ago, obviously, already a view that the assets in Vistra Vision were valuable. There was a question mark about the Tradition side. I think that's being addressed by the tightening you're seeing in the marketplace. And frankly, the inbounds that we receive of folks interested in assets in Tradition because these are hard assets to replicate. And I would suggest with some of the EPA rules that have been issued, they're going to be even harder to replicate. 
 So we think the integrated model has a lot of value as far as disclosures. We try, and obviously, in our script today, we shared some information about the free cash flow conversion of Vision and Tradition and the relative EBITDA weights. So our goal here was to provide some insights into how the financials work on the integrated model. But I don't think at this point, it's a priority for us to do a GAAP reporting associated with that. I think our goal is to provide our investors the key insights that drive the economics, which, as you know, have a lot more to do with the forwards and our ability to capture it than some of the traditional segmentation methods. So that's a little bit, I think, of color, Shar, is how we're thinking about it. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. That's perfect. And then, Jim, just on the market dynamics. I mean, a big investor debate right now over a new entry in ERCOT and whether it will even make a dent in demand through the end of the decade. I guess what's your house view on gas due builds and scarcity at this point? Are we kind of setting up for another early 2000s rush of turbines? 
James Burke: Great question, Shar. I think -- so first of all, I think the queue of gas is starting to build a little bit. The application process will officially open for the Texas loan program in June. I think it's different than the early 2000s in a couple of ways. Number one, while sparks have improved over the -- even the last 2 months, in ERCOT, we no longer have the severe backwardation that we are accustomed to seeing. So that's a bullish sign. The loan program would be a bullish sign.
 However, the EPA rules, the proposed rule and the final rule that was issued last week will make it very difficult for somebody to be comfortable with the combined cycle gas turbine technology, which was different than the early 2000s. That baseload technology, if it were to run over 40% capacity factor, would need to have the carbon capture capability installed by 2032. We do not see an operating combined cycle with carbon capture technology anywhere in the world that we can point to. So I think the emphasis ultimately will be on peakers. The peakers are a higher heat rate. Machines are going to run and would need to run less than 40% capacity factor.
 And I think with the build-out of renewables, the solar, the wind, and even the shorter duration batteries, peakers make sense from a build-out standpoint. But I don't think they're going to be the 60-plus percent capacity factor assets that you saw coming in, in the early 2000s.
 As far as is it an oversupply, I think we're in a chicken-and-egg situation with ERCOT. I think the demand is there and the demand is going to be waiting for the supply. And so I don't think it's a situation where we're dealing with static demand and which asset can best serve it. I think it's going to be an ever-increasing demand that will continue to come as long as assets are coming on to the grid. And I believe Texas, which has positioned itself as open for business, wants to be a leader in this economic development opportunity. And I think that's true for transmission, I think it's true for renewables. I think it's true for dispatchable assets like gas peakers. So I think the fundamentals are really different than what we saw a couple of decades ago. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And then just 1 really quick one for Kris. Kris, just on the '26 midpoint opportunity, how much incremental EBITDA would there be if you were fully opened in '26? So I guess how sensitive are you to that number? 
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes. On the sensitivity, what I'll say is we feel good about the $6 billion number. We have a high confidence in that number, given where the curves are and where our hedge percentage is. As we look to sensitivities, we haven't given that. But as we think about it versus what you'll see in our deck on 2025, it's roughly twice, I would say, as sensitive to moves in power and sparks is what we're showing for 2025. But we do feel confident in that $6 billion number. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Jim, fantastic execution today. Thank you. 
James Burke: Thank you, Shar. 
Operator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. 
Durgesh Chopra: Congrats on the solid print. Just maybe can I ask you on the free cash flow conversion? So it looks like the '24 guidance is about 50% of EBITDA and then you gave us the numbers for Vistra Vision and then Tradition. Just how do you see that trending? The answer to that is higher, but what are the drivers that get you from 50% on the Vision side of the things to 60%? Is that integration, more efficiencies? Maybe just talk to that, please. 
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes, that's a good question. As you would expect, we put a lot of emphasis internally on the free cash flow conversion rate. And as Jim said in our prepared remarks, we target 55% to 60%, and we're a little bit lower than that based on 2 timing issues, I would say, this year. One of those is that of the -- on Slide 11, you'll see that Energy Harbor increased $150 million. One of that is -- $100 million of that $150 million is really due to a change in accounting methodology for outage expense recognition. So that's a noncash item that is increasing EBITDA but not turning into cash. So that is hurting free cash flow conversion.
 And then the other one is that, as you would expect, the retail team enters into contract for future periods, we generally -- as the prices have increased, we generally see the hedge of that -- we do that hedging through a variety of structures. And if that price has risen in the outer years, the cost of those products has increased. So that does create a timing mismatch between when we pay the cash premiums on those options and when we recognize the revenue in future years. So we would expect that to reverse as we go forward.
 So if you just reverse those 2 timing impacts, our free cash flow conversion this year would be closer to 55%. And then we just see some other improvements that get us closer to the 60% starting next year and moving forward. 
James Burke: Durgesh, what I would add to Kris's comment is, as you see the curves rise, some of that does not necessarily require additional capital and expense to achieve the higher earnings and free cash flow. So as you see the projections improve, you would expect to see some of the free cash flow conversion improve by the nature of the gross margin expansion and more of that dropping to the bottom line. So that is part of the trend that we're describing when we gave you the outlook for the free cash flow conversion. 
Durgesh Chopra: I appreciate all that color. Very helpful. And then just Jim and Kris, there's a lot of debate around how long are you going to do these share buybacks. I appreciate there's not a clear-cut answer, but can you give us some parameters? What metrics are you looking at? Is it free cash flow yield? Is it EBITDA? What is the comp group you're comparing it to? Is it IPPs or the broader market as we think about your decision-making on those share buybacks going forward? 
James Burke: Sure. Durgesh, I'll start and argue, as a more of a free cash flow yield comparison and how does that compare to the next best use of capital. When we started this process, of course, years ago, we were talking about free cash flow yields north of 20% for the business. It was a very obvious choice, I think, as to how we would deploy capital, recognizing where our relative value was in the marketplace.
 As we've continued to see our share price move, which is a good thing, we've also seen the forward curves move and the earnings power of the business move. And so we still certainly see upside from where we sit today from a share value. But you'll see the free cash flow yields have certainly come down, still well above some peers in the market. But we also have other competitive projects now with those free cash flow yields.
 The ability to do our Vistra Zero projects in the mid-teens type of free cash flow type returns, that gives us some confidence there. We've got some organic opportunities, including some gas plants that we think are competitive. There may be inorganic opportunities like M&A on both retail and generation. Those are all more competitive today where we're currently trading. And the good news is that I think we could do multiple of those, not an either/or. So I still believe where we sit today with the free cash flow yield, the returning capital through our buybacks, as we've discussed, through 2025, the $2.25 billion makes a lot of sense.
 We have additional unallocated cash flow that we could do either more return of capital through buybacks, other shareholder opportunities such as dividends, but we're really focused on other growth opportunities. And as long as they're competitive with that benchmark on the return of capital through repurchases, we've got a lot of options on the table. I think that's an exciting place to be for Vistra. It's not where we were 3 years ago in terms of this choice set, but it's opened up considerably. Kris, anything you'd like to add? 
Kristopher Moldovan: Yes. I would just, again, reiterate that we do maintain an internal model and evaluation. And then we get feedback from our partners, our consultants as well, and we've done that recently. And we continue to look at different ways to value our stock. And right now, where it sits is any way we look at it, given the update that we've provided today, we still feel like our stock is a good buy. To the extent it gets to the point where it exceeds our internal valuation, which we don't see as being a near-term issue, but we would have to then discuss -- we will be disciplined in how we spend our capital. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. 
David Arcaro: Great update.  I was wondering, could you talk [indiscernible] I'm curious, which location... 
James Burke: David, this is Jim. I think I heard you mention data centers and curious about locations. Was that the question? It broke up a little bit on us, I'm sorry. 
David Arcaro: Sorry about that. I was wondering the data center opportunity with your nuclear plants, could you give an update as to potential timing, which locations might be more attractive than others? 
James Burke: Sure. Yes, thank you, David. I think the conversation certainly has picked up this year. We started our process actually last year looking at  our -- at the time, it was a prospective close of Energy Harbor, which, of course, is now in the rearview mirror, which is great. And of course, the Talen AWS deal came out early March. So that was certainly a benchmark and a watershed event for the industry.
 I will say the 2 unit sites still have -- this is an order of preference that I think the market is grappling with. The 2 unit sites have more desirability for what their redundancy can provide. Then there's the single-unit sites, of course. And then there's the gas plants. So what's been very interesting, David, about our discussions with potential partners is we have normally sort of tried to search for opportunities for us to find partners and bid into their energy needs. Now this has been reversed. We actually have partners, potential partners coming to us directly.
 And speed is really very important to them. I would say gas has become as interesting to many of them as nuclear has, in fact, even a preference for some. So from our standpoint, all options are on the table with 40,000 megawatts. And we've got, obviously, 12 states and 40,000 megawatts that we can do some of our projects with. But we've actually flipped it a little bit so we've actually put out some RFPs ourselves. So instead of just responding to the inbounds, we've actually gone out to the marketplace to handle actually multiple conversations simultaneously and see what the best opportunity might be for us. And so that process has not concluded yet, but we're in the middle of that process. And we're very excited about the interest. 
 Of course, you can imagine the hyperscalers, the colocators and the specific developers are in that process. We're dedicating a ton of time to it as I am personally. And it's probably been the most exciting development for our industry in quite some time. But we think we can be a great partner to one or more capable parties because of the size of the fleet in multiple geographies. And I don't know yet which one is going to happen first. But it's a huge opportunity set for us, David, and one that I think we're going to be making really good progress on here shortly. 
David Arcaro: Great, that's really helpful color. Was wondering if you could also touch on just other power plants and other colocation opportunities at gas plants. And are you potentially considering new build yourself as well, would be curious? 
James Burke: Yes, David. It actually ties into the earlier question, which is you have existing assets that we have in our portfolio, large-scale combined cycle assets. The goal, obviously, for any of these potential partners with the data centers is speed and then reliability that they can count on for supply. It's going to be really hard to build an asset like a combined cycle to support a new data center without it having the carbon capture equipment that we were talking about. That's a huge lift.
 That carbon capture equipment could double, if not triple the cost of the combined cycle. So I don't view that as a really attractive near-term option at this point until that technology matures. So I think the existing combined cycles are an opportunity for somebody to colocate. I think the next best alternative, if it's involving gas, is likely to be peakers. But that will probably require that, that data center needs to also be prepared to pull from the grid so they could get the cheaper wind and solar power on the margin when available but be prepared to run the peakers for continuity of supply and potentially a price hedge. That I think is a potential model.
 And I think some of our partners we're talking to are wrestling with the fact that to build out the number of gigawatts that they're talking about, there's only so many large meters you can leave behind. You're going to have to actually add supply to the grid, and you're probably going to have to work in a hybrid type situation where you're pulling when there's surplus but then producing when you need. And I think peakers could potentially play that role. And I think, again, that plays into this queue discussion of what if there's a lot of gas to be built.
 I actually think that means more load comes and then we might have to build more gas along with the wind, solar and battery that is, as you know, already heavily in the queue. But this gas from a reliability standpoint, I think, will play a role one way or the other. I just don't see it being combined -- brand new combined cycles for that purpose until there's more clarity about these EPA rules. They're likely to be litigated. I think it's tough to invest into an environment where you've got uncertainty with protracted litigation. And so I think it's going to be difficult to create new baseload assets with confidence. And that's why I think the existing baseload assets are getting as much attention as they are. 
Operator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. 
Agnieszka Storozynski: So just first maybe starting with your credit metrics and investment-grade aspirations. So just wondering what's the time line when we think you're going to hit -- the low -- I mean, investment-grade metrics? And how you could potentially use like stock-based M&A to actually accelerate this path to investment-grade? 
Kristopher Moldovan: Thanks, Angie. I appreciate that. As you know, we just said today, we're right at 3x. I think there's a -- we're 2 notches away from investment-grade with 2 of the agencies and 1 notch away from the other one. So we have some work to do even to get closer to investment grade. I think we're continuing to look at -- as we look at the outlook, I mean, our leverage metrics go down just with the increase in EBITDA that you're seeing over time.
 And then we have sufficient -- a significant amount of cash that is yet to be allocated. And so some of that will go to debt repayment. So we do expect to -- that there could be opportunities to be talking about investment-grade metrics in the next year or 2. First, we want to make sure that we get the agencies to the 1 level below, and then we'll really start talking to them about timing for the deleveraging and where we need to get. I think we said on the last call, it's important for us to get to investment grade.
 If we do that, that we are comfortably in investment grade, we don't want to be right at the edge of the metrics. We want to be significantly into that area. So we haven't had those detailed discussions yet because like I said, we're still waiting to get the upgrade to the 1 notch below.
 I think as you think about our currency, as we said, we're still -- we've been focused. The price of the stock has come up and  there could be opportunities to use it in transactions. But at this point, as we just noted earlier in the call, we still see room for our stock to run and we're currently buying. So I don't think that, that would be the driver for why investment-grade wouldn't be the driver for any deal like that. We would certainly think about our ratings as we did any potential opportunistic transaction. But we're comfortable where we are. We do think we'll get to investment-grade metrics, but we don't have a specific time line to do so. 
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then changing topics a bit, like your sunset assets and the brownfield site especially those associated with the former Dynegy coal plant. So just wondering, is there any change in your views about the longevity of those sunset assets? Now it seems like they're economic, right? I'm sure that some of the increased output from these assets is embedded in those EBITDA ranges that you provided us with. But I just wonder if some of these assets might get reallocated back to this provision, meaning that you will not put them in that sunset bucket. And number two, if there's any upside associated with these brownfield sites from the former coal plants, especially in Illinois. 
James Burke: So Angie, I think on the coal plants themselves, the main driver that we're looking at on a go-forward basis is really the EPA rules that we need to comply with, which means that all but 2 of our coal plants, the 2 being Martin Lake and Oak Grove, will be retiring in that 2027 time frame unless there's some other change in rule or law that we don't anticipate.
 They are more economic, given these curves. I think part of the reason the backward -- the farther dated parts of the curve, particularly 2028 in PJM and even in Texas has moved up because the dates are becoming more real. And I think the supply-demand dynamic is becoming more apparent. And so it's not as much about the economics of those sites at this point that are in Ohio and Illinois and more about the compliance, which, of course, we're going to comply with the EPA rules that are in effect.
 As far as Martin Lake and Oak Grove, with the new rules that played out last week, we would either have to add carbon capture technology to those sites, which again would be very difficult to do, similarly to the comments I made about combined cycle or co-fire 40% with gas, which we believe is a possibility, something that we think could extend the life of those assets are needed potentially all the way up to 2039. That's something we would have to evaluate because we've got to have the sufficient gas supply to be doing co-firing at that level. And currently, we don't. We have some co-fire at Oak Grove, but it's a much lower level.
 So I think, Angie, this transition is happening on the grid, this baseload across the country, whether it's regulated markets or competitive markets, has to comply with these EPA rules. And I think the opportunity for us to do something with those sites and redevelop the sites down the road is possible but to operate in the coal configuration that it is right now seems unlikely for those sites in Ohio and Illinois. 
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And just 1 last 1 about capacity prices. I'm just wondering what kind of assumptions did you embed or like versus at least the last [indiscernible] capacity auction in those ranges that you provided us with, given that we're awaiting the next capacity auction in PJM? And we're seeing some bilateral contracts. We think those incremental capacity auctions clearing meaningfully higher than that last auction. I'm just wondering at least directionally if you can give us a sense what you expect and what is embedded in those ranges. 
James Burke: Yes, Angie, we do see some bilateral trades that are indicating improvement in PJM capacity clears. I think we've still been pretty conservative with our forecast and how we've built assumptions for the auctions that are forthcoming, the first one coming in July. I think where we've seen some of these clears, we've seen them in the $90, $100 kind of megawatt day range. Whether we're going to see that in this upcoming clear or it's going to be one later in December, we like the steps that PJM has been attempting to bring forward.
 They haven't been successful in all of the market reforms that they've recommended, but I think there is a recognition of the tightening supply-demand dynamics and also the fact that this coal is going to be retiring. And there's, frankly, interest in stakeholders. At our visits to Ohio state leaders, they'd like to see some new gas plants built. So it's not just a Texas market dynamic. It's other places where they're attracting industry and the reshoring, the CHIPS build out, and they want to see more assets come to ground, which capacity markets play certainly a key role in sending that signal.
 So we have an improvement embedded, Angie, but certainly not anything that I would call a big lift from what we've seen some historical clears be. But it's going to have to prove out in the auctions themselves. And at this point, we await to -- they've been delayed for a while so we're all eager to see how these next couple of auctions play out. Steve, anything you'd like to add? 
Stephen Muscato: No. I think, Jim, you hit it. It's basically, if you look historically, PJM cleared on average $100 a megawatt day historically. We see that happening at the very least. And obviously, as grids continue to get tighter with demand growth in PJM and the retirements of coal that Jim mentioned, which are really more environmentally driven than they are price-driven, that market should continue to tighten. 
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Fleishman: Thanks for some of the new disclosures. I'm going to go back to an earlier question just on the 2026 hedging, the 50% hedged. Could you give a little more color on just how the pricing of those hedges are versus current market and/or kind of the timing? Like that 50% number, where was it at year-end '23, Q1 '24? Just that would be helpful. 
James Burke: Sure, Steve, the hedging, obviously, from our standpoint, we look at it as more opportunistic. So we look at where the price obviously is, where our fundamental view is and then is there actual liquidity in the market to transact. So just to give a perspective, at the end of last year, so December time frame, we were in a hedge percentage that was going to be closer to 10% to 15% hedged for 2026. So the team, as they've seen this move particularly more recently, have been moving more volume, Steve. There's also been more liquidity in the marketplace.
 And I'm going to ask Stephen Muscato to comment on that a little bit because, obviously, if you're looking to move some of your volume, depending on the depth in the market, you could be having impacts as well and the team is sensitive to that. I'd like Steve to comment on how he's seen that dynamic change because it's been more recent, and I think it's been indicative again of this recognition by market participants that the load is coming, some of the baseload is retiring, and this is coming together in a supply-demand dynamic. And Steve, I'd like for you to comment. 
Stephen Muscato: Sure, Jim. As you pointed out, we've been waiting for the curve in ERCOT to no longer be in backwardation and move up into a contango formation, which it is. And the second thing we look for is basically liquidity events, meaning there's going to be people that are willing to buy it with enough scale for us to get our hedges off. And we're starting to see that liquidity come in.
 We're seeing trades that are no longer, let's say, 10 or 15 megawatts out in the '26 through '28 period. We are seeing people willing to buy a couple of hundred megs at a time. And so we try to scale into that because it is a finite market. It is something we can scale up. And now that we're seeing some of that contango come in, we're taking some off the table. I don't think we're done yet. I think the gas prices are part of the reason why ERCOT is in contango, not just heat rate.
 But if you look at sparks, sparks are expanding. But if you look at heat rates, and I really want to bring that to your focus, heat rates are not expanding as fast as you would think, given a tightening market. So a lot of this contango is gas-driven, and we think there's more to come in terms of heat rate expansion. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then just 2, I guess, other questions on hedging. Is there -- in that 50%, is there a big difference between your hedges between ERCOT and PJM? Are they both around 50% or... 
James Burke: Yes, Steve, we weren't planning to comment on specifically by region on that front. But obviously, those are our 2 biggest portfolios so I would just leave it at that. I think it depends on the depth in the market and where we feel we can comfortably move some of the volume. And Steve, I do want to correct 1 thing I shared a minute ago. I was 1 file off as I was trying to respond to your question. We were closer around a 25% hedge at the end of the year in 2023, and that's moved up closer to the 50%. So I was trying to be a little bit too nimble in pulling out my information. 
Steven Fleishman: Yes, no worries. Directionally correct. Okay. And then just we've been getting a lot of questions on nuclear fuel with the current law being passed. Just could you comment on how you're positioned on enriched uranium and the like, that would be helpful. 
James Burke: Sure. Yes, we have -- Steve, we have secured the supply physically for the outages all the way through 2027 and substantially financially. There's a few of our products that have some index pricing to it. And we are significantly hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel really good about fueling the 6 units over this planning horizon. With the Russian ban, with an uncertain or to be determined waiver process, I should say, we're very active in the discussions just to make sure that there's ample liquidity in the market as folks will look at these disruptions potentially, and it can cause the spot prices to move up considerably.
 We're fairly well hedged in the financial range. We're kind of looking at a $7 over the whole kind of time period, including Energy Harbor and the Comanche Peak site. So we were a little bit further hedged out for the Texas site, a little bit more open on the back end with Energy Harbor. If we put it all together and locked it all down, it's roughly a $7 a megawatt hour average over that period.
 But the spot markets are in the $11 to $12 range, so DOE, with the additional funding of roughly $2.7 billion, we'll be looking to incentivize domestic production and we'll see how that develops. But that's probably going to take into that time frame of the end of this decade to see something physically materialize there. But I think we've done a good job of locking down some of these risks, both physically and financially, and that's embedded in the numbers we've provided today. 
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. 
William Appicelli: Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the retail side, can you remind us the average duration of the contracts and the ability to roll those prices forward as the wholesale prices go higher as we move through time? 
James Burke: Sure. Yes, Bill. So the business contracts that we sell can be a duration of 1 to 2 years all the way up to 10 years. Now our portfolio is more skewed to the residential business, which I would say those tend to be 1- to 2-year contracts. Residential customers don't tend to have as much appetite for the longer-dated contracts. And so if you see a sustained higher price environment, you would expect the competitive market from a retail perspective to reflect the new cost of goods sold over time. And that would mean higher prices in a sustained high power market.
 It also has meant in the past lower prices, when you've seen lower power prices sustain themselves and retailers need to respond to that. I do believe that in this situation, this has been a relatively stable and steady build in power prices. So these aren't shock-driven like the polar vortex and even Winter Storm Uri, where there were large bills being sent by retailers that hadn't fully hedged. This has been more of a steady build, I think, more consistent with inflation that folks have been seeing in other categories that they procure.
 But from our integrated model standpoint, you would expect that after you get past the 1- to 2-year horizon, you start to reflect the higher or lower retail revenues associated with wholesale power costs. And we try to target more of a steady dollar per megawatt hour type margin in retail so that it's additive to whatever is happening on the wholesale side. 
William Appicelli: That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on that same topic. In terms of the -- given the population growth, can you just speak to your market share and the customer counts as you've seen a growing pool of potential customers in the state? 
James Burke: Sure, Bill. I'm going to ask Scott Hudson, our President of the Retail business is here, and I'll ask Scott to cover. 
Scott Hudson: Sure. Well, first of all, let me just touch on current retail performance. We really had strong performance in the quarter and year-over-year. We grew residential direct-to-consumer customer counts by 13%. That came not only from the Energy Harbor acquisition, and we had some really nice success in the market that just opened, but we're also growing these books across all markets sort of organically. So really nice growth rates in Texas around the population. As Jim mentioned earlier, roughly 1.5% to 2%. And it's our goal at retail to grow with the market or exceed that market and grow kind of market share.
 So we have a very large flagship brand with TXU Energy that holds significant share in the ERCOT market, but we also have 5 other brands that continue to complement one another. And our goal is sort of optimizing those brands by targeting them towards specific populations. It really is that coordination and sort of our use of advanced analytics to understand what populations, what brands and what particular products that allow us to continue to grow in these markets. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks. 
James Burke: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and I again want to thank the Vistra team, which includes our new members in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And we are very excited about our platform and our unique growth opportunities. The S&P 500 inclusion is a great milestone and our future looks bright. We appreciate your interest and investment in Vistra, and we look forward to visiting soon. Have a great day. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Vistra's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. And now I would like to take the conference to Eric Micek. Please go ahead.
Eric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There, you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and the earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra's senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Visa's website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. First, I am proud to share the very strong results that the hard-working Vistra team delivered in 2023. And second, I am excited to announce that we expect to close the Energy Harbor acquisition on Friday, March 1. The Energy Harbor acquisition fits squarely with our continued focus on our four strategic priorities as laid out on slide 5, which starts with operating an integrated business model that combines retail and wholesale operations leading to more resilient and sustainable earnings and a variety of weather and pricing environments. This was not only true in delivering results $440 million above our original guidance level in 2023 and but was recently apparent during Winter Storm Heather in January of this year, where our core competency of operating generation assets was evidenced by our 98% commercial availability, which is particularly impressive in an environment where the ERCOT overall market outage rate for the five days impacted by the storm was 2.5 times Vistra outage rate. Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned to our investors approximately $4.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we are excited to announce the Board approval of an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases, which we expect to fully utilize by year-end 2025. Importantly, we have strengthened and simplified our balance sheet while maintaining our capital return plan. Net leverage remains low at 2.4 times, and although we expect to be slightly above our three times net leverage target when Energy Harbor closes, we project to return to below three times by year-end 2024. The successful repurchase of approximately 98% of our outstanding tax receivable agreement rights marks further progress in our efforts to simplify Vistra's capital structure, while improving our free cash flow conversion over the foreseeable planning horizon. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in renewables and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites and interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. We delivered the Moss Landing 350 megawatt energy storage expansion in June of last year, and we began construction on three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments located at our former coal plant sites in the spring of 2024. With grids in most of our markets tightening in the coming years as older fossil generation retires, mode continues to grow and with interconnection and transmission challenges, Vistra is well-positioned to continue to find ways to serve our customers reliably, affordably and sustainably while remaining disciplined about our capital allocation. Turning to slide 6. We received FERC's approval for both the acquisition of Energy Harbor and the corresponding sale of our Richland and Stryker generation facilities. Energy Harbor is a transformative acquisition and represents another significant step forward for our company. We are diligently working towards closing this transaction, which, as I already mentioned, we expect to close on March 1st. Despite closing later than we had hoped, we remain comfortable with our ability to successfully integrate our teams and deliver the initial guidance of pre-tax run rate synergies of $125 million by year-end 2025. We are also reiterating a 12-month 2024 and 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor of $700 million and $800 million, respectively, as well as the expected run rate ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity on an unhedged and open basis of $900 million. However, given the anticipated closing date, you can expect our updated 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range, which we expect to provide on the first quarter 2024 results call will reflect only 10 months of contribution from Energy Harbor this year. Moving now to slide 7. As a reminder, we began the year with initial guidance for 2023 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a midpoint of $3.7 billion. This guidance was subsequently revised on both our second and third quarter calls, ultimately raised to a midpoint of $4.025 billion. As I stated earlier, despite another year of volatile weather, characterized by mostly mild weather, excluding the unprecedented summer heat in ERCOT during the third quarter, we were able to exceed the midpoint of our original guidance range by $440 million. Importantly, this translated to higher than expected ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of approximately $2.491 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our original guidance range by $441 million. These results were achieved through strong customer count and margin performance at our retail segment and a nearly 96% commercial availability rate for our Generation segment. Now, I'd like to quickly turn to the 2024 guidance. Given the recent regulatory approval and the upcoming transaction closing, we anticipate providing combined Vistra and Energy Harbor guidance, including an update on synergies, as part of our first quarter 2024 results call. However, we can reaffirm the Vistra stand-alone 2024 guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. We are eager and excited to join with the men and women of Energy Harbor and execute on behalf of our customers and communities as one team. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 9. Vistra delivered strong fourth quarter results in 2023 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $965 million, including $463 million from retail and $502 million from generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $4,140 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA including $1,105 million from retail and $3,035 million from generation. Despite mild weather conditions for much of the year, the performance of our generation units combined with our comprehensive hedging program and our ability to optimize our flexible assets drove the significant year-over-year improvement in our generation results in every region in the country. Moving to the Retail segment. The strong margin performance seen in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter. Positive residential customer count growth was driven by our multi-brand strategy with organic growth by our flagship brand, TXU Energy, for the third consecutive year. Turning to slide 10. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we executed approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchases and leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November of 2021. We expect to utilize $2.25 billion consisting of the $750 million remaining under the previous authorization as of the end of 2023 and the additional $1.5 billion of authorization announced today over the course of 2024 and 2025. We will review our capital available for allocation after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and expect to share any updates later this year. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.215 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 9% over the dividend paid in Q1 2023 and an impressive 43% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021, when our capital allocation plan was first established. Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. As Jim stated earlier, although net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, it will remain close to three times, and we expect it to return to below three times by the end of 2024. In addition to maintaining low leverage, we took an important step to further simplify the balance sheet at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. As of February 23, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 98% of the outstanding rights to receive payments under our tax receivable agreement. To pay for these rights, which were entitled to receive approximately $1.4 billion over time on an undiscounted basis. We paid approximately $625 million, consisting of approximately $475 million in aggregate face value of Series C perpetual preferred stock and approximately $150 million of cash. Based on our forecast of payments that would have been due under the tax receivable agreement over the foreseeable planning horizon, we believe this transaction results in accretion to free cash flow over that time period and provides robust net present value to the company. Finally, the team is preparing to begin construction activities at three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. We believe these projects will continue to exceed our targeted return thresholds despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment. The three key tenets of our responsible energy transition reliability, affordability and sustainability will continue to guide our renewables development program. We remain disciplined in our approach and continue to benchmark all projects against other uses of capital, including our share repurchase program. Touching quickly on slide 11. As we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of February 23. While the ERCOT forward price curves continue to reflect on backwardation, the prices remain higher than the April 29, 2022, curves when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. These curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program, give us confidence in the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion for Vistra stand-alone discussed last quarter. Again, we expect to update the 2025 opportunity, including the expected contribution from Energy Harbor on the first quarter results call. We are extremely proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams during 2023 and the start of 2024. We believe our commercial optimization activities and flexible generation assets combined with an industry-leading retail business provides significant opportunities going forward. We will continue to focus on being a reliable, cost-efficient operator of assets, while producing adjusted free cash flow yields that translate directly into significant returns for our stockholders. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, let's start with a question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar, please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Can you hear me?
Jim Burk: Yeah, Hey, Shar. Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, Jim, sorry with that little tech issues. I guess, Jim, you're getting closer to closing the Energy Harbor, you repurchased the TRAs to clean up the cap structure. Can we just get a little more color on how you're thinking about the longer-term profile of the business? I mean, do you see a pathway for traditional and vision to go their separate ways in the years ahead? Or is this kind of a longer date process in your mind?
Jim Burke: Yes. Thank you, Shar. I'll let Kris address the TRA, but I'll start with the direction we're headed. I think the Energy Harbor acquisition, as we said, is transformative for the company. It obviously brings a dispatchable 24/7 carbon-free element to the portfolio enhances our starting point that we had with Comanche Peak and Vistra Zero. The other part of the portfolio that I think is incredibly critical is the dispatchable assets that we have with our fossil fleet. Flexibility is an increasingly valuable attribute on these grids, particularly with the renewables penetration that we're seeing across the country, particularly ERCOT and California. So, from our standpoint, with such a large retail position and a growing retail position, the integration of how we can match the customer needs with assets that can provide the base load and the ramp products is an important part of risk management and value creation for our company. So, we see this still as one team. We see it as Vistra delivering on an integrated basis across our business for the long-term. And I think this excitement we have around closing Energy Harbor is it's a path we've been on for quite some time with the other acquisitions we've done. This is yet another one that fits neatly into what customers are looking for and that's why we're ready to get on to this next chapter. I'll let Kris quickly address the TRA.
Kris Moldovan: Yes, Shar, again, we noted in the comments, I think the primary purpose of the TRA, it does have some benefits that aren't economic related, but the primary purpose was economic. When you take an instrument out that is entitled to $1.4 billion, and then we did it with a little bit more than $600 million. And more than three quarters of that is perpetual stock. It's just -- it became a transaction that was very economically beneficial for the company. And so we really focused on the economics of it. As far as cleaning it up, it does simplify the capital structure. It's a topic that we're pleased to not talk much about going forward. But it still is just one of the impediments to a split. There are still other debt securities at the Vistra operations level, and we still have preferred stock in place. So, there would be other things to address. So, that wasn't the primary purpose for this transaction. It was really -- we thought it was a great economic benefit to the company, including a significant amount of NPV for us.
Shar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then, Jim, just on ERCOT. We've seen a few new build announcements recently. It sounds like one of your peers is waiting for the loan program details before potentially pulling the trigger on a combined cycle. There has also been a substantial amount of noise regarding the ECRS, I guess what's your house view on supply/demand backdrop and sort of ongoing market reforms? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Yes, great question. Well, the demand growth surprised, I think many of us, both what we saw last summer and even with Heather. So, robust, low growth in Texas coupled with extreme weather, you start to see the grid getting pushed, obviously to a level of tightness, we haven't seen in quite some time. The loan program clearly was a signal from the legislature and policymakers that they would like to see the dispatchable resources grow in Texas, at a minimum to backstop the level of growth that we see with intermittent resources in Texas and we see like in winter storm Heather, on the tightest days of winter storm Heather about 5% during the hours that were the tightest. About 5% of the power coming – were coming from intermittent sources, about 95% from dispatchable. So I think the desire is there. The loan program is clearly a boost because the interest rate at 3%, that's better than where market is. But you raised another point that I think is critical, which is there's a series of market reforms that are contemplated at the moment that sit between ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission, they generally are around the ancillaries. So ECRS is one. DRS is another. And there's details of these that are yet to be defined. We hope to hear more about ECRS here in a few months. It's likely that ECRS could actually dispatch a little earlier, could actually end up being brought into the market earlier than it was last summer, which could have a little bit of a dampening effect on prices. The DRS is pushed out in time and it's unclear, what kind of effect on price signals that might have? And then lastly, PCM, this performance credit mechanism, which is in the law, the House Bill 1500, that is also probably on a 2027 time frame. And I think the balance, Shar, that all policymakers are trying to strike is what's the sufficient revenue stream to incentivize someone to write an equity check and at the same time, deliver affordable electricity in Texas that's obviously reliable. And there's a tension there. And that tension shows up in some of the rule makings and the procedures that are going to follow -- we're going to learn more as they follow through on these in the next three to six months. So the loan program is certainly helpful. We don't view that as sufficient as a revenue signal you still see in our PowerPoint deck, there's backwardation in the spark spreads for ERCOT. So why they are higher than they were when we first started to talk to you about long-dated curves in 2022, they're still backwardated. We need to see some support for the price signals to be able to be confident that a 20- to 30-year life asset has a reasonable prospect for a return. And I think people are working hard to try to make that happen, but that's still TBD.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you very much. And congrats on the execution. I'll see you soon. Appreciate it
Operator: And now we have a question from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey, thank you, good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, David.
David Arcaro: Maybe a bit of a follow-on to that question, specifically on data center growth. And as we see that accelerate, wondering if you could speak to how you're thinking about the potential market impact and opportunities for your fleet potentially from new data centers coming on?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. I'll step back just a second to say that as the grids have become a little bit tighter across the country, we're seeing the fossil assets retire, particularly coal. And then we're seeing more electrification. We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry. And data center specifically, they're looking for speed to market, so they're trying to get online as fast as they can. They're obviously looking for where they've got good fiber, particularly potentially access to water for cooling needs, but reliability is now entering that discussion. So many of them are talking about while they can do it out on the grid, they're interested in also being behind-the-meter. And depending on who the customer is, it doesn't need to be a nuclear plant. They're actually entertaining gas plants for behind-the-meter opportunities. And we've done that with some of the crypto load already in Texas. We've done some behind-the-meter. So we're familiar with it. Whether that load goes behind-the-meter or out on the grid, it's new demand. And that's part of the supply and demand equation that might also send the price signals that could also then incentivize new supply. But it's meaningful, David. It's hard to get locked in on any one forecast. But most forecasts have a doubling of this data center load by 2030. Texas is a pretty easy place to do business. So Texas, which is already the second largest data center market in the country, may end up getting a disproportionate amount of it. But we do see this as a real opportunity for our company. I will tell you in terms of customers approaching us, way more customers approaching us around data centers than we've had so far on hydrogen. And part of that is just the rules uncertainty around hydrogen, but also I think we're serving a customer demand. There's actually a demand for where this is going, where the hydrogen has been a little bit more supply driven and trying to create a product that's inexpensive. This is more pull from the customer, and we're having a lot of conversations. We're pretty excited about it.
David Arcaro: Yeah. Got it. Thanks. I appreciate that perspective. How early is it? When do you think that you could see potential market impacts if it's upside in the curve or potential contracts like you say with maybe behind-the-meter or contracted power with these customers? 
Jim Burke: Yeah. The behind-the-meter activity, it still takes some planning studies that we work on with ERCOT and the wires company. You may also need to be doing the substation construction, get some of the high-voltage switchgear. So you could still be looking at a couple of years for something to go from concept to reality. So I wouldn't say that it's immediately around the corner for something, that's a new conversation. There are clearly some current data centers that could actually even be repowered. Those can actually go from existing chips that are used more for cloud services to the more energy-intensive AI purpose chips. That could be happening over the course of the next two years. But I would say it's a couple of year process, David, from my perspective.
David Arcaro: Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thanks so much.
Jim Burke: Yeah. Thanks David.
Operator: And we'll follow with a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning Jim and congratulations on the progress here, nicely done. In fact, I wanted to follow-up on the last question and the expectations for 1Q update here. Can you give us an initial glimpse on how you think about capital allocation? I presume to a certain extent, there could be capital commitments on your part to enable some of these data-oriented strategies to perhaps provide some of the warehousing, et cetera. So how do you think about that impacting capital location, as you say, maybe a couple of years out 2025, 2026? And then maybe to marry that up, how do you think about sustaining this level of buyback? Or do you have any broad heuristics that you might be willing to share as you think about buybacks beyond -- 205 and beyond here as you think about this updated plan with 1Q?
Jim Burke: Yes, Julien, thank you very much for the questions. I'll start with the data center opportunities, as I mentioned, whether behind-the-meter or whether out on the grid, they have a natural sort of demand increase that could send some price signals for wholesale power prices in the out year. Some of that could be factored into these curves already. I mean people have been reading about this. The curves are stronger today than they were in the spring of 2022 when we first put out our multiyear guidance range. So I think, Vistra being net long in ERCOT has an opportunity, whether we are directly involved with the data center or not. So then you beg the question, when would we get directly involved? It's if we found that there's a return on that capital to do something that would make sense relative to our other capital allocation alternatives. I would say that, I'm not in the detail at a level of comfort yet, that I would tell you, that's actionable. So we know that from a free cash flow yield perspective, it's still pretty attractive for us to be returning capital through the buyback. So we would need to see a level of, what I'd call, transactable economics that have the long-term agreement to bring that to bear as an alternative to our capital allocation strategy, in which case, I think our shareholders would be pleased to see it. But I view this as an opportunity for us with our native position that I think it's specifically an enhanced opportunity for our own assets, if we choose to do something behind the meter. In addition, I didn't even mention, but in addition to the data center, of course, we have population growth in Texas, which is still strong. And we have a Permian Basin growth rate for load that ERCOT has put out some studies that suggest that you could see 13 gigawatts of growth out west from 2023 to 2030. That's oil and gas driven, it's population driven. It's also got some data center loan growth there. So, this is a general theme and then how that -- I think will benefit an asset position like Vistra. And then specifically, how we might target our own assets, I view that as incremental upside, none of which is factored in to our long-range plan at this point. And in terms of when we'll update from a capital allocation and how we think about longer-term buybacks, I'm going to have Kris jump in.
Kris Moldovan: Yes, Julian, I would say, you hit it with the Energy Harbor transaction. So as that closes, as we look forward, we talked about expecting to spend $2.25 billion on share repurchases over 2024 and 2025. We also have a little bit of debt to repay, and we have some growth that you see for our renewables and energy storage business. But on top of that, we do expect to have additional cash available for allocation that's unallocated. We think it's preliminary right now to get into the levels that, that is because we just want to make sure to get this Energy Harbor deal closed and put the two businesses, start integrating the businesses. But I do think, we will come back to you and talk about an additional amount that over the next two years that we have to allocate on top of the share repurchase estimate that we're making. And so, I don't believe that any of those opportunities would disrupt our pacing on share repurchases.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, even as a percent of total cash flow beyond '25?
Kris Moldovan: We'll -- we're going to continue to come back. I still think that the -- we haven't ever announced it as a percentage, but I think as a gross amount in this $1 billion-plus range on a per year basis, we don't see anything that would move us off that now. But we will continue to evaluate that with our Board.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. I know it's in flight. Good luck, guys. We'll speak to you then.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ICI -- ISI, pardon me. Durgesh, you may proceed.
Durgesh Chopra: Yes. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time team. Good morning to you.
Jim Burke: Good morning, Durgesh.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, Jim. Hey, Kris, just maybe this is a stupid question will ask it anyways. The TRA transaction that you did, does that have any implication on like your forward looking free cash flow guidance, you kind of talked to it as being somewhat cash flow accretive. So are there any implications as we think about sort of 2025 guidance and beyond?
Kris Moldovan : As we do. We do see some benefits on a -- just a straight free cash flow basis, it is positive from free cash flow. So if you look -- as we talked about, we spent about $150 million of cash and then we issued the preferred. And so over the course of five years, our cash cost for that repurchase is in the neighborhood of $350 million, our estimates that we previously had would have shown that the TRA payments would have been roughly twice that. So there is some free cash flow pickup and that will factor into our conversion percentage. We still see -- obviously, we're in a higher cost and higher interest rate environment. So there are puts and takes. And so I think we still feel really good about saying that our -- our expectation is that we would be 55% on average over the planning horizon. Some years, we expect to be more like this year, you see in our materials that we end up just over 60% conversion. In some years, depending on the timing of maintenance capital could be a little bit lower. But I think on average, 55%, the mid-50s is the right place for our conversion ratio.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. That's super helpful. But it is accretive to your cash flow guidance, but there are obviously other drags and you're comfortable with the 55% range is the key takeaway there. Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just can I ask -- I don't want to jump the gun, but what to expect in terms of disclosures on the first quarter call, whether EBITDA is still the metric? And then in terms of forward-looking years, what to expect, if you could share any color?
Kris Moldovan : Yes. So we're going to focus here on Energy Harbor and getting it closed. I do think that whether it's on that call or a future call, we are going to continue to assess what is the best way for us to communicate the ongoing value of this company. And so I do think we will -- at the very -- we do expect to plan -- we do expect to give updated guidance for this year. But as we go forward, what metrics we use and how we communicate what we see as the value of the business, we're going to continue to work through that, and we will come back to you whether that. It could come on the May call, but it could come also later this year. We're going to think through that and make sure that we've thought through all the issues.
Jim Burke: Durgesh, what I would add is, once we close Energy Harbor, we will go through a process to confirm the synergy numbers. So we'll talk about that on the May call. That will then lead to the 2024 expectation, as Kris said, of the combined companies. We will also, as he noted in his script, we'll talk about where we see the 2025 headed as well. And obviously, the synergies are part of that. Capital allocation, there will be an amount that's still unallocated that we see that we will be talking to our Board with, with respect to how we think about the best use of that capital. But what you could expect to hear about in May, at least to 2024 with a nod to 2025 with our guidance and then these updated synergy expectations. As far as the best metrics, clearly, with Constellation's call yesterday, very successful in their description of how to think about the value drivers. For our business, where we have looked at it and since the buyback program was enhanced in 2021. So far, we've really focused on the return of cash and capital to the shareholders. And on a per share basis, between the buyback programs and the dividends, you're seeing that in the sort of $4.45 on the high end and that's an opportunity that's per share. And so that's just from a return of capital standpoint. In terms of the adjusted free cash flow before growth on a per share basis, it's much higher on a stand-alone basis, that's closer to $6 a share. As far as working through GAAP and working through the mark-to-market, working through depreciation and amortization, we will be taking a look at that. What we've tried to focus on to date has been much more about the proof points around the capital we're returning and the sustainability of that and frankly, the upsizing of that. But clearly, the investor response yesterday was super positive. And if there's opportunities for us to be more clear about the value drivers and the comfort that investors are looking for, for the long term, we owe it to them. We'll be certainly taking a look at that.
Durgesh Chopra: I appreciate that very much. Thank you both.
Operator: We are now taking a question from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Michael, please go ahead.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Good morning.
Michael Sullivan: Jim, you kind of answered this, but just wanted to confirm. So it sounds like the synergies from the original target, you're going to kind of revisit and refresh. But the Energy Harbor guidance itself, what you're putting out there today, is that just kind of what you saw originally? Or is that actually refreshed and just consistent as of today?
Jim Burke: Yeah, Michael, I would say it has been -- we have been updating it ourselves as we're tracking kind of through the process of working to close. We feel good about it. So when we looked at $700 million on a 12-month basis, I do think we'll be in the ballpark of prorating 10th, 12ths of that number. If you do that and you add it to our Vistra stand-alone as we sit today, then you're in the $4.5 billion sort of range for calendar year 2024. That's above where we were when we announced the acquisition in March of 2023. The synergy numbers, I think there'll be some upside to the synergy numbers, but not likely in calendar year 2024 because we thought we could close this deal later last year. So we're getting a later start. But I think by the end of this year, we'll be about where we expected from a run rate perspective. I think there's upside to the out years on how we're thinking about it. So we'd expect to talk about that on the May call. But the way you're thinking about it is correct, Michael. I think it's always helpful to close a deal work with the teams day-in and day-out, make sure we understand all the assumptions and then affirm and potentially, we see a chance to upsize some things on the May call, we'll do it at that time.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Super clear. Thanks. And then we continue to get questions on this. Just can you give us the latest on where you are in terms of having nuclear fuel secured both for Comanche and to the extent Energy Harbor's position?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, we believe we're in really good shape. Michael, we have, as I've indicated on previous calls, we have, as Vistra done some additional procurement through time since we announced the transaction. Obviously, we had a high percentage likelihood in our view of being able to close the transaction. Either way, the markets continue to go up in price, and that's been speculation on the part of a number of folks based on whether Russia pans or limitations would ultimately be put in place. So we have a physical procurement strategy that we are secure for both Energy Harbor sites and our site Comanche Peak through 2027 refuelings. And we feel good about that. We're also substantially hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel good about the risk management around that. And of course, long term, depending on where this goes with the domestic fuel supply capabilities and whether the federal government will incentivize more domestic capabilities for enrichment remains to be seen. But I think we have a very good line of sight and very consistent with everything that we've shared publicly so far and our expectations of this deal.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And now we follow with a question from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie, please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. Good morning. So maybe first…
Jim Burke: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Storozynski: Good morning. Maybe first with -- yeah, the fundamentals of our markets are tightening, but we don't see it in forward power curves and probably very low natural gas prices do not help. But I'm just wondering, if you think that there will be a step change in those power curves on the back of any big announcements about and data centers, you name it. We've seen some positive surprise in capacity prices in New England. I'm wondering if you'd hope to see a similar message being sent from the next PJM capacity auction, and again, how do you think we will see more of a forward-looking signal that the profitability of your assets is improving?
Jim Burke: Yes, Angie, thank you for that. New England was a better clear than we've seen in a while. In fact, about 50% higher in the 2027, 2028 auction than what we saw just prior in the previous auction. Good for our gas fleet, obviously, up in New England. PJM has delayed some of their auctions. So we have to play catch-up with PJM. So we'll see what comes forward. There's going to be a number of auctions that happen in the next 12 months to get caught up in PJM. There have been market reforms proposed for PJM. Some of those are going to be implemented. Some of them were not supported by FERC. So again, it's still a little bit of a struggle as to what is going to be the effect on the capacity, things like market seller offer cap have been very difficult to move the needle on, which has had a dampening effect on capacity prices. But this effective load-carrying capability or ELCC, where potentially the dispatchable assets get proportionally more credit than the intermittent. That's an opportunity for the PJM capacity clear. So I think they are coming to the same conclusion that other grid operators, which is we -- PJM used to be really flushed with excess capacity, but a lot of it is retiring. And the gas plants are critical because the intermittent sources for wind and solar are not nearly as naturally supported in PJM as they are in places like ERCOT in California. As far as Texas is concerned, as I mentioned, the spark, and you see it in the graph that Chris covered, the spark spread has definitely moved up. So gas prices went up and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have come back down. Sparks have stayed elevated relative to that time frame, but they're still strongly backwardated. And I think that still comes from the concern of how much renewables will continue to come in. And then also, will the market reforms support price formation in ERCOT. And ECRS was an example where price formation occurred last summer. There was a lot of concern from a lot of customers and others that maybe there was too much price formation. And so they start having to revisit the rules. And now I would say it's just uncertain how some of these things like ECRS will play out. So certainty around some of these ancillaries will help certainty around PCM will help. That, coupled with the demand growth that is actualized on the ground I think, could help address some of the backwardation in ERCOT, which could then help address the investment signal. But we've said that for a while, ERCOT has been backwardated for about forever. If you go long enough out back in history, so the prop will always be pretty strong because that's where a reality meets the supply/demand. But out in the forwards, you still see concern around whether the price signals will be there. And that's part of the Texas market reform and ultimately, the gas plant investment that folks are considering. But I think that's still yet to play out.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then changing topics. So I understand that the Energy Harbor transaction hasn't closed, but I'm sure that was taking months to close. You were probably looking at the assets you're acquiring and potential revenue and cost synergies. So we're waiting for probably the first colocation of a data center within nuclear plant. And I'm just wondering, one, if you think that this will have an impact on other nuclear power owners? And also, how do you see the portfolio and large portfolio of nuclear plants vis-à-vis that opportunity. I'm mostly asking most of your sites are single unit nuclear plants. So there's this no backup from additional units that a data center would get? And would you think that it's somewhat of an impediment to the pursuit of such a colocation strategy on your sites?
Jim Burke: Yes. Angie, it's a fair question. I would say the data center growth behind the meter at a nuclear plant is still early stages for anybody in the market. It's certainly been discussed and being considered, but it still takes time for some of these to play out. I do think the two units having an opportunity to have redundancy will be attractive for customers. So Veeva Valley has been the one that is it working towards this path and then Comanche Peak as well. However, I'll go back to a comment I made on an earlier question, between the colocation companies and the hyperscalers, speed is very important to them. So while the redundancy may not be there on a single unit site, pulling from the grid would still be an option. And that's how we manage the behind the meter that we work with, with our gas plant. So while there is a preference list from a customer standpoint of things that check every box, I think there's going to be a balance of factors that the potential data center companies will be considering when they do a site selection. And speed is one of them. Economics is one of them, access to water is another one. So there's a number of variables there beyond just the two units versus one unit. But all things being equal, that would probably be a preferred site Angie. But I -- the fact that we're being approached about gas plants tells you that it isn't just about the carbon attributes. It's about some of these others as well.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, I'm sorry that I'm asking so many questions. But if you were to be approached by some of these tech companies and offer long-term contracts. And again, against a very depressed forward power curve, would you be willing to actually lock in some of these assets? Or are you basically thinking that we're about to see a step change in how the market assesses the value of your assets? And so there's no need to actually lock the -- the value at the bottom of the -- a potential bottom of the sell-the-cycle?
Jim Burke: Yeah. That is an excellent question, Angie. I don't know if it's an all or nothing approach because we have a lot of assets with a lot of length. But with -- if you're speaking nuclear first with a production tax credit that escalates with inflation and our curves are basically sitting at those levels, you would need to see something attractive from a customer to lock it in and it would have to be at a reasonable premium to what your view is of the alternative, which is to stay long to have the PTC as some support on the bottom, but still retain some of the upside for that asset. For other assets like the gas plants, I think you could potentially have more flexibility because you're not necessarily going to see that -- you're not going to see the PTC support for some of those. But from a nuclear standpoint, I don't think there's a rush here for the reasons that you mentioned. And it also takes time because of the complexity of these to put these in place. So I think we agree with how you're framing the question, Angie, and we're going to be patient about how we think about these opportunities.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Angie.
Operator: And with that, we conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke, the CEO of Vistra for some closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Perfect. Thank you. First, I want to start with just thanking the Vistra team. 2023 was a heck of a year, and we look forward to what is in store with Energy Harbor, who I also want to thank they have done an excellent job running a business during a year of uncertainty, whenever an announcement is made, the units are running very well. The team has been incredibly cooperative on our integration efforts. And we're excited about this Friday and becoming one team. We're going to continue to execute our plan, which includes returning capital in an environment of very strong long-term fundamentals. I think that came out in a number of the questions that we were asked. And I also hope that we get to see many of you in New York next week. We'll be up there for a couple of days, and it's always good to see folks face-to-face. So, thank you for your time this morning, and we'll hopefully see you soon.
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Vistra's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our third quarter 2023 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and the earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release presentation and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thanks. And I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning, and I appreciate all of you for taking the time to join our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am proud to deliver our third quarter results this morning, which was a very successful quarter for all facets of the business. We'll start this morning on Slide 5. I'll speak to this quarter's operational and financial performance in more detail in a moment, but notably, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.6 billion underscored Vistra's capability of achieving consistently strong earnings through its integrated business model, with excellent operational performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams and a variety of pricing and weather environments. In the prior two quarters, we experienced average power prices clearing lower than our realized hedge prices, which highlighted the significant downside risk protection to our earnings at our comprehensive hedging strategy provides. This quarter that scenario held in the markets outside of ERCOT were milder weather kept prices lower. In these markets, we were able to capitalize on our dynamic position management of our hedged portfolio to capture significant earnings in our generation segment. We saw this paradigm flip in the ERCOT market and while we were significantly hedged, we did have some open length and the generation fleet's operating flexibility was optimized by our integrated teams to respond to higher market prices, while keeping the lights and much needed air conditioning on at competitive prices for our customers throughout the markets we serve. With each of our four strategic priorities, our aim is to challenge ourselves with high performance goals and then consistently deliver. To that end this quarter, you saw us continue to advance our other three strategic priorities as well, as we focus on a strong balance sheet, our capital return program and our energy transition goals. As of November 2, we've now returned over $3.785 billion of capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and our dividend program, since the capital allocation was first announced in November of 2021. After we close Energy Harbor acquisition and develop a long-range plan for the combined company, we will work with our Board on a new multi-year capital allocation plan and expect to disclose the specifics of that plan in the first half of 2024. In the meantime, we continue to opportunistically invest in renewables and energy storage growth, including our expectation that we will begin construction in spring of 2024 on our three largest solar and energy storage developments located at our former Illinois Coal plant sites while maintaining our sub-three times leverage ratio. I want to move now to slide 6 to discuss our third quarter operational performance. This past quarter, we saw unprecedented heat and ERCOT. It was the highest third quarter on record even beating the record-setting heat of 2011. Temperatures in Texas were six degrees above normal in August and early September frequently topping 105 degrees in Dallas and over 100 degrees in Houston and San Antonio. Cooling degree days were 23% above the 30-year normal for the June through September comparable time period and ERCOT set a new peak demand 10 different times this summer. On August 10, ERCOT experienced its all-time record peak load of over 85,000 megawatts. It was vital for our generation team to keep the plants running in these extreme conditions to ensure that people of Texas could continue to live and work in healthy and comfortable environment. In ERCOT, the solar generation ramp down hours of around 6 to 8 p.m., have proven to be a critical time period for the grid. It is still very hot during those times with strong customer energy demand but it is also the time period where we see solar start to ramp down and at times the wind may not make up the difference especially in August. The ERCOT grid is operationally complex having to predict the availability of not only dispatchable resources but also intermittent resources such as solar and wind, limited duration energy storage and demand response activities. As the generation mix of intermittent resources increases, ERCOT needs more reserves as a backstop to ensure there is adequate generation to cover demand and avoid emergency conditions. In these scenarios, you see flexible generation fleets like ours ramping to meet as much of this demand as possible. And that is exactly what we did, exceeding 97% commercial availability on average during those critical hours. During these tough weather seasons, our number one priority is ensuring our customers can consistently access competitively priced power to maintain their quality of life and keep the economy strong. That's where our retail business excelled. This summer's marketing campaigns featured several differentiated products tailored to our customers' needs, including a seasonal discount product that helps customers manage the size of their electricity bill through the higher usage summer months. Our customer-focused multi-brand and marketing channel strategy and responsive service, allowed us to grow our ERCOT residential customer counts over the prior quarter. In addition, our business market segment grew customer volume 16% year-over-year as strong margins. While the retail and generation teams stood ready to meet these demands for our customers and the people we serve, our commercial team optimized our financial position to create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, in August, the ERCOT market saw average real-time pricing around $196 with 43 hours in August clearing over $1,000. And during those critical hours at 6:00 to 8:00 PM in August, we saw prices clear on average around $843. Leveraging customer usage insights and our generation fleets strong commercial availability, our commercial team optimized and managed our risk position to create significant value on our open positions. The commercial team further set us up for success in our markets outside of ERCOT where the weather was milder, strategically managing our positions and flexing our generation output to optimize our hedge positions and achieve strong results for the quarter. We see this trend of new peak demand records at ERCOT continuing for the foreseeable planning horizon, demand that we believe our retail products are designed to attract and our diverse and flexible generation fleet is uniquely positioned to serve. Moving now to slide 7. Again I am proud of the team's exceptional, tightly coordinated performance this quarter that helped Vistra achieve its $1.613 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Not only did the retail team grow residential customer accounts, TXU Energy maintained the PUC of Texas five-star rating, extending its streak to 12 straight months. Our ERCOT fleet delivered 2.5 terawatt hours more than any other quarter's output in at least the past 10 years, a 10% increase over the next highest quarterly generation output achieved in the third quarter of 2019. It was a notable feat that when paired with a strong performance by the commercial team to adapt to a variety of weather conditions created significant value across all of our markets. With the important summer months behind us and only two months left in the year, today we are raising and narrowing the guidance range we announced last quarter from $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to now $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. We are similarly increasing and narrowing the range of adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations to a new range of $2.35 billion to $2.5 billion. Turning now to slide 8. We introduced 2024 guidance ranges for Vistra stand-alone without including any Energy Harbor contributions. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Notably our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for 2024 of $3.9 billion is higher than the midpoint opportunities we previewed on our most recent earnings call in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We are confident in our forecast as we expect consistent earnings from our retail business paired with expected strong performances from our reliable, diverse and flexible generation fleet that stands ready to deliver in a variety of economic and weather conditions just as it has this year. Of course, we will update our guidance ranges to include Energy Harbor performance expectations after we close the acquisition. Speaking of the Energy Harbor acquisition slide 9 provides an update on the status of the transaction. Since we last spoke, we have received approval from the NRC in September and we declared substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request on August 31st. We have responded to all requests from FERC and that process is progressing. Given our commitment to sell the Richland/Stryker generation plants, which we believe eliminates any potential remaining concerns around market competition, we continue to target a closing before the end of the year. Our team has worked with the Energy Harbor team to prepare for a smooth integration. And we are prepared to close the transaction promptly after receiving approval from FERC. As noted before, we intend to provide combined Vistra and Energy Harbor forecast and guidance information, after we close the acquisition. But as shown on slide 9, we continue to expect the Energy Harbor business to deliver an average of approximately $750 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024 and 2025 including the impact of the hedges and synergies with that number growing to approximately $900 million when considered on an open basis. I'll now turn the call over to Kris, to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 11, Vistra's performance in Q3 2023 was a reflection of available opportunities and outstanding execution throughout the country by both our Generation and Retail segments. Generation segment exhibited the benefits of maintaining a diverse, flexible and durable fleet of assets with the team delivering strong results in both ERCOT, where third quarter temperatures were on average the hottest on record and outside of ERCOT where temperatures were milder. Notably, the $1.44 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations delivered by the Generation segment, in Q3 2023, was almost $400 million higher than the same quarter last year. Moving to the Retail segment. Despite the challenges of high loads and prices in ERCOT in Q3, the Retail team delivered outstanding results for the quarter by focusing on customer counts and margins and consistently optimizing its supply position throughout the quarter. Although Retail is not typically expected to contribute much adjusted EBITDA, if any, in the summer months when prices are higher, the team was able to deliver $173 million in Q3 this year. Looking at year-to-date, each of the Generation and Retail segments are outperforming as compared to last year, with Vistra earning over $800 million more in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA through the third quarter of this year, as compared to the same period in 2022. We are proud of the team's execution thus far this year. And we are looking forward to finishing the year strong. Turning to Slide 12. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of November 2nd, we had executed approximately $3.26 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 26% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. However, as Jim noted, we do expect to review our capital available for allocation, shortly after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and would expect to announce a new comprehensive capital allocation plan in the first half of 2024. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.213 per share, which represents a substantial growth of 42% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. This growth highlights the significant returns available to our shareholders, as we reduce share count while paying a constant quarterly dividend amount. Turning to the balance sheet. In light of the results achieved in the third quarter, culminating an updated 2023 guidance ranges Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. While net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we currently expect our net leverage ratio to be below three times on a pro forma basis in 2024. Finally, in addition to the transformation we are achieving with the Energy Harbor acquisition, the team has been busy with development and pre-construction activity this year at our three largest solar and energy storage developments at our former Illinois coal plant sites, for which we now anticipate construction to begin next spring. Despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment, these projects continue to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. As we've stated before, we believe in a responsible energy transition that targets disciplined capital outlays for strategic projects and the zero carbon generation growth we will achieve with these three coal to solar sites are reflective of that core principle. Touching quickly on Slide 13, as we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of November 2. While the ERCOT forward price curve continues to reflect some backwardation, the prices still remain higher than the April 29, 2022 curves, when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. The curves and sparks are holding together well and support our initiated 2024 guidance ranges. Those curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program provide us confidence in an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, Slide 14 provides some additional breakdown of our 2024 initiated guidance ranges including midpoint expectations among the current business segments. As we have discussed previously, the acquisition of Energy Harbor will accelerate the transformation of our company and we expect it to alter the way we analyze our business results. Accordingly, after we closed the transaction, we expect to re-segment our businesses. While we will have more say on that after closing, we do expect to provide you with more visibility into our nuclear and renewable businesses. I want to reiterate Jim's comments. We are extremely proud of the collaborative work and performance of each of our generation retail and commercial teams. We have great line of sight to keep that momentum going for the foreseeable future. And we will keep striving to meet the expectations of our customers and our communities to keep the lights on in an affordable and reliable manner in markets in which we operate. And at the same time, we will manage the company in a cost-efficient and strategic manner to continue producing adjusted free cash flow yields that we are translating directly into significant returns for our shareholders. I know I speak on behalf of all of our employees and partners, when I say that we are striving to end 2023 on a strong note and to execute against our targets for 2024. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, good morning, Michael.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, Jim just wanted to start with maybe what kind of gives you conviction in being able to close the deal by the year-end and we'll be able to hear something from FERC in a timely manner here?
Jim Burke: Yes, Michael. We've noted the progress that we've made with this transaction. Originally we thought NRC would be the longer pole in the tent and we were pleased to get that approval a few months ago. Where we sit at the moment is we've got feedback from DOJ and we think we've addressed DOJ's concern. We expect to have addressed FERC's concern by selling the Richland/Stryker facility. We did not think it was a concern at the time we initiated the deal and we still don't believe that's a concern. But out of an abundance of caution we are making that move. We have obviously responded to all of their information requests and the interveners have done the same. So our anticipation is that FERC has all the information that they need. We've asked for a feedback by the middle of November. We feel confident that we'll get to something by the end of this year and that we target to -- we're planning and targeting to close by the end of this year. But I think it's just been a process Michael and it's been one that we've been obviously very responsive to and I think from a FERC standpoint they've got the information and they've got to do their due diligence, but there's been no new issues raised to us at this point and that's why we think we're going to get this done by year end.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the new financial outlook here I wanted to ask on some of the dynamics below EBITDA and at the free cash flow line. So it looks like the free cash flow for 2023 actually improved more than EBITDA. So I wanted to get a sense what's driving that? And then it looks like the conversion to free cash then drops again in 2024? And just also on that I wanted to confirm like does that include the interest cost associated with the debt you issued for Energy Harbor but obviously not the EBITDA yet. Yes. Sorry that was a bunch here but...
Jim Burke: Yes, Michael, thank you for that. I'll start by saying that our results for this year which obviously we've continued to guide up as we've gone through the year. Most of that improvement is EBITDA-driven and we did a nice job operating in the third quarter with extreme opportunities with pricing and weather being coincident particularly in ERCOT. That EBITDA largely drops through to the bottom-line when we built the plan at the beginning of the year you wouldn't have expected the kind of weather conditions that actually played out. So that free cash flow in this near term obviously will fall through and you're seeing that improved conversion. We started the year with an expected lower conversion rate because we wouldn't have had this kind of EBITDA opportunity built into a more normal weather scenario. We actually talked about free cash flow conversion being a little bit lower in 2023 and 2024 when we set our plans and we talked about the capital required to run the units pulling in some of the long-term service agreement spend for CapEx was one of the main drivers. You'll see in the capacity factors that are in the back of the deck our units have been running really well but they've also been running hard. And so we'll spend some capital in 2024 and probably have to spend some capital in 2025 to make sure the fleet stays in tip top condition. And so I think the surprise was not where we see 24 playing out from a free cash flow conversion. We actually had some positive free cash flow conversion due to the EBITDA opportunities that came our way in 2023. As far as Energy Harbor interest and how we're thinking about that financing and its effect on our results in 2023 -- in 2024 I'll ask Kris to comment.
Kris Moldovan: Yes, Michael I think you hit it. There are a couple of factors. For 2023 we did plan for some financing that would have some interest that would hit into 2023. And those were -- we didn't execute a financing until later in the year and the first interest payment on that financing will be next year. So, we actually -- it's a little bit counterintuitive but versus our plan from the start of the year we're in a benefit position on interest for 2023. And then you're right, 2024, the number that you're seeing here does take into account the interest expense on the debt that we raised for Energy Harbor and that we're holding right now. And as you noted, we don't have any contribution from Energy Harbor results.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, super helpful. Thanks a lot.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you guys very much. Really appreciate the opportunity to connect here. Just coming back to the capital allocation update commentary from the call real quickly. I mean obviously you're going to be introducing a new year in the first half of the year I think you said. But can you give us a little bit of a sense as to what the parameters are? I mean is it just really about how to capitalize the business? Are you thinking about this vis-à-vis new and novel growth avenues that could be emerging here pro forma for the acquisition and/or any other directions there? I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying there? Is this more about addressing the potential 2025 and 2026 $1 billion buybacks? Or is there something more that you're kind of alluding to in terms of how you think about the future growth of the business here?
Jim Burke: Julien, thank you for the question. Good morning. I appreciate the comprehensive question on capital allocation. I think it's several things. First of all, as asked earlier, we want to close this Energy Harbor acquisition get -- make sure we've got embedded fully a multiyear view of the potential for that business as well as the synergies that we're anticipating to be able to deliver over a multiyear basis. We also -- because we've raised the Vistra stand-alone guidance, we see more cash available for allocation. So, we want to put all of that together and go through that process of discussion obviously with our Board when we can have a comprehensive discussion about a number of things. We've mentioned some Vistra Zero opportunities in this deck that we will continue to execute on. The buyback program we've been executing actually slightly ahead of pace. We would anticipate that when we come back through the approval process with the Board, they'll remain supportive of the buyback program potentially at the current or even a potential higher pacing than where we've been executing. We did not feel like going out too far at this point given that we need to close the acquisition and put the full plan together. We didn't feel just highlighting one element of a buyback amount in 2025 or 2026 was appropriate at this point, but our commitment to our four strategic priorities and I think the execution against those has been on track if not exceeded and I would expect that to continue. As far as growth vectors, there are a lot of things that the future holds that are still being sorted out particularly with the Inflation Reduction Act. And are there going to be opportunities here to utilize behind-the-meter opportunity some of the hydrogen opportunities, I think just from our standpoint we still own nearly 60 sites worth of land and interconnect. So, we've got plenty of opportunities to still develop a number of avenues of our business from a growth strategy, but they need to meet our return requirements. And I think that's the discipline we wanted to continue to demonstrate through this presentation and why we want to come back with a comprehensive capital allocation plan is, we have to look at all of the options on the table, and look at the best ones, and not just the ones that we've been executing on to this point. But I see us remaining focused on the four core principles, and I think that's worked well. I think our investors understand our mindset around these, and we look forward to hopefully given another set of opportunity for our investors to see how we'll create value once we close the Energy Harbor acquisition.
Q – Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. And just speaking of which, right I mean obviously, the 2024 guidance today is not apples-to-apples with maybe what Street is "using" out there. I mean any chance that you could give us a little bit of a sense of what the EH impact is mark-to-market today even in a ballpark, sense to try to kind of square your guidance?
Jim Burke: I think Julien, it is a little bit from a timing standpoint, an apple and an orange, but I do think you can take a couple of pieces and add them together. So if you look at our stand-alone guidance for next year, we're looking at a midpoint of $3.9 billion. And then we unpacked the Energy Harbor 2024 2025 numbers, because we what we wanted to do we gave you an average last time of 750. Now we're unpacking it saying 700 for 2024. That's still using some data that we got originally, through our cases but we're tracking curves. We have a sense of things are about where they were at the time, we announced the deal from a power price standpoint. So there alone you're taking the 3.9 and the 700 here, you're getting to 4.6. We had been at a midpoint of 4.35, on average when we gave you that direction when we announced the deal. So, I think the two pieces just added together put us north of where we have been signaling the combined opportunity. And this still has the targeted synergy levels in here. I think we could potentially exceed those targeted synergy levels, but we need to get into the business fully have the details around that execution plan before, we would upsize anything there Julien. So, I do appreciate you calling out, because I think there's been some consensus that is included. Energy Harbor and some that has been stand-alone. Our stand-alone is well north of anything that we have signaled, at this point and we think our Energy Harbor at this point is on track. And when we get into it, I think we might be able to find some additional upside. But at this point, we're not reflecting that.
Q – Julien Dumoulin-Smith: At least, on track with those synergies it seems. But thank you very much again for time, guys. Appreciate and I’ll pass it.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Q – David Arcaro: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Jim Burke: Good morning, David.
Q – David Arcaro: Could you comment on the retail trends that you're seeing, do you expect this retail strength to continue? And I guess looking into the 2024 guidance, you've got some solid growth that you're reflecting year-over-year in the Retail segment. Wondering if 2024, could be potentially considered kind of a new baseline, I guess for the performance of that segment?
Jim Burke: Yes, David I'll start off. I'd like Scott Hudson, our President of Retail to add some commentary. I think the business – obviously, we break our business apart, quite a bit. There's different geographies in the business. ERCOT has its own unique design. The other markets obviously, have a different one more with the TDU, the wires company doing the billing. Our business has a very heavy residential footprint from an earnings profile standpoint, but a very large-scale business and profitable business in the Commercial & Industrial segment. The business has performed better than we expected it to perform this year relative to plan. And next year is pretty flat to that. So I think it's actually more stable is how I would describe the retail business not a large growth assumption or a moonshot required for us to be delivering in our 2024 guidance. And the team has done a really nice job adapting to a variety of weather conditions extreme weather and ERCOT and actually milder than normal weather in most of the rest of the country. But I think the underlying trends are a function of the creative products and the marketing channels. I'd like Scott to comment on that. So, you get a feel beyond just the numbers of how the team actually executes dynamically to meet customer needs.
Scott Hudson : Yes. Thank you Jim, and thanks for the question. We did see strong margins and growth across all of our customer segments and geographies in the quarter-over-quarter. On the residential side in ERCOT, which is a large concentration of what we do, Jim mentioned, the summer campaigns that we had very successful across six brands we have in the markets across multiple different products, our seasonal discount product, which helps flatten the customer bill with the discount in the summer for the customer is very popular. And then on the retention side, we have an advanced analytics team that actually identifies customers that we give customer credits to. We call them comfort credits and that's also a way to retain customers in these very extreme summer periods. That's a program we've had in place for several years, but we continue to refine. On the C&I side, what we see is that really strong margin performance. When there's volatility in these markets and power costs are up and down, this is really an opportunity for us for really providers at scale that have reliable generation and sophisticated commercial capabilities. So we saw some nice margin expansion both in ERCOT and in the Midwest and Northeast market. So those are just a few examples to give you a flavor, but to Jim's point, we're always looking to optimize our customer counts, our margins, our risk capabilities along with the customer experience. And it really is that optimization that allows the business to be consistent and stable.
Jim Burke : And David the thing I would conclude on Scott's remarks, which we're spot on with how we think about the business is the customer could be put under a lot of pressure with volatile pricing. With the hedging strategies, which we've described before are pretty conservative about the way in which we procure to handle extreme weather. Our goal is to insulate the customer as much as possible from those kinds of bill shocks. That helps franchise value in the long run. It helps the customers sort of get through the seasonal events. But it does take resources to be -- to hedge at that level. It takes capital you have to post collateral at times. You have to be a little bit more conservative on how you think about some of your pricing structures. But I think it pays off in the long run. And that's why the business not only had a really strong financial quarter they grew accounts in the quarter. Growing accounts in the quarter as being one of the largest market share participants is not an easy thing to do. But if you're providing that stable value proposition to the customer, the customers do respond well. And I think that's where we shine better is when we've got this kind of volatility that's when the model I think really differentiates itself.
David Arcaro: Yes. Excellent. Yes, I appreciate that color. And thanks for the clarification on the trajectory into 2024. And could I ask just does the retail contribution as you look into 2025 and the indicative midpoint guidance there? Does it stay flat into that year off of $24 million?
Jim Burke: David, we haven't put anything out specifically on retail, but we've given you a sense of where we see 2025 on a combined entity. But, yes, we see it staying fairly flat. And most of the delta that we'd expect to see if any in 2025 would be more driven by where the generation segment is. We're highly hedged in 2025, but we have to carry more open there. So you might see a little bit more variation there than we'd expect to see in retail.
David Arcaro: Yes. Got it. Understood. And just to push out even further just any directional thoughts on 2026 how much might be hedged at this point and just directional trend off to 2025?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes. If you look at the curves David 2026 is looking stronger than 2025. That particularly has moved in the ERCOT region from the last time we spoke. In fact when we had our call in August it was August 9 and August 10 was the all-time peak in ERCOT. So we were busy and we talked about how we needed to make sure that we got through the summer. Most of the pricing volatility in ERCOT came in the back half of August. And I think the forward curve started to reflect that the sort of on paper level of reserve margin may not actually be what the actual reserve margins are under stress conditions. So we have seen the curves move up. As Kris noted they are higher than where they were in May of 2022 still backwardated, but they are higher. And I think that's a reflection of the supply-demand calculation that folks are revising for ERCOT. We are still majority open out in the 2026 time period. We have not provided a hedge position, but our anticipation at the moment is that Energy Harbor also has largely remained open in 2026. That's why we were comfortable saying we expect it to be around that $900 million range. And then we see upside from where we sit today for the rest of the Vistra stand-alone for 2026 relative to 2025.
David Arcaro: Okay. Excellent. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time.
Jim Burke: Thank you, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew -- I'm sorry Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. 
Angie Storozynski: Good morning.
Jim Burke: Good morning, Angie
Angie Storozynski: Good morning. I just had a question about market power issues if any and how those could prevent you from any additional transactions. So you were clearly surprised by the issue that came up with Energy Harbor at the FERC level. And again is there any lesson learned from it? Again do you think that you have grown to the point where you might encounter those issues in other PJM zones?
Jim Burke: Angie we -- I don't think we've really learned anything, specifically, from this other than deals get a lot of scrutiny. We actually have in all of our filings and all of the screens we've done that we need to do in order to make our filings complete we did not see and still don't believe that these assets are pivotal in that regard. So I still think we look at the situation in the exact same way as we did when we made the announcement. But we do want to move forward and get this deal done. So we made the modification that we made. Even in ERCOT, our market share -- because the markets continue to grow we're more like a 14%, 15% market share number so there's even headroom for us to do something in ERCOT and that's where we have the highest level of relative size compared to others in the market. So no, I think the field is still open, Angie. I think, we'd love to obviously get this done and move forward and we want to be constructive and work with the regulatory bodies to make sure that that happens in a way they're comfortable. But no, I don't think, there's anything to read through at this point. Of course, we haven't heard finally from FERC on this matter, but we feel very good about our position on this and we think we have headroom to do additional transactions in all the markets.
Angie Storozynski: Great. And then you mentioned that you guys are waiting for some clarifications around the IRA, especially as those relate to the behind the meter installations. So I'm just wondering, if that's specifically referring to nuclear PTCs and how transactions with affiliates or non-affiliates will be counted towards the energy growth whatever receipts or margin that is currently in the role. Again, a little bit more clarity around what you're waiting for to see.
Jim Burke: Yeah. So, we obviously await guidance from the IRS on a couple of matters. The whole hydrogen topic and whether nuclear -- existing nuclear is going to qualify as a clean energy source whether it's behind the meter or what they call hydrogen by wire where it's more contracted through a PPA type structure we await clarification on that. We don't have growth built into our plans for that. We're not assuming an upside yet on our plans. But that's something Angie that we obviously await guidance on. I think the more immediate material guidance will be the nuclear PTC. And what is the revenue basis for determining whether an asset has earned some of the PTC, because the realized revenue rate is below the floor. We expect to get that guidance some point in the spring, but we're not sure how soon it could come. Obviously it goes into effect beginning of next year. Once again we've not assumed any PTC value in our long-range plan. But the way we think about it is the curves are right at and slightly above where we see the PTC floor. So it's unclear that it would apply at this moment. Now, there is indexing to that PTC. So if the curve stayed flat you might inflate your way into earning some of the PTC. It is still unclear about how affiliate transactions would work. But I feel like, there's been a commentary and some acknowledgment that some basis of spot whether it's real-time or day-ahead prices that there needs to be some reflection of what the market value is of the power and not just how the hedge transactions either were done at the portfolio level or at the asset level. I think that's a cleaner way to think about, it is to think about something in the real-time or day ahead market as a better benchmark for the value at the hub of the power. But again, we await that guidance. It's not baked into the plan. And I think it provides some downside protection. We're not 100% sure how much yet. But since we still have the upside of where the curves could go for the nuclear assets whether it's Texas or Pennsylvania Ohio, we view it as a real opportunity that the IRA provides. We just don't have clarity on the size of that opportunity at this point.
Angie Storozynski: Great. And if I could ask one last one. So there's some additional media scrutiny around the supply of nuclear fuel and the reliance on Russia here. I remember that, you mentioned that Energy Harbor is well hedged for nuclear fuel. But given that, you are doubling down on nuclear power, I'm just wondering if you have a way to manage the Russia risk, either direct or indirect exposure to 10x especially…
Jim Burke: Yeah, Angie, good question. It is something that the whole industry is paying attention to, because it can affect prices for domestic and more global sources beyond Russia as a source. So it's got implications whether you're sourcing directly from Russia or not. We have increased some of our nuclear fuel purchases. We've done that as Vistra. And we have done that both for our own needs, but also in anticipation of closing this transaction. So I feel very good about our financial and our physical supply with or without any Russian exposure over the next several years. And we feel that we're in good shape from a Vistra standalone actually for the next four to five years. But from a combined basis since we don't have all the detail beyond the next couple of years at this point from Energy Harbor, I think our fleet-wide purchases will actually help bridge, anything we'll see on a combined basis. But we have our -- we started working this issue. We started working even before we made an announcement about Energy Harbor, because obviously this conflict dates back in time. But I think we have done a very nice job. The team has done a nice job not only hedging for the physical part, but financially hedging curves are up for nuclear fuel. There's no doubt. You'll see nuclear fuel quotes in the $9 to $10 a megawatt hour kind of raise that's kind of an all-in value. We're still -- and I mentioned we're -- historically, we were closer to $5, trending up to $6 for Vistra standalone through 2026. That's still where we are. We don't have all the details on the Energy Harbor cost per -- I know they reset some of theirs early on as they did their restructuring, but we could have some exposure towards the back-end of a five-year planning horizon on price, just because the curves have moved up. But there's also a discussion about domestic sources and incentivizing additional supply, non-Russian that may come into play towards the back-end of our planning horizon. But I think we've substantially de-risked physically and financially there, Angie.
Angie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thanks Angie
Operator: Thank you. The final question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Jim just a more pointed question on the capital allocation and I appreciate you're going to go to the Board and we'll have a plan here in the first half of next year. But given the move in the stock and I asked you this on the last call as well, do you kind of still view that the security is undervalued here as we think about buybacks prospectively beyond 2024?
Jim Burke: Yeah. Durgesh, it's always difficult for management teams to predict where things will go. But yes, if you look at the multiples and ours now raised EBITDA guidance levels and our expected free cash flow generation, I think the multiples are just staying where they've been. And we're just reflecting a much stronger business profile. I think you can obviously make your case as to what's the right multiple to put on the business. I think there's been a view that the free cash flow yields need to be 20-plus percent in order to compensate for the risk of being in the business. I think our integrated model has shown a real stability to the business model. And we've seen various weather conditions, pricing conditions play out over the course of this year. And I think our team has managed through that exceedingly well and we've raised the out year. So I know Kris put in more of an exclamation point on this on the last call and I'd love to be interested to see if his view has changed, but I'm pretty sure it hasn't. But I'd like to let him close on this, because I want to make sure you guys know we're sticking with these four core principles.
Kris Moldovan: Yeah. Durgesh, I'll just point out obviously as you can see by the pace of our buybacks, we've actually picked up the pace in the third and fourth quarter. And as Jim mentioned as we look forward and we still have to get with the Board and talk about a comprehensive plan. But as Jim mentioned our intention would be to maintain the pace that we set this year and potentially look to see whether it should stay that same on same pace going forward or whether it should be increased. So we still feel good about the prices at which we're buying our stock today.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. That's perfectly clear guys. Thank you both. And then just, can I go back to the 16%, I think that was the number, one-six, of customer count growth in the retail segment. Can you just provide a little bit more color? Is that predominantly ERCOT? And then just for us to digest that what's like a five-year average, so we can see how strong this quarter was really?
Scott Hudson: Yeah, I can take that. This is Scott Hudson. The number that was referenced is in the appendix slide in the materials, but it's volumetric growth in our C&I market business. And we've seen a lot of success in that business both in ERCOT and in the Midwest Northeast markets through these times of volatility. I think what you find is that larger sophisticated customers want to work with players of scale, because we can structure a lot of complex products whether those be indexed, fixed, stability and pass through, new charges in the ERCOT markets, we see a shift of customers to the larger players in this particular environment.
Jim Burke: Yeah, Durgesh. I think Scott -- we had residential growth, but the 16% was a business is a volumetric growth. And so -- but both businesses grew and they grew their business not only in Texas, but outside of Texas. So it was really strong performance for the business to fundamentally grow in a very dynamic power market.
Durgesh Chopra: Thanks. Appreciate the color guys. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thanks, Durgesh.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Jim Burke for closing remarks.
Jim Burke: Yes. I want to close by thanking the men and women of Vistra for their hard work and for delivering an exceptional quarter for our customers and the communities we serve. We appreciate your interest in Vistra. And as you saw in our presentation, we have a lot to still accomplish and layouts and we look forward to laying that out for you and speaking to you again soon. Hopefully after we have closed here on the Energy Harbor acquisition and we wish you all a great morning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Vistra's Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn : Good morning and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our second quarter 2023 results. Today's discussion is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentations and earnings release.  Leading the call today, are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary.  Our earnings release presentation and other matters discussed on our call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation all available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website.  Also today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke : Thank you, Megan. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. The second quarter proved to be another strong one for the business as we delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Typically, we do not formally adjust our guidance ranges until after we get through the critical summer months, but based on performance to-date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of the guidance ranges introduced on the third quarter earnings call last year.  Accordingly, we are narrowing that original range which was $3.4 billion to $4 billion to a new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA.  Looking beyond 2023, the market curves continued to support a strong consistent outlook as well. Our commercial team is working to strategically lock in these opportunities, employing comprehensive hedging strategies to provide better line of sight to our earnings over our planning horizon, which in turn allows us to plan for capital return to our shareholders that is consistent and predictable.  In addition, I'm proud of the great strides we're making in the expansion of Vistra zero-carbon generation portfolio with our 350-megawatt addition to the Moss Landing Energy Storage facility that came online this quarter.  I'll speak to that milestone momentarily, but first, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 where we once again highlight our four strategic priorities. I think it's important to continue to reiterate our focus on these priorities each quarter with some notable accomplishments, as I believe these are critical to long-term value creation. This quarter saw continued strong generation and commercial team execution combined with our retail business that continues to deliver strong counts and margin performance. This year is proving it can consistently deliver substantial and resilient earnings in a variety of power price and weather conditions.  Just as last quarter on average, we saw power prices this quarter clear lower than our realized hedge prices. This is highlighting the significant downside risk protection to our earnings that our comprehensive hedging strategy across the integrated business can and does consistently provide. These de-risks consistent earnings give Vista the confidence to announce aggressive shareholder return programs, and then stick with those programs and amounts equal to or higher than those originally announced.  I'll let Chris provide the detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but of the aggregate upsized $7.75 billion capital return plan we originally announced in November of 2021, we've already returned $3.35 billion through August 4, 2023, which is approximately $250 million ahead of the originally announced plan levels.  We regularly evaluate how best to bring value to our shareholders and we expect to continue buying back stock and paying dividends that grow each quarter, based on a reduced share count.  Our balance sheet strength remains a top of this as well. You saw this quarter that we structured a $450 million P-Cap transaction which is unique and allowing us to post-treasury securities as margin deposits, returning more cash to the balance sheet. We expect to utilize that cash plus the margin deposits that have been returned as expected, as our hedges have settled throughout this year to fund a significant portion of the purchase price we expect to pay in the fourth quarter for Energy Harbor, substantially reducing the amount of acquisition debt to be issued.  Finally, as it relates to our opportunities with the energy transition, in addition to the progress we are making on the Energy Harbor acquisition, which I'll speak to in a minute, I would like to turn to Slide 6 regarding our Moss Landing Facility. The Vistra team did an excellent job in bringing online an additional 350 megawatts to add to the existing 400 megawatts at our Moss Landing site in California, which is the largest energy storage facility of its kind in the world. This addition came online ahead of schedule and on budget despite a challenging supply chain environment and extreme rainfall. This is now a total of 750 megawatts of energy storage backed by contracted revenues through our PG&E Resource Adequacy Agreements.  Importantly, we continue to see additional opportunities to add batteries to this site in the future. The facility is located in the [Indiscernible] energy market, which is experiencing significantly higher gas price volatility, as well as the potential for scarcity pricing due to high demand and import competition from the neighbouringh balancing authorities.  These factors result in favorable conditions for the earnings outlook for a Moss Landing battery facility and our co-located combined cycle plant which has 1,020-megawatts of capacity. This is a tremendous site and a great example of our ability to invest in a discipline way in Vistra zero while also providing for the reliable and affordable energy customers need.  Moving to Slide 7, the $1,008 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA achieved this quarter was a result of strong performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams with retail achieving attractive counts and margin performance and all customer categories and our generation team delivering commercial availability of approximately 95%. Our people working hard in this extended high yield environment, and they continue to perform extremely well.  When we originally announced 2023 guidance in the third quarter of last year, we estimated a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. As mentioned earlier, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of that range, leading us to formally update our guidance to reflect the new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and a new range for adjusted free cash flow before growth. Of course, there was a lot of execution still to go in the balance of the year, and our people remain focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.  Turning to Slide 8, I just wanted to reiterate that all three key agencies continue to work on the necessary approvals to close the Energy Harbor acquisition. We are working constructively with each agency and an all involved parties and as I mentioned before, we continue to anticipate a fourth quarter closing.  We believe Energy Harbor is a terrific transaction for district adding a substantial amount of nuclear generation with the support of the production tax credit. We continue to expect significant contributions from Energy Harbor, including the opportunities for synergies. I think back to the announcement of the Dynegy acquisition when we projected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion. Through the hard work of the Vistra and Dynegy teams and including the acquisition and successful integration of Crius and Ambit, together with the expected closing of Energy Harbor later this year, it is exciting that we could see ongoing adjusted EBITDA on average in the '24 to '25 timeframe of $4.5 billion, including synergies and out year prospects potentially even higher.  Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 10, Vistra delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, including $510 million from generation and $498 million from retail. Generation's results were favorable compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher energy margin achieved through our comprehensive hedging strategy. And as we did last quarter, our ability to capture value by backing down generation in times when prices are below unit costs.  Retails results were also favorable as compared to the second quarter of 2022. While the segment was impacted by less favorable weather, this was more than offset by continued strong counts and margin performance. As I discussed last quarter or the entire year shaping that damping the first quarter's earnings contribution to the overall year was offset as expected in the second quarter.  Turning to Slide 11, as Jim mentioned, we have been consistently delivering on our capital allocation plan. As of August 4, we have executed approximately $2.9 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.35 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. Notably, our outstanding share count has been reduced to approximately 367.5 million shares as of August 4, an impressive approximately 24% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. This meaningful and consistent share reduction has led to robust dividend growth.  For example, the recently approved third quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.206 per share represents an increase of approximately 12% per share, as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2022.  Finally, as Jim mentioned, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to growth. We have fully allocated the net proceeds from the December 2021 Green-preferred stock issuance and are now turning to securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate launching the first such financing in the coming months.  To wrap up on Slide 12, we have provided an update on the out year forward price curves as of August 4. As you can see the forward continue to hold together well. Specifically, since our last call we've seen forward curves increase in ERCOT in '24 and '25, increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve the previously disclosed $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities in those years.  As a reminder, we are significantly hedged in years 2023 through 2025 approximately 86% on average of expected generation across all markets, with a balance of 2023 expected generation hedged at approximately 98% and 2024 expected generation hedged at approximately 95%.  Finally, Crius and Ambit [ph] continue to provide opportunities to lock in significant earnings, especially during times of scarcity. Our commercial team continues to work to de-risk these opportunities by executing on our multiyear comprehensive hedging strategy, which strategy continues to be supported by our standby liquidity facilities.  We are proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams as far this year and are excited to continue our work towards executing against our remaining 2023 goals and long-term strategic priorities, as we translate that success and to shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our third quarter call.  With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Jim Burke : Hey, good morning, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning. So first up, I guess you're now obviously the third IPP to report stronger retail margins. Could you just unpack a little more what you saw this quarter, kind of within the strength as we're thinking about optimization versus actual margin expansion, and the degree to which I guess you guys see this as being durable? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Sure. Shar, I'm going to start. I'm actually going to have Scott Hudson to give a little bit of perspective on the market dynamics as well. You realized last year when we were in a climbing power environment, due to the conflict that we saw with Russia-Ukraine, and then the commodity curves moving up. So retailers in general, were climbing the hill in 2022. We started to see that obviously come off at the beginning of this year. And the team does a very nice job of looking at the multiyear nature of the contracts for large commercial, the 12-month to 24-month range for residential. And their objective, of course, is to have normalized margins. We tend to buy forward as a company, we try to normalize the experience for customers, because our experience has been, if you move the customers price too much, it's not the expectation that they had when they signed up with you.  So even on renewals, we're careful about how we manage this. So from a durability standpoint, the retail business has earned strong margins in follow years and in stable years. And I think as part of the brand power of the business, is that we're not selling an index type product that's just floating with a spot price, we're actually taking some of that predictability, risk by hedging forward and giving that benefit to the customer. So I feel very good about the durability.  And I would -- Scott, I'd let you to add about the market dynamics. 
Scott Hudson : Sure. Shar thanks for the question. I would just add to what Jim said is that we've got multi-brands at play in the ERCOT markets, and each of those brands are designed to attract a different customer segment.  But in general in ERCOT, on the residential side transactions remain at historical levels. So there were a lot of moves and switches and opportunities to win customers in the market. This really reflects the health of the Texas market migrations to consumers to it. As Jim said, prices have come down materially compared to this time last year, and the number of offers in the market has increased as have the number of competitors, in these markets. So very robust.  But I think where, we're successful in both accounts in the margin side is the differentiation of our products and services across those brands. So our summer campaign, this summer features three distinct products, seasonal discount product to first to market time of use product and then also an electric vehicle product, which really is doing well on the gains and helping us mitigate losses as well.
Jim Burke: And I would add Shar that the annual view for retail that outlook has improved from when we originally set our guidance for 2023. As Kris noted, the Q1 to Q2 effect is more about the shaping of the cost of goods sold because retail will buy power, according to the shape by month for the year. So the winter costs are much higher than the spring, the summer costs are much higher than the fall and into December. So we see that retail profitability much higher in our results in 2Q and 4Q, and we see less from retail in 1Q and 3Q. So I was giving you the annual view as to how I think about the durability, but there is a quarter to quarter difference because of how we buy power for retail reflecting the shape of power costs. So I hope that helps.
Shar Pourreza: No, it does. And that's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just lastly, I don't want to push too far but such great color on '24 and '25. Can you just speak to how the EBITDA opportunity to look for '26 or at least the degree to which you've been able to hedge that far. And just maybe refresh us on the Energy Harbor EBITDA opportunity that far out? Are you still seeing things north of $900 million? Thank you, guys.
Jim Burke : Yeah. You bet. So Shar, we have obviously continued our progress of hedging. As we said, we would, we consistently look for opportunities to provide a predictable earnings stream. And so first of all on '24-'25, we feel good about where we are from a outlook standpoint for Vistra stand alone. And that's really the data that we are operating with here Shar. We don't have a view into updates regarding Energy Harbor, and how they look at the moment for '24-'25 because we're going through the regulatory process. And so the data, we have this more the data we had at the time of the announcement.  But our view is because we're obviously in the market, and we view the curves, is that we're set up well, for Vistra standalone for '24-'25. We still feel good about raising that range that we mentioned where it was originally 3.5 to 3.7 and now we're looking at 3.7-3.8. So I feel good about where we sit in terms of Vistra standalone.  Energy Harbor, we know that had some out of the money hedges at the time that we announced '24-'25. And so our view there was that on a combined basis, we were 4.35 or so on a combined basis recognizing they had some hedges that were out of the money. We believe that there's an opportunity for our business, because of our update that we gave, because we were at 3.6, when we gave you the update for Vistra standalone. If we're at 3.75 now for Vistra standalone, again, be in between 3.7-3.8. That puts the combined enterprise in that for 4.45 to 4.5 range. So $4.5 billion on average in that '24-'25 timeframe. '26, we're pretty open still. In fact, I would say, Steve Muscato is here -- when we look at the markets, we look for opportunities. But when we last talked to you, we were seeing curves in AD Hub, for instance, in PJM that were pretty attractive. They were in sort of the $50 range. Those have come off now to about $44 in that 2026 timeframe, very close to the acquisition case that we announced. So I think we're on track for that $900 million. The upside to that for that piece would need some support from the '26 curve because we've seen that move around from $45 up to the low-50s and back to that sort of 44% range.  And we're still pretty open. We assume they're still open. Again, we don't know what hedging they've done for the long term. But I think 900 is still a solid number for 2026 for Energy Harbor.  And in terms of our business, Vistra standalone we've seen PJM come off. We've seen ERCOT come up. And ERCOT has come up, and it's been attractive and Steve, I used and you shared some thoughts about how you have seen these markets unfold even in the last month or two.
Steve Muscato : Sure. We've seen ERCOT because of the heat that we've been experiencing and the periodic bouts of scarcity that have been kind of a routine issue here in the last at least several weeks with the heat in Texas. It has rippled into the forward curves, and so fixed price is holding in there. So we're able to hedge some of our solid fuel free.  And we're also seeing sparks, to your point, Jim, expand as we move out into that period. And so we're opportunistically hedging ERCOT where available, as you can imagine, '26 is somewhat illiquid, but we are having some success open our retail and wholesale channels and increasing those hedge percentages when the opportunities present themselves.
Jim Burke : And of course, with the AD hub and with Energy Harbor, we have some PTC support ultimately, Shar, we don't view it as meaningful because it's kind of -- all the curves are close to at the money right now on that, but that's one of the reasons the deal was attractive as well was the support to the downside if we had it. So -- thank you, Steve, and Scott, for the context on that. Shar, thank you for the questions.
Shar Pourreza: Yeah, terrific, guys. Congrats and very good color. Appreciate it. 
Jim Burke : Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Sullivan : Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for the color on those last couple of questions. Hey, Jim. Wanted to shift over to -- from the debt -- from the EBITDA side more to the debt side pro forma. I think, Jim, you were mentioning you did the PCAP and then you have some margin collateral posting coming back. Can you just give a better sense of like how much new debt you will ultimately have to issue and if that's changed from when you announced the deal and then what on a pro forma consolidated basis, where the debt is going from where you are today?
Jim Burke : Sure. Michael, I would say that the conditions, obviously, in terms of margin deposits and the return of cash has been pretty favorable this year. I'll turn it to Kris to talk about how that influences the way we think about financing Energy Harbor and the overall credit metrics and targets that we're looking at.
Kris Moldovan : Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I'll put it into two buckets. As we -- when we announced the transaction, we had shown an assumption that we would use $600 million of cash and $2.6 billion of debt. And of course, we knew that there was going to be some more cash coming back from margin deposits or we expect it to come back for margin deposits, but we wanted to be conservative and make sure that we maintain sufficient liquidity. As we have settled those hedges throughout this year, that money has returned as expected. But that number also included plan to do some nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero, which we still intend to do. So I would say, over the balance of the year, there's really two different things that we're looking at. There's the acquisition financing you can -- that has with the return of the margin deposits and the cash and the PCAPs transaction that has also returned cash. That has brought that $2.6 billion down to again, assuming we go to the next stage on the non-recourse financing, but that's probably brought that number down to $1 billion to $1.5 billion, somewhere in that range.  And then we still have nonrecourse financing in the works that was in our plan that was assumed in those numbers. And I think as we said in the remarks that we still expect to see a transaction in the coming months. And so that will fill in the rest. We still have enough commitment that we're still being conservative with our -- the financing commitment that we have in place. But -- that's really it.  And from a debt perspective, as we said, we're still targeting sub three times. At the closing, I think we continue to believe that we're going to be just above that. And as we look forward through a combination of debt repurchases and increasing EBITDA, we think we can get to that sub three times in the 2020 -- as early as 2024. Potentially leaking into the first part of 2025, but we don't see there being a long wait for us to get to the target levels that we're looking at.
Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate all the color there. And then maybe just on ERCOT looking forward here, obviously, been pretty hot down there. What are you seeing in terms of just the grid holding up for the rest of the summer? And then thoughts on potential new build response later this year around the referendum vote.
Jim Burke : Sure. Yeah, Michael, it's been a very active kind of last three weeks. I would say it's a daily area of focus Steve would say it's a minute-by-minute focus. And that's really because the grid, as you know, in Texas, it's been a robust, low growth market. And the additional resources that have been added over the last three to five years have largely been wind and solar. The solar move has been consequential 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts year-over-year. which is helping that evening period, and we're getting to the point where solar is filling in that six to eight-hour range fairly well, and we're all focused on the wins ability to pick up where solar left off at that sort of seven to eight hour and beyond. A couple of good points is that earlier in June, while wind overall was lower in third and second quarter this year in ERCOT than last year, at peak times during this evening hours, wind actually when the grid was at 80,000 megawatts or higher, wind actually performed relatively well in the early part of the summer. We didn't see much price formation. In July, late-July and early-August, we're starting to see that the wind in those periods of time is returning more to kind of normal expectations, and we're starting to see that tightness in those late evening hours. And of course, we're talking about the marginal resource of wind or solar. That assumes nuclear, coal, gas are all operating the way they need to be. And that's we sometimes lose focus on that because that's the majority of the grid. The units are running hard. There's no end in sight for this heat that we're in. And so -- the team is doing a terrific job keeping these units online.  And I would say, overall, the ERCOT grid and the operators have done a nice job keeping the grid supplied, but there's an asymmetric risk to the upside on prices when you look at how tight the grid actually is. And we're starting to see those forwards in '24-'25, I think, start to reflect that there actually is meaningful supply-demand tightening that's occurring in ERCOT. And as far as whether gas newbuild comes it's a three-year process for the most part from the time you get started. And the loan referendum is in November, the PCM, which was part of the House Bill 1500, the Sunset bill, it has a net billion dollar cap that was inserted as part of that legislation. It could be several years to there years before that could be implemented, the PCM. So there are a lot of variables that are moving at the moment that developers would have to get comfortable with in terms of are they seeing enough to build because the curves are still backwardated. Even though we're saying the curves have moved up in '24-'25 and we're working through it, ERCOT still has -- there's still an assumption in this market. It's going to get overbuilt or there's going to be a lot coming that's just going to be potentially supported by PTCs and create downward pressure on pricing.  So I think it remains to be seen what kind of queue there's going to be for gas-fired generation, but there clearly was support in this legislative session to try to keep existing thermal generation and try to incentivize new. Not all stakeholders agreed on what the right solution is to do that, but at least there's recognition that the thermal resources existing and new are important. And that was a good outcome. But there's still a lot of work to do with the P&C and ERCOT in various stakeholder groups to get this over the finish line.
Michael Sullivan : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. 
Jim Burke : Thanks, Michael. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the conversation on the '24-'25, the 4.5 there. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the retail assumptions are there? I know Shar tried to get at this a little bit, but it seems like you're just collapsing the transaction in there. Ultimately come up with that new number in the mid-4s. How do you think about these other retail pieces there? And ultimately, just also what were you alluding to on '26? I know you said it was quite open. Just what does that transposed into '26 if you can start to go there just quickly in terms of the puts and takes?
Jim Burke : Sure. Well, if you look at our revised guidance for 2023 and you look at that sort of midpoint, if you take that and add the Energy Harbor numbers to it, that I'd shared with you for '24-'25, you're getting to that $4.5 billion number.  And what we've seen in our business model, Julian, is because of where we've hedged and how we've been able to hedge, the realized kind of margin expectations are pretty flat from this kind of '23-'24-'25 timeframe. And the split between retail and gen might vary a little bit, but not materially. And I think that's 1 of the durable parts about our model is. And we saw it last year. And we're going to see it a little bit this year is that you may see a little bit of movement between retail and gen based on market conditions.  But retail is very solid in this kind of $1 billion range over that horizon. And I would expect the difference being the wholesale to get to that 3.8. And that's actually, I think one of the things that we've been excited to share is that the business is stable doesn't mean we're not working hard every day to hold on to it. I don't want to make it sound like just because we've hedged it. It's going to be realized. We have to deliver every single day on the business. But the outlook is actually above where we were in May of last year when we announced it and stable. And we'll be adding Energy Harbor to it. And so that line of sight with those hedge percentages we feel really good about where we are in that '24-'25 timeframe. Certainly '26 is more open.  And as I mentioned earlier, ERCOT is looking favorable relative to the last time we talked. But PJM is down on fixed price power at this point in 2016, but then we also have some PTC support for that for the Energy Harbor length. It doesn't look like ERCOT would be in that PTC range right now because of where the curves have moved up to.  But we've got kind of geographic flexibility segment, flexibility in -- or I should say, diversification and how I think 2026 will play out.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And if I can ask you to clarify your forward ERCOT expectations. I mean we've got a few different programs yet to be implemented, I suppose, is the procurement program with a certain level of subsidy baked in there coming, I suppose at some point, curious on your sense of timing on that for any real impact? And then related, we have other reserve programs yet to be fully implemented. I'd be curious on your initial assessment of some of these programs, like the dispatchable reserve strength?
Jim Burke : Sure. I'll start. I think by subsidy, I think you're referring maybe to the loan program and the grants that could be coming Julien?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yeah.
Jim Burke : So yes, that -- obviously, the referendum is in November. The initial amount that was shared as part of the bill was $10 billion. The amount that has been provided for in the budget is $5 billion. And then the amount of the $5 billion that's going to be allocated to building new gas plants is unknown at this point. So let's say it's something in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range potentially.  When we've looked at the math, the 3% interest on a 60% loan to value, it can move your returns a couple of points. So it is helpful, but it does not make up for potentially missing revenue in a backwardated market. And that gets to your other point, which is do these other programs, whether it's an ORDC bridge PCM being implemented, eCRS was just implemented. DRS will be implemented by the end of 2024, do those cumulatively add a recognition of reliability for the assets that Ken provided. And if so, can we get enough line of sight to build into that? And I think we don't know yet for us. I mean, we're still evaluating it. Steve, in terms of how the new ancillaries like eCRS and DRS, how you see that playing in Artic bridge be interested and share your thoughts on how you see the market adapting to these?
Steve Muscato : Sure. I think let's start with eCRS because it's the latest and we've actually seen how it's been implemented. And they're putting it in when I say the ERCOT is dispatching it only when critically needed. And so, I think it's serving well from a reliability perspective in terms of keeping ERCOT out of an EEA situation. But one of the other things I've seen is it hasn't necessarily impacted price formation too much. So I really think it gets into how ERCOT handles these reserve products. If they handle them in the way that they're designed, which is really when the grid is approaching tight conditions, and it's not necessarily used to -- for price formation, which is what we're seeing so far.  When I see ECRS dispatch, it's been on the very hot days, at the peak hours when needed. And it hasn't been very price suppressive. So we think it's working the way it's intended. And we'll have to see on these new reserves that they're putting in. But to the extent they use them in the same way as ECRS, I think we're in the best of both words where we're avoiding what I'll call emergency conditions on the grid, but we're still seeing very solid price formation when it does get tight.
Jim Burke : And I think it's too early to call DRS at this point. I mean it's still early stage to think about that one. Julian. That was one of the ones that some certain stakeholders were pushing as kind of the market solution. And so I believe the P&C and ERCOT have enough tools that they can work with to try to build some incentives for existing and new assets to be recognized and rewarded for their reliability, including a firming requirement for assets that come on to the grid after January 1, '27. And that they have to effectively be able to backstop the expected generation that they are committing to.  Those were all the right, I think, concepts. It's just early stage for us to know at this point how that's going to affect prices.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Net-net, though, there does seem to be some kind of timing discrepancy between when these reserve programs come in. And any ultimate effect of any kind of procurement program here?
Jim Burke : I think so. The procurement program or the loan program and grant program alone, like I said, is marginally it's beneficial but it does not solve the broader problem that we entered the session trying to solve. And I think that's why we ended up with a menu of things. And frankly, it's a ton of work for the Public Utility Commission in ERCOT to work through this. And they're going to have their plate more than full. I mean, there's real-time co-optimization that has to fit in there before even PCM.  So there is a lot still to, I think, figure out. And we'll obviously be active and work with the stakeholders involved to try to bring clarity to it. But yes, on a calendar basis, it's multiyear at this point.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent, guys. Good luck. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, good morning, Jim. Just on the hedges, I think you answered part of my question in your prepared remarks. But the '22 to '25 hedges stayed at 86% and no change since the Q1 update call. Is that just you willing to stay more open given the market conditions? You mentioned the ERCOT curves -- or is it just more normal course of business and you're going to opportunistically hedge more? Just any thoughts there?
Jim Burke : Yes, it's a very good question, Durgesh. I would say there's a combination of factors. One is we've actually added some length given that the curves have moved up. So that's a good thing. There's more hours in the money for the fleet. So that means there's actually more to hedge. That's ultimately a good thing. And so when you look at the percentage, it's not a static amount of generation. So that's 1 element.  The second element is that's as of 6/30 that we were giving you these percentages. We've continued to hedge since 6/30 particularly in the 2025 timeframe. I don't feel that where we sit working with our team that we feel '26 is at a place where you have to go lock it all in because of the dynamics we talked about earlier. We think there's still upside in some of these markets. And we feel good about the visibility we've given for '24-'25, and we've got time to work on '26.  So the curves, as I mentioned, in '26 for PJM had come down ERCOT has gone up, but not anything that we need to go rush out and move materially on '26 at this stage.
Durgesh Chopra : How about just within that '23 to '25 period. I guess what the message here is that 86% should move higher as we get along here.
Jim Burke : It's already higher since 6/30 Durgesh. And so the '26 hasn't moved much, but we have moved up on '25 and we're nearly fully hedged obviously for '24. But these percentages do move because, again, being in the money means you have more hours to hedge because there's gross margin. So the hedge percentage could drop, but your earnings forecast could go up as a function of just simply looking at the opportunity set. So some of it is just the timing and the fact that these curves do move around.
Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks. And then, Jim, one of the questions we consistently get from investors. Obviously, as you look at the stock, right, I mean, since I believe you initiated this buyback program, it was Q3-Q4 '21 the stock was in mid-teens. You broke 30 today. Just your updated thoughts on capital allocation, share buyback versus growth opportunities. How are you thinking about all of that here as the stock hit $30 
Jim Burke : Sure. Well, Daesh, it is good to see that the stock has moved up. We view this as a long-term strategy when we initiated it, and we still feel that way.  If you look at the stock price move, and this is a very imprecise science, but a good portion of the move, you could explain by virtue of the reduction in the share count and not necessarily seeing the enterprise value move that materially. Now that's still a good thing for the existing shareholders, and it's an opportunity for existing shareholders that are effectively increasing their percentage of ownership in Vistra.  I also believe that since the May timeframe of last year and where we are today, we have materially improved the earnings outlook of the company, which in theory, would result potentially in a multiple expansion. And we really haven't seen that much of a multiple expansion. And I'm not here to argue what the right multiple actually is. But I still feel there's recognition that I believe the market will continue to see as we put, I call it points on the board, delivering on our scorecard and our results. And at some point in time, when folks are comfortable that the earnings power is sustainable for the -- in the duration of a horizon beyond even the two to three years we talk about you might actually see some multiple expansion. We're not really there yet. And so our capital allocation plan for the foreseeable future, and I would put that in partly the high-class problem if we have to revisit it. But we feel very good about the capital allocation plan. And we might lean in a little more aggressively on the pace of the buybacks if we continue to overperform and see where we are with our -- obviously, cash needs to do that, fund Energy Harbor, which is our focus is to get this transaction closed in the fourth quarter. And then we're being disciplined on the Vistra Zero projects. And when we're reflecting that. And we want our shareholders to be confident that we do things, and we do look at the buyback as an alternate use of capital relative to the growth options. So the growth options need to be attractive. And so we'll pace the Vistra Zero projects to make sure that we're hitting the best ones and not chasing just the renewable projects. And I like our portfolio there. And we mentioned MOS 350 was an excellent project to bring online and an excellent job by the team.  So capital allocation plan is intact. And we're excited to, I'd say, hit the gas pedal on the capital allocation plan because we think it's the right mix for our shareholders as well as our debt holders.
Steve Muscato : I just -- I would just add, obviously, you're talking about, as you mentioned, $30. We do as you would expect, internally have our own valuation of what management and the team feels like the stock is worth. And I think, as Jim said, we're still comfortable buying and potentially leaning in at these prices. And so it gives you a feel for where we think fair value is. And we're not there yet.
Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you, both. And congrats on the solid execution here on several quarters. Thanks. 
Jim Burke : Thanks, Durgesh. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro : Thanks so much good morning. 
Jim Burke : Good morning, Dave. 
David Arcaro : Steve. I was wondering, I noticed a decline in the CapEx for 2023 for solar and storage development. Wondering what's driving that. And then similarly, just looking out to the development plan, some of the in-service dates moved out for several of the solar and storage development projects. Wondering if you could give some color around that dynamic.
Jim Burke : Yeah, absolutely. Those two are related, David. We have the Illinois coal to solar, we had the majority of that reduction that you see was some movement out of 2023 and -- and into '24-'25. We're still working the procurement cycle with working with vendors on EPC and obviously, the equipment. And we're still working that process in Illinois. So it's more just a deferral at this point for the coal to solar projects. And that was about two thirds of what was moving out.  The other is, as I mentioned on a couple of previous calls, on the ERCOT solar, we're starting to see the solar hours kind of cannibalize the solar hours. And so we'll move forward on solar projects with a PPA, but we're not going to move those in a merchant type model. And that really was the other part of what lowered the CapEx.  Now as I've mentioned as well, we own these projects, the pacing of these, a project may not be ripe now, could be ripe three years from now, depending on market conditions and depending on how some of these rules played out that we talked about on one of the earlier questions. But that is really a reduction at this point this year, that's a deferral on the coal to solar. But I would say in Texas Solar, but I would say next year, we're probably still in this kind of $600 million number. So we're not pushing number down this year to then take the next year number up fully. We're showing the discipline because the Texas piece, in particular is something that we want to keep a close eye on. So I think even for next year, you're going to see a development number for CapEx that's pretty close to this year.
David Arcaro : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just maybe following on to that, how do you think of if there's or now maybe this is a little bit separately. I imagine if that growth CapEx number goes down, that was going to be largely financed with non0recourse project financing anyway. 
Steve Muscato : That's correct. 
Kris Moldovan: So we open up additional cash available for allocation at the overall Vistra entity?
Kris Moldovan : You have that right. As we look at this, the amount of price [Technical Difficulty].
Unidentified Analyst: My question is it just like a structural change that we see in retail margins? Again, if only because of the higher cost of financing? Or is it just we are coming off from a really high price, power price environment? And there's some pricing arbitrage between where we were and what's the current costs to serve these retail contracts?
Jim Burke : Yes, there's a lot in your question, Angie. And I'll break it down I think into two big market distinctions. The ERCOT market is more of a scarcity-driven market. And we have seen in just the last two months, the volatility pickup and the cost that a retailer needs to be prepared to pay to insure against that volatility has moved up. So you had the whole energy complex move up in '22, then it started to come off earlier this year. Now we're having the actual scarcity of basically supply demand tightening and ERCOT. And we're starting to see the costs for swing, which is part of that full requirements, particularly for residential, that's very costly. Large commercial and industrial does not have as much of a swing aspect to its load profile. So we are a very residential, heavy retail book. We have a great LCI business, but we are dominated from an earnings standpoint by our presence in residential. So we manage that swing in the pricing for our customer. Scott Hudson has to provide for the fact that he's wearing full requirements risk and serving this load.  And we have the assets to back it up. And I think that's what's distinctive about our model is that we've got the base load the intermediate and the peakers, so that Steve Muscato and the team can fulfill. And so if there's any issue with that we get it just right on the quantity hedged, which hedging is always imperfect. We've got an opportunity between the retail and the gen side to balance each other out. And ERCOT where we've really seen that volatility.  In the other market, it's been more gas-driven. And we've seen a general downward slope in the gas curves and these other markets and retailers generally can expand margin in a declining gas and power cost environment. And they might see some compression in margins and are rising. And I think, some of the tailwind in 2023 in signing deals is based on the fact that if you signed deals in 2022, that were multiyear deals with large commercial, you might have had negative margins in the first year and 2022, because power costs were so high because you average the cost for the customer. And then you would have seen positive margins in the out years. That's normalized now.  You can now sign deals and see positive margins in '23-'24-'25. So that's part of the tailwind. But this is a cyclical business. And I think you've got to run it for the long-term. And you've got to set customer expectations around being predictable and not move them around too much, as I mentioned earlier.  So those are the two dynamics I see in the market. Scott, is there anything you'd like to add to that?
Scott Hudson : No, I think that's right, Jim. I think the most dramatic change that we've seen year-over-year is residential customers in the Midwest and Northeast, where it's a cyclic market. We just have an opportunity to bring on more customers, particularly digitally and online, because of where the price to compare is. At we still -- 
Jim Burke : Price to compare is still much higher. 
Scott Hudson : Much higher. 
Jim Burke : And our power costs are lower. But I think, there was such an extreme last year that that'll stabilize overtime, but you really do have to think about these as very market specific. And then customer product and brand-specific segments.  Thank you. Thank you, Scott.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and just one other question. So as we keep going back to the rising cost of financing, but also strengthening of your stock, even though there might be little to no margin expansion yet. If you were I mean -- if you were to do another M&A transaction, just talk to me -- talk me through the financing of any potential deal. Again given the rising cost of financing, you are seemingly that dedicated to share buybacks. So, again, I'm just debating if you are a sufficient scale have pro forma Energy Harbor and if there are additional economies of scale to be had both from an operational perspective and a financing perspective that you would benefit from basically adding one more generation portfolio.
Jim Burke : So, Angie thank you. Always looking ahead. We are clearly focused on Energy Harbor. And as Kris mentioned earlier, we've got some return of cash this year. So it can help change our what our financing needs are to close the Energy Harbor transaction.  We don't comment on any potential M&A, but I think we demonstrated that we keep an eye out and we have the right conversations to be aware of the opportunity set. And if there is an attractive one at the right price, we'd be in a position to move. But I've also said and I said it on our Vistra standalone case. We liked the Vistra standalone the case at the time we announced Energy Harbor. So we had to get comfortable to Energy Harbor would truly be accretive in a long-term good fit for our company. And we made that determination. And we're very excited about it. We would use a similar lens on anything else. And we still think the capital allocation plan, which we kept intact, through Energy Harbor. I think we still need to consider that in anything that we're doing that our shareholders have come to expect that capital allocation plan that will execute on it, increase any comments on the financing markets, and how we think about it. But that's sort of another step down the road, even from this Energy Harbor transaction.
Kris Moldovan: Yeah, Jim, I would just add As we have talked about, and as we have increased our forecasts for '24-'25 and as we see opportunities in 2026 one thing Angie, to note, and we'll have more to say on this after the Energy Harbor closing. But we still have capital to allocate even above and beyond the billion dollar -- the minimum billion dollars a year of share repurchases that we've talked about and the $300 million of dividends and getting our debt where we needed to get it to go in our renewables growth.  So even beyond that, we have a significant amount of cash. And so we'll continue to make decisions. And as I said, we'll have more to say on it coming up. But we'll continue to look at opportunities and that could be growth. There could be additional share repurchases. So, that would damp in any financing that we have. But we feel good about our ability to raise financing. We also have -- we have created a currency with the Vistra Vision equity. We're not looking to use more of that, but there could be a situation where that is available to the extent that it makes sense.  So we have a lot of options. And we'll continue to make sure that we are flexible as we go forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Thanks. 
Jim Burke : Thank you, Angie.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke, President and CEO for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke : Thank you again for joining us on this call and sorry if the call dropped and you had to get back on. But we really appreciate your interest in us and following how we're progressing. And we look forward to talking to you hopefully, if we see on the road before the next quarter. And wish you a great summer. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Vistra's First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. Today, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast, discussing our first quarter 2023 results. Today's discussion is being broadcast live on the investor relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find the copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra's senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call, as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation and other matters discussed in our call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also today's discussion contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statement included on slide two of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks and forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I will begin on slide five. We entered the year focused on our four strategic priorities, and we are making great strides. First, our integrated model continues to demonstrate its value and effectiveness. As you probably recall, we spent a majority of 2022 executing on our comprehensive hedging strategy that we said was locking in earnings opportunities for 2023 through 2025. We utilized available liquidity last year to support this strategy as we believe the additional EBITDA opportunities were significant. This first quarter of 2023 we saw this strategy translate into real value as mild weather was experienced across the major markets in which we operate, which led to lower than expected cleared power prices. While we saw power prices clear at approximately $30 a megawatt hour on average, our first quarter results reflect a realization of average prices of around $45 per megawatt hour given we were highly hedged entering the year. In addition, in the outer years where we have been more open, we have seen prices and spark spreads increase as compared to this time last year. We have continued to opportunistically hedged to secure an increasing out year earnings potential. We believe this is important not only because it provides an enhanced resiliency of our earnings profile despite an uncertain commodity market, but also because it ensures we can deliver on our commitments to reliably serve our customers, consistently return capital to shareholders, maintain a strong balance sheet, and transform our fleet as we strengthen our position for the long-term. Second, our return of capital to our shareholders remains consistent and robust. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan in just a moment, but I want to highlight that of the aggregate 4.25 billion share repurchase authorization, we have returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders from November, 2021 through May 4th, 2023. Additionally, we are on track to pay $300 million in common stock dividends in 2023 as planned with our Board approving a second quarter dividend in the amount of $20.40, representing an approximately 15% increase over the second quarter dividend paid in 2022. The share repurchase program together with the structure of our dividend plan work in tandem to provide our shareholders with the expectation of dividend growth each quarter, as the aggregate $300 million in annual dividends is spread across a decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. Third, we continue our focus on a strong balance sheet. As we see margin deposits return, we are positioned to utilize that cash for opportunistic delevering and/or to reduce the amount of debt we expect to incur to close the Energy Harbor acquisition we announced in March of this year. While the first quarter is typically the lowest free cash flow quarter for Vistra, we were able to repay approximately $500 million of short-term debt. Of course, we're expecting our net debt balance to grow over the balance of the year to fund the Energy Harbor acquisition, which we expect to come with a significant amount of EBITDA. But we remain focused on our goal of a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times, which we expect to achieve in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Finally, we are very excited about our announcement just two months ago regarding the acquisition of Energy Harbor, which is expected to close later this year. With this acquisition, our nuclear fleet will grow by an additional 4,000 megawatts in PJM, which will more than double the zero carbon generation we have online today. Turning to slide six, I will discuss this quarter's results. We achieved $554 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, strong operational performance and our robust hedging activities helped offset milder than normal weather throughout the U.S. Our retail and generation teams continued their strong operational performance with retail achieving growth in ERCOT customer counts while maintaining attractive margins, and our generation team delivering commercial availability of 97%, while maintaining the focus on safety. The generation team has operated over three years without a significant injury across a large and diverse fleet, and safety remains our number one priority. Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of our $3.4 billion to $4.0 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance range for 2023 as we announced in the third quarter of 2022. We're also reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations guidance range. Of course, with nine months to go in the year, including the important summer months, we believe it would be premature to narrow or otherwise adjust our guidance range for 2023. Kris will cover in more detail while we remain bullish on our opportunities and years ahead. Before I wrap up and turn the call over to Kris to discuss the first quarter's performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the status of our Energy Harbor acquisition. As noted on slide seven, we have filed approval request with each of the three key agencies and anticipate receiving all needed approvals in time to close by the end of this year. As a reminder, we've committed bridge financing in place and an amount sufficient to close the transaction, but we do expect to replace the entirety of our bridge commitments with permanent financing between now and closing. Finally, I think it's worth noting that as we have seen out year forward price curves improve, our financial forecast for Energy Harbor has also improved in the out years. Previous estimates we shared in March indicated average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for 2024 through 2025 of approximately $900 million with adjusted free cash flow before growth opportunities at a 65% to 70% range. This is inclusive of synergies and on an open pretax basis. Given recent price curves, we see the average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor for 2026 and beyond to be higher than this original estimate. We expect that we will provide more detailed adjusted EBITDA and other financial projections for the combined company closer to closing or just after. Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, Vistra delivered $554 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, including $583 million from generation and a loss of $29 million from retail. Generations results were strong despite the significant impacts of milder weather on pricing, primarily driven by in the money settled hedges opportunistically backing down generation at times when prices were below unit cost, and the recognition of the net bonus position in PJM for Winter Storm Elliott. Those benefits were partially offset by headwinds for the quarter that were known at the time guidance for 2023 was set, including default service migration costs, and lower PJM capacity revenues, as well as entry year impacts relating to timing of hedges and opportunistic acceleration of planned outages into the first quarter. While retail was also impacted by mild weather, it is important to note that due to strong counts in margin management, the results for retail for the first quarter are in the range of what we expected coming into the year. Given the entry year shaping, we continue to see due to higher power costs in the winter and summer months, we anticipate substantially all of the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters.  Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of the $905 million to $1.065 billion range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail that we announced on our third quarter 2022 call. Turning now to slide 10, I'll share a quick update on capital allocation. As of May 4th, we had executed approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases since the beginning of the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.55 billion of authorization by year in 2024 with at least $1 billion of cumulative repurchases expected in calendar year 2023 as originally planned. Notably as of May 4th, our outstanding share account had fallen to approximately 373 million shares, a significant reduction of approximately 23% from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding when the program started in November of 2021. As a result of our robust and consistent share purchases, our dividend program of approximately $300 million per year or approximately $75 million per quarter continues to result in significant growth in the dividend per share received by our shareholders. To that end, the second quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $20.4 per share, which is payable on June 30th, 2023, is approximately 15% higher per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022. While we remain committed to consistently returning capital directly to our shareholders, we also remain steadfast in our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Accordingly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. Finally, our Vistra Zero growth remains on track. We have allocated over 90% of the net proceeds from the December, 2021 green preferred stock issuance and are focused on securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things, support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate the first such financing to be in place no later than the end of this year. Turning to slide 11, we provide an update on the out year forward price curves as of May 4th. As you recall, we announced last year on the first quarter call that we estimated a range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for years 2023 through 2025 based on April 29th, 2022 curves. While we do not expect to update this range before initiating guidance for each applicable year, we did want to note that we currently believe there's upside to the range in each of 2024, 2025, and now 2026, in light of the higher prices in our primary markets and the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program that has now hedged 2023 through 2025 at approximately 86% on average across all markets, with the balance of 2023 hedge at approximately 99% and 2024 hedge at approximately 96%. As you would expect, 2026 is significantly less hedged, which creates a significant opportunity, but also a wider range given our open position. We remain committed to executing against our 2023 strategic priorities and translating that success into shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Jim Burke: Hey, good mornings, Shar.
Kris Moldovan: Good morning, Shar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Good morning. I think you sort of touched on this quickly, but I guess what point could you revisit and update the two-year commentary you guys have been providing. And then, obviously, those numbers have been floated around first in 2022. I guess, what kind of O&M inflation is embedded in those? Maybe put differently, we've seen a few of your peers kind of flag strong, increases in O&M costs of late, so I guess what are you guys seeing in those numbers as well? Thanks.
Jim Burke: Yeah. Shar -- excuse me. This is Jim. Thanks for your question.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, Jim.
Jim Burke: The two-year, if I understood your question, the two-year view you're speaking to is about 2024 and 2025. And as you noted, we had put out the 3.5 to 3.7 range last spring when we started to see the forward curves move and we've been opportunistically hedging into that. When we got to the end of 2022 and we started to talk about 2023, obviously we put out a 3.7 midpoint, which was at the upper end of this midpoint range, which was a construct we were trying to use to signal to the market that we see the earnings power of the business improving, but there's still a lot unhedged at the time we first put it out. Since we've continued to hedge, we see us continuing to move up. So, using the May 4th curves, and this is without including Energy Harbor, we see that midpoint opportunities for 2024 to 2025 start to move up higher than the 3.7, and we see it in sort of the 3.7 to 3.8 range. Again, this is the midpoint of those opportunities, so when we would formalize guidance at the end of this year for 2024, we'll have a bigger range around that, just given the inherent variability of managing through the business. But as we continue to perfect these hedges, we still have some open, obviously, in 2025, we're more hedged in 2024. We see this earnings power definitely improving for 2024, 2025, and in 2026 we're even more open. And if you rolled forward to 2026, we see an increase even further from these numbers.
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just -- I'm sorry to ask, but what's the O&M inflation you guys are embedding in those numbers?
Jim Burke: Yeah. So, the O&M inflation, it depends on which category we're referring to, Shar. We're using, and we have consistently seen something between 3% and 10%, depending on the nature of the input. Labor is different from OEMs doing outages, which is different from variable chemicals we use in the power production process. But it's in that range. And obviously, as a competitive company, we're contracting and procuring as competitively as we possibly can, but we don't have any go gets, if you will, built into the numbers to that we are trying to solve for, this is our best line of sight of what it takes to run this business.
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Perfect. And then just last, I would love to get maybe a pulse check on sort of the legislative cycle right now, and your expectations for resource adequacy in ERCOT. Anything seem to be a little quieter. Now that the Senate has passed several items. I guess, what are your expectations for pathways forward as this session comes to a close? Thanks guys.
Jim Burke: Sure. Yeah. Sure. The -- it's coming down to the final three weeks in Austin. I do think there's been a lot of attention and appropriately so on reliability, and we've talked about that, especially when you consider that Texas is the nation's leader in wind and soon to be the nation's leader in solar, which helps from a sustainability point of view, but we've actually see that there's needs to bolster the grid from a dispatchable generation point of view. That was the impetus for the performance credit mechanism that was adopted by the Public Utility Commission in January. And the timing is such that depending on how the legislative process wraps up, the stakeholder process would begin for this PCM mechanism to be able to create a market mechanism to reward reliability. There's still many bills being considered in the house and the Senate, so it's hard to predict what might pass. But I think from our standpoint, the PCM is meant to address not only the incentives for new generation, but ensure that existing generation doesn't retire prematurely because some of the other forms of generation are getting production tax credits, which as you know, can create downward pressure on market power prices. So from our standpoint, we think the reliability focus is important. If the PCM is well designed and it moves forward, we think that it'll bolster the competitive market. We obviously want to continue to see support for our integrated model in Texas. We think it's a business that serves customers well, and we would intend to invest in building gas fire generation if there is a well designed PCM. So, we think policymakers are focused on the right aspects of what it takes to keep the grid affordable, reliable, and sustainable. And sure, our view is we want to be part of that solution here in our home state, but we still have three weeks to go and we'll obviously have to provide more updates as the session wraps up. But I do think the attention on this is well deserved and we'll be involved as much as we can through this session and the stakeholder process.
Shahriar Pourreza: Very helpful, Jim. Thank you so much. Have a good morning. Appreciate it guys.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Shar.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Look, I wanted to just follow up on the success of the Energy Harbor transactions. Obviously, got a lot of folks attention. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts about looking into potential further inquisitive activities? Obviously, there's a NorthStar around, buybacks and commitments there in and maintaining that throughout. But can you talk today, especially in reaction Energy Harbor, how you would think about perhaps leaning in further to, whether that's nuclear or other angles that could include retail renewables or what have you. But we'd love to hear your thoughts.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Julien and good morning. Look, we have generally stayed away from commenting on M&A. I think it's one of those activities that opportunistically comes your way and you have to be prepared for it. You have to always be what we'd say, hang around the hoop a little bit on opportunities. However, I think the Energy Harbor transaction is a very significant one for us. Certainly, it's our focus right now, not only getting through the approval process with the key agencies, but the integration activities with the team at Energy Harbor and with our team. As you note, it's transformative in a lot of ways, because we used it as a platform to highlight just how much of a business we have with the carbon free aspects of our business. And obviously, we're going to more than double that amount of generation with this transaction. The strong balance sheet and the returning capital, the reason we keep repeating the four priorities is because we have to find things that fit within those four priorities and not everything is going to. And I think that's a commitment we've made. I think the Energy Harbor transaction reinforced. We mean those that we're going to stick with those four core principles. So Julien, nothing is ever off the table from the standpoint of looking at it, but it needs to fit the criteria that we've laid out and we're going to remain disciplined in that regard.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. No, fair enough. I appreciate that. Look -- and then with respect to the transaction itself, I mean, can you comment a little bit? I mean, seems like there might be a slight delay in the close the transaction, just what caused that, what approval process, or just the execution process? And then related, you talk about a significant jump in generation here. You all obviously have a pretty sizable retail platform. You saw some quarter-over-quarter declines in retail customers. How do you think about building out that retail platform a little bit further here in light of Energy Harbor, Oregon? Is that less of a priority considering things like the nuclear PTCs that might deemphasize the need to want to quote unquote balance that retail business with generation, if you will?
Jim Burke: Sure. Well, on the first matter, I think we're progressing well on the approvals process. We announced the transaction early March. We made the filings, the key filings in April. We believe the NRC is working towards an early October approval, which to be on the six-month track for a license transfer, we think, is actually on the more efficient side of the scale in terms of where we would go. We've talked about closing this in the fourth quarter, and I think that is achievable.  Julien, as you know, we don't have anything built into our numbers for 2023 related to Energy Harbor. So, hopefully, there's some opportunity there. But just I think we're tracking well. There's nothing that we're concerned about at this stage, but it's still early in the approval process. But so far so good. On the retail side, our reduction in counts has been more outside of the ERCOT market. We've made some strategic exits in a couple states. The Energy Harbor platform does give us an opportunity to bolster some of the areas where we do currently operate in retail. And obviously, it gives us an asset base, including some attributes like the emissions free energy credits, which customers are becoming more interested in that the nuclear units can offer. So, I like our retail, we like our integrated model. We do think the Midwest Northeast market reforms in some of the retail markets is still warranted. As we've talked about, Julien, the level of competition there in terms of the degree to which you can differentiate your products, there is still rather limited. It's more of a hedge channel and being able to serve customers with your assets than it is a true business to consumer or business to business differentiated marketing strategy. We hope to get there in some of these markets and we'll continue our efforts from a stakeholder outreach perspective. But the integrated model is certainly well intact with this acquisition, because it comes with a retail business in addition to a generation. But we do need to see these markets open up a little bit from a reform and being open to innovation in these markets, the way Texas has been open innovation. And so, we do have some work to do there, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. I'll leave it there. Best of luck guys. We'll see, speak soon.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, good morning.
Jim Burke: Hey, Michael.
Kris Moldovan: Good morning. 
Michael Sullivan: Hey, Jim. Hey, Kris. Wanted to just confirm on the upside you're seeing in 2024 all the way out to 2026, that's based on basically current curves. And then if so, maybe if you could just give us your own point of view on where you think things could go just based on supply/demand dynamics in your major markets.
Jim Burke: You bet, Michael. Thank you. Yes. We base this off of using the May 4th curve. So, it's a function obviously, of where we have hedged, what we still have open, and the curves as of May 4th. Not that the liquidity is infinitely deep in some of these outer years, but it's not based on a point of view. It is based on curves. We know that this is something that you and our investors are trying to follow, which is, are we seeing some upside? As Kris laid out in his chart, from the time we first initiated the strategy of talking about a three-year horizon, the curves have actually improved in those outer years. So, while we've seen the front of the curves come down because of a number of factors, I'm going to ask Steve Muscato, our President of Wholesale, to comment.  We've seen the out years actually strengthen, and we think that that's actually a sign of opportunity for Vistra long-term. But in terms of the dynamics by market, I think it might be helpful for Steve to share a few thoughts as to how we see these markets being impacted by some of the factors obviously late last fall and through this year and where we see that headed. Steve?
Steve Muscato: Thanks Jim. Sure. I would add, if we start with natural gas, which is kind of a big driver behind power prices, the marginal shell has now become the Hainesville, which is a dry shell. We're seeing limited growth in the Utica and the Marcellus due to limited pipeline take away and all the growth in the Permian that's happening, even though that's a wet shell, it's not the marginal shell. It's being used to really feed growing LNG export markets. So, that's really provided support on natural gas, which is why you're seeing it stay $4 and above, at least 2025 and beyond.  The front end of the curve is really influenced by a -- some excess storage inventories that are due to a mild weather, that if you look going forward, if you assume normal weather should balance itself out once you get to the 2020, late 2024, early 2025 period. In terms of like, say, fundamentals in each market, you're seeing this integration of renewables, particularly challenging in PJM, you see a lot of coal leaving the stack over time, but a slow incremental movement in renewables. Not only are renewables less effective in markets like PJM because lower capacity factors, it doesn't have the same irradiance or wind speeds that you see in markets like Texas and Mico. But it also takes a lot to replace it. You could see five to nine to one replacement levels needed in order to maintain same levels of reliability. You also have problems with east coast gas markets to the extent they can recouple with European markets. That could also cause some volatility. And I think Jim mentioned some of the things that are already happening in ERCOT in terms of reform. You have solar pushing the peak out. You only have one hour batteries coming into ERCOT, which it really doesn't help on an extended heat wave that may occur or extended cold front. And so, I think uncertainty around gas and coal assets and determine what happens with the legislature in addition to an aging fleet provides this collision we're seeing over time, which is going to win out the renewables or fossil fuels, and at least in the intermediate term, it appears gas is going to be needed. It's going to be stressed. And so, we think that's supporting fundamentals out.
Jim Burke: Steve, thanks for that. I'll just add, Michael, that in addition to the dynamics we're seeing of the resource fix and how it's changing, we've seen obviously a handful of significant environmental regulations that have been issued and potentially forthcoming that could also put some pressure on assets that currently are providing a reliability service on these grids. And our assets even with a Vistra Tradition and a Vistra Vision, coal is 25% to 30% on a go forward basis of Vistra Tradition. It's predominantly our combined cycle gas fleet. We think that has a lot of value in helping these grids be able to sustain a reliable operation while integrating more renewables. And then, of course, our Vistra Vision is anchored by Vistra Zero and also Comanche Peak and Energy Harbor assets on a go forward basis. So, we like our asset position to backstop and what we call firm up our customer commitments. And we think the horizon, whether it's the economics of what happens in competitive markets, or whether it's actually some of the incentives and the rules that could come forth from an environmental standpoint, these assets are going to be needed for reliability purposes. And that's our thesis with why we think this business has a long-term earnings potential that we see actually growing through time.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks. That was super comprehensive. Maybe just one quick follow up there on the environmental rules. So, from where you're standing right now, Jim, like any near term impact in terms of whether it be investments that you have to put into some of your coal plants that you were planning to keep online?
Jim Burke: Not in the near term, Michael. A couple things. Obviously, the CCR, ELG rules we have talked about for years, and that does have impacts on our coal fleet, which we've communicated multiple times that will have retirement dates and that sort of 2027, 2028 horizon except for two of our sites. Casper or the Good Neighbor Rule, it did -- it was recently stayed. So, you have an opportunity here for the state of Texas to revisit this rule. Obviously in the fifth circuit, it's going to take some time to sort that out. That could impact some of our old gas units, could impact the Martin Lake if it were to be fully implemented. But I think there were good reasons for the challenge and we're certainly not the only party in that challenge. There's many industry participants outside of even power as well as the state. But no, Michael, we don't have any anticipated large CapEx spend as a result, but we stay active. Again, reliability is important and we think that that this transition that's occurring on the grid needs to be done so thoughtfully, but nothing -- no near term impacts with the stay, maybe a little bit pushed out from that standpoint in terms of impact on our fleet.
Michael Sullivan: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.
Jim Burke: Hey, Dave.
David Arcaro: Hey. Let's see. Wanted to check on the retail business. Just wanted to confirm, is that on track for the year, given the first quarter results? Are you going to -- need to pursue some more proactive initiatives to keep kind of in line with the guidance range for this year? Or is this really just the -- maybe more natural ebb and flow of the EBITDA results for retail?
Kris Moldovan: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. As we noted in the comments, 29 -- the loss is $29 million that was expected -- that was within the range of what we expected when we set the guidance. So, that's not far off of what we were expecting going forward. We continue, and I noted this, but we continue to expect retail to be able to meet or exceed the midpoint of its guidance range that we provided in the third quarter of last year. We don't -- we see some timing effects over the balance of the year and some margin and count benefits that have carried through that we see will offset some of the pressures they saw from weather in the first quarter. So, we don't see anything in particular over the balance of the year that we need to stretch to meet that goal. Again, as we would note, the shape continues to be that we're going to see pressure on the retail side from an EBITDA perspective in the first and third quarters. And the second, fourth quarters is where they're going to make substantially all of the EBITDA. And that's because they typically have flat prices through the year, but the power costs in the winter and summer months are the highest. So, there's some pressure on EBITDA in the first and third quarters and the second, fourth quarters is where they make it up.
David Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, similar topic, I was just curious what the latest trends you're seeing are in customers moving to default service. Is that still a trend that's happening or which direction are you seeing right now?
Jim Burke: Yeah. David, we're still seeing some default prices increase in the markets through their kind of delayed procurement, but you are seeing competitive offers in the market that are now south of that default level. So, you are not seeing the same level of migration to default. You're going to start seeing and we are seeing folks moving from default back into the competitive arena that is part of this market dynamic. I was mentioning that from a reform standpoint, ideally you would have a one-to-one relationship with the customer and not have it a customer bouncing between a utility and a retailer. But at this stage of the game, obviously prices have crested, they've started to come off in the wholesale market and that's creating opportunities for our retail business. But it's also creating some of the migration in some markets away from default and default prices because they're still increasing in some markets through May, that's going to create more and more savings opportunities for customers.
David Arcaro: Okay. Great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.
Jim Burke: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just wanted to make sure Jim, I sort of heard this clearly in the response to Shar's question earlier, for 2024 and 2025, the midpoint is in the $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion range, and 2026 is expected to be higher than that for the base business?
Jim Burke: That is correct.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. And kind of above $900 million for Energy Harbor in 2026 as well?
Jim Burke: Yeah. That is the view that we have. And obviously we've talked about this on a hedge basis, which is largely open in 2026 Energy Harbor. We've talked -- because we are 2024, 2025 numbers that we've given, you have hedges in them for Energy Harbor. Once you get to 2026, Energy Harbor is pretty open. We're pretty open. And actually you could see Energy Harbor doing better than $900 million when you get out to 2026 again at current curves.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for clarifying that for me. And then just as we look to the end of the year or maybe as you close on Energy Harbor, what should we expect in terms of disclosures? It is your -- is it going to be sort of a three-year, kind of like you did last year EBITDA guidance and free cash flow range? Just any color you can share, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Kris Moldovan: Yeah. We're going to -- I think we will obviously update guidance for the balance of 2023 and then 2024 at or at the time of closing. We haven't made a decision as far as how far out we'll continue to update. We'll probably continue to give directionally where we see things going. But I think we're -- I don't know that we plan to continue to consistently give three-year ranges going forward. But as we get closer to closing, we'll getting updates to what we've put out so far.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood. Thanks Jim and Kris.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Durgesh.
Operator: Today's final question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please proceed.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So -- actually some questions. One about flexibility in financing of the Energy Harbor transaction. So, I think we're all watching credit spreads. You have this deal to finance. You have the bridge financing in place, but you plan to refinance it before the end of the year. So, I'm just wondering if you could use, for example, any of the project level debt you mentioned at the renewable assets to maybe help yourself here. So that's one. And number two from the -- a bigger picture question. So, when you look at the mark-to-market of earnings of Vistra Vision and Vistra Tradition at these prices, you are solving for deleveraging pretty quickly. Probably 2025 if not sooner. So, would that change your thoughts about keeping these two businesses together, i.e. could we see a separation of Vistra Vision, again, which would unlock the true value of these assets? Thanks.
Kris Moldovan: Angie, I'll handle the first question where we talked about financing of Energy Harbor. Obviously we -- in the -- when we announced the transaction, we put out some assumptions on the amount of cash that we would use and the amount of debt in the split of the debt. We continue to look for opportunities. First as you saw, the margin deposits are coming back as expected. We saw about over $1 billion, approximately $1.2 billion come back from the end of the year into -- through March 31st. And we continue to see some margin of deposit returns as we settle our hedges going through the summer this year. So, you can expect us to continue to optimize the amount of cash that we're going to use from the balance sheet. As we -- and so it could be larger than the amount that we indicated on the call when we announced the transaction. As far as debt, we're going to look at a number of opportunities. We're going to be opportunistic as to timing and which market that we're in. So, we're already preparing for those opportunities. And I think you'll see us look at a number of different avenues to raise that debt and not just wait until the end and try to do it all in one market.
Jim Burke: And Angie, this is Jim. I'll add to Kris' comments on that. The idea obviously with Vistra Vision as it was conceived in order to execute on this transaction and keep a strong balance sheet, did obviously do two things that highlighted the amount of our earning stream that has a zero greenhouse gas emissions profile. It also created an investment vehicle for some of the key shareholders for Energy Harbor to participate in this future entity. I still step back and think about this as a customer business that is -- that has a changing sort of view of what they're looking for from the electric grid, including a more sustainable grid, but also a reliable grid. That in essence is Vistra. I mean, that is what we're doing. We're doing it, we're expressing it through different transactions. Energy Harbor obviously is the most significant one, but with the Ambit and Crius and growing our retail presence and then our launching of our own opportunities with Vistra Zero. So, the dissynergies that could come about by saying that this business is only this and this business is only that, is not really how the electric grid functions. It is obviously a way in which we can think about investors and how they want to express their point of view of what they invest in. But I think we can achieve that even with the structure we have here. And most importantly, we're still a fundamentals based view on value, and we invest in things that generate long-term sustainable cash flows. I know folks do talk to us about what do we think it might take to get a rerate, that's in some level out of our control. What is in our control is our ability to make good decisions, take advantage of the market opportunities as they come about, create some on our own and serve customers extremely well. And if we do that, we're going to return capital to shareholders very aggressively and paydown debt. And I think that's a winning model. It just may not come with the shorter term moves that some people might want to see, but I think we're building an enduring business and I think that's attractive for investors, and we're prepared to execute on that.
Angie Storozynski: That's great. And just the last one question. So, you mentioned on some of it, that we're seeing relatively limited liquidity in those forward curves for power, right? There's always this question, is gas more liquid versus power and maybe those spark spreads that look incredible in forward years, I mean that are just to be true. So, I mean, is there a way for you to basically capture that strengths even with limited trading liquidity in power markets, either through some derivative transactions, gas driven hedges, you name it.
Jim Burke: Yes. Angie, we can. Obviously, gas is more liquid than power, and gas many times is a good proxy for power. But to your point, it's not a perfect proxy for power. And Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on some of the things that we do to try to use liquidity efficient means and how we're thinking about capturing this value. Because we are sensitive, Angie, that the further out we go, depending on how we hedge, there obviously is a use of liquidity, and we balance that into our thinking. And we're not also thinking that these curves just go away tomorrow because again, the fundamentals of what we think is happening with the electric grid speak to reliability and assets with flexibility, which is our portfolio. And we think those are getting valued and they're getting valued differently than they have in the past, because reliability was taken for granted. But Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on how we're thinking about blocking this in.
Steve Muscato: Sure. I think for nuclear assets, gas is a decent proxy as a hedge. And so, we are able to use gas instruments like the NYMEX and different NYMEX structures to at least either lock in value or put a range of value in place to kind of protect downside. But we do have the PTC, so that's a consideration. In terms of the sparks, we do have to buy the gas in order to lock in the spark, and some of the specific gas locations is more challenging. I think ERCOT, PJM, there's more liquidity than places like New England for sure. But we try to do it in a liquidity efficient manner because as you get out further, the independent postings or the independent -- the initial margins that you have to post with exchanges can be quite expensive as you go out in time. And so, we're looking at trying to increase credit using first lien structures when we go out that far, or even bilaterally with counterparties to get that done. And so, it's a little bit slower from both, because we're trying to use liquidity efficient channels, and also going directly to customers and other wholesale counterparties. But it is something we've begun working on in 2026, even out as far as 2027. But it will definitely take time. And again, trying to use liquidity efficient channels is important, like first liens and direct to bilaterals.
Angie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.
Jim Burke: Angie, thank you for the question.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
End of Q&A:
Jim Burke: Yes. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vistra and please know that our Vistra team is working hard to execute well for the summer, and our strategic priorities, and we look forward to giving you future updates. Have a great morning everyone. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-03-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Vistra's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Vistra's investor webcast, discussing fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, which is being broadcast live on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, the related press release and recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Joining me for today's call are Jim Burke, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior Executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I would like to note that today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call all include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website. Also today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statement included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks and forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with you all to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, which we believe is a positive and straightforward message. Beginning on Slide 5, as we've reiterated over these past quarters, we remain vigilant and focused on our strategic priorities throughout the year, and the 2022 results demonstrate that focus and set us up well for the future. We believe that operating an integrated business model provides the stability and consistency that our customers and our shareholders expect and our operations throughout extreme weather events this past year, we believe, have proved this thesis. You'll recall that we initiated guidance for 2022 for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations with a midpoint of $3.06 billion. Despite extreme volatility in commodities and numerous weather events, including winter storm Elliott at the end of December, we ended the year exceeding this midpoint by $55 million. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted free cash flows along with these higher earnings, delivering a final adjusted free cash flow before growth of $129 million above the midpoint of the narrow guidance range we introduced in the third quarter of 2022. Our integrated portfolio also supported our comprehensive hedging strategy we executed throughout 2022, with the goal of locking an out-year earnings potential in years 2023 to 2025. Kris will speak to this in more detail later, but we concluded the year at approximately 73% hedged across '23 to '25 across all markets. This hedging percentage and the current forward curves continue to support the estimated $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion midpoint of adjusted EBITDA earnings potentials in those years. And with our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint set at $3.7 billion, we look forward to executing squarely on these opportunities. We continue to see Vistra generate significant cash flows and our strategic priorities remain focused on returning meaningful value to our shareholders. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but I will note that we returned approximately $2.25 billion to shareholders via our share repurchase program from November 2021 through December 2022, approximately $250 million more than we had originally planned. Additionally, we paid out $300 million in common stock dividends in 2022, as planned, with each quarter's dividend per share growing as the share count was reduced. The fourth quarter dividend paid in December 2022 represented a 29% increase over the fourth quarter dividend paid in December of '21. We expect shareholders to continue to experience increases in dividend returns into 2023 as we expect to continue to pay out an aggregate $300 million in annual dividends due to decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. We remain vigilant this year in maintaining a strong balance sheet. While our debt balance did grow to provide the liquidity we needed to support our comprehensive hedging strategy, we achieved our goal of a sub-3x leverage after margin deposits are considered at year-end. We held our debt capacity steady at year-end as we saw less return of margin than originally expected. We have seen the margin deposits start to return to us in the first quarter of 2023, and we continue to actively manage our liquidity and focus on opportunistic timing and structures to further optimize our balance sheet. With the goal to achieve our long-term sub-3x debt leverage ratio target on a pre-margin deposit basis over time. Finally, we are proud of the results we saw in our Vistra Zero business this past year. We added over 400 megawatts of renewable and storage capacity in 2022, and we expect to add another 350 megawatts of storage capacity in California at our Moss Landing Phase 3 facility in mid-2023. We also retired approximately 2,900 megawatts of Ohio and Illinois coal facilities at our Zimmer, Joppa and Edwards plants. We appreciate the dedication of our teams who work at these sites for decades, powering our communities and always with a sharp focus on safety. We are pleased to be able to redevelop these sites in the future Vistra Zero energy facilities. Notably, the Joppa and Edwards sites are part of our Illinois Coal to Solar program where we are transitioning numerous sites into solar and/or storage facilities. Turning to Slide 6. We had a strong 2022, ending the year with $3.115 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. This is $55 million above the $3.06 billion midpoint we said in the third quarter of 2021. We achieved nearly $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, $129 million higher than the narrowed guidance midpoint we set in the third quarter of '22. Our financial achievements were underscored by the strong performance of our retail and generation teams. Our flagship retail brand TXU Energy continues to execute well, growing Texas residential customers nearly 2% year-over-year, while maintaining its PUCT 5-star rating. Our Generation team has proven its ability to perform in extreme weather conditions in both the summer and winter months, optimizing the maintenance of our fleet to stand ready to perform when needed. The team's commitment is illustrated by the 95.4% commercial availability achieved fleet-wide this past year. Safety remains our top priority and the culture of continuous improvement is exemplified in our Vistra best defense safety program. I'm pleased with our performance in 2022, but through continuous improvement, we see opportunities to perform operationally at an even higher level in 2023. We now look forward to delivering on the financial guidance we set forth last quarter for 2023. We are reaffirming our $3.4 billion to $4 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations range for 2023 as well as reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range. It is early in the year, but notably, despite the volatility in commodity prices we've experienced lately, we continue to have the line of sight to achieve the expectations we've set for ourselves given the potential value our comprehensive hedging program has locked in for 2023. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss the 2022 fourth quarter and annual performance in more detail.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 8, Vistra delivered solid fourth quarter results in 2022 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $771 million, including $359 million from Retail and $412 million from Generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $3.115 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations, including $923 million for retail and $2.192 billion from Generation. Retail's results exceeded the midpoint of its component of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance of $700 million by $223 million. Our favorable results were primarily driven by strong residential margins, claim management and customer counts in ERCOT, offset partially by PJM and New York, New England counts and margins. Moving now to Generation. Its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations results came in under the midpoint of the Generation component of guidance by $168 million, primarily driven by low first quarter prices in ERCOT, coal constraints and higher default service costs, partially offset by higher realized prices and strong commercial availability. Turning now to Slide 9. We are providing an update on the progress we've made on our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we had executed approximately $2.45 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. This includes an incremental $200 million since the end of 2022. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $800 million of authorization by year-end 2023. Notably, as of February 23, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 381 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 21% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding just under 16 months ago. Additionally, in 2022, we delivered on our goal to pay $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year, and we continue to execute against that goal as we head into 2023. To that end, we recently declared the quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.1975 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate, payable on March 31, 2023. This is an approximately 16% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2022. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we also continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any nonrecourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than 3x. While we did in the year with a higher debt balance than we planned, that higher balance corresponds to the higher levels of adjusted EBITDA opportunities we now have in years 2023 through 2025 as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, the execution of which required additional liquidity. Even with the higher debt balance, we achieved a sub-3x leverage on an after margin deposit basis at year-end. As we have reported in prior quarters, we continue to pursue Vistra Zero growth, and once again, we emphasize that we anticipate financing that growth by using primarily third-party capital along with the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the $1 billion of green preferred stock and ongoing Vistra Zero free cash flow. Turning to Slide 10. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. As you can see on Slide 10, we are providing an update on the forward power and gas price curves as of February 23. While there has been noticeable volatility over the past year, prices are still holding in the range of the April 29, 2022 curves, which were the basis for the estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint range for each of years '24 and '25. Importantly, as of the end of 2022, we were approximately 73% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 approximately 90% hedged and 2024, approximately 76% hedged. As Jim stated, we are pleased with our 2022 accomplishments, but we are focused on continuous improvement as we deliver on our 2023 priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shar Pourreza: Realize it still kind of ways off, but I guess given the volatility we've seen in the backdrop, I think it'd be kind of helpful for The Street, how should we sort of think about the EBITDA in '26 and beyond? The curves would imply a bit of a step down, obviously, not as liquid that far out from a hedging perspective. And I guess, any general sense you can give there like you've been doing for '25?
Jim Burke: Shar, this is Jim. We knew when we put out 3-year kind of views, we get asked about before and it's not surprising. What's interesting about the curves is that '26 is actually hanging in there relative to '25. You see gas, obviously, still has a little bit of contango in it. We're seeing the heat rates hold up. We're certainly way more open in '26, and the liquidity there is not obviously the same as the near term. But right now, it's just that we're really open in '26, Shar, but actually, the '26 on just sort of a view as to where the curves are today. If we could actually lock that in, we feel pretty good about where we would guide for '26. It's just that's a long ways off, and it's not as liquid as we'd like it to be to be able to act on it. I'm not even sure from a point of view that we would act on it fully, if we could. I think we think that some things might be a little bit overdone on at least as we see the view now with the mild winter and that putting that kind of downward pressure we've seen on the complex overall. But it's a good question. It's one we talk about every day, as we look at how we commercially optimize the business, but '26 is hanging in there.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, Jim, a lot of different data points flying around this winter on the PCM and ERCOT. I realize it's not yet a completely done deal, but I guess how should we sort of think about potential uplift to your assets, if it's passed? You guys should have done the math, and obviously, is there still a door open to do something else down there?
Jim Burke: The PCM, as you know, is the leading concept at the moment as a proposal passed by the Public Utility Commission 50 in January. A lot of alternatives still being discussed there. The one thing to note about the PCM is, it was passed, I would say, more with the conceptual framework. The details are still to be worked out, things like what is the reliability standard that the state is actually going to procure resources to ensure reliability. What is the net CONE, what's the slope of the demand curve. There's just a lot of things to work out. And so this idea of trying to calculate its value, I think there's really a couple of concepts we would want to make sure when we get through the stakeholder process. One is, is it material enough to attract investment? And that's one of the ideas that is the concept behind doing anything with market reform. And is it enough to retain the Generation that's currently there? So to the extent that we end up with a PCM that just does not have a lot of value in it, it could be a concept and it could be implemented, but it may not do much attracting of investment or retaining of assets. And I think you'll hear the debate down there that's happening in Austin, there are many stakeholders that do not believe that we have to do significant market reform. We're concerned about market reform from the standpoint that the state of Texas from a reliability standpoint will need to actually incentivize new generation while retaining the existing because we are such a strong economy, and we're seeing the load growth here in markets unlike anywhere else in the country. So I think, Shar, it's too early to say what the PCM is going to provide. Obviously, we believe in a dispatchable resource emphasis around PCM. We think that's core to grid reliability, but there's too many things to still work out in the stakeholder process, if this is the leading concept coming out of the legislative session.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, Jim, one last one for me, I promise. Just on the inorganic side, I mean we've seen nuclear assets in the East come to market in recent months. One of your peers obviously has been very vocal that they couldn't bridge the bid ask there. Is this something you've considered or would you consider in the future? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.
Jim Burke: Yes, sure, sure. We're obviously not going to comment on any specific aspect of M&A, but you've seen this in the past. If they can leverage our core capabilities, it'd be a consideration. We've done it with Dynegy, Crius, Ambit. I view it as -- I think we're good at 3 things. I think we're very good at operating plants, serving customers and commercially integrating these 2 activities, which as you know, operate in a followable commodity market. So I think we would look at things, and we have been around processes and that's part of just our core strategy of looking how -- looking at ways that we can maximize value for shareholders, but I wouldn't put a caveat. Our investors have been very clear that they do like our return of capital strategy. We try to be very consistent with that approach, as Kris laid out, and I think that still remains our priority. So anything that we're going to consider in that front, I believe, needs to fit within that framework that may or may not be possible, but we have a priority around returning capital to shareholders. And if we can do that and leverage our core capabilities, we'd be interested.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific, guys. Congrats on the execution and much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: I was wondering -- let's see. Could you speak just a little bit more to the Winter Storm Elliott events. Curious if you could just elaborate a bit on how your Generation facilities operated, if there were any penalties that you might have experienced? And then also on the Retail side of things, how did you manage the unexpectedly strong load and get through that weather event?
Jim Burke: Sure. It's a good question. So obviously, we ended the year with a really strong weather system that affected not just one market, but multiple markets. When we go into these events and some of this has been refined since Uri, we carry more length into these events because we've seen that particularly, in winter events, you can actually have some fuel disruptions, not just asset performance challenges. So we try to take that into consideration. So we hold back length on the Generation side, and then we expect that retail load, particularly in extremely cold weather, can swing even more than what we would normally have expected on a winter day. And we expect those 2 to offset each other, and in Winter Storm Elliot, that's what happened. So we were able to run our ERCOT fleet, and our fleet performed really well -- and in PJM. And that extra length from an energy perspective covered the extra swing that we experienced on the retail side. On the penalty specifically, because PJM has yet another aspect to it with the penalties, you could be in a bonus or a penalty situation. And our view at this point, although we do not have full information yet from PJM, is that we're in a net bonus situation, not by a lot, but we are in a net bonus situation. But we haircut a bonus expectations because of some of the default risk that others are concerned about, and this actual process could take 8 or 9 months to receive payments for people that are in a penalty, and they need to pay in order for us to receive a bonus. So we've assumed for this purpose that we basically have a breakeven penalty bonus situation in PJM with that haircut on the bonuses. And so we came out of the storm where we expected to be. What we like about our business is, we can handle these events. What you tend to see in the aftermath of these events is some more volatility potentially in the forward curve. And then we try to hedge into that, and that's how we're able to provide the guidance that we provide. But we don't go into any one event looking for it to be a significantly positive or negative event because we're on both sides, the Gen and the Retail. And we try to come out of that event, and we had a good performance at Elliot.
David Arcaro: Got it. That's great to hear. Obviously, a very tough event for a lot of generators. And then I was curious if you could just give an update on the margin deposits so far this year. Is there a level that you could give us as to what that currently stands at? I think you mentioned that it was kind of coming back in slower than expected. So curious if that's starting to improve.
Kris Moldovan: Yes. This is Kris. So as of the end of the fourth quarter we talked about, we had expected to start seeing margin deposits come back as we settled our – settled some of those hedges in the fourth quarter. With the volatility that continued on in the fourth quarter, especially in December, we actually saw margin deposits go up from September 30 through the end of the year. Over the past 1.5 months, prices and volatility have settled a little bit, and we are seeing some return of cash, and so – and we’ve also settled some additional hedges. So we are seeing cash come back in, and we do expect more cash to come in, in the near term and over the course of the year. And over the course of the year, we would expect a significant portion of the – over $3 billion of cash that we had posted to come back.
Operator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Jim, can we get your updated thoughts on capital allocation, share buybacks, et cetera, et cetera. On the Q2 call last year, you announced $1.25 billion in additional share buybacks that you're going to complete this year. But just can we get your latest thoughts there? And when should we -- from a timing perspective, when should us and investors be looking for an update in terms of your forward-looking share buyback plans?
Kris Moldovan: Durgesh, this is Kris. I appreciate the question. So when we did upsize the program in the middle of the year last year and that was in part as we were seeing increased opportunity for 2023 that we went ahead and added that increase into the middle of last year. So we added a $250 million. As we disclosed this morning, we ended up completing the first $2.25 billion approximately of the program by the end of the year. And as you know, we have a 3.25 upsize program that we said that would be by the end of this year. So that left $1 billion for 2023. And we had said that we thought share buybacks would be at least $1 billion starting in 2023 through 2026. We have also disclosed today that we have already, through February 23, executed another approximately $200 million. So that would leave approximately $800 million for the final 10 months of the year, which is consistent with going into the year, how we thought about it. We will -- as with same as last year, any changes to capital allocation, including share buybacks, we wouldn't likely consider those and talk to our Board about those until after we get through the important winter and summer months. So I'm not predicting any changes or updates as we had last year, but if there were to be any, that would probably come after we've gotten through a couple of the summer months.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. So back half of the year. And then my next question is on the nuclear fuel. I see sort of you kind of reiterated your nuclear fuel expense projections for 2023. Some of your peers are showing a pretty sizable ramp-up in nuclear fuel costs looking out in the future. Can you comment on that, please?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, it’s a good question. It’s one that we’re staying close to. We forward buy nuclear fuel, as you would expect. We buy the various components that allow us to have the fuel assemblies for our reloads. On a historical basis, we’ve seen it be somewhere around $5 a megawatt hour a fairly good estimate, if you were to take all of the capital costs and kind of spread them out over the megawatt hours of production. The team has been forward buying, and that’s why you saw a bigger CapEx number in ‘22. We have a bigger CapEx number in ‘23. Our best view of this is, as you spread that out over the time period in the 2025, 2026, that fuel cost is working its way up from $5 to just sub $6. So if you put that on a on Comanche Peak size unit, $1 is about a $20 million per year impact. So it’s not jumping to $6, just kind of migrating from a $5 cost on average historically to hedge. It's looking like it's going to be sub-$6, but heading towards $6 around that 2026 time frame. And so that gives you a sense that it is definitely on the upward trend, where there’ll be some domestic opportunities for supply down the road. That remains to be seen, but I think the team has done a very nice job of getting ahead of the nuclear fuel cost escalation and sourcing, and that gives you a kind of a range of magnitude as to how we’re managing through it.
Operator: Next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.
Angie Storozynski: So maybe a little bit more about Vistra Zero. So thank you for the additional slides. I'm just wondering, I mean it doesn't seem like the market is giving you any credit for that business. So if you could comment both on how you could extract some value from this business? And two, what's the long-term view on the profitability of this business? Or maybe as a percentage of total EBITDA, what do you think is going to come from that business? Again, any way to extract value.
Jim Burke: Sure. Angie, thank you. That's a very good question. Vistra Zero has been off to, in our view, a really strong start on the projects that we've got line of sight to. Right now, we did deliver the 3 that were in Texas in 2022, actually on time, on budget. Our focus right now is Moss 350, which will come online for this summer, which adds to the already large battery assembly of 400 megawatts, will become 750. And then we have 9 Coal to Solar projects in Illinois that were focused on the balance of this year and in 2024 to bring those on in late '24 and '25. What we've done, and you put all that together, Angie, you're still looking at about a $200 million to $250 million kind of EBITDA business. So on the basis of the 3.7, it's still not a sizable share, but it's a meaningful share. And what we've done in Texas, as you know, is we slowed down some of the merchant solar development because we've seen those returns be challenged based on not only EPC cost and panel costs, but solar is already starting to cannibalize solar in terms of price realization. So we would want to do additional solar under the right circumstances, which would likely be if it were contracted. So we slowed our process down at this point because we want to make sure that those projects make sense for us. As we stated since we announced Vistra Zero, we hold these options ourselves. They're not on a time constraint that if we don't exercise them, we lose them. And some of these sites, I think, can end up being more valuable through time as we see these interconnect queues are really hard to get through all over the country, and we own dozens and dozens of interconnect queues that we're not utilizing right now that we'd like to. So it is absolutely an option for us. I think you'll see that we will continue to grow this in a very deliberate way. But I think we've also tried to show discipline that we did not give you a headline megawatt number and just go pursue it regardless of returns. I think we've been very disciplined about the approach. And the market opportunity, clearly, with the Inflation Reduction Act is improving some of these returns even on the projects that we've already announced that are executing like Moss 350 and Coal to Solar. So I feel very good about our portfolio that we're executing on, but there is still uncertainty about the back half of the Vistra Zero portfolio and whether they can generate adequate returns. And if they do, we'll pursue it, and if they don't, then we're going to be disciplined and we'll wait because we still own the sites and have the options.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And there were questions about Comanche Peak. I'm looking at the size of your generation in Texas and your retail book. I mean, how core of an asset is it to serve your Retail load? And again, just judging by your multiple and comparable comps for nuclear plans, it seems like it would be an easy way to generate value by selling the assets. I'm just wondering how core of an asset is it for your generation-retail strategy?
Jim Burke: Dispatchable assets are core to serving Retail load. In fact, I think we have seen, and this is what Steve Muscato and his commercial team focus on every day is, can you serve Retail loads successfully, simply with renewables and batteries. And it’s a really tough – it’s a really tough effort to manage the risk around that. So dispatchable assets clearly are required to be successful with risk management on Retail. Comanche Peak itself, we talked about was the anchor tenant in Vistra Zero when we first announced Vistra Zero. Obviously, it’s got additional support from the production tax credit. We just obviously put in for the relicensing of it, and it operates at one of the lowest cost structures, if not the lowest cost structure, in the industry. So we do occasionally get inbounds from people that ask that question, Angie, and we are obviously interested in long-term value creation, but we like the Comanche Peak asset. It fits within our portfolio in Texas, given our sizable retail presence. and obviously, nuclear has been given a new level of interest given the Inflation Reduction Act, but we will always engage ideas. But in the core competencies of – we run plants well, we serve customers well, and we commercially risk manage the 2, I think it’s a core asset.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke: I just want to thank everybody for joining. I want to thank the hard-working team at Vistra for a strong 2022, and we have turned our attention, and we’re focused on delivering in 2023. So I hope everybody has a great morning. Look forward to talking to you again soon.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Vistra Third Quarter Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Meagan Horn. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing third quarter 2022 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available on the Investor Relations section of the company's website. Also today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slide two in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of these forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. We plan to keep this call relatively short. We believe we have a straightforward message to deliver today. In prior calls, we've shared with you our priorities for the year and today, we're here to share how we are successfully executing against those priorities and provide our view regarding 2023. Starting on slide five, we had another strong quarter financially earning $1.038 billion and ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Our generation team performed extremely well throughout the summer, but their performance was most on display during the high heat weather events experienced in July in the ERCOT region. For example, on one particular day in July when ERCOT experienced periods of low wind and solar output, we saw our Texas generation fleet operate at its max capacity. On this day, we saw prices hit the $5,000 price cap on three different hours. A well-maintained fleet is key to delivering reliable power for our customers and our communities and ensuring value is captured during these weather events and our generation team delivered. Our retail business similarly performed well showing its resiliency by demonstrating the ability to serve customers at attractive margins. Even in light of the higher commodity cost environment. Our retail team responded to our customer's needs, and our performance reflects our deep commitment to our customers. In fact, this commitment was recently acknowledged by the PCT when TXU Energy was recognized as a five-star rated retailer. With three quarters of performance now reported, we are able to narrow our previously announced guidance for ongoing operations, adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. We now see ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2.96 billion to $3.16 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $2.17 billion to $2.37 billion for 2022. We're reaffirming our original midpoint of $3.06 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for 2022. This has been a year with significant volatility and fuel prices and weather, in an environment of rising inflation, and yet our team is performing well in tracking at the original guidance provided last November. Due to our comprehensive hedging program to capture higher earnings in future periods, we have incurred some higher interest charges which is reflected in our modestly lower midpoint for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. This midpoint is now $2.27 billion. As we have discussed in the past, we took on additional short-term debt to fund the liquidity needed for our comprehensive hedging program. The hedges are locking in significant out-year earnings potential. That higher earnings power is reflected on slide six. Today we are initiating guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion for 2023. Our 2023 guidance midpoint of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $3.7 billion. This is the top end of the midpoint opportunity range we estimated for 2023 during our first quarter call, as we saw the dramatic increase in gas and power forward curves. Given the higher EBITDA figures and the volatility we have seen in the market, our range is larger on an absolute basis, but as a similar percentage of the midpoint as we have had in recent years. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this value proposition for 2023 and as you know, our comprehensive hedging program extends in the future years. With that I wanted to take a moment to reiterate Vistra's strategic priorities as we summarized on slide seven. We believe these priorities are delivering and are expected to continue to deliver significant value for investors. We previously stated that we saw annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA potential of around $3 billion going forward. As forward power curves increased, we announced Q1 2022 that we saw ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint potential in a $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range for years 2023 through 2025. We're now approximately 70% hedged on average across 2023 through 2025. Accordingly, we continue to believe in that range of earnings potential. And in turn, we're using significant cash flows to return value to the shareholders. Vistra continues to execute on our previously announced capital allocation plan and Chris will speak to those details momentarily. But notably, our capital allocation plan offers a robust returns per share. Looking forward to the target share repurchases and dividends under the capital allocation plan between now and year end 2023, we have $1.2 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases that we expect to utilize by year end 2023 plus $375 million in dividends targeted for payment Q4 2022 through Q4 2023. That capital distributed across our current shareholder base delivers an equivalent of approximately $4 per share of capital being returned. I recognize this as a simple illustration. I only point this out to underscore the incredible value proposition we believe Vistra currently offers. As a reminder, these expected cash returns are achieved even after we make the planned maintenance capital investments to ensure our fleet is well-positioned for the winter and the summer. This is also after we execute on our expected debt reduction to ensure a strong balance sheet. Lastly, we expect Vistra Zero to be financed primarily with third-party capital, enabling us to continue to transition aspects of our fleet, primarily some of our older coal assets in a capital efficient manner. Vistra Zero will also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, including setting a price floor for a nuclear asset Comanche peak. You may have seen we recently submitted the relicensing application which would extend our licenses by 20 additional years for each of the two units to 2050 and 2053. We continue to see how important a role our diverse set of assets are playing throughout the U.S. and ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable power. Our integrated model of delivering the service that our customers and communities depend upon, and we are excited to be able to share our expectations with you, our owners, that the future is bright for our company. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss this quarter's financial performance in more detail.
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, as Jim mentioned, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the third quarter with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.038 billion, including negative $2 million for retail and $1.04 billion for generation. It is important to note that Vistra's full year 2022 guidance contemplated that retail would deliver negative ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA this quarter. Despite rapidly rising power prices this year, retail's results this quarter and year-to-date are bolstered by continued strong margins and customer counts in ERCOT, along with robust large business market sales performance, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, and ex-ERCOT headwinds. Moving now to generation, the results of the generation segment this quarter and year-to-date have benefited from higher prices in the summer months coupled with outstanding performance of the fleet to be available to capture those higher prices, offset by lower prices in Q1 2022, lower generation volumes from coal plants due to industry-wide fuel delivery challenges, and higher than expected migration of customers to default service providers. With our financial results tracking consistently with our expectations, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan, as described on slide 10. As of November 1st, we had completed approximately $2.05 billion of share repurchases. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.2 billion of authorization under the upsized $3.25 billion program by year end 2023. Notably, as of November 1st, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 398 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 18% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding as of a year ago. We also remained committed to paying $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year. To that end, our Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.193 per share, or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on December 29thm 2022. This is an approximately 29% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we have not deviated from our long-term net leverage target, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. On our second quarter call, we noted that we expected to repay at least $2.5 billion in the second half of the year and we made significant progress this quarter, repaying approximately $1.4 billion of debt. We expect to repay an additional $1.1 billion of debt by year end. Finally, as we look to grow Vistra Zero, it is important to emphasize that we anticipate financing that growth by using primarily third-party capital. As Jim mentioned earlier, we have initiated guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. On slide 11, we're presenting the forward power price in gas curves as of October 31st, 2022. As you can see, while there has been noticeable volatility, prices are still up materially as compared to the prior year. Not only do these curves support our 2023 guidance range, but they also continue to give us confidence in the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for each of years 2024 and 2025. As you would expect, the commercial team has continued its execution of the comprehensive hedging program that we discussed initially on the first quarter earnings call, significantly derisking and locking in our future earnings potential for these out years. As of the end of the quarter, we were approximately 70% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 being approximately 90% hedged. On slide 12, we are providing a bit more detail around our 2023 guidance among our retail and generation segments. You may recall that last year, we also separately broke out our Sunset generation segment with several plants closing and 2022 in the very beginning of 2023 and moving from our Sunset segment to our asset closer segment, together with the growth of Vistra Zero, we are currently reevaluating the appropriate segments for our businesses. In light of that ongoing process, we have combined this Sunset segment with our other generation segments for 2023 guidance purposes only. We currently expect to finalize any segment changes by the time we share our first quarter 2023 results. I think it is worth reiterating execution has been and will continue to be our focus in 2022 and into 2023. Our first nine months have delivered strong results and we see our full year 2022 on track. We look forward to discussing our full year results on the next call. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Sullivan: Hey everyone. Good morning.
Jim Burke: Good morning.
Michael Sullivan: Hey Jim, Hey, Chris, I was just hoping maybe you could start with some color on some of the moving pieces relative to the last call. It seemed like 2022, you were tracking a little better than the midpoint, now at the midpoint; 2023, you're kind of, at the higher end of that range. So, maybe just a little more color on what kind of move between the two years from the last call is just commodity prices or anything else going on?
Jim Burke: Yes, sure, Michael. So, for 2022 we were tracking a little bit above midpoint when we talked last time. We see ourselves closer to midpoint at the moment. I think we've seen some headwinds with coal constraints that we assumed earlier in the year and even through the summer. We were getting some indication that coal deliveries we pick up. That has been a slower process, not just for us, but I think from everything we can tell, industry-wide. So, that's one of the headwinds. The other headwinds that we mentioned is we picked up some default service mode. We did on that load last year and even as late as early this year before the price ran up. As that -- as the market moved up in the spring, in the summer, customers have the opportunity to move to default service, that's their choice. In addition to that there was one media aggregation in OPEC, that actually in mass moved all their customers to default service. We're not sure that that actually was provided for in the structure of the default service, but it was approved by the Commission in Ohio, those headwinds that have developed even further since our last call. So, when we look at the year, we've been able to offset those. So, we have had very good performance on the retail business, a good performance with the summer as we mentioned in the script, and so we had length, we were able to cover those headwinds, and I think the integrated model shows diversification paid off. But I think that's really the driver as to why we saw ourselves tracking slight above midpoint before, and now we see it on midpoint. But the operational excellence of the fleet in the retail business has been quite strong. And as it relates to 2023, some of the default service carries over into May -- through the May time frame and we also had to recognize that the coal constraints has been a rolling issue. So, we have just modest improvement now assumed in 2023 for coal deliveries. We're still not running everything that we could run from the coal fleet even in the 2023 plan. So, I think there's a little bit of conservatism and it's just something we've learned throughout this year that, it's a tough market. It's a tough challenge just to -- to basically free up the supply chain and have the train sets running and the quantity and the cycle times that we would like. So, we reflected that here. And I think the upper end $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, we mentioned that on our first week call in May, and we're at the upper end of that midpoint. And so we feel good about being able to weather this volatility. But those are the headwinds and some of the tailwinds that we've reflected now in this guidance.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. That's super helpful. And then my next question was just as we look out to 2024, 2025, it seemed like previously given a bigger un-hedged position, you help maybe even better out there and just latest thoughts on how you're feeling since the Q2 call?
Jim Burke: Yeah. On slide 11, you see the direction of the curves, and we've tried to, we knew when we put this out, the first week we made that we'd be asked for continuous updates on this. So we added potentially our disclosure on a more consistent basis now for the third call. But you see the run up late spring and summer, and then you see it coming back off pretty hard, we had been hedging through that period. And I think that's the value of the comprehensive hedging program. So, we were a little bit more bullish about where we saw things. Obviously, when you're in the middle of the summer and the curves were peaking and you had the un-hedged position. We were able to hedge through some of that, but the curves have come off, and we are actually still through this chart showing that through October 31 curves, which is certainly much lower than where they were at the peak of the summer, because we've increased our hedge percentage now to 70% across the years, we still feel good about the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. So, again, it's a predictable set of cash flows as far as we can see. We obviously aren't fully hedged. But I think we haven't been trying to time the high and the low. We've been working through this and I think showing that $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is still there and our expectations for 2024 and 2025 is a sign of that integrated model working.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. That's great. And just real quick, the last one, again, kind of back to the bridge to 2023, what are the positives on the retail side, if I just look at kind of where you are year-to-date, something like $564 million and then the range for next year, it's kind of close to $1 billion. Yeah. What are the tailwinds there that could be up for next year?
Jim Burke: Yeah, we continue -- one of the things we've been able to do this year, which has been a benefit for customers is we forward by, obviously, as you'd expect, in our retail business because our customers expect predictable pricing. And so we've seen our rates move up on existing customers, on average, about 10% this year. So in the aggregate of the inflationary effects and even the price spikes of commodities, I think we've done a nice job smoothing that out for our customer base. As you look at what's going on when you move forward, we do have continued movement in our expectations on average of how we smooth out the prices for customers. So we have even greater margin realization as we go forward, which is a tailwind. We also are seeing -- we've had great margin management this year. We see that continuing. The count story has been very good at ERCOT and that continues. And even our Midwest, Northeast business, which has been more challenged because of the default service, price is lagging the same topic I just mentioned about the fault service migration. It makes it difficult for retail businesses to compete against that. We see that improving in the Midwest, Northeast improving next year as well. So, retail business is in a very good position. It's having a very good year this year, and we expect that to continue to improve. We also have a little bit less retail bill credits that we have as post yearly effect where we have no credits for settling large customers. We have less of that in 2023 versus 2022. So those are the key drivers of the improvement in that business.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Jim. Appreciate all the color.
Operator: The next question will come from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jim Burke: Hi, Paul.
Paul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the update. A lot to pick through, to start out with, could you discuss the drivers on the 2023 free cash flow conversion, I know you had a 65% target at the Analyst Day in the past. So just curious is kind of 2023 a blip and do we get back there in the future?
Jim Burke: Yeah. Paul, the free cash flow conversion from a historical standpoint, we've obviously seen revenues go up because we have inflation that's affected some of the raw commodities. Some of that also affects our cost of doing business, including our CapEx assumption. So we have more outages next year. It's actually just a function of the starts of the units and the run hours. So we have more outages planned for actually '23 and '24, and that's predictable. We can see that peak in 2023 and 2024, and then it comes off for the next three to four years. So we have higher CapEx, and some of the CapEx is more expensive because of the inflation drivers. We also have more interest expense that's a function of our comprehensive hedging program. You can see some of those drivers, obviously, in the back of the release in terms of some of the reconciliations between our EBITDA and our free cash flow. Obviously, the inflation does affect the revenue line, but it does affect some of the cost drivers as I just mentioned interest rates. We have more borrowings at this point, and we have slightly higher interest that's un-hedged that we have. But we do have some interest rate swaps in place as well. But those are the key drivers. And Kris, if there's something you'd like to add there, please?
Kris Moldovan: No, Jim, I think you've covered the driver as well.
Paul Zimbardo: Thanks. Okay. Great. And then separately, I know you're running a lot of promotions in Texas over the summer. Could you just discuss what you've seen on kind of retail customer attrition? And just unpacking a little bit. It looks like customer count was down quarter-over-quarter and you talked about like value-accretive exits, if you could just elaborate a little bit there? Thank you.
Jim Burke: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. The retail market in Texas is a robust market. We have done extremely well this year. Part of it is the innovation that you mentioned. We've been able -- in fact, we rolled out an EV miles program just this week. We have a lot of those flexibilities in Texas because the retailer gets to do the billing. We get to design the products that customers are looking for, and that gives us a chance to differentiate. And our accounts have actually been very strong in ERCOT, and we've seen ourselves hold, I think, this position of a trusted brand and that is one of the positives from 2022 going into 2023. These exits that have occurred in other markets are a function of the fact that some of these other market designs. They still don't let the retailer do the billing, but still competing against default rates. And those default rates lag, like we've seen a lag this year in particular, it becomes unprofitable to stay in some of these markets. And so you end up in these boom bust cycles. In fact, I think the default markets could end up seeing peak pricing, and then you'll see the retailers rush back in and pull these customers off default. So there were two things happened. On New York, we actually left the New York market because the regulatory scheme you had to offer a discount to the default rate. So that became untenable once the default rate is not moving and you have to offer a discount to that, it becomes unprofitable is unfortunate, because it was a very good customer base. But we have to look at this and be realistic that if the market design is not there to be able to recover your cost, you need to exit. Connecticut was a different story prior to our acquisition of Crius. There was concern from the regulatory body about some of the bill disclosures and when contract term would end for customers, they wanted to see us settle that matter. And one of the terms of settlement was, they asked us to give up our licenses in Connecticut. It's happened before we ever got the business. It seemed shortsighted from the standpoint that the customer impact wasn't even determined to necessarily be negative. It was a question about how clear was the disclosure around the termination of a contract plan, but as I mentioned earlier, if you're competing against default rates, and you do not have the ability to differentiate your product with the customer. You're essentially a line item on a bill and you're competing on price and that's a difficult proposition. So we have to work to change the mindset of some of these marketplaces to be able to open them up to differentiation. I do think other brands entering the space like Tesla, Shell, BP, can help bring other voices to the table. I think a lot of this is the follow on to the polar vortex in 2014, where there was a lot of concern about how retailers needed to try to recover their cost and prices were moving very, very quickly. And we've got to restore confidence in some of these other markets outside of Texas to be able to differentiate like we do here.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: And the final question for today will come from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just, first, one follow-up on the free cash flow projections. It's actually for both 2022 and 2023. I think I'm a little bit confused about working capital changes and new collateral postings. I'm assuming that collateral is coming back. So I was actually hoping for some boost to free cash flow in 2023. So again, maybe if you could talk both about collateral postings and the free cash flow projection?
Kris Moldovan : Yes, Angie, thanks for the question. So we do expect the collateral to be posted as you can -- as you saw, we just -- we have just over $3 billion of cash still posted as of 9/30. We expect a significant amount of that to come back over the balance of the year and into 2023. What you would note though is the margin deposits and working capital, we don't -- that doesn't get reflected in our adjusted free cash flow number. So it's below that line. But we do expect over the next 14 months to receive a substantial portion of the cash that $3 billion that we have to return to us. And that's factored into our capital allocation discussions as far as the amount of share repurchases that we plan, the dividends and the debt repayments.
Angie Storozynski : Okay. So what's the reason why there is this big positive from working capital perspective this year and basically offsetting negative next year?
Jim Burke: I think, Angie, what we're seeing in the disclosures from the EBITDA to free cash flow is that we are seeing obviously, from EBITDA to free cash flow, we see some drivers through CapEx and interest expense. We are expecting the return of working capital and margin deposits net through 2023 and we'll see that as part of our capital allocation, as Kris mentioned, with our share buybacks or dividends and obviously, our debt pay down.
Angie Storozynski : Okay. Okay. And then secondly, on the guidance, right, for 2023. So you were 90% hedged, and I appreciate all the volatility that you're seeing in energy markets. But that's quite a wide range. So can you just give me a sense, for example, what is it that you're trying to hedge against? Is it, as you mentioned, some issues with the call supplies, is the performance issues of your power plants? Again, just what can take me to the high end versus the low end?
Jim Burke: Yes. Sure. Well, there's a number of things. Even the 90% still has quite a bit at elevated prices that unhedged part is still a meaningful part of the various drivers. We also assume that there's volatility in the marketplace, and that volatility is something we can capture, and that's what we did over the month of July when we had higher prices, tighter supply demand. We saw that some in PJM. We obviously saw it a little bit in CAISO. So we assume that there's an element of volatility in the marketplace and that we can capture some of that, either because prices move up and we're able to capture that incremental output at a higher margin. Or if prices actually move down, we can actually not run the assets and buy back in the marketplace. And that's sort of what we call extrinsic value is part of the value that we anticipate when we set guidance. So that's part of the expectations that we said when we put the $3.7 billion out in the market. We also have some assumption. I said it's modest of coal being able to be delivered slight improvement over 2022 actuals. It could still move south from here. I mean, we do not know how all of this is going to get resolved. They're still in negotiation. They're trying to get the rail agreement that would work for all of the unions involved. But we don't have perfect foresight into how that will play out. That also could be a positive. We can actually get past that and get to the sense that we already have security to get the cycle times where they need to be, that would be upside potentially to our guidance. And then lastly, we still have weather variance even in retail. We do hedge retail conservatively and have paid off for our customer base this year. It's paid off for our retail performance. But if you had mild weather, you could actually find yourself long power in the retail business and having to sell that back in the market at reduced prices. And so when prices get elevated, then the variances around and volumetrically become bigger on a dollar basis. That's why we kept about an 8% band around the midpoint similar to prior years, just larger on an absolute basis.
Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then lastly, again, I might have missed it in your in your pack -- in your slides. I was hoping for more disclosures on cash available for distributions and drivers year-over-year. And I appreciate some of the comments you have made in your prepared remarks. But should we expect something like that like cash available for distribution, so we have a better sense of how much can be deployed into either additional buybacks and/or dividends?
Kris Moldovan : Yes, Angie. So thank you, again. We continue to talk about being able and in position to spend $300 million a year on the dividend and $1 billion -- at least $1 billion a year on share repurchases and paying down debt to get to three times, which primarily, we can get there, as you can see, as working capital comes back -- as margin positives come back, we could use that money to pay down debt. We also still have some proceeds from the green preferred to allocate. But we're tracking well right at where we thought we would track when we came out with that cash available for allocation last year in November. We did upsize the share repurchases by $250 million to reflect some confidence in additional free cash flow. We'll continue to evaluate as we move through the time period. And as we have additional cash to allocate what's the best use of that cash. But we're still committed to at least $1 billion a year of share repurchases and the $300 million dividend and getting our leverage to three times -- just under three times.
Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Burke for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Jim Burke: Yes, I want to thank you again for joining us this morning. We're excited about Vistra's continued value proposition, and we appreciate your continued interest investor, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months when we will discuss our fourth quarter and our full year performance. Have good morning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Q2 2022 Vistra Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing second quarter 2022 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Jim Burke, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to our new CEO, Jim Burke, to kick off our discussion.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. I am excited and eager to talk with all of you as I take on this new role for Vistra. Over the past few months, I've been asked what I envision for Vistra's path forward. Accordingly, turning to Slide 5, before I discuss our second quarter results, I would first like to reinforce a few of my thoughts on Vistra's strategic direction and top priorities. I continue to remain confident in our short-term and long-term value proposition precisely because we intend to remain focused on the 4 key strategic priorities we initially defined in the third quarter of 2021. As we've shared in the past, Vistra is well positioned for the long term during this energy transition. In addition to ensuring that our customers and our communities have the power they need, our integrated approach enables us to deliver strong financial and operational performance, particularly in volatile commodity environments through the operational excellence and expertise of our generation retail and commercial teams. As part of this integrated business, we are continuing to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy that we announced last quarter, which is locking in significant future year earnings potential. This effort is supported by a high-performing generation team and a customer-focused retail team experienced in managing counts, margins and customer experience, and both teams are supported by a strong commercial team that captures market opportunities and manages risk in a dynamic marketplace. Second, it is fundamental to a business that manages through volatile commodity markets to have the financial flexibility to hedge both fuel procurement and power sales for our fleet and for customers. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and an ample liquidity position. As Kris will cover later, we anticipate paying down a significant amount of debt in the second half of this year as our 2022 hedges settle and the corresponding cash collateral is returned. At year-end, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 3x based on the range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA we expect in 2023. Third, we are delivering on our capital allocation plan that prioritizes a significant return of capital to our shareholders through 2026. We remain committed to paying aggregate dividends of approximately $300 million per year with the per share amount increasing as we repurchase our shares. We continue to believe that share repurchases provide an efficient, attractive means to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $2 billion share repurchase program on an accelerated basis, having completed approximately 80% to date and expect to complete the balance before year-end. Accordingly, we're pleased to announce that our Board has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion for share repurchases effective immediately, which brings our cumulative authorization to $3.25 billion and the remaining amount available for repurchases to approximately $1.65 billion. We expect to complete the full authorization by the end of 2023. As we deliver on our earnings potential, we will revisit the size of the share repurchase program on a regular basis. Finally, we've made great progress on the build-out of our Vistra Zero platform, which we expect to grow primarily by utilizing cost-effective third-party capital. I'll speak to updates on Vistra Zero in more detail momentarily. I am committed to the execution of our strategic priorities as I firmly believe that our successful execution of these priorities will enable Vistra to deliver sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Now turning to Slide 6 for our second quarter results. We achieved $761 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Our Retail segment grew ERCOT residential customer counts in the quarter and year-over-year. In fact, our flagship TXU Energy brand had its best quarter residential counts performance in nearly 15 years while achieving our target margins in a dynamic market. This highlights our expertise as an integrated energy company to acquire and retain customers through volatile and high-priced commodity cycles. Our unique product offerings and multi-brand and channel strategy, combined with our commercial team's expertise in managing risk, drove this success. Our Generation segment similarly performed above expectations, achieving commercial availability of 95%, a strong performance, especially considering the unseasonably warmer weather experienced in Texas in the second quarter. The teams worked diligently to perform regular maintenance on an expedited basis and in some cases, truncated schedules to ensure the plants were available to the grid during the heatwaves experienced in the latter half of the second quarter. We are reaffirming today our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We don't typically update current year guidance until our third quarter earnings discussion, but favorable weather and strong performance in our Generation and Retail segments provide increased confidence that our 2022 outlook is tracking above the midpoint of guidance. Of course, the remaining summer months are important across the country for us, so we are focused on proactively maintaining our fleet during times of lower demand to avoid unplanned outages as much as possible. We understand that execution is key to delivering the full value we believe possible in this environment. Turning to Slide 7. As we discussed in the first quarter, we are currently experiencing a highly favorable pricing environment. We've used this opportunity to continue to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy we previously discussed. As a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, Vistra is now over 60% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025 with 2023 now hedged at approximately 80%. Last quarter, we stated that given the marks as of April 29, we anticipated a risk-adjusted midpoint opportunity in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for the years 2023 through 2025. Curves moved up considerably in May and early June before coming off in late June with the drop in natural gas prices. For 2023, when comparing where we were as of April 29 and rolling that forward to July 29, overall, the curves are in a similar place despite the volatility we've seen over the past 3 months. However, for 2024 and 2025 since April 29, as the graphs indicate, both power and gas curves have continued moving up. As our hedge percentages have increased, our confidence in this earnings potential has grown. And more than that, we continue to believe this range could be on the conservative side. Of course, given that we are not fully hedged, there remains a significant range around this earnings potential, especially in '24 and '25. Looking ahead, assuming the forward curves continue to hold or improve, you can expect us to continue to execute on this comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in more value while maintaining sufficient generation length as insurance against the unforeseen. As discussed last quarter, our hedging strategy requires ample liquidity for collateral postings, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident, and we can execute this hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. Kris will go into more detail on our liquidity management activities later in the call. Turning now to Slide 8. I wanted to provide a brief update on our Vistra Zero growth trajectory and how we are positioning Vistra to capitalize on this significant opportunity. This past quarter, we returned both phases of our Moss Landing energy storage facility to service with over 98% of its maximum capacity on the expected schedule and ahead of California's hot summer months. We successfully restored and addressed root cause concerns during this timeframe, and we anticipate the final few megawatts to be restored by the fall. In addition, we began construction on the 350-megawatt Phase III expansion of our Moss Landing facility, which we expect to be online by June 2023. In Illinois, we bid in a competitive process. And in May, we were selected by the Illinois Power Agency to provide over 460,000 annual renewable energy credits, or RECs, over the course of 20 years. The contracted sale of these RECs will serve to provide stability of the revenue streams of our coal to solar projects. In June, we were also awarded energy storage grants at our Joppa, Havana and Edwards sites to be received over 10 years. We expect to bring our Illinois projects online in the 2024 timeframe ahead of the required dates for the awarded contracts. Finally, our development projects in Texas continued to make great progress as well. In April, we announced that our 50-megawatt solar facility Brightside was online. This was followed by announcement in May that our 260-megawatt energy storage facility at DeCordova was online. And in June, our 108-megawatt ERCOT solar facility, Emerald Grove, was online. We now have 608 megawatts for Vistra Zero online of solar and energy storage serving the ERCOT grid. In addition, of course, to our Comanche Peak nuclear facility. Our teams did an excellent job of delivering these projects in Texas as well as returning Phases 1 and 2 of our most Moss Landing facility to normal operation in California. Some of our early-stage projects that we are evaluating are facing potential impacts from supply chain constraints and inflation. We prudently reevaluate the business cases of these projects on a regular basis. For example, we have reassessed the timing of certain ERCOT solar projects, and we will move ahead with these projects only if we have confidence in the returns. Since we own these sites and we have the flexibility on timing, this is something we expect to remain dynamic. We are excited about the pipeline and the growth potential of achieving 7.3 gigawatts in Vistra Zero generation online by 2026, but we are also going to remain disciplined on the projects. Of course, in light of the newly introduced Inflation Reduction Act, it is possible that our Vistra Zero development projects could see enhanced returns. It is certainly a dynamic time in the marketplace and Vistra is extremely well positioned with both a strong outlook on our core generation and retail businesses, but also with Vistra Zero. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris Moldovan, our recently named CFO, to discuss the quarter's financial performance and our capital allocation progress in more detail. Many of you already know Kris well and his track record of successfully driving shareholder value for Vistra, and as of late, his active and effective management of our liquidity position. As background, he practiced as an attorney for over a decade, including gaining significant experience through representing clients in merger and acquisition activity as well as complex financing transactions. Kris has been with Vistra and its predecessor for 16 years and joined the finance team in 2010, where he has focused on some of the most complex financial transactions in our industry. I've had the privilege to work with Kris for many years and could attest personally to his insights and capabilities, and I'm very much looking forward to partnering with him as we take Vistra forward in these exciting times of transition and growth. Kris?
Kris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be in the new role and representing Vistra on the call today. While I have met many of the participants on the call in my previous role as the Treasurer of the company, I look forward to getting to know everyone and spending time with each of you in the coming months. I'll turn now to Slide 10. As Jim noted earlier, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $761 million, which was above management's expectations. Retail ended the quarter at $403 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. And while this result is $107 million lower than second quarter 2021, it is important to note that this difference is more than accounted for by the amount of onetime self-help initiatives we undertook in the second quarter of 2021 to offset some of the losses we experienced in the preceding quarter. Retail performance this quarter was favorably impacted by warmer weather, strong margins and exceptional residential customer count growth in Texas. Moving to Generation. Our collective Generation segments ended the quarter with $358 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. This result was approximately $14 million above our second quarter 2021 results after adjusting second quarter 2021 to remove the earnings attributable to Zimmer and Joppa, which are now reported in the Asset Closure segment. This increase was driven primarily by favorable prices we experienced in the quarter offset by the ongoing coal constraints the industry continues to experience as well as onetime benefits of self-help initiatives executed in the second quarter of 2021. Finally, turning to Slide 11. Our strong financial results allow us to continue to favorably execute our capital allocation plan. Specifically, as of August 2, 2022, we have executed approximately $1.6 billion of the original $2 billion authorization, repurchasing approximately 70.5 million shares or approximately 14.6% of the shares that were outstanding as of November 2021. Since we expect to execute the remaining portion of the $2 billion authorization before year-end 2022, as Jim noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion of share repurchases effective immediately. As such, we have approximately $1.65 billion of aggregate remaining availability for share repurchases under the upsized $3.25 billion authorization, which we expect to execute between now and the end of 2023. Additionally, the Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.184 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on September 30, 2022. This is an approximately 23% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2021. While we are focused on returning capital to our shareholders, we remain steadfastly committed to balance sheet strength, targeting a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x, excluding any nonrecourse debt we raised at Vistra Zero. This year, however, the material increase in forward power prices for the balance of 2022 through 2025, taken together with our increased forward hedging activities to lock in those prices, has resulted in significant increases in our collateral posting obligations and required liquidity to support these obligations. As such, we have actively worked to increase our available liquidity, including issuing $1.5 billion of short-term senior secured notes, in addition to increasing the aggregate commitments under our corporate revolver by $725 million and increasing the aggregate commitments under our commodity-linked revolver by $250 million. As a result of these proactive transactions, we have significantly increased our available liquidity which was approximately $4.5 billion as of August 3. Looking forward, as we deliver power against our hedges over the balance of 2022, we expect to see a material return of collateral including a significant amount of the cash we had posted at June 30. To that end, we anticipate repaying more than $2.5 billion of debt by year-end, including debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Of course, we must continue to prudently balance the timing of these debt repayments against the liquidity needed to support our hedging program. In addition to repaying debt, we will continue to monitor and optimize the amount and sources of liquidity necessary to support our existing hedges as well as any additional hedges we may execute over time. We said we would focus on execution in 2022 and the efforts of our generation retail and commercial teams in the first 6 months have positioned us well for a successful year. We remain focused on our strategic priorities and look forward to discussing third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2022 and for 2023 on our next call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jim for a brief wrap-up.
Jim Burke: Kris, very much and congratulations on the new role. Turning to Slide 12, to recap a few key points. First, our integrated model is uniquely positioned to capture long-term value in these dynamic conditions, and we are comprehensively hedging and have locked in over 60% of this value for the period of 2023 to 2025. We believe we have ample liquidity and balance sheet strength to execute this strategy. Our confidence in our outlook is reinforced by the upsizing of the share repurchase program to $3.25 billion, and we continue to return capital through this program and our $300 million annual dividend. Finally, we have made great progress by bringing online over 400 megawatts in new assets in Texas this spring with Vistra Zero while restoring Moss Landing battery operations in California. With our Illinois coal to solar contracts and other pipeline projects, we are excited about our ability to decarbonize our fleet and grow our business. We are tracking ahead of our 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030 for our fleet, and we anticipate Vistra Zero will more than replace the earnings of the retiring coal units and we are doing this with cost-efficient capital. This is an exciting time for Vistra, and we are well positioned for this energy transition to deliver long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shah Pourreza: So let me just ask more of a top level and maybe we could start sort of with the capital allocation announcement. It's, obviously, a bit earlier than we expected, but that's a good problem to have. How should we be thinking about the cadence of future updates given the move here? Could we start to see more off-cycle announcements as free cash flow generation for the next 3 years is increasingly locked in with the hedges? I guess what do you mean by “revisit” on a regular basis? And have you and the Board thought about potentially allocating everything you've locked in through '25 all at once?
Jim Burke: Shar, there's a lot in that question. Let me first start with the idea that we are just past the halfway point 2022 and we feel good about where 2022 is trending. We were working through the buyback program in a fairly expeditious manner. And our next call, obviously, would be early November. So we thought, given where we're tracking in '22, plus the incremental hedging that we've been able to do for '23 through '25, our confidence level was higher. We wanted to keep the momentum in the market from a return to capital standpoint. So we felt comfortable asking for the authorization and the Board was obviously comfortable approving it as a sign that the earnings power of this business has taken a material step up since early this year when we saw the curve start to rise in April. As far as the frequency of it, I think it's a function of a number of factors. It's a function of what are the market opportunities from the capital standpoint that we could deploy in the base business. We are obviously always even looking for upgrades in our own units, where we can bring in incremental megawatts, for instance, in ERCOT. We've operated some of our units to capture some of the prices that we saw this summer. So there's -- on the margin, there's opportunities to deploy on the base business small amounts of capital. Vistra Zero is obviously something that could accelerate some with the IRA that we're talking about here. But I think the main thesis, which is as we get a line of sight to these cash flows, the 60% is still well hedged, but there's still plenty that's not hedged. As that confidence builds, we could continue to update the capital return strategy, and that was the point we tried to make in our comments, and I think we have to just see how the market curves and follow from this point forward in tandem with our hedging strategy.
Shah Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And just on your hedging real quick, I guess, obviously, the backdrop is really strong. There's some perpetuity to it. I guess, why aren't you just hedging everything at this point? Is it just that you can't give the liquidity out in ‘25, fuel hedging, maybe just a bit of a fundamental view here.
Jim Burke: Sure. I think you hit a couple of the key points, Shar. The market depth is not as great, clearly, out in 2025 as it is in '23. The liquidity that we have, while it is ample, it does take more liquidity in reserve to be able to hedge that far out. And so you can imagine we've got sort of a downward sloping hedge percentage where ‘23 is hedged higher as we said, over 80%. '24 is less than that and then '25 is less than that. It's also we do tandem hedging, where we want to make sure that we've got the fuel to back up the hedging for our generation assets and some of the fuel procurement out that far in certain regions is not as deep. And so we take all that into consideration. And also, we're not sure in some of these that full value are still realized. These curves have moved up in '24, '25, but there may still be some room to run. And so it's okay for us to have a little bit of exposure to that, too.
Shah Pourreza: Got it. And then lastly, Jim, for me is one of your peers recently mentioned that they were considering maybe contracting for new build gas in ERCOT, right? I guess do you agree the market needs more? Do you guys have a fundamental view, I guess, over the next 5 years in Texas. The CDR says one thing, but the real-time markets says another.
Jim Burke: Yes. Shar, great question. That's actually hitting on the bigger topic about ERCOT market reform and how is ERCOT going to sufficiently incentivize not only the potential for new assets to come online that are dispatchable, be it thermal or battery, but also retain the assets that actually has, on the grid that were needed multiple times from May through July. I think as the market and the CDR indicates more interment resources, are clearly in the queue, and they've been coming in a fairly robust fashion. But that means that all the other assets are dispatching at times against marginal cost assets that could be dispatching at 0 or even negative prices. So I think ERCOT reform is going to have to consider how does the revenue mechanism for dispatchable assets have a factor that considers their availability and their reliability. And that may be a payment mechanism that suffer in the part can simply redispatch for energy purposes. That hadn't been figured out yet. And so I do think there's a worry that the only thing that has the incentives and that’s primarily because of federal incentives to be built are more of the intermittent resources. And I think policymakers are focused and interested in having the reliability that the dispatchable assets bring. That's the focus of the study that the consultant is doing on behalf of the Public Utility Commission. We believe that there needs to be a focus on reliability. There's been a lot of focus on the transition from an environmental and emission standpoint, but in many places around the country, the reliability aspect has not been the key area of focus. I think Texas is focused on that, and Texas wants to solve this. That might incentivize some thermal generation. But without that incentive, it is hard to see that penciling now in our analysis. And so potentially with market reform, that might be something that would work.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman : Yes. I want to echo congratulations, Jim and Kris. So just on the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range, '23 to '25. Is that an average over the 3 years? Or is that a range you expect each year?
Jim Burke: So that is an average, Steve. And similar to the last call we had, what we see is we're more hedged in the early part of that period, and we're less hedged obviously in the latter part. So even though on an absolute basis, the curves aren't as high and say '25, '23. Once you consider the relative hedge ratios, they actually end up being pretty similar.
Steve Fleishman : Okay. So just I guess my next question was just going to be the shaping of the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, '23, '24, '25. It sounds like based on what you said, it's kind of similar each year?
Jim Burke: It is. Now, the good news is that '24 and '25 have continued to run on fine as that shape doesn't look flatter. We're more locked for '23, so we won't capture probably as much upside if '23 were to continue to run. Or the '24, '25 were to then we could absolutely see still upside in that slope actually shifting more to upward.
Steve Fleishman : Okay. That makes sense. Is it fair to assume for '24, '25, you're using forward curves as they are right now for the open positions in those years? Or are you are cutting some just because --
Jim Burke: So yes, so we're using curves of [7 29] as we refresh this analysis. We have to take into some consideration, Steve, some of the unknowns. I mean we assume that some factors like coal constraints would have worked their way out more by 2025 and potentially the balance of '22 and '23. So we have done, and we said this risk adjustment, we have taken into account some risk adjustments as we think about this. That's why we think the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is conservative. So we still have a decent open position out there. So it can go the other way, right? That's why we feel like hedging makes sense. That's why we like the opportunity to keep ample liquidity. But yes, this is a conservative view on a risk-adjusted basis.
Steve Fleishman : Yes. All right. That makes a ton of sense. And then just on the IRA aside from potentially improving returns for your renewables opportunities? Any other broad thoughts on implications for Vistra as it passes?
Jim Burke: Yes. I think there are some. I think obviously, the most immediate ones would be on the renewables piece and the stand-alone batteries. More than 50% of our Vistra Zero opportunity set is storage related, and that was not attached to solar, in most cases to solar. So standalone battery ITC is meaningful for us. On carbon capture, we have some assets that could be good candidates. That's a little bit further out to be able to get the technology, but certainly, the economic incentives could be there, and we've got some attractive assets that could be coal or gas that could be candidates for carbon capture. And then the hydrogen piece, obviously, with the nuclear facility, with Comanche Peak. You've got not only the hydrogen incentive, but the production tax credit, which at today's curves looks a little bit more like it provides a floor support. I wouldn't consider it in the near-term incremental EBITDA, but it certainly helps provide a floor that's a lot higher than where the floor was in 2018, where we were looking at forward curves in the mid-$25 to $27 range for as far as the eye can see. So even if the floor is $40 to $44, that's a much more attractive place to put a anchor for a large carbon-free asset like Comanche Peak. So that's how we think about the IRA.
Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then one last quick question on retail. Very strong quarter for you in terms of customer growth and the like. Could you just maybe give a little bit more flavor on the competitive dynamics you're seeing in retail in Texas?
Jim Burke: Yes, you bet. And I'll kick it off, Steve, and then I'd like Scott Hudson to comment here in a second. We have had a really good run in the ERCOT retail business for well over a year now. And the second quarter was really strong, as you noted. We tend to do really well. If you go back over the 20 years, when curve start to move up rapidly, and there's a lot of volatility, our value proposition to our customers really shine because we forward buy sometimes the hedging and folks would like to see a more open position. But part of our hedging strategy is selling from generation to retail and retail being able to lock in a good price for that -- for the customer base. A lot of our competitors aren't doing that. So our customers were seeing year-over-year, when inflation for gasoline was up 50% and even doubling, we're seeing our revenue rates over the quarter-over-quarter in the 8% to 10% increase rate. So that's a real value proposition for our customers. So our retention was excellent and then our acquisition with new products that we've announced heading into this hot summer which has been really well received, is something I'd like Scott to comment on because it is a product innovation and a channel strategy. It isn't just a game of oil pricing, but I think the platform that we have of stability for customers is really attractive in these periods, and it's showing up in the customer count. Scott?
Scott Hudson: Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, Steve. A little bit about market dynamics that we're seeing -- the market was extremely active in the quarter, first of all, with new transactions being up by about 19%, and then we're -- to capture more of that market activity. We also saw a tremendous amount of leads coming into our call centers and our digital properties, which, as Jim mentioned, I think, really speaks to the effectiveness of the marketing. And in times of volatility customers that might be on a less-known brand really come to brands that they know and trust and TXU Energy clearly falls in that category. And then lastly, as Jim mentioned, we're really known for offering first of a kind mass market product offers and the market we had -- the product we had in market this summer was called Ultimate Summer Pass. And it's a seasonal discount product that gives you percentage off during the summer and because it was so hot that particular product just really resonated with the consumers. But we have a lot of proven capabilities in terms of analytics and marketing and channel strategies, but it really is just a focus on the customer experience and how we really try to be consultative with our customers and help them find the right product and the right plan, and it's really all contributed to our success. But again, thanks for the question.
Jim Burke: Steve, I would just wrap with Scott's comment by just adding that these gains are some of the best gains we've seen in 14, 15 years. Competition has kind of winnowed a bit in terms of number of competitors because the balance sheet and the hedging requirements and the volatility make this a difficult business to just be standalone. And I think this is another case where the integrated model has really been able to show its effectiveness.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro : Maybe I have a quick follow-up on the inflation Reduction Act. Any thoughts on the minimum tax and whether that could impact cash flow going forward?
Jim Burke: I'll comment, and then I'll ask Kris to say a few words. It could. Not in the near term. We don't see anything. We still carry losses from Yuri. And so -- this is going to be something that for book purposes, it's going to take a while to work out of. And so it would down the road, as we think about what is our federal tax exposure, it could increase it. But it's not a near-term kind of in immediate vicinity of our planning horizon, but I'm going to let Kris comment further.
Kris Moldovan: Thanks, Jim. I think that's right. Given the fact of the losses during Yuri and those book losses, we don't see throughout the entirety of our planning horizon that coming into play. We will continue to monitor it. But it's not -- as Jim said, it's not a near-term effect on us.
David Arcaro : Okay. Great. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then there's been a lot of focus on operations, just given how tight the ERCOT market has been. Wondering if you could just comment on kind of the current health of your fleet in ERCOT, how comfortable you're feeling as we head into August. And whether there is just still kind of maintenance work that you're trying to chip away at or just how -- what the current state of the fleet is right now?
Jim Burke: David, thank you. Great question. First of all, I'm going to tell you about how we have performed, and I hope that doesn't jinx our performance going forward because it is a tough business. And I can't get into the specific details of the financial impacts, but I can tell you from a reliability standpoint, the fleet performed exceptionally well, particularly in July, which was a critical period. The men and women that are out there in these conditions, making these units operate at the level of effectiveness that they have is really just a tremendous, tremendous effort, and there were times, I'm sure you were following where basically every megawatt was needed on the grid to keep the system with a minimum operating level of reserves. So the fleet is in good shape. It remains in good shape. We tend to take some periods on the weekends to come down for some assets to do minor repairs to make sure they're ready to go. And of course, we use our weather -- our weather forecasting as well as coordinating with ERCOT with advanced notice to let them know what our intentions are, and that has been very helpful so that we're able to do the maintenance that we need. I will say in some other parts of the country in July in PJM, we did have a few struggles with some older coal units. And so the performance that we saw from the from the July generation and retail performance was offset some by where we were seeing some unit challenges in PJM, not fully offsetting by any means, but just recognition that when you run a 40,000-megawatt fleet, there's going to be some cases where you have some unplanned impacts. Those units have been recovered and they're operating, but it's still just a matter of a large fleet diversified across the country. But in the moment, when ERCOT was its tightest and when these units were needed there was exceptional performance by the ERCOT fleet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Congratulations to you both. I just wanted to go back to the -- I'm sorry, I was going to ask you a question about your debt-to-EBITDA metrics. And obviously, as of the second quarter, they're kind of -- you've got some margin contributions there. So they're elevated above the 3x target you have long term. Maybe just could you talk to how do you see that trending over the next few years? Should we expect them to kind of remain elevated given the margin deposits? Or how should we think about those targets over the next 12 to 24 months?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, Durgesh, thank you. In the deck, we tried to highlight the total debt numbers, recognizing, of course, we have cash on hand. And then we have a significant amount post of this margin deposits. And of course, as we operate our fleet and we serve customers, we would expect this cash that's posted in terms of net margin deposits to come back into the system, and we've used that obviously, to pay down debt, as Kris indicated in his remarks. I believe that we're tracking, and I think you see this in the chart, I think we're tracking in the low 3s in under normal course of operation here in the very near term. If we have to keep posting margin, it means that the curves are moving up, and that probably means that our unhedged position is even more in the money, and that's a good thing from an enterprise value for Vistra. So I think the most important thing that we've done, and Kris has done an excellent job of doing this, is securing ample liquidity, which I realized that you've read some announcements over time, wondering what is the adequate amount to have, and that's something we monitor every day, and it's a function of how hedged are we, what's the volatility in the market, how far out are we hedging. And if anything, we're going to be conservative on the liquidity side and make sure that we are not paying down debt, permanent debt any sooner than we should because we want to make sure that the liquidity is there to keep taking advantage of these market opportunities. And so I'm going to ask Kris if he would like to add something.
Kris Moldovan: Yes. Thanks, Jim. The only thing that I would add is that it's just the timing that you referenced. As we reported this morning, we have approximately just over $3 billion of cash posted and a significant amount of that cash will come back over the balance of this year. And that's what -- as we perform and our units run. So that's what gives us the ability to be confident we say that we'll be able to repay more than $2.5 billion over the balance of the year and get back into the range of our target, we think, in the very near future.
Operator: Our last question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.
Jonathan Arnold: Durgesh just asked what I was going to ask. One other thing I wanted to -- just curious on as Vistra Zero grows and you start to see more of a contribution. How are you going to show that to us? Any thoughts about sort of does it just show up in the segments? Are you going to call it out just sort of back to the comment on anticipating replacing EBITDA from retiring coal with that portfolio over time. There's no -- any sense of just sort of tracking that we'll be able to do on that.
Jim Burke: Yes. Great question, Jonathan. I think I even indicated earlier this year that we would envision providing visibility for that segment. And at that same time, we were focused on restoring Moss 300 and 100 because until we got these assets operating in the spring in Texas and got Moss 300, 100 restored, there wasn't a lot of operating EBITDA in Vistra Zero. Now that we have even those assets on the ground and operating with obviously Moss 300 and 100, we have a material contribution for 2023, we see it in the ballpark of around $200 million coming from Vistra Zero. That's not a segment reported yet, but I see us getting to that segment reporting towards the end of this year. And we just wanted to make sure if it was meaningful, Jonathan, to go through that exercise at this point and we wanted to get the operating assets on the ground delivering and we've got that. So I think you can expect to see more visibility into that towards the end of the year.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.
Jim Burke: I just want to thank you for taking the time to join us, be with Kris, myself and the management team. We are incredibly excited about where Vistra is, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months as we update you on our execution and our outlook for 2023 and beyond. Thanks again.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Vistra's Investor Webcast discussing First Quarter 2022 Results. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing first quarter 2022 results which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning to everyone and thank you for your continued interest in Vistra. Getting started with Slide 5. I've mentioned before that 2022 is a year of executing on the strategic priorities we outlined in the third quarter of 2021, shown on this slide. Importantly, Vistra has started on the right foot in 2022 with Q1 results consistent with our expectations and it is noteworthy that our confidence regarding 2022 has grown. However, to me, the bigger story is the material movement in energy commodities complex forward curves for '23 and beyond. And our emphasis on a comprehensive hedge strategy, capitalizing on this move that began last year, continued in the first quarter and continues today. Notably, we expect this upward trend to continue given how the U.S. and world energy situation is set up, especially regarding ESG and boardroom actions in response, combined with strong demand and geopolitical events. In a nutshell, the U.S. natural gas complex is already tight and likely to be increasingly tied to world gas economics. As an expanding pivotal supplier on the world stage, we expect U.S. supply and demand to tighten even further. Higher natural gas prices in turn lead to higher power prices and Vistra is long power and natural gas equivalents. Frankly, in my 40 years, I have not seen a confluence of events quite like this. Certainly, Vistra is in the right position to capitalize on the strong forward curves. The effectiveness of our execution will be key as the day-to-day volatility is extraordinary. It is a rare opportunity presented to us and it is our job to create the most value out of it while managing the risk. Our prudent hedging strategy has resulted in Vistra locking in material out-year value in the '23 to '25 timeframe. And it is worth noting that the forwards have also risen materially out to 2030. The market clearly believes there has been a fundamental shift in the energy commodity complex and it started before the aggression against Ukraine. This shift, as reflected in the forwards, offers continued opportunities to hedge more while remaining mindful of the potential liquidity requirements against further commodity price moves. The good news is that this offers right-way risk with our open position as well as the significant value already hedged. We also have tandem hedged, other risks associated with our commodity hedge positions, such as fuel and basis differentials. Our generation fleet has also performed exceptionally well at an average commercial availability in the mid-90s percent as a critical component of our hedging strategies. We bolstered this exceptional historical performance by the additional expenditures after Uri to derisk our ERCOT plant operations and as we have mentioned in the past, we hold back generation to cover forced outages, all to manage any risk exposure that hedges can expose us to. Our primary focus when hedging is on managing risk while capturing value. We are not focused on picking the absolute peak. Our experience is that this futile endeavor leads to a significant risk of missing the opportunity entirely. As it relates to 2022, while we were considerably hedged coming into the year, our open position in the summer months could now benefit from the power price environment which we expect to remain intact given the likely continued strength of natural gas prices, as I just discussed. This is our expectation even without an extreme weather event. In addition, our retail business continues to deliver strong margins while organically growing customer counts as customers in ERCOT value quality retail names like TXU Energy and Ambit. Jim will speak to the significant value capture opportunity in more detail momentarily. But in sum, the EBITDA outlook for Vistra through 2025 has now increased to potentially over $1 billion even with prudently conservative estimates and the market has only continued to move up. As briefly mentioned a moment ago, a robust hedging strategy, of course, requires significant liquidity as collateral postings are required. Notably, our commitment to a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity has positioned us with the cash and access to capital necessary to make the collateral postings while continuing to execute solidly on our $2 billion share repurchase program and pay out significant dividends to our shareholders of record. Of course, in this environment, you can never have enough liquidity. As such, we continually look for ways to efficiently manage our liquidity and are working diligently to enhance access to capital so we can further take advantage of the long-dated move up and forward and capture value for our shareholders. We believe these efforts will be successful given the significant strength of our business and the amount of forward value we can lock in. Finally, we remain committed to sensibly progressing our fleet of zero carbon generation. As of today's call, we have completed construction of our Brightside and Emerald Grove solar facilities and our DeCordova battery energy storage facility in ERCOT. Additionally, we've been working around the clock to install replacement connectors in the water-based heat suppression safety systems at Moss 300 and Moss Landing 100 and expect to begin bringing those megawatts back online ahead of the hot California summer months. Despite the challenges, the supply chain issues or the uncertainties around solar panel procurement that the Department of Commerce's anti-circumvention investigation are causing the industry, we find ourselves well positioned to navigate these particular headwinds and as we continue to advance the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Our planned 2022 development projects are constructed and we've already procured panels for several of our next-in-line solar projects. Further, our remaining projects have a timeline that allows us to opportunistically contract at the right time. It is important to note that we will remain disciplined in our development efforts, especially given that we either have procured the equipment or have flexibility to time our projects with availability and pricing of equipment. It is also important to note that the supply chain bottlenecks and government actions are dampening the build-out of renewables in the U.S., placing more emphasis on the existing fleet of assets, especially natural gas fueled and nuclear power plants. As we have said many times before, natural gas fueled power plants are going to be critical to a rational and just transition to a decarbonized electric system. Moving now to Slide 6. In the first quarter, we achieved $547 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in line with our expectations. Notably, this year, our first quarter results are a smaller contribution to our overall annual earnings as compared to certain prior year first quarters. But this new earnings shape was expected for 2022 and is correlated to the seasonality of our retail business in the ERCOT market during the winter months with higher cost of goods sold locked in to hedge retail sales. However, there is greater margin opportunity expected in the remaining months in both our retail and wholesale businesses. With that said, the Retail segment performed above expectations in Q1 in ERCOT with notable organic customer count growth and strong margin performance. Our Generation segment came in a little below expectations, largely due to a greater open position and lower realized prices from a weaker winter. However, with very strong performance in commercial availability rates at the plants of approximately 96% in this first quarter. We are reaffirming our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flows before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We retain the ranges as we are still early in the year, have the summer months ahead of us and at this point in time, we continue to carry a little more open position than in the past for risk management purposes. However, we reaffirm this guidance with increased confidence given the favorable energy commodities markets we continue to experience. In closing, Vistra is very well positioned, especially given the current market environment. Execution is key in 2022 and beyond, especially related to our hedging in forward years and managing adequate liquidity. Now before I turn it over to Jim, as you are likely all aware, this will be my last earnings call as CEO of Vistra. It has been my distinct honor and privilege to serve you all for nearly six years. I want to thank our many stakeholders for their support throughout my tenure. In particular, all of you who entrusted us with your hard-earned money. I know, I gave it my best to do business the right way and create value for our investors. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished and believe Vistra is well positioned to drive continued industry leadership. This is simply the right time for me to transition the CEO role to Jim. Jim has done everything to be prepared for this demanding job. After having worked with Jim for many years, I have the utmost confidence in his capabilities, commitment to Vistra and his leadership skills. He has a deep experience and knowledge of our business, including an understanding of how the disparate parts of the company work together. I am certain and our Board is certain that he is the right person to lead us through our next phase as we execute on our capital allocation plan, including substantial return of capital and expansion of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Finally, to the incredible team members at Vistra. I have never been more honored and proud to work with a group of people. Your life has shown brightly through thick and thin and I am grateful for the time we had together. I believe there is a tremendous opportunity ahead for Vistra as a leader in the power business and look forward to watching that come to fruition. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. I will get into additional details surrounding our first quarter's financial performance outlook and our strategy. But before I do so, I want to express my appreciation for all Curt has done to lead this company over the past six years. Curt has been a mentor and a friend to me. But more importantly, Curt has been a champion of Vistra and its many varied stakeholders. Vistra's accomplishments under Curt's leadership since he took the helm in 2016 for many. We grew our business by acquiring Dynegy, Crius and Ambit, moving from a Texas-only company to one operating in over 20 states, delivering over $850 million a year in annual value drivers while pivoting the company to being predominantly a natural gas-powered fleet serving over four million retail customers and well positioned for future growth with Vistra Zero. Curt Championed the integrated model and highlighted the benefits of our commercial capability that is tightly integrated with our generation and retail businesses and the importance of a strong balance sheet. He pioneered our ESG and DEI efforts despite the challenges we faced with Uri and the COVID pandemic. These accomplishments, among many others, resulted in a doubling in value for our shareholders while also providing a strong foundation for the future. I want to reassure you all on the call today that as CEO, I'm ready to build on what we have achieved and I intend to remain focused on our previously announced capital allocation plan with a commitment, as always, to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. I am grateful to Curt and committed to do my best to lead Vistra going forward alongside some of the finest, most dedicated colleagues in our industry. Turning now to Slide 8. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter that were in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $547 million. We recognize the quarter-over-quarter comparison is not meaningful given the Uri impacts to last year's earnings. Retail ended the first quarter in 2022 at $163 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and our collective generation segments ended the quarter with $384 million in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Despite the expected lower than historical contribution, we believe these first quarter results from ongoing operations positions us to achieve or exceed the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance previously announced. This quarter also continued the execution of our previously announced capital allocation plan. We repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares since our last reported share count as of February 22, 2022. As of May 3, 2022, we've repurchased approximately 54 million shares since the share buyback program was initiated, accounting for a total of approximately 10.5% of shares then outstanding. Approximately 431.8 million shares remain outstanding as of May 3, 2022 and $805 million remains available for additional share repurchases for the remainder of 2022. The Board has also approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on the common stock in the amount of $0.177 per share payable on June 30, 2022. This is approximately 18% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet in the near term and are balancing the hedging opportunities to lock in value with ensuring sufficient liquidity for these dynamic markets. especially given that the hedging activity is locking in materially higher future earnings. We will continue to provide updates on the $1.5 billion debt repayment as the year progresses and as we capitalize on opportunities to lock in value and manage liquidity. Similarly, we are committed to our transformational growth and are actively exploring avenues to support the Vistra Zero portfolio with nonrecourse financing where we find those financing markets remain open and with satisfactory interest rates. We can't discuss our capital allocation plan in full without acknowledging the commodities and power pricing environment that we've been experiencing this past quarter. As reflected on Slide 9, this quarter saw dramatic increases in both the ERCOT and PJM weighted spark spreads for 2023. These trends have continued through April and into May. Given the favorable environment, we've continued our hedging strategy to lock in value in 2023 and beyond. As of March 31, 2022, we were 93% and 96% hedged in Texas and East segments, respectively, for 2022 and we were 60% and 67% hedged in those segments, respectively, for 2023. Turning now to Slide 10. This slide illustrates in more detail the phenomena we've all been observing, reflecting that power price forwards are up dramatically in correlation with the increase in the gas price forwards. This environment increases margins across our fleet in the money gas generation plants, coal, nuclear and renewables. In addition to locking in the revenue values, we have also been hedging coal, gas and nuclear fuel cost as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy. Vistra is now over 50% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025. To provide a sense of magnitude, we have stated in the past that we expect to consistently earn above $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations on a go-forward basis. Given the marks as of April 29, we now anticipate a risk-adjusted midpoint in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for the years 2023 through 2025. Again, we are just over 50% hedged, so there is still a significant range around this midpoint. However, the curves have continued to move up materially since April 29. So we believe that range of estimates to be on the conservative side. We are continuing to execute on our comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in as much of that value as possible. Notably, a comprehensive hedging strategy requires significant liquidity for collateral postings. We are actively managing our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident at this time that we can execute our hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. In closing, we continue to focus on execution in 2022, execution on the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, of our comprehensive hedging strategy and of our previously announced capital allocation plan. And we firmly believe in the value this execution will bring to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we progress throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: So, maybe if we could start with earnings and the hedging outlook and sort of in light of the current commodity environment. It looks like you guys hedged into '23 fairly well here versus February. And obviously, we appreciate the high-level color on '24 and '25 in the slides. But can you give us any more detail on the amount of hedging you've done into the outer years of the curve, if at all? I mean, put differently, have you departed from -- your typical hedging profile here given the opportunities or fundamental view, I'm really thinking about your approach to 25 and '26 but I do obviously appreciate that the curves can get a little bit of liquid on the power side quickly so.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So look, I'll start with a couple of opening questions but Jim can then fill in with specifics and add his flavor to it. But look, I do think we've departed and we're going to depart. If anything, a message we deliver today is that we've got really one of the most rare opportunities in my career and I've been around a long time, to lock in significant value in the out years. The curves have moved up -- sorry, even out into 2030. The thing you have to balance, all of us do, even if you're investment grade, is margins and posting and having enough liquidity. And we feel very good that we will be able to do that. But this is a rare opportunity for us and this is a good news story. It's all about execution and we feel good about it. And then, of course, as these hedges realize, you got to run the assets. And the one thing that we've been very proud of through the years is just the incredible performance of our generating fleet to back up the hedges. So this is one of the best opportunities I've ever seen for a company like ours and we just need to capitalize on it. So philosophically, we are departing a bit and we are looking to hedge '24, '25, I suspect just given the way that the energy commodity price -- world markets are set up, we think this is going to be around a while and we'll roll hedges into '26, '27 and beyond because we believe that you're going to see a strong natural gas market for many years to come. So, it's a rare situation and one we have to step up and capitalize on. And Jim can tell you a little more about the specifics of what we've done in '24 or '25 because we have done some significant hedging which is rare for us because you know this, Shar. Generally, these curves are backward dated. And we are seeing pricing that is at or above our point of view. And we've told you that when we see prices at or above our point of view, we expect to hedge and we're not trying to pick the highs. We're just trying to lock value and then we just have to execute from that. Jim, do you want to add? You bet, Curt.
Jim Burke: Shar, the way Curt described it, it looks like a unique opportunity and we're taking advantage of it because we have typically seen tremendous backwardation. So we'll see prompt months and maybe a year show up but then the outer periods have not responded. I think on Slide 10, where you saw the curve moves, particularly gas driven but also the sparks that have driven considerably higher in the '23, '24 period, we decided to layer on more hedges. That's what gave us the confidence to talk about '23 to '25. As you know, we would normally talk about 2023 after the summer and we would generally and I cannot recall that we've ever spoken specifically with confidence two and three years out. But we're representing that in our materials today because we have hedged over 50% in total for that three year period a little bit more in the front in '23, a little bit less in '25. There's still a range around that and that's the important thing. And that range can go higher. It could also go lower. We recognize that. And that's why we talk about that range as a midpoint. So there's a chance for that number to go down. We would put this in the range of potentially $500 million, $600 million to the downside, possibly that to the upside and we think that's reasonable. And so giving you a sense of how much we've hedged and putting that out with all was important for investors because these opportunities, as Curt said, don't come around very often.
Curt Morgan: And Shar, look, we know you guys model. Everybody does. We want to give you some idea of this. But I think it's important to also note that I think the skews to the upside, especially given that commodity prices have moved up and that 3.5% to 3.7% range was a 4.29% [ph] vintage and we've seen a pretty big move up this week alone. And so we're just trying to give you an idea but the earnings power of this company for the next -- at least three years and beyond is significantly higher and it's just the realities of the situation. And like I said, it's our job now to manage that because it's not without risk. But that's what we do and we do it well. So that's -- this is a good news story but we need to execute.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And as we think about sort of the potential for extra cash to come in the door versus your plans last fall, how does your, I guess, calculus shift at all? I mean at a high level, how would you maybe prioritize the incremental cash? Should we be thinking about returning to shareholders more delevering growth CapEx like Vistra Zero acceleration? And the reason why I'm asking this is, this is obviously in light of your view that the curves, the moves in the curves aren't really transitory, right?
Curt Morgan: Look, I think it really doesn't change much. I mean, we still like the value proposition of buying our shares. And so -- but this -- you know this, it's a function of where you're trading at in terms of your share price. But if you said, okay, what would you do if you have a pile more cash today? I think we'd say, we'd buy back our shares. But we also want to maintain a strong balance sheet for sure. And we want to pay a healthy dividend. And the buyback our shares has helped us pay a healthy dividend and increase that over time for those -- the shareholders of record. So, I'm not sure that we would change that much. We've said that we would prefer not to use the cash flow from the core business on Vistra Zero to allow Vistra Zero to raise its own capital because we could get cost of active capital there and we still have a high free cash flow yield. And so that may not be the best place to put it. So, I think it's the real three primary capital allocation buckets that we've always talked about and share repurchases would continue to be strong on that list. But again, that's a function of where you're trading at any given time.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
Michael Sullivan: Good morning. Curt, congrats and all the best. And Jim, congrats to you as well and good luck here. Exciting times. Yes, maybe just wanted to start and just with a quick clarification. The $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range you gave, is that true in each individual year? Or is that an average over the '23 to '25?
Curt Morgan: Jim, do you want to take that?
Jim Burke: Yes. So Michael, it is. First of all, it is a range that applies to all three years, okay? So we see all three years within that range. We didn't want to put out individual year guidance and individual year hedge percentages at this point because this is moving -- We've taken advantage of a lot of the hedging opportunities that the month of April provided us where we really started to see this move. But we're pretty flat over that three year period because we have a little bit more hedges on at the beginning when the move started in the near term and a little bit more open to the out even though they're still backwardation, the captured value ends up being pretty similar across that three year period.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. That's super helpful color. And then maybe just on the liquidity side, Jim, if you could give us an update there on some of the steps you're taking. I think there was a revolver update yesterday and just as things continue to evolve here? And it sounds like you expect things to get increasingly more volatile. Just how you're thinking about that and what are some of the steps you can take to manage that liquidity? Just more color there would be helpful.
Jim Burke: You bet. Yes. And Curt emphasized liquidity in his remarks and it is front and center for us being able to capture this opportunity and make sure that as we continue to hedge because we'd like to do that, we'd like to continue to put more hedges on at these levels that we have adequate liquidity. So you saw us increase the commodity-linked revolver so that we have $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of yesterday. That is very helpful in managing the hedge levels that we already have put on. We also are looking to do some additional raise and work with other counter-parties in a more credit efficient way which we can do with some of our first lien opportunities to hedge with parties and we do that already but we expect to increase that level of activity. And so our view is that did now is the time to make sure we have ample liquidity because we want to not only hedge more, we want to be able to withstand any further moves because the goal here is all this liquidity comes back to us, right? It all comes back as we operate and deliver the power through the various calendar years. And so it's relatively cost effective for us to load up on even additional liquidity to make sure we can hedge more because we know that this cash does return and just make sure that we have the line of sight and continue to bring the range of outcomes in the out years even tighter. And I think, as Curt noted, I think the midpoint of this range is skewed to the upside. I think the midpoint can continue to move up and we can give you that confidence as we continue to put more hedges on. But we've had great access to liquidity. All of our partners that have worked with us have been very helpful because they understand this is the right-way risk as these hedges continue to be put on and we have to post more. They know the franchise value of the enterprise is continuing to grow. That's a great place to be and this is going to be something that we'll continue to actively manage.
Curt Morgan: Michael, if I can just add something too. The nice thing about adding this liquidity is that we can keep it outstanding and keep this on our balance sheet as long as it's necessary. So if we continue in a high-priced volatile market, we can continue to extend this liquidity and lock in value. And the annual cost of that liquidity relative to the value locked in, as Jim just said, it is very low; so it's a compelling value proposition. If we were to come back to a more recent historical normal level of commodity prices which I'm not sure will happen. But let's just say that we did. We can always then reoptimize the balance sheet and shrink the amount of liquidity that we have to the volatility in the marketplace at that given time; so we can flex it. And because it's right-way risk and also because we tandem hedge all the risks, not just the commodity risk but also basis and fuel, we have a high -- and we can perform very -- at a high level with our generation. We have a high confidence of achieving the cash flow levels that the hedges bring to us which obviously satisfied the cost of the added liquidity. So -- and this is -- right now and this works for us. Liquidity is very important to us; we have access to it and it allows us to go out and lock that significant value in for years to come and that's a rare opportunity for companies to have.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And congratulations to both of you but very well-earned retirement here. Leaving on a high note, as we say. I suppose just coming back to this quasi guidance, if you will. Just to reconcile that $1 billion number you threw out in the comments versus the $3.6 billion midpoint that you just talked about a second ago. Just the $1 billion, that was relative to what? Just to make sure I understood that appropriately.
Curt Morgan: You mean when I say was $1 billion of value that we were adding, you're talking about what I said in my remarks?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes.
Curt Morgan: Jim, you can answer that because you know it, too. So go ahead.
Jim Burke: Yes, yes. Sure. Julien, that was in the remarks we said through 2025, nearly $1 billion. That was a cumulative minimum value increase from '23, '24, '25 of $1 billion. So think about that as $333 million a year minimum, so that gets to our $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion which is higher than where anyone was really thinking we were ahead of this commodity moves where they -- we said we're a $3-plus billion business. Some would say you're a $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion kind of business. So we're taking that delta and saying assume $300-plus million a year, that gets you to this midpoint of the range we're talking about for three years is $1 billion.
Curt Morgan: And Jim, can I add that we debated on this one, Julien, because if you take the $3 billion plus that we always say, that number is close to $2 billion. If you take sort of the $3.3 billion that we sort of, I guess, gave a wink and a nod to for 2023 previously, then that number is closer to a little over $1 billion. So the reality is it's a significant amount above -- depending on what you want to use as your baseline. And we looked at consensus, too. And that number is -- no matter how you slice it, it was at least over $1 billion. And so that's why we felt comfortable saying that. And those two, we tried to reconcile those, what Jim said, the $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion and what I said. But no matter how you slice it, it's $1 billion or more. And you can argue with the $3 billion-plus number, it's closer to $2 billion.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, no, no, indeed. Both numbers are conservative. I got you. I hear you. Well, listen, I mean, just to keep that focus going on the commodity front, what are you seeing with your coal counter-parties and your logistics counter-parties here? I mean, are the PRB suppliers finally ramping up? And to that end, how have you made arrangements and what are you seeing with logistics? And ultimately, what's priced into that $3.6 billion, for instance, on delivered PRB and your lignite, etcetera?
Curt Morgan: Jim, you can talk. Yes, go ahead, Jim.
Jim Burke: Julien, I'll start and Curt, thank you for that. We have factored in that even in 2022, it has been tough for some of the PRB suppliers to fully ramp up. As you would expect, as gas continues to move up, everyone is trying to get more coal and that's logical but it is difficult for some of these coal supply chains to respond. And some of it is simply hiring and having enough people to actually operate the equipment and some of it is weather driven. There's been storms that have actually disrupted some supplies. We factored that into how we think about 2022 and we have factored in the ranges we just gave you. So we are not assuming perfect execution on the coal supply chain. We do think, over time, this will get resolved either because there will be a more fulsome response to the supply chain maybe even outside of the 2022 timeframe before that happens, or gas may actually, at some point, dissipate and not put quite as much strain on the system. But it has been a challenge more on the PRB and the train set as so with the barge coal that we have access to for our Ohio plants but that is something we took into consideration when we provided these numbers. Go ahead, Curt.
Curt Morgan: Well, I'll add to this, Julien, is that we have good relationships with the BN also with KCS. And then down with Coleto Creek, it's UP. And we have good relationships. We have long-term historical relationships. And I think we're going to continue to work and I am and so is Jim with the leadership of those companies to try to help us through this, especially given that we got a summer coming up in Texas. We want to make sure we have adequate access to coal. But it is -- they're struggling like everybody else on the supply chain side and having enough labor. I can't remember the number, Jim but it's like six to nine months to train new people on the railroad. So it takes a long time to get new people -- fresh people in and get them trained. So this is an issue. The good news is we've been conserving where we can. We're going into the summer with a decent pile. We'd like to have more and we'd like to see the train sets get picked up. I think we'll be able to work that out and this is something you just have to work together with the railroads on.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. But you're pricing in kind of current strip pricing or...
Curt Morgan: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.
Jonathan Arnold: And congratulations to you both. Just a quick one on given this big shift in the market, does it change any of your thoughts around planned retirements that you have scheduled -- just curious there.
Curt Morgan: So some of our retirements are already scheduled because they are part of agreements that we have I'd say there are some that are not. And certainly, we're going to look at the whole suite of things that we look at when we decide whether we retire a plant. But I think the other thing we have to balance is markets are tight and we're part of the reliability of markets and also the affordability of our product as well as emissions. And so I could see a situation where maybe we would extend some of the coal plants. But we've also agreed to shut those down as part of the coal combustion residual rule at EPA. And so a lot to take into account. But could we say maybe go from '25 to '26 for something? We might. And I think we just have to consider what does the market look like, what's the need of the power plant. And it's not a foregone conclusion that all these are economic even with these prices. Having said that, we're economic people but we're also about trying to help with reliability in the markets that we serve and keeping prices affordable. So we'll have to balance all that and see what that brings us. We haven't made any definitive decisions on any of those other coal plants other than the ones that we have committed to retiring as part of some sort of a commitment.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. I mean you've not assumed anything like that in this outlook, I imagine?
Curt Morgan: That's right. That's correct. We have not.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And then could I just -- just a couple of things on liquidity. Could you maybe update for us just what the current numbers are relative to the ones you put in the release for the end of March, given the April moves? I think you said you now have two available rather than one but I want to make sure net of moves in commodity but I just want to make sure we got that.
Curt Morgan: Jim will take that.
Jim Burke: Yes, we had $3.1 billion available as of the end of March. We now have $2.1 billion available and we added $1 billion to the commodity rate revolving facility for capacity because of the moves, particularly in April. And we wanted to take advantage of hedging more in the month of April. So we increased our capacity some but we still have the ability -- we still have the $2.1 billion available to us after all postings that we've made to date.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And the implication of your prior comments is that you feel confident you could flex more if you needed to?
Curt Morgan: Correct. That's correct.
Jonathan Arnold: And just a different kind of liquidity question. But as you out in the out years, in the past, it's been challenging to find liquidity in power. But maybe gas has been more liquid. Can any -- can you give us any sense of is that changing? Or how are you -- what's the nature of the hedges you're able to put on that far out?
Jim Burke: It has been changing, Jonathan. I think both the sell side as well as the buy side has -- see this as either opportunity or potentially risk if they don't buy long term. So we've been able to hedge both gas and power out through '25 with fairly deep markets compared to what we've seen historically. And I think that is something that has occurred as people are thinking this is not temporary. We've generally seen, as we talked earlier, things move up in the very short run and then you see some assumed corrections. But you don't even see that with the NYMEX curve now for the next 10 years. So I think folks are seeing that the complex is moving up. They see difficulty in supply chains. They see difficulties with some of the environmental restrictions that are happening. So I think folks are concerned about where this whole commodity complex could go. So there has been folks on the other side willing to make longer-dated purchases that we haven't seen the same depth in prior markets.
Operator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.
Durgesh Chopra: Maybe just Curt and/or Jim, maybe can you talk to the first quarter 2022 EBITDA? I appreciate sort of the profiling has changed post Uri. But just maybe a little bit color there. And then when you talk about margin opportunity or greater margin opportunity rest of the year, I get, I mean, obviously, there's upside from the commodity standpoint or open positions. But is there something on the retail side in terms of profiling or expenses that we're missing? So any color there is appreciated.
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, Durgesh, what ended up happening post Uri is the first quarter cost structure shifted up remarkably as people started to conclude that the winter has potentially even if not more volatility built into it than the summer. ERCOT, as you know, has always been a summer focus. People have always talked about peak capacity and peak demand in the summer. Uri shifted that. And now we saw the first quarter part of the curve move up considerably. Retail has to buy that but they generally flat price their customers. We don't have a lot of indexed-based structures with particularly residential customers. So when we flat price, it basically means that the margins get squeezed considerably still positive but definitely lower in the first quarter than historical patterns. What that means is it really opens up the margins in 2Q and 4Q relative to what we have seen in the past. So when Curt was alluding to we have greater earnings power in the back part of the year, that's not assuming anything with the open position. That's just simply if you were to model retail margins on a monthly basis, you would have historically seen a better first quarter margin than we're seeing at the moment because of the shape of the 12-month curve.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. So just to be clear, it's the retail margins that we're talking about, the profiling of the retail margins Q1 and then rest of the year, right? I mean we're expecting to pick up.
Jim Burke: That's correct. Yes.
Curt Morgan: I mean if I can add, though, I mean, look, the prices have moved up, too, though, on the wholesale side. But what we were talking about specifically about what we were seeing and we actually had factored in into our guidance was what Jim talked about which was that shift in retail margins. And we don't -- you know that guys, this is a little bit disappointing is that we don't give quarterly guidance. And unfortunately, there is a consensus out there which is generally built on kind of an assumption of the percentage of EBITDA of the annual and the reality of the situation is that does move at times. And we tandem hedge. When we sell retail, we tandem hedge with wholesale. And we knew this -- this was in our guidance number all along. And we knew that we were going to be a little skinnier on the first quarter but higher in the second and the fourth. Now we've also seen them move up a little bit on the third because of wholesale pricing. We'll see if that comes to fruition. But that's just how things work and we just want to be clear that we understood this phenomenon. And we don't -- we're not seeing it in the outer years, either. We think things will probably, at least over time, move back to more of a traditional split or shape of earnings. But it just happened in '22 just given the way that traded relative to the -- when we locked in retail.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. That's super helpful color. Just one quick one for me. On the topic of share repurchases, the latest guidance you have for '23 and beyond is, I believe, at least $1 billion a year and right? And we're looking at sizable EBITDA cash flow upside, Curt, that you alluded to in your commentary and the EBITDA estimates going forward. When should we expect sort of an update on the use of that excess cash that now you're seeing over 2023 and beyond? Is that sometime later this year? When should we expect an update on that in the use of the cash proceeds?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Well, Jim, I don't want to -- because I'm not going to be here after obvious one but I would expect that just the way we've normally done is later this year, after we get through the summer and also, we've done some more hedging, my guess is we'll talk about at least about '23. And we'll see about '24 and '25.
Jim Burke: No, I was going to say, Curt, I agree with that completely. I think we need to get through the summer. Let's look at the additional hedges that we anticipate putting on at these kind of levels. And obviously, we won't hedge all the way up but we still think there's value to capture here. So we'll again, emphasis on liquidity. All this money will come back to us eventually but we do want to preserve long-term value and take advantage. So I think it would be prudent for us to talk about that in the fall when we give the guidance for next year. That will be a good time for us to update our cash flow and our capital allocation assumptions for '23.
Operator: And the last question today will come from James Thalacker from BMO Capital.
James Thalacker: Congratulations, Curt, It's really been a pleasure. Just had two real quick questions. Just following up on Julien's coal question. I know you said your outlook reflects basically the current curves on coal pricing. But is that coal pricing based on an FOB basis? I know that the rails are also having some labor issues also on deliveries and that could be impacting upward pressure on transport costs. So just wondering what you guys are seeing there.
Curt Morgan: Go ahead, Jim.
Jim Burke: Yes. I was going to say, we have some long-dated transportation arrangements for our key facilities, James. So our issue has been less rail transport cost. It has been simply about quantity as it relates to PRB, getting all the quantity that our plants could consume in the higher kind of power price and natural gas price worlds. So we have been less exposed to the cost of transport. It's been for us a little bit more on the quantity side.
James Thalacker: Okay, great. That's helpful. And just sticking along that same line. Do you think that some of the recent move in power could also be a reflection of gas plants being dispatched out of merit to preserve some of these coal stockpiles? Some of the more regulated [indiscernible] we've talked to are down to like 20, 25 days as we move into summer. Just wondering if that could be contributing to the [indiscernible] and the moves recently.
Curt Morgan: Absolutely. In fact, I'm certain of it, that, that is affecting it because some people are -- they're holding on in the shoulder periods where the margin isn't that great on coal, they're backing off. Gas is having to come on at setting price. So yes, that interplay between gas and coal is going to continue until the coal can solve the issue. But yes, that definitely is having an impact on price.
James Thalacker: Okay, great. And then just the last question and this is kind of -- I apologize for being greedy and I know that we're only a week after the -- when you guys priced your upside of $1 billion through 2025. But obviously, prices have continued to kind of move up. Are you -- going back to that previous question, Curt and Jim, do you think that pricing will kind of hold in this level and that you feel good about kind of being able to lock in, let's say, $300 million across to 2025? Or do you think that we're kind of at a peak here and we should really be sort of baking in any incremental upside from here?
Curt Morgan: Well, how we handle it? Well, I'll just keep in mind, Jim, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I'll pull out my crystal ball here. Look, I think here's what I would say about it. We would like to continue to hedge. And 70% to 80% would feel pretty good to us in those out-years right now, the ones that we've talked about. But the one thing we're just going to make sure, James, is that we also have the liquidity to go along with it. So, we're just -- we're being prudent about it. But I would also say that whether it's going to stay at this level or go a little bit higher in the near term, things seem to be a fair amount of fear in the market around gas right now. How long that lasts, I don't know. But I do believe that we're going to stay at pretty strong levels on gas and power for a while and we'll pick our shocks. But look, we see a real opportunity here. We have a sense of urgency as a company. This -- you don't get this opportunity very often and so you can be rest assured that we're working urgently to lock in value at these kind of levels. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see us having increased our hedging between now and the next quarter when we talk to you again. I mean I just think that -- and we're not going to worry about whether it's at the peak or not. We just -- what we really care about is it a fundamentally good value for the company. Jim, you want to add to that?
Jim Burke: Yes. Curt, I agree completely. And I would just add that if prices stay where they are and we continue to increase our hedge percentage, then we would see this range move up from where it is. That's what we meant by we were being conservative because we made this range off of the April 29 curve, James. And as you noted, they've moved up. So, if they stay where they are and we can continue to hedge into that, I would expect that you'd see this midpoint of this range move up.
James Thalacker: Okay, great. Yes. Sorry about the greedy question but I was just curious because it seems the biggest delimiter that you guys probably have, to your point, is really just maintaining adequate liquidity as well as probably just sourcing liquidity in the markets, especially as we probably get out past '24, '25, '26, I would think that it probably gets a little bit more thin out there and so you might have to take some discount to sort of get those hedges on.
Curt Morgan: Yes.
Jim Burke: We might see thing. But as Curt said, we're not trying to get every last nickel here. So there's plenty of room for us to lock this in and move the midpoints up. And as you said, liquidity is a key area of focus. We feel good about it but we're going to keep actively working that so that we could capture this opportunity. Sorry to pick, Curt.
Curt Morgan: No, no, that's it. I think that's right.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thanks again. It looks like we ran over time. Sorry about that. Great working with everybody. I'm hoping that I get to see people between now and August 1 and now that we're also getting to see each other. But enjoyed it and look forward to. You're in good hands with Jim and the company is in good shape as ever. So we're excited about the future. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Vistra Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability. Please go ahead.
Meagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-K and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. 2021 was undoubtedly a challenging year and, in many ways, a pivotal one for Vistra. We were faced with an unprecedented weather event at the beginning of the year with Winter Storm Uri, and the financial strength we worked so hard to put in place was challenged. Yet sitting here today, I'm proud of how our team came together to not only confront and mitigate the impact, but to then shift to building a stronger company. That strong balance sheet we built and the resilience of our team helped us stabilize the company and ultimately get back on track within months. Importantly, we accomplished what we set out to do following Uri. We shifted our strategic direction and implemented an enhanced comprehensive capital allocation plan with substantial share repurchases, a new dividend policy and an acceleration of our Vistra Zero portfolio, all while derisking our company after Uri. We believe we exited the year in a position of strength. And we are excited about our competitive positioning and the long-term value creation opportunity ahead. I'd like to now turn to Slide 6 to begin the presentation to discuss the key takeaways from our 2021 performance. We delivered on our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance we issued in November which notably was an increased and narrowed range from what we had announced in April. After immediately stabilizing our company after Uri, we conducted a thorough review of our business, announcing a capital allocation plan that returns billions of capital to shareholders, enables us to cost effectively fund the development of Vistra Zero and maintains a strong capital structure by continuing to pay down debt. We also made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a leader in ESG and the clean energy transition with our Vistra Zero carbon-free generation portfolio, and our efforts regarding DEI and sustainability, including enhanced disclosures. In fact, in December, we issued the first ever green U.S. corporate perpetual preferred stock that funds our development and growth of Vistra Zero. We haven't emphasized this in a while, but we continued our OPI savings, realizing $500 million of such savings in 2021 from our generation segments. OPI is now part of our DNA, with continuous idea generation and conversion of ideas to executable opportunities on a regular basis. And our retail business rose to the challenge as well. We grew our ERCOT residential accounts by approximately 23,000 customers, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2008. Most of this growth was within our flagship retail brand TXU Energy, demonstrating the strength of our brand promise and continued importance to our customers. In all, we ended the year back strong again and look forward to building on that momentum through the execution of our four strategic priorities, which we will discuss in more detail a bit later. Before I get to that, I would like to turn to Slide 7 to discuss our 2021 performance in a little more detail. When the dust settled right after Uri, we were facing an adjusted EBITDA picture of right around $1.2 billion. I recall thinking that this is not the way that 2021 is going to end. We've got to put this company on a positive path and improve this picture. We instituted at a stretch target of $500 million in self-help and, in fact, achieved the target coming in at $546 million. At the same time, we were very active in the Texas 2021 legislative and regulatory deliberations regarding Uri, which, among other accomplishments, resulted in Vistra being allocated $544 million in ERCOT securitization payments. I want to thank those in the State of Texas that had to deal with the fallout of Uri for their efforts and specifically securitization for their courage and foresight. The self-help and securitization efforts resulted in improvement following Uri of over $1 billion and significantly contributed to improving that initial picture that I mentioned earlier. In November, we issued refined guidance that increased and narrowed our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations estimates we had issued in April, and we delivered at the midpoint of that November guidance at $1.994 billion prior to taking into account an opportunity we had to settle some Uri-related retail bill credit liabilities. Specifically, at the end of the year, we settled a block of these bill credits for $53 million prior to their expected settles in 2022 and 2023, all with internal rates of return ranging from 20% to over 40% and an average of more than 30%. So while it did decrease our final adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for 2021, we expect the high IRR settlements will positively impact us in 2022 and 2023. Our adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations was $179 million for the year, which is within the guidance range we offered in November, and excluding the early retail bill credit settlements that I just talked about, it would be over the midpoint at $232 million. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2022 guidance. We see some headwinds and tailwinds, as is normal, in the coming months. And though the upcoming summer months will be critical to our performance, we continue to anticipate that 2022 will be consistent with our previous statements of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3 billion or more. We are not establishing guidance beyond 2022, but our long-term view of Vistra's earnings power remains consistent with our previous views. Our generation and retail performance outlook is strong. And as we always have, we will capitalize on opportunities to not only lock in adjusted EBITDA through hedging activities, but also incrementally add value through commercial optimization. The net of this activity, we believe, will be in the $3 billion plus adjusted EBITDA range. In addition, we are positioned to grow from this level as investments in our Vistra Zero generation fleet become operational, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. This is all and despite the retirement of significant coal generation. Turning now to Slide 8. In November, we announced four strategic priorities: return capital to our shareholders, accelerate investment in our zero carbon generation growth through an appropriate capital structure, continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver long-term sustainable value. We delivered squarely on each of these priorities by year-end 2021 and are poised to continue delivering in the years ahead. First, we returned $290 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends in 2021 and have instituted our new $300 million dividend policy for 2022. We front-end loaded our share repurchases and spent $764 million of the $2 billion share buyback program as of February 22, 2022. The combination of the new dividend program and share repurchases has yielded an approximately 13% increase in declared dividends in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021 and, as we continue to buy back shares, will lead to further increases on a per share basis. We are also well on the way to deliver the $7.5 billion of shareholder capital return by year-end 2026. Finally, later this year, we expect to be in a position to announce the next phase of our share repurchase program after we complete the $2 billion program by the end of this year. As long as our stock has the kind of free cash flow yield that it does currently, we will be buying our shares. Second, we executed on our goal to further finance and grow our leading Vistra Zero portfolio. In December, we issued an upsized $1 billion in Green Perpetual Preferred Stock. Proceeds from this issuance will be used to fund Vistra Zero's growth while allowing us to retain full control of the business. We expect that these proceeds will also offset the once anticipated $500 million per year equity contribution to Vistra Zero, freeing up that capital to be allocated to further execute on our share repurchase program. We expect Vistra Zero to be further financed, as needed, with project free cash flows and project level financing. Third, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We reduced debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 by approximately $625 million and are on a pace to reduce total debt, exclusive of Vistra Zero project financing, by $1.5 billion by year-end 2022. We've increased liquidity year-over-year by $180 million and further strengthened our balance sheet with cost-effective preferred stock of $2 billion and a $1 billion commodity link revolver that will help provide incremental liquidity for cash postings under various of our commodity contracts when power prices are high. With these endeavors and the planned activities in 2022, we expect our balance sheet to be back into the pre-Uri range by year-end 2022. We continue to believe a strong balance sheet is essential to managing the risk of the company and creating long-term equity value. Finally, we continue to pursue long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. I already mentioned the $500 million OPI value enhancements, which leads to a core set of generation that is highly efficient and necessary for the long-term grid reliability. You are beginning to see large asset managers essentially recognize the need for natural gas in the transition to net zero several years out. We possess a low-cost fleet of gas field generation that is likely to be needed for many years to come. Our retail segment saw significant organic customer growth and we continue to implement derisking activities, including our expenditures to further harden our generation fleet in ERCOT. Specifically, in 2021, we invested approximately $50 million and we'll invest another $30 million in 2022, further derisking our ERCOT fleet. We installed dual fuel capabilities at plants where it was economic and prudent and added on-site and off-site fuel storage. We also revised our commodity hedging approach and carried extra length heading into the winter months of 2022. We've taken these precautions at a relatively low cost to guard against a severe financial impact in the event of a storm similar to Uri. And while the recent weather events in February 2022 in Texas were certainly not Uri-like events, they have given us valuable insights into how our preparations would fare in a repeat situation. We are pleased to report that our fleet has performed exceptionally well with no weather-related outages. Moving on now to Slide 9. We know there is quite a bit of interest in our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. This visual shows you by state the projects and megawatts in the pipeline. We forecast that approximately 5,000 megawatts of projects will generate highly contracted revenue, resulting in approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually. This is in addition to our nuclear plant Comanche Peak at 300 megawatts. All in, Vistra Zero is expected to be in the range of at least 7,300 megawatts of carbon-free generation by 2026. We have a clear line of sight to our project pipeline, as demonstrated by our recently announced Moss Landing expansion by another 350 megawatts, our acquisition of the 110 megawatt Angus solar development in Texas and our 450-megawatt coal-to-solar initiative in Illinois. That's a total of 900 megawatts of planned renewable developments announced in the past five months. And we expect to bring on three projects in ERCOT in the very near future, 260 megawatts of storage at DeCordova, plus 158 megawatts at Brightside and Emerald Grove. It is important to note that we continue to believe in the strength and growth opportunities at Vistra Zero despite the recent unplanned outages we have experienced at our Moss Landing 300 and 100 battery storage sites. We are committed to helping California and the country, as a whole, transition to cleaner sourced electricity and batteries will undoubtedly play an important role. This is a new technology and it will continue to improve. These incidents give us and the industry important insights as we move the country forward in the energy transition. Notably, we believe the issue has not stemmed from the batteries, but instead appears to be related to failures in the water-based safety system. Our investigations have revealed that the safety system is working. It's just experiencing leaks. We will do what it takes to fix this issue quickly, get the systems back online as soon as practical. And as always, we will do it all with safety as our number one priority. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim?
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 11. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.2 billion, which is $363 million higher than 2020. Retail is approximately $526 million higher than Q4 2020, primarily driven by our accrual of the expected $544 million of securitization proceeds. The favorability was partially offset by mild weather. Period-over-period, the collected generation segments ended the quarter $163 million lower than fourth quarter 2020, driven primarily by lower realized margin in ERCOT and our Sunset segments. Adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $1.941 billion for 2021 after subtracting the favorable bill credit settlement cost. Year-over-year, the retail segment was $329 million higher than 2020, driven primarily by our self-help initiatives, partially offset by net Winter Storm Uri impacts and milder weather in ERCOT. The generation segment year-over-year was $2.15 billion lower than 2020, driven primarily by the Winter Storm Uri losses. While 2021 was significantly impacted by Winter Storm Uri, we believe we are back on track with 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guided to a midpoint of approximately $3 billion. I'm turning now to Slide 12, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2021 execution on the announced capital allocation plan. We executed on our $2 billion share buyback plan with a total of $764 million of buybacks occurring through February 22, 2022. This leaves just over $1.2 billion remaining of buybacks to be completed by year-end 2022. We remain confident that we will achieve this goal. With those buybacks through February 22, we have 448.8 million shares that remain outstanding, representing an approximately 7% reduction in share count or approximately 35 million shares since our last reported share count in the third quarter of 2021 10-Q. We continue to believe that buying back our shares will create a better supply and demand balance, generating a share price more reflective of what we believe to be our true value. Reducing our share count should also result in an increased dividend yield to our shareholders as we execute upon our announced plan to deliver $300 million in annual dividends to our common shareholders through 2026. In keeping with this plan, on February 23, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of our common stock, approximately a 13% increase over our 2021 first quarter dividend amount. The $0.17 per share amount reflects an estimated $75 million of dividend payouts this quarter. The common dividend will be paid on March 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2022. The Board of Directors also declared a dividend on the company's 8% Series A fixed rate reset cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock of $40 per preferred share payable on April 15th to preferred holders of record on April 1st. In accordance with our announced capital allocation plan, we also eliminated approximately $625 million of debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are on track to reach our goal of $1.5 billion debt reduction by year-end 2022, exclusive of project level financing incurred in Vistra Zero. Finally, we previously announced our commitment to allocate capital to attractive strategic growth opportunities. We are executing on this commitment as we pursue the Vistra Zero portfolio. Vistra Zero's expected EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million per year from the 5 gigawatts of storage and renewables projects by 2026 is the type of investment that makes sense financially and is a key component to our portfolio transition. We are excited to be a leader in the energy transition taking shape across our nation. We saw that excitement echoed in the market when our Green Perpetual Preferred Stock issuance was upsized from $750 million to $1 billion while still locking in the low dividend at 7%. Even better, we learned that green-focused accounts drove nearly 25% of the total green perpetual preferred stock allocations and 4 of the top 10 holders were green-focused accounts. In closing, we continue to believe that our execution of this capital allocation plan will continue to unlock the value of Vistra as we return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while transitioning our asset base. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we execute throughout 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Curt Morgan: Hi, good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: So I wanted to start with a fairly high-level question on private market appetite for assets and for cash flows. Now this is a topic that I know you all think about a lot over time, but the – I guess, our sense is the private market has a very strong bid for assets with strong cash flows. You all obviously have very strong cash flows. Those buyers also might have a different point of view on leverage. And I just – I see this large disconnect that's been around for quite some time in terms of the kinds of valuations and cash flows that the private market would be willing to accept versus where the public market is pricing your stock. And then you're taking great steps to take advantage of that, you have a lot of capital flexibility, but there seems to be this persistent disconnect between the private and public market. And I'm just curious to get your latest thoughts on that disconnect. Are there ways to take advantage of that? What's your latest thinking there?
Curt Morgan: Well, I think, you outlined the things from a private market perspective that would be attractive about a company like ours, right? So I can't argue with those attributes because I believe they exist. I think I've said this before that we're a big-sized company in terms of a private market transaction. I was with a private equity firm, they have their own set of issues with their LPs in terms of what they can invest in. And they're getting the same pressures on ESG as anybody else. So I think the long-term valuation question that comes up with companies like ours and other fossil fuel-oriented companies, even though we're shifting, tend to come up in a private market setting as they do in a public market setting. Having said that, I think the investments we're making would be attractive on a private market basis. So look, I think we should be attractive, both in public markets and in private markets. I get the point that you make, that this company could be suitable to being in the private markets. And I think there are attributes that make us attractive. So I can't argue with that. Other than that, I can't say anything more than that because there's nothing really to say. I think you're right about that, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And are there ways beyond, obviously, just at the corporate level, more at the asset level, where you could optimize, find ways to essentially bring cash back at yields that are essentially lower than the stock overall to take advantage of this dynamic?
Curt Morgan: There could be, yes. We, at time to time, have looked at that and we did not see what we thought were accretive transactions. But yes, there are opportunities and could be opportunities like that, and that's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. So if there is an opportunity like that, we'd be interested in it. And so, it's one of the things that we look at.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Just one last one for me. Just on storage, you gave a good update there. I was just curious in terms of just next steps in resolution of determining liability. Who's liable for the damages? Are you optimistic about sort of recovery of costs that you've incurred there? Could you just speak a little bit more to kind of next steps there on the storage operational issues?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean, here's the reality. We have warranties with our contractors and equipment suppliers and we have insurance. There are deductibles with the insurance. But we do – one way or another, we feel like we are covered in this from a cost standpoint. The area where it gets gray sometimes is when you want to improve the current situation, which we are undoubtedly going to want to do. And then there's a question about who pays for those improvements and we'll sort through that. I think the biggest thing we're doing now is we're focused with our contractors and equipment manufacturers to work together because this is bigger than just Vistra or bigger than any one contractor or manufacturer. This is about the long-term transition in the energy sector and batteries have to work. And these two facilities are critical to the summer and beyond. And so I think what we're trying to do is keep this in a situation where we're working together and we're not splintered. And I think once you start going to battle stations on this, then it creates even more issues. I think there's a way to do this in partnership with the folks that worked with us on bringing these two facilities up, and that's what we're going to do. But I think at the end of the day, Stephen, that we have warranties and we have insurance. And we believe that, ultimately, the lion's share of the cost of this are going to be borne by others, but I'll just say that this company is committed to bringing these facilities back online. The good news in my mind is it's not huge money to really fix these the way that they need to be fixed. We're talking about basically the transportation and storage of water and then the release of water into each individual battery module. That should be able to be done in every building and every manufacturing facility in this country and in the world. There are water-based fire suppression systems that do that very thing. And it's frustrating to me that we could not put a system in place that work. These were turnkey deals, we expected the engineering to be right and we're going to get it right. And I think we can do it relatively quickly, and we will get this done right. So we'll sort out the rest of it, but we do have the things in place that you would expect us to, to make sure that we're covered from a cost standpoint.
Stephen Byrd: Really clear and very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Good morning. Hi, Curt.
Curt Morgan: Hi, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Just on that topic on the Moss Landing issues. The two units have different EPC contractors. So I guess, is it more the actual equipment not kind of working as supposed to or design or not clear?
Curt Morgan: It's – look, I got to be careful about because we're still going through all this. I think, Steve, there's a little bit of difference, we believe, in what happened at Moss Landing 300 in the initial phase versus Moss Landing 100. And there are subtleties to all of this. But I think that you hit the areas that we're focused on. It's whether the parts, some of the parts that were part of the water-based heat suppression system were either not installed correctly and/or they had a defect to them or that the design of the overall system needs to be improved. And I think there's – frankly, Steve, there's an element to all of that. And that's what makes it a little complicated in sorting all this out. And I'm just being as honest as I can be about it that, that's what we – we'll end up sorting out in the long run. And I think we've made a lot of progress on it. I think we were making a lot of progress on Moss 300 until 100 happen. And that opened up some additional learnings that we are taking into account. And I think we'll take all of those together and come up with the right game plan for both 300 and 100 to get this right. But there are elements of each of the things you mentioned, Steve, in both the Moss 300 and the Moss 100 situation, but they're a little bit different for each one, and that's about all I can say about it.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And a separate topic, just commodity exposure overall, could you just maybe give a sense of kind of how to think? Obviously, commodities are moving around a decent amount. How to think about kind of your position 2022, but maybe more importantly, 2023/2024 to kind of come up – I know you gave your hedging, but just maybe kind of frame it broadly on how to think about it.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So in 2022, we're pretty hedged. So probably not a lot to talk about. Although we are carrying a little more length going into this summer than what we would normally carry. I think that most of the markets we're in, the price of power is set in many hours by a natural gas unit. So we effectively are long natural gas equivalents as a company. But we also have, obviously, a big short position on, which is our retail business. But we're net long. And I think in 2023 and beyond, we have length, gas length. And it feels to me, I'm not particularly good at predicting commodities, but we're in it. And I think we know it pretty well. But it does feel like we're in a period where natural gas, in particular, is probably going to be set at a little bit higher level than the old $2.50 to $3. It's feeling more to me like $3.50 to $4 or more. You're seeing that U.S. gas is being connected to worldwide gas. We've got geopolitical issues and those are likely to persist for some time, with Russian gas into Europe, China has a big appetite as well as the rest of Asia. And so gas is beginning to trade on a global basis. And it feels like whether it's artificial or not, there's tightness in that system on a worldwide basis which is probably going to mean in the next few years, potentially several years, that we're just at a little higher plateau for gas. That in the long run, is good for our company, given that we are long natural gas equivalent. So I think we're positioned well. The real key though is for us to manage the volatility and to take advantage of it. Because I do believe that regardless of where it settles, the one thing we can pretty much bet on is that it's going to be volatile just given the geopolitical issues that persist in the world. I think our team is up to that challenge and can take advantage of that. Volatility is something that if you're good at it, you can benefit from it. And I think we're in a good position to do that. I don't know if – Jim is on, too. I don't know if he has anything he wants to add to that.
Jim Burke: Yes, sure, Curt. Hi Steve, I would only add that as we put out our guidance last fall, we have certainly seen commodity complex move up considerably. We see it particularly even outside of ERCOT. Spark spreads are up $3 to $5. We are largely open to that, particularly when you get to 2023 and 2024. We're less than 20% hedged out in that 2024 and beyond time frame, and you see us more hedged in 2023. We just put that hedge disclosure out. Still just about 25% hedged to spark out in 2023. So it's nice to see the diversification of the portfolio where, at times, we've seen ERCOT run, but not the other areas. Now we're seeing some of the other areas really have some swing up and we have good opportunities to capture that. And as Curt mentioned, we'll get through the summer, and we'll come out with our guidance for 2023. And we'll hopefully give some view as to how the out years look, but it's been a favorable move overall over the complex since we put out the guidance last fall.
Curt Morgan: Steve, one other thing just to tell you is that while we've seen forwards move, the liquidity in the markets has been limited. And that's because I think the markets are – the bid and the ask are trying to figure out where this thing is going to settle out and whether some of these geopolitical issues are long-lived or short-lived. And so it takes some time and patience to manage in this type of an environment, and you have to pick and choose the right time to do it. And just – it's not a cautionary note, but more of just a factual one, that the liquidity in the markets has been somewhat limited just because buyers and sellers are trying to sort out whether these are long-term moves or not. Again, if you're in the market every day and you're patient and you take it as it comes, you can take advantage of this. And I think that's what we're trying to do.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Last quick question, just on the pace of the buyback. Should we assume if the stock stays in this rough area that you're going to continue an aggressive pace? Or do you think you'll kind of more average it out over the rest of the period?
Curt Morgan: Well, go ahead.
Jim Burke: I'm sorry. We've made the commitment, obviously, we've made the commitment to continue down this buyback to be able to deliver the $2 billion buyback by the end of the year. We've made I think tremendous progress so far, Steve. And I think, hopefully, these disclosures, which come out periodically, folks saw it with the dividend increase of approximately 13%, obviously being reflective of how aggressive we've been on the buybacks. But since we're just a little over 1/3 of the way through that program, we've got a good ways to go through the end of this year, but we feel very good about it. And then we've announced, as we've said before, we intend to do another $1 billion in 2023. So I think the program has been well executed up to this point, and we're going to continue to be aggressive through the balance of the year.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Thanks Steve.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the opportunity.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Do you hear me?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Can you hear us?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Curt, if I could go back, we were talking a lot about Vistra Zero a couple of questions ago. But of the $450 million to $500 million, how much of this EBITDA is effectively locked in, if you will, right? Can you talk about the cadence of this EBITDA materializing? You've obviously had great success already. How much of this effectively have you sort of captured? How much of it is "yet to go?" And effectively, how much of this eventually comes from California given your perhaps disproportionate successes in that geography. Do you guys hear me? Excuse me.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Sorry, I was talking, Julien, and I had it on mute. So I think we said that both Illinois and California that the underlying revenue streams and EBITDA were about sort of 50% contracted based on the constructs in both of those. They're different constructs, but they ended up coming out about the same, a little bit over that. In Texas, we will contract essentially 100% of those with our – likely with our retail business. And so if you just look at Vista Zero on an isolated basis – and then on a megawatt basis, we're probably looking at maybe half coming out of Texas or so. And so that pushes you into kind of the, I'd say, 2/3 contracted, something like that, just in pure math. And so I'd say that's about what it is. And then, of course, we will try to hedge as we go on further. Jim, anything you want to add to that? But that's the quick math in my head tells me that we'll be somewhere in that range, just given the way that we are contracted both in California and Illinois, how we expect the contract in fact.
Jim Burke: Curt, that's correct. And Julien, we put out announcements. What we've tried to do is give the five-year view which we did in the fall, and then we want to keep filling that in so that we can talk to our investors in the market about how are we progressing. So we announced – since the fall, we had announced the fact that we had completed this Illinois coal to solar through the legislative activities, that's progressing well. We'll be going to the procurement of the REC contract here shortly, the Angus solar facility and then the Moss 350 which would be the third phase of Moss Landing. All of that, that 900 megawatts there, is going towards that 5 gigawatts. But then importantly, we've got three projects coming online right now. We've got Brightside at 50 megawatts, Emerald Grove, 108 megawatts, Grove solar facilities in Texas and then a DeCordova energy store will be on the spring 260 megawatts. That's the unique hybrid project where we paired the combustion turbine with the one hour battery, incredibly flexible, instant ramp but with 24/7 duration, if needed. Those are all coming online now, and that's part of what we want to do is keep bringing the awareness that this is real. It's coming online, and we're going to continue to roll out the announcements, both when we secure the projects and have the contracts to back them, but also as they come online physically.
Curt Morgan: Julien, sorry, but these are 10- to 15- to 20-year type contracts, just to remind you that there's a mix of that. But go ahead, sorry.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. No, no, please. I mean on the $450 million to $500 million though, so what's the cadence? How quickly does that ramp, right? So how do you think about the EBITDA profile in say, 2023, 2024, 2025 in the interim? And when I said locked in, what I was trying to get at, is how much of a line of sight do you have on that EBITDA already versus having to win contracts still in California? I.e., is there upside in that $450 million to $500 million? Maybe even said differently.
Curt Morgan: Yes. I'd say – go ahead, Jim.
Jim Burke: In the earnings deck, I do think you can get a view, Curt covered the map of the U.S. And what we've done here is put the items that are basically inked and ready to go, we've itemized. And then the other items where we've left the queue, where we said, here's what we have line of sight to but don't have a contract to back in California, that was just over a gigawatt of storage capabilities. And then in Texas, we have 1.3 gigs of other opportunities. Some of those we do have within our portfolio. We're just not ready to announce those yet. So of the five gigs, roughly 2.5 to three, what we would say, line of sight secured. And then the rest, we're going to continue to develop over the next couple of years and feel confident that by the 2026 time frame, we can at least have accomplished this level of development.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Yes, at least. And just separately, but in parallel with this, I mean, I do want to touch on the strategic aspect here. I mean you guys have substantial plants that are retiring. These have existing latent transmission interconnect, right? So you've got a leg up, shall we say, on independent renewable developers. And in this environment in which so many developers are struggling to get that interconnect, can you speak to your ability to monetize and effectively capitalize on your existing position on the grid from a transmission perspective? It seems like you're doing so already, but again I'd love to hear that from an even more holistic perspective beyond just the narrow context of the plants that you talked about.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean, it's been why we have been able to build this, in my opinion, why we've been able to build this business. Because it's all started, frankly, with California and with that Moss Landing site, which, if anybody has ever been out there, it's a world-class industrial site in the state that doesn't have many of those. So there's a scarcity value to that site. There's a scarcity value to our Oakland site as well as our Morro Bay site, all of which have transmission yards right next to them and access to transmission. And then if you think about it, we've got the same type of situation in Texas. We have multiple sites that were either purchased many years ago to put a power plant on that never happened, but have access to transmission because the site – the reason we bought the sites is because of their proximity to transmission or they already had a transmission interconnect. And of course, the nine sites in Illinois all have transmission interconnect. In fact, the transmission system was built around those assets. We also have the two sites – at least the two sites in Ohio, the two coal sites that we think ultimately will be available to us for batteries and solar. Same thing is we've got an opportunity at our NEPCO site that came from Dynegy in Pennsylvania. So there's a number of opportunities – and transmission, you're right about this. I mean, we're seeing that PJM is struggling to keep up with transmission interconnect. We know that MISO is because we're working with those guys as well. And so having that access and in particular that proximity, because there's also a cost in many of those markets to interconnect, and if it's significant, it can weigh down the economics of any particular project. And if you're right next the transmission, because that site was obviously used previously by a power plant, it just changes the game. So I think it's something that we started doing. I'm not going to – it was because we had a good site and PG&E knew it and they came to us. But it's something that we can replicate across the country with the sites that we have as we retire plants. We can add batteries and battery storage and solar. We would do win too if it was the right economic decision, it just hasn't been that way.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. I will leave it there. Thank you guys.
Curt Morgan: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Shahriar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just, you guys, I think you've hit the EBITDA question pretty well. But just given sort of the strong start, you have visibility, you guys are fairly hedged. Any thoughts on narrowing the 22 range in 2Q versus the traditional 3Q time frame following some visibility in June, July? I mean the range remained somewhat wide and you guys do have a lot of good visibility. So just some thoughts there.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Look, I think we'll take a look at it around second quarter, because we will have July pretty much in the bucket. But August is the biggest month for us in the summer. And because we've carried more length going into the summer and the winter months, that is what creates the wider distribution. But I think – look, I think we always look at it. And if we feel like we have a high degree of confidence one way or another, we would come to the market with that. But because August is such a big month, and in Texas, September – the first part of September can always be a game changer, we've been hesitant really, Shahriar, to come out and change that until we got into the third quarter call. And in fact, from a retail perspective, the shoulder months are really what are key, and that can be months like October. So that's why we've been a little more hesitant to change. But because we did widen the guidance, I think we'll take a look at it. I just think it's going to be – come down to confidence. And because we're carrying a little bit more length, we may be less apt to do that, but we'll see.
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. And I know, Curt [ph] it's minor, but it looks like year-over-year customer losses in the Eastern markets kind of continued for another quarter. Can you just maybe touch on what you're seeing in this segment in terms of attrition. Just the ability to add new customers. It seems like Texas is doing well. But any color there would be helpful.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Look, I mean, we'll call a spade here. I mean, Crius has been – we've struggled, and it's because it was a predominantly door-to-door channel. And door-to-door has suffered because of COVID. You can't go knocking on people's doors with COVID. So we have pivoted to digital offering, but it's been a struggle. The other thing is, is that the standard service offers were hedged out and we've seen power prices go up. And so what's happened is there's been a squeeze on margin. And people also, because the standard service offers have been lower than where market is from some of the retail providers like us, they've moved over to standard offer. That's going to change as those standard offers roll off and there'll be an opportunity. And we're also beginning to get back out on the door to door, but we're also strengthening our other channels. So I think over time, we think we can build back what we've lost, but it's an unfortunate thing that would happen with COVID, and it disproportionately affected Crius because of the door-to-door nature of that channel. But we think we can build it back over time. And Scott Hudson, who's on this call with us is – he and his team have a good plan to do that and it's going to take time, Shahriar. It's not an overnight thing. We think we can do it. The good news is Ambit has been particularly good in Texas. And we've also sort of moved into more of a value offering rather than just an offering on price. We've been successful with that. Our consultants are doing a really good job in that particular channel. And so we're very happy with the Ambit acquisition, in particular, in the ERCOT market in Texas. Crius has struggled some. Overall, though still both very good acquisitions and we think in the long run were the right things to do. And Texas just overall, in particular with TXU Energy, when we went through Uri and some other things, that flight to quality was big. And obviously, TXU Energy was part of that flight to quality and so we grew customers in a significant way. 23,000 customers in a year for us is a big deal down in ERCOT, because as you know, we had typically lost a slight amount of customers in the last few years. But we've been able to turn that tide around and add customers. So that's kind of the lay of the land for retail.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just literally one last question. I know you're getting this a lot on the private side, single asset, whole company, whatever. But just – and it makes sense, given where valuations are. But I just want to confirm something, maybe just round out exactly what the key message is, is this an exercise you even looked at? I mean has there been serious considerations internally around this path or at this juncture when you're looking at sort of the visibility, you're looking at the clean energy, the transitioning. It's just the plan is too cemented to even give it a serious consideration. So if you could just round out everything and just give us a sense on whether you can kick the tires around there.
Curt Morgan: Well, look, here's – what I'll say about that is after Uri, Shahriar, regardless of what we determined about why it happened, you can't ignore the fact that it happened. And so the Board and the management team went to work. And so we looked at a very broad set of actions that we should consider in the wake of that event. And I'll just say that everything got looked at and looked at seriously. And so I think the Board, along with the management team, are – and I know this is going to sound cliche, but I just honestly believe, because I was in the middle of this, we were focused on what we thought was going to bring the most value to the table. The one thing we control, obviously, is our strategy and our capital allocation plan, and we believe we did the right thing around that. Whether there's somebody out there someday that would pay more than what we think that strategy is worth, we're way open-minded on that. And we are flexible in terms of that. Because that's our job at the end of the day, is to get the most value for the company. But in terms of just actively going out and pitching that, we look at that relative to other opportunities. And that's all I can say about it. I just can't get into in more detail. But we are open-minded people and our job is to maximize the value of this company for our current shareholders. And I can guarantee you that's what we're trying to do.
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you for that. I just to want to hit that and concluded. I appreciate it. Thank you guys.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Jonathan. How are you?
Jonathan Arnold: Good. Thank you. Just want to be sure I understand, on the dividend, Curt, your intention is to run at this $75 million per quarter level but declare it on a per share basis each quarter so we could see multiple changes during the year? Or is it set now for the whole of 2022? I want to make sure I got that right.
Curt Morgan: No. Yes, I'll let Jim – Jim can take you through it. Because we looked at a couple of different options and made a call. But Jim, do you want to take them through the details?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, hey Jonathan. We think one of the benefits of this strategy is, as we continue to buy back shares throughout the year, it will constantly change the denominator as we go. So for this quarter, when we announced the dividend, we set the x dividend date from March 21 and the record date for March 22. We had to estimate how many shares do we think will be outstanding by that point in time because we're going to continue to buy back shares. And then that's how we set the dividend rate at $0.17. And then we're going to come back in the next quarter and we'll do the same thing. So you should expect to see, as long as we're consistently out in the marketplace buying back our stock, you would expect to see that increase each quarter as we go. And that gives the investor obviously a sense of just how much of the equity we continue to buy back, but also reward the holders that are continuing to hold the stock that they will see double-digit year-over-year increases in the dividend.
Jonathan Arnold: Great. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on Vistra Zero and the way you intend to sort of communicate around it going forward. Do you foresee this being pulled out as a separate segment or embedded within your current segments? And just I'm curious how you plan to highlight executing against the EBITDA target.
Curt Morgan: Jim, you want to take that, too?
Jim Burke: Sure. Jonathan, as noted on this call and since we announced it last fall, there is a lot of interest in seeing the visibility into Vistra Zero. So we're looking at our segmentation across the business and analyzing the best way to bring that to light, because as folks have covered the space, they are attributing different value to different asset classes. And when we take this investment and we contract it, it becomes meaningful in the eyes of a lot of the investors that we're speaking to, that are putting these much higher multiples on that asset class relative to some of our base business. And so we will probably bring that forward, it will come shortly. I don't know if it will be at this next quarter, it could. But we are looking to bring segmentation that allows our investors to see that as it continues to grow. As you know, the rest of the business, retail is an important part of the business that folks want to continue to have visibility into. So I think it really will come down to how we think about some of our generating assets and which we see a lot of cash flow coming off these assets don't necessarily get as high a multiple as we think they deserve, but we also think that the power of the capital allocation plan is to buy back the equity, obviously continue to pay down debt, as we said, consistent with our target. But if we can bring that Vistra Zero to light, continue to do the capital allocation steps that we have outlined last fall, we think both the sum of the parts as well as just the sheer force of the capital allocation program that we have instituted, we're going to realize a better Vistra value overall.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And I will leave with that.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Jonathan.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Well, thanks, everybody, again for – I know it's a busy season here, obviously, when – all the earnings calls, but thanks for being on. Look, we feel like we've turned the corner here and strengthened our company. We derisked it. We've got a very good set of priorities that we're working on and a capital allocation plan that matches that. And so we think the future is bright. So thank you for your time.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Vistra Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra’s third quarter 2021 results conference call, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today’s investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today’s press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. While we have a lot to cover today, we will do our best to be as jiffy as possible to leave sufficient time for Q&A. Not only will we be discussing our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, but we are also initiating our 2022 guidance as is customary on our third quarter results call. And most importantly, we are laying out additional details of our long-term capital allocation plan, which I’m excited to share with you. So, let’s get started. It’s hard to believe we are still in the same year where we experienced the significant effects from Winter Storm Uri. I’m proud of how our company has recovered from a business standpoint, and we are beginning to execute on our strategic priorities, which are a product of a thorough review with the Board that have begun prior to Uri but accelerated greatly immediately on the heels of the storm. We will discuss these priorities in more detail later. Consistent with the bounce-back of our business, slide 6 reports our strong third quarter financial results, despite a weak Texas summer where Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion or $1.167 billion, excluding the impacts from Winter Storm Uri realized in the third quarter, which included a small positive impact from ERCOT’s 180-day resettlement statements. As of September 30th, Vistra has already achieved approximately 85% of the $500 million self-help target we announced following Uri, and all of that done without really impacting any future periods. And we have a clear line of sight to achieving the balance in the fourth quarter. The combination of our solid execution on these self-help initiatives together with the inclusion of the approximately $500 million in proceeds we expect to realize from ERCOT’s securitization of certain charges allocated to load serving entities during Uri, we are in a position today to both, narrow and raise our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range as shown on the slide. The securitization and self-help materially offset the more than $2 billion loss from Uri, such as the retail bill credits we will discuss later. As you likely recall, internal and third-party analysis has shown that Vistra’s Uri loss was driven predominantly by the uncontrollable failure of the Texas Intrastate gas system. We are also narrowing and revising our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance, which is similarly reflected on slide 6. The cash flow associated with securitization is expected to be received in the first half of 2022. Consequently, the cash impact of securitization is reflected in our 2022 guidance on the next slide. So, turning to slide 7, Vistra is initiating its 2022 guidance today, forecasting ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion, with ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. This represents a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 76%, which is higher than our historical conversion ratio due to the anticipated receipt of the securitization proceeds in the first half of 2022. On slide 7, we also offer an illustrative view of Vistra’s 2022 guidance ranges, which exclude Winter Storm Uri related bill credits of approximately $185 million, and also the negative in-year impact from the execution of NPV-positive long-dated contracts with retail customers of approximately $55 million and the $500 million of securitization proceeds in free cash flow before growth only. We believe this illustrative view is the best way to think about Vistra’s future financial performance potential as it demonstrates the long-term earnings power and cash generation of the business. Notably, the adverse impact from the bill credits in 2022 guidance are more than offset by the securitization included in the 2021 updated guidance. In fact, securitization will likely more than offset the retail bill credits across all years. Looking beyond 2022, Vistra’s long-term view of our earnings power remains robust. The Company is less hedged in 2023 and beyond, which affords an even greater opportunity to capture momentum from the rising curves we have observed in recent months. In fact, we have seen a move up in both gas and heat rate in ERCOT as the gap between market and our fundamental view converge, which we have similarly seen in the last several years. In fact, this conversion has resulted in projected results using market curves for the next several years, in line with our stated view that we can generate consistent EBITDA of $3 billion or greater. Previously, the out years using steeply backwardated market curves were below $3 billion. This leaves us in a stronger position to optimize our EBITDA within the $3 billion or greater EBITDA range, especially as we add our growth investments. We continue to remain confident in the ability of this business to earn significant cash flow on an annual basis, and we intend to return a majority of that cash flow to our financial stakeholders in the years ahead, as I will outline on the next few slides. Slide 8 sets forth the four key priorities that our recent strategic review identified. We believe the best way to unlock the value inherent in this business and maximize value for our financial stakeholders is to drive long-term sustainable value through our integrated business model, which has been strengthened following Uri through various investments in our fleet and fuel supply as well as our enhanced risk management practices; return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and a meaningful dividend program, especially for as long as our stock remains at what we believe is such a meaningful discount to its fundamental value. And if our stock responds, we will continue to return that capital in the most optimal way to our shareholders. The key is that we generate substantial capital year-over-year, and we intend to return a significant amount to our shareholders. Also, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. And last but not least, accelerate our Vistra Zero growth pipeline with cost-effective capital. As we set forth on the next slide, our long-term capital allocation plan reflects these strategic priorities. Vistra’s long-term capital allocation plan reflects an anticipated return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to its common stockholders through year-end 2026 while simultaneously reducing our corporate level -- leverage and accelerating our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. Specifically, as we announced in October, our Board recently approved a $2 billion share repurchase program which we expect to fully execute by year-end 2022. The share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued last month. We then expect we will allocate approximately $1 billion per year towards share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of $6 billion in five years. And again, if our stock responds, we will reallocate those funds back to our shareholders in similar cost-effective manner. This $6 billion of return of capital represents more than 60% of our current market cap. This significant amount of capital allocated to share repurchases is evidence of both management and the Board’s conviction of the long-term earnings power of the business, juxtaposed with what we believe is a significant undervaluation of our stock. We will expect we will continue to prioritize share repurchases so long as we believe our stock is undervalued. And let me tell you, in my view, we have a long way to go. We are also reinforcing our commitment to paying a meaningful and growing dividend. Rather than identifying a target annual growth rate for our dividend, management expects that it will, subject to Board approval at the appropriate time, allocate $300 million per year toward its common dividend. As we retire more and more of our shares over time, this $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares and will offer potentially outsized growth on the remaining shares. For example, if we were to execute all $6 billion worth of the share repurchases at our recent stock price, our annualized dividend per share would grow by more than 175% by year-end 2026. At our current share price, these share repurchases and dividend programs are projected to result in an annual average cash yield on the stock of an attractive 15%. As always, we are also committed to a strong balance sheet. We expect we will retire another approximately $1.5 billion of corporate level debt by the end of next year and up to $3 billion by 2026 with projections of debt-to-EBITDA in the mid to high-2s during this time frame for the Vistra base business. Per our previous comments, we expect to combine project financing with renewable-related preferred equity and cash flows from existing renewable projects to cost effectively develop our current nearly 5 gigawatt renewable and battery pipeline over the next five years using only $500 million of our own capital. And that is $500 million on a cumulative basis over the five-year period, a significantly lower estimate than our previous expectation of spending approximately $500 million per year on growth capital. These funds can now be used to support other capital allocation priorities, especially share repurchases. It is important to note that Vistra Zero will be a highly contracted business with third-party and internal PPAs. So, the leverage ratios will be commensurate with similarly situated businesses. Slide 10 outlines the sources and uses for the long-term capital allocation plan that I just laid out. Importantly, we expect we will be able to execute on this capital allocation plan by growing our Vistra Zero renewable and battery storage portfolio to a more than 5 gigawatt business, generating approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually by year-end 2026. We are excited about this long-term capital allocation plan and believe strongly that it is the best way to maximize the value of our business as we expect we will return the majority of our free cash flow from our base business to our financial stakeholders while being mindful of our overall leverage levels and cost effectively accelerating our renewables and battery storage growth pipeline, which should ultimately be valued at a higher multiple over time. Using the midpoint of the Vistra Zero EBITDA of $475 million by 2026 and a 14 times multiple would result in a total value of $6.65 billion for these projects. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic review we undertook was thorough, evaluating multiple scenarios and potential paths to unlock shareholder value. Ultimately, we believe the path we have outlined here today will be the path that will result in the greatest financial reward over time, taking into account risk of execution, cost effectiveness and economies of scale. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim?
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion, results that are comparable to our third quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $205 million higher than third quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives and the lower cost of goods sold in 2021. The collective generation segment ended the quarter $211 million lower than third quarter 2020, driven primarily by the lower realized energy margin in Texas, East and Sunset after a very strong 2020. Turning now to slide 13. We wanted to briefly touch on the momentum we have seen in spark spreads across the markets where we operate. Since September, we’ve seen a dramatic rise in commodity pricing across the board as gas prices, power prices and spark spreads are all climbing higher for 2022 and beyond. This is true in all the markets where we operate, though we highlight our two largest markets, ERCOT and PJM on the slide. As a general rule, Vistra is a company that benefits from higher natural gas price environments as gas units are typically the marginal units setting the price of power, leading to higher overall power prices. We expect this will benefit us in the outer years where we are less hedged. As of October 31st, Vistra is now 27% and 50% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, respectively, for 2023. We are hedged at relatively similar levels in New York, New England, CAISO and MISO as we have taken advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads over the last couple of months which are rising more in line with our fundamental point of view. We expect our commercial team will continue to take advantage of commodity pricing volatility, working to position our integrated operations to earn a relatively stable earnings profile over time. I’m turning now to slide 14, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2022 financial guidance. We believe the illustrative guidance in the range of $3.05 billion to $3.55 billion, adding back the impact of the Uri-related bill credits and the year one impact of various NPV positive long-dated retail contracts is the best way to think about the long-term earnings power of this business. We continue to believe that Vistra will be able to convert a majority of its adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth. Similarly, our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth includes the anticipated receipt of securitization proceeds in addition to the other Uri impacts, such as bill credits. So, our illustrative guidance removes these for a more normalized view of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth. A strong conversion percentage, as shown on the slide, enables the significant return of capital that Curt discussed while also supporting a strong balance sheet and the transformation of our fleet with our Vistra Zero pipeline. Before we close this morning, I wanted to briefly address our long-term leverage target in pursuit of investment-grade credit ratings which I know has been a strategic question for many of you following Uri. Foundationally, a strong balance sheet is core to Vistra’s strategy. Our low leverage level proved critical during Uri as our financial strength supported our ability to quickly add more than $2 billion of debt in response to the storm. As outlined on slide 15, we believe our current leverage in the range of approximately 3 to 3.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA is a leverage level that will afford us the same level of financial strength. We believe we will be able to maintain our leverage in this range in the near term and reach the mid to high 2s over the next five years. We also believe that we would still be a candidate for investment-grade credit ratings in the future as our corporate leverage drops below 3 times and any project financing will relate to a lower risk contracted part of the business, though, as we said recently, we believe this opportunity is at least a few years in the future. In closing, as I hope you can see from the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out today, we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. By prioritizing returning the majority of our capital to our financial stakeholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet and pursuing accelerated growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, we believe that we will unlock the value of our business over time. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hey. Good morning and congratulations on laying out a very thoughtful capital allocation approach. So, I wanted to focus on Vistra Zero and the updated guidance here. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it’s fairly capital light from your perspective, as you mentioned, $5 billion in total capital needed, but only $500 million in net capital from Vistra net of project debt, other financing, cash flow, et cetera. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? I guess, I was thinking that’s a fairly high level of project leverage. And we can get that typically when we have contract durations of 20, 25 years. I thought it might be more challenging to achieve that level of leverage here. And what gives you the confidence in sort of such a capital-wide approach?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, I’ll take a first shot at that and then Jim, feel free to jump in. But -- so, I think, we’re also looking at sort of what I’ll call a kick-start upfront tranche of capital. We haven’t determined exactly what that tranche will look like, but it will be equity like, let’s put it that way. And then, when you combine that with leverage, Stephen, that’s more around about 60% type leverage, project leverage with the contracted cash flows. So, it’s not like we’re putting 80% leverage. But I think the other thing that’s missing maybe in this is the effort that we’re pursuing to bring in another tranche of capital in here of some consequence. And then, when we look at the cash flows off of the business and the maintenance expense and things because it’s fairly low for these types of assets, we generate enough cash, along with project financing and this project capital along with our $500 million to basically self-fund the build-out of the roughly 5 gigs through 2026. So, we have looked at this. We feel comfortable with how we’re setting it up. Clearly, we would like to grow it even further than that, and I expect us to add to the pipeline, whether that’s through acquiring projects or potentially even a platform. But just what is line of sight that we have already in the Q, we feel like we can raise sufficient capital, and through the cash flows, that would be more than adequate to be able to run that business. Jim, anything you want to add?
Jim Burke: Curt, you covered it well. The only thing that I would amplify is that we intend to structure the PPAs from these assets back to Vistra to create the contracted cash flows. That gives us the chance then to put 60% to 70% project debt. The balance comes from the three sources Curt mentioned, the parent contribution of less than $500 million, some form of structured financing or equity and then the cash flows from the projects themselves. And so when we think of this as a self-sustaining entity and an entity that can grow even faster than we anticipated when we announced this pipeline last summer. And so, I think it gives us a way to use more cost-effective capital and still take advantage of the opportunities, given the pipeline of great sites that we have.
Stephen Byrd: That’s really helpful and makes a lot of sense. And then, just on the 5 gigawatt target by year-end 2026, could you just give us your latest thoughts on sort of visibility of growth, degree of competition, sort of how you see that sort of playing out?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Go ahead, Jim.
Jim Burke: Sure. Thanks, Curt. What we try to do here, Stephen, is focus on where we’ve got a strong place to start, which is sites that we have control over. Its focus right now is primarily Texas, California and now with Coal to Solar, the Illinois fleet. We have a few opportunities at a couple of other coal plants that we intend to convert. But, this does not include -- as Curt mentioned, this does not include an expectation of prospecting for a bunch of sites we don’t have control over or an M&A type platform. So, I think we’ve got a really good pipeline that we can set up based on our partnerships. We’ve got very good partnerships on the solar side and the EPC side and our batteries. And so, it’s really just a matter of taking advantage of this methodically over the next five years. And then, in addition to that, I think there’s other opportunities that Curt mentioned. But, this is our focus, not a heavy focus on PJM, and I also ISO New England at this point, those are possibilities. But, what we’ve got in front of us is quite a bit.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Stephen, you know we have Moss Landing site that can take probably up to another 1,000 megawatts. We have a site called Morro Bay, which can be up to 700 megawatts. Those are both in California. We have a number of sites. We’re one of the largest landholders, especially at our sites that have some of the old coal plants in Texas. We obviously know that market quite well. And we’re partnering in California with the utilities there. And then, of course, we are in the Omnibus Energy Legislation in Illinois. We pursued that for three years out of thin air and raised this Coal to Solar and battery storage legislation that then was -- woven into the ultimate Omnibus bill. So, I think we came up with an idea to utilize sites that already have transmission access in many of the areas where the assets were being shut down or were already retired. And that’s proven to work very well. And I think we have other opportunities down the road.
Stephen Byrd: It’s a great point. I mean the site value from any of those sites in places like California, Illinois, clearly quite high. So, thanks so much for the color. I appreciate it.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just a two-part question on ‘23. Curt, you indicated you’re pretty open still. Is your fundamental view for more expansion in sparks as we draw closer? And directionally, can you just also indicate where EBITDA would shake out under the current dynamic?
Curt Morgan: Yes. For ‘23 now, you’re talking about?
Shahriar Pourreza: Yes, please. Yes, yes, perfect.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, look, we had a period of time where sparks were compressed. They’ve actually come back to what I’d call a more normalized level, but there’s still a fair amount of backwardation in the curve going from ‘22 to ‘23. I think our fundamental view would suggest there’s still room to move with the curves relative to the fundamental view in 2023. But, the one good thing is that that -- those two curves, market and our fundamental view -- our point of view have converged significantly, and I think I made it in my remarks. But we’re now seeing over the next five years, EBITDA levels that are $3 billion plus even at the curves. And prior to that, Shahriar, we were seeing -- when you marked it to the curve, below $3 billion. So, that has converged significantly. In terms of the spark spreads, there’s probably some further what I’ll call normalization that can occur in ‘23 on sparks. And so, yes, there could be some of that movement. But, we’ve seen a pretty strong move in sparks. But, if you take a look at ‘22 sparks versus ‘23 sparks, they’re still about, I’m going to say, maybe about $4 difference. And we would expect that to -- that gap to close. And so, there is some upward mobility and our fundamental view shows that. In terms of directionally, ‘22 to ‘23, we always say this, but I want to be clear this time that we’re within the range of being in a very similar EBITDA level on using that illustrative EBITDA number. And when I say that, that’s plus or minus a couple of hundred million dollars, because an open position can go either way, depending on weather. And so, -- but we’re well within the bounds of where we are in ‘22 for ‘23. And I would say, directionally, when we look at the distribution of outcomes, probably with a greater probability of upside versus downside, just knowing where the curves are, where our fundamental view is, and knowing that our commercial team is able to take advantage of when the curves are in -- are at the point of view or better. So, I feel good about 2023. I think directionally, it’s in that range, and now we have to go out and execute and capture that value.
Shahriar Pourreza: Right. At least at a minimum, the reality versus your view is starting to align, which is what you’ve been pitching for a while, so it’s good to see that. And then, the $4 billion in additional buybacks is predicated, obviously, on your view of the stock value, right? Any guidance here on what you see, Curt, as something of a more sustainable free cash flow yield?
Curt Morgan: Well, yes, that’s -- man, that’s -- I wish I had a crystal ball. But look, I think what I would hope to see, especially with this capital allocation plan and with our execution is something that is much more in the mid-teens and going down into the low double digits. I think that we certainly warrant that when -- I understand that there was a major event in February, and you know this as well as I do that any kind of return is -- part of that is the anticipated risk of the business, and I think that exposed some risk. But, I think once we show how we have invested in our business, we’ve reduced the risk significantly, and we’re able to execute, I would expect that risk premium to come down. And then, I also believe that people are beginning to realize that a combination of renewables, batteries and low heat rate, very efficient fossil fuel, mainly gas plants, is really going to be the right mix of assets going into the next 15 to 20 years, because you’re going to need dispatchable resources for reliability purposes. The market is going to have to pay for those. Clearly, we’re going to need to have clean and green resources going forward, and battery storage is going to be a big piece of that. I think that’s what our company is lining up with. And then, we’ve got this large retail business that I think people don’t think about that we can contract much of our renewable and battery business with. That also has very consistent and significant margins, and we expect that to continue as well. So, we feel like we’re lined up. If we can execute, then we would expect that the risk premium, that is a function of both, a perceived risk in the business model, which I think we are closing, but also the terminal value question, we believe that we have a company that’s here for a long period of time. We should see that risk premium come down. And commensurately, we ought to see a much lower free cash flow yield, which in turn, as you know, means a higher and stronger stock price.
Shahriar Pourreza: Right. Got it. And then, just lastly for me, are you having any coal or sort of material supply challenges with the Sunset fleet?
Curt Morgan: Yes, we are. We are. If you take 2021’s outcome and you take $500 million securitization, you back it off, you’ll notice that we were a little bit under and a big chunk of that, more than half of it, is the challenges we’ve had at the Sunset segment, not just coal constraints, but also we’ve had some outages that were this year that came about. What I would call, though, our coal constraint mainly is an opportunity loss more than anything else. And I’ll tell you why. We have been prioritizing building coal inventory for the winter, because the price curves are saying that it’s much more economic to run in Q1 of ‘22 than it is in Q4 of ‘21. And if you think of it, we have a finite amount of coal because of the supply constraints. We were going to have to optimize between Q4 ‘21 and Q1 of ‘22. We have opted to run a little bit less in Q4 of ‘21 to conserve and preserve the amount of coal we have so that we are going to be there for Q1 of ‘22 because the price curves are telling us that’s where it’s most economic, and that’s what we intend to do. The other thing I’ll tell you is that I’m still a little bit concerned about making sure that the entire grid in Texas is weatherized, including the gas system for this particular winter. And so, we want to be very cautious. We’re going to go into that carrying more length because of that, and we want to make sure that we don’t have any hiccups. And then, just the broader energy commodity complex, as you know, is quite volatile. And so, because of that, we’re taking a very, very conservative approach going into Q1, and that means trying to conserve some of our coal to make sure that we can run in Q1 of ‘22.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Well done, truly. Listen, I wanted to follow up, a couple of easy questions, if I can just start. First off, in terms of the buyback itself here, any thoughts about a tender versus other mechanisms to execute here? Obviously, a lot to buy at hand. And then, separately, related to your -- on the ‘23 EBITDA, just I’ll throw it out there quickly, some inbound questions here. I mean, how are you thinking about that relative to ‘22 levels? I know you said it’s better than 3, but what about better than ‘22, if I can ask you in that way.
Curt Morgan: Jim, do you want to take the first one around buyback, what we’re looking at around buybacks and then we can -- and then if you want to take a stab at the second one, that’s fine, and I can add to it. Go ahead.
Jim Burke: Sure. Good morning, Julien. Thanks for the questions. So, on the buyback, we have -- we are looking at a number of alternatives. We have not settled on the method that we’re going to use, hopefully coming out of this earnings call, we’ll be very aggressive with the buyback program in order to be able to implement the $2 billion by the end of ‘22. We don’t intend to telegraph how we’re going to buy, when we’re going to buy, but we’ll report each quarter how we’ve effectuated the number of shares that we’ve purchased. But, it is a meaningful percentage, as you know, of what’s outstanding, not only for the program through ‘22 but through ‘26. The other question, as we think about ‘23, I think as Curt, you mentioned, we have a large open position in ‘23 relative to ‘22. And that can work obviously to create an overperformance opportunity or come in slightly under, and we’ve seen the curves continue to rise. And I think the commercial team has done a very nice job looking at our point of view and trying to figure out when to put the positions on to be able to manage the expectation. I think, as Curt said, ‘23 was much lower. You saw that with forward curves in the past, particularly this time last year. That gap has closed considerably. It hasn’t fully closed. And then, you see that even in our charts in the slides that we presented for the spark spreads. So, we think ‘23 has a very good chance of being in line with ‘22, but there’s still room. There’s still room for the curves to move, and we still have a large open position. So, we’ve talked about a $3-plus billion business on a run rate basis. And I think the fact is, is that there’s going to be a range around these outcomes. We are in a competitive segment. We’re benefited by having a large retail position that can work almost in a countercyclical manner to the wholesale position at times. But, we still have some variation around it as these -- as the markets have shown some volatility. We view that as something we can capture. So, I think looking at it more in line is where we would expect to be, but we still have a ways to go for the ‘23, given that there’s still some backwardation relative to ‘22.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Got it. So, ways to go. Is it uncertainty or is it still a little bit below…?
Jim Burke: Well, I think, Julien, the way I would describe it, it has -- go ahead, Curt.
Curt Morgan: No, no, no. Go ahead, Jim. Sorry.
Jim Burke: No. I would say, you have -- if you’re simply -- and this is the struggle that we talk about because we have a point of view on the business that has consistently shown that the market curves begin to approach as we get towards a prompt year. So, if all you do is look at where it curves today, and you just look at it and say, lock all that in, it’s going to be lower than ‘22. I mean, that’s just math. That’s not how we run our business. We run our business based on where we think it makes sense to put positions on and where we think curves would likely end up, given supply-demand characteristics in the Q that comes in for new build, et cetera. And so, when we look at it over that basis, we feel that ‘23 has a very good chance to be right in line with ‘22, but that’s just not where the curves are at the moment. And we don’t -- that does not concern us. We’ve been in the spot before. And we -- and it’s happened for ‘22. It’s happened in previous years. And so, we anticipate it would likely happen again in ‘23.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, Julien, I think that’s why we say -- and we’re not trying to be evasive here at all. It’s just that when you’re this far out and the curves are still backwardated, and we’ve seen every year that when you get into the summer and come out of the summer, that the next summer and the winters tend to begin to move up, and we expect that from our fundamental view. Marking something just to a current curve will give you one result. Marketing something to our fundamental view will give you a different result. We think those -- the good news is this time around is that those two things are still within the range of ‘22 for ‘23. In the past, the curves -- and you brought this up before. In the past, the curves were well below the $3 billion mark. And now, those -- the curves in the fundamental view are -- have converged, but there’s still some room to move. So, I like to think about there’s a distribution around ‘23. But clearly, the ‘22 EBITDA midpoint on illustrative basis is within that distribution. And so, we think there’s a good chance that we can come in around where ‘22 levels are for ‘23. That’s going to come down to execution and being ready when the curves are ripe and our team, that’s what we do. That’s what we get paid to do. So, we feel pretty good about going into ‘22. We clearly feel good about it being $3 billion plus and being plus $3 billion. Where it will land in terms of ‘22 for ‘23, we’re going to be within spitting distance of ‘23. And I think we have a good chance of hitting it, and we could actually even exceed it. So, that distribution I think is favorable. It’s now about execution and getting opportunities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wow! Thank you, team. So much for an easy question here and certainly not evasive at all. Now, let me ask you a slightly more detailed question then. On this Vistra Zero side of the equation, you talked about $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA. How much CapEx are you thinking needs to get invested to get that outcome here? And just to be clear, it sounds like none of that would be paid at least prospectively by the corporate capital. It would all be funded with various other project and segment-specific sources as well. I know that this is an update that’s coming. But it’s -- I just want to make sure if I’m capturing this holistically correctly.
Curt Morgan: Yes. I think it’s in the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range of total capital that would have to be invested. And you are right, the amount of equity capital that we would be putting in is relatively low, although we’re putting in some -- obviously putting in some projects into that as well that have value on the market. But yes, I think it’s $5 billion to $5.5 billion, if I remember right that we would have to invest. And we obviously have plans for how we would do that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: In the contribution, principally, is just your existing storage assets, right, without being too specific?
Curt Morgan: Well, yes, I think I mentioned it, it’s Moss Landing, it’s Morro Bay, it’s our Oakland site in California, it’s -- what is it, 9 sites in Illinois that would have batteries or something like that. It’s batteries in Texas. We have one that’s 265-megawatt, 1 hour battery coming on in Texas. We have a 10-megawatt already on. But that’s what the battery storage picture looks like. And of course, we’re predominantly a solar. On the renewable side, we have found wind to be economic. We’re not an offshore wind person yet, so -- and I don’t expect us to be that. But, we’re not afraid of wind. It’s just that we haven’t found the opportunity for that. But that’s -- those are the primary projects. Of course, there’s a lot of solar, both in Texas and in Illinois.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: So, just -- want to just -- the NRG issues yesterday call, it sounds like you discussed some, but I guess also the Texas ancillary costs and coal treatment, et cetera. How do you feel like those are embedded in your outlook? And obviously, your asset position is different, but just want to kind of clarify that you’re okay on those issues.
Curt Morgan: Yes. And Jim, you can jump in after this. But -- so over half of -- well, let’s just put it this way, about $40 million in ‘21 is the effect of coal constraints. And so, just -- so, we’ve captured that, Steve. That’s in our updated guidance, and we’ve captured that. I think I mentioned, we’ve decided to build inventory for Q1 because the economics are more compelling to be ready for Q1. And so, we have created this constraint in Q4 of ‘21 in favor of Q1 of ‘22. Everything -- any constraint that we have going into ‘22 is already built into our guidance. So, there’s nothing more to talk about there. We expect, given what we’re doing in Q4 of ‘21 in favor of Q1 of ‘22 will actually allow us to run where we want to in Q1 of ‘22. I think you know this too that some of our plants, two of them in PJM and Ohio are not on PRB. A lot of these constraints are coming out of the PRB and on the rails from the PRB. And then, of course, Oak Grove mines its own coal. So, we don’t have those limitations there. And then, many of our other -- we just don’t have a lot of EBITDA coming from like the Illinois plants. And so, the constraints just aren’t as big for us. And I think the other thing is our team got way out in front. I mean, this came to me more than a couple of months ago that we were concerned about this. And so, we’ve been managing toward that, and we’ve been working with the Burlington Northern folks. I’ve talked to their leadership team about getting more trains so that we can get them in and they’re doing the best they can. They know it’s important for this winter in Texas. So all in all, I think we really kind of took a, what I’d call, a $40 million opportunity loss in Q4, but we’re also going to have more inventory for Q1 of ‘22. And all of that’s baked in both of our guidance ranges.
Steve Fleishman: Okay…
Jim Burke: Go ahead on the ancillaries.
Curt Morgan: Did you ask about ancillaries, Steve? Can you hear us?
Steve Fleishman: Yes. That was a big part of the issue they had to, yes.
Curt Morgan: Yes. We have that. That’s also -- ours is just much lower. And Jim, you might want to add to this. But our effect -- we have ancillary, the effects of ancillaries baked into our numbers. Jim, do you want to add to that, any specifics?
Jim Burke: Sure. Yes, we do. It’s baked into our plan. We view the ancillary costs similar to the other costs that any retailer would face. You’ve got to work it to your price, and you’ve got to ultimately reflect it with the customers. We have that built into our plan for ‘22 and beyond. And of course, we do have, as you mentioned, Steve, a different position, having some generation assets as well, so. But, the integrated effect and the effect on retail is slowly reflected in our plan.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And then, just on the renewables plan, how are you going to deal with the Texas sites in terms of -- historically, you were looking at developing those as merchants. But obviously, you can’t project finance that. So, are you going to do PPAs with Vistra retail or with third parties? What’s your strategy on the Texas renewals?
Curt Morgan: Yes. It could be both, Steve. But, I think most of it, we’re looking at right now, this can be different in the future is back with our retail. And that’s actually -- we have an entity that lives between our wholesale and retail group that manages the supply. We call it the supply boat, but it manages supply for our retail business. And they buy and they sell to third-party retailers as well as to our own retail business. They’re the one that will ultimately end up contracting and then they will then supply our retail book as well as other retailers, but that’s where -- it’s really sort of back-to-back with our retail arm. And so, that’s where those contracts will be set up.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: I have a clarification and a follow-up. Just the $500 million prospective EBITDA from the Vistra Zero platform. Just to be clear, as you’re thinking about the structured financing or equity for those projects, that ends up diluting that $500 million, right? That $500 million is the gross number than what’s Vistra’s share is going to be lower depending on what financing you choose. Am I thinking about the right way or no?
Curt Morgan: You are, but let me just put it this way. We will own 100% of the common equity of this entity. So, just to be very clear about it. That capital tranche that we’re looking at, we haven’t decided exactly what it will look like, but we will own 100% of the common equity of that business. And so, you can sort of figure out what kind of tranches that could be. But, we’re not looking to sell and partner with the equity ownership of that. I think there are other ways to do what we want to do and maintain our control. Jim, anything you want to add?
Jim Burke: Yes. Durgesh, I think the way you’re thinking about it is correct. What Curt mentioned is an EBITDA number. And so, we would expect that we would have some interest expense because we’re going to be doing the project financing and any other sort of third-party capital charges that we would have. So, we have some ongoing cost of that capital, which we believe to be more cost-effective than our own. And then over time, we’d have some amortization of the project debt, the project level debt that we would take on. So, that’s not meant to be a free cash flow number if that’s I think was getting to the nature of your question. It is an EBITDA number. And as Curt mentioned, our goal is to maintain 100% equity control so that from a terminal value standpoint, we’re building a business of $500 million on a five-year basis. We can get to $500 million and have long-dated, long-lived assets, very ESG-friendly asset portfolio that’s grown rapidly and use third-party capital, more cost-effective capital to do it. So, there will be some distributions out of that EBITDA to pay for that, but we think that’s more cost effective than doing it all on balance sheet.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. That’s super helpful. Yes, I was really interested in whether it’s going to be 100% owned by you and sounds like it will be. Okay. Second question, in terms of that $3-plus-billion EBITDA number. You mentioned coal retirements, amongst other things that kind of give you opportunity to get to that 5 gigawatt zero platform number. Is there a degradation to that base $3 billion EBITDA as you ramp up on the Vistra Zero platform?
Curt Morgan: Well, yes, if you break these things -- and Jim, you can go. But if you break them out, right, and you say, okay, let’s isolate what impact do we have from our closing or retiring of our coal fleet, yes, there is some slight degradation in EBITDA from that. I will say that there’s very little coming from these assets and the value of these assets have been written down to zero on the books. So, they’re just not economically not contributing a lot and certainly not on an EBITDA basis. What we are seeing though is that, that effect is more than offset by over time as we invest in the Vistra Zero platform. So, we’re able to actually ultimately grow EBITDA over time as we invest. And so, we do see an increasing EBITDA profile when we project that out. So, while they do, if you isolate it, they do have a negative effect on EBITDA, meaning the retired coal plants, the other projects that are coming on more than offset that. Jim, go ahead. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt.
Jim Burke: No. Curt, you covered it well. There’s nearly 8,000 megawatts of slated retirements. Well, we obviously have two large facilities in Texas that do not have anticipated retirement dates, but the EBITDA contribution of that nearly 8,000 has come down through time and is not material on the go-forward horizon, but it’s something that we are built -- we built into our plan, and that’s the whole point of transitioning this fleet is to be able to put new long-lived high-margin assets with Vistra Zero to more than overcome that so that we have a growing EBITDA profile through time.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks, guys. Net-net, it sounds like you’re biased higher on that $3-plus-billion EBITDA prospectively, right? Like counting in the…
Curt Morgan: Correct.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Curt Morgan: Yes.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thanks again for everybody for your interest in our company. I’m proud of what we’ve done after this February event. I think, we’re back on track. I feel like we’re as strong as ever and really appreciate the interest in Vistra, and we look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. We thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Vistra Second Quarter 2021 Investor Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Vistra’s second quarter 2021 results conference call, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today’s investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today’s press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially on this crowded earnings reporting day. As we find ourselves at the start of August already, the fact that the power markets are in a state of transition continues to be apparent. California, Texas and New York have all requested conservation at various times during the summer. June of 2021 was America’s hottest June in 127 years of records, meeting the prior record from June of 2016 by 0.8 degrees. Much of this record-breaking heat has been observed in the Pacific Northwest. North Texas was actually slightly below the 10-year average in June with April and May also being very mild. So as a nation, there is no question that temperatures have been on the rise in 2021 as have the extremes in weather conditions. These weather extremes, coupled with the greater percentage of renewable resources making up the supply stack in various markets, have resulted in a heightened sensitivity to scarcity conditions by the system operators, reinforcing the importance of thermal resources, especially natural gas and maintaining a reliable grid now and several years into the future. Power markets and systems must also balance decarbonization efforts with affordability and reliability, which is proving to be a challenge as evidenced in California and Texas. Given the uncertainty with COVID-19, especially the Delta variant and the country’s desire to return to normal, we have continued to prioritize the safety of our number one asset, our people, while delivering reliable and affordable power to our customers. The second quarter results we are announcing today reflect this dedication and focus. During the quarter, we continued our rebound from the very unfortunate impacts from Uri, most notably hardening our assets, participating in the Texas legislative and regulatory processes and refining our risk management policies. We have also begun a process to review our strategic direction and how we allocate capital. On Slide 6, we show our strong second quarter financial results. Excluding the second quarter impacts from winter storm Uri related to bill credits and higher fuels costs, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $909 million comparable to its very strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Including these Uri impacts, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $825 million. These results were pretty much in line with management expectations for the quarter. We have similarly had a solid start in the execution of the self-help initiatives we identified when we announced our revised financial guidance in April. We currently have a line of sight to achieving the vast majority of the $500 million of self-help initiatives we previously announced. And we have achieved more than 40% through June 30. We will continue to pursue the full $500 million, but only to the extent we do not jeopardize the future risk profile and/or earnings of the company. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth as set forth on Slide 6. Importantly, excluding Uri, Vistra would be tracking in line to ahead of our pre-Uri guidance midpoint for the year. We understand that Uri happened, but we also believe it is important to recognize that the long-term earnings potential for Vistra remains intact. Turning now to Slide 7, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, power markets have recently moved up with forward curves in both ERCOT and PJM as well as our other markets, up meaningfully over the last several months. I am sure you have heard me discuss our point of view in the past, which is our modeled fundamental view of where prices are likely to move over time, incorporating various weather conditions, new build scenarios and other key variables on a probability weighted basis. Pretty much since I have been at Vistra, our point of view has decoupled from backward-dated forward curves, especially in ERCOT. Over the years, forward markets, and to some extent, settled prices have afforded Vistra the opportunity to construct realized price curves, in line with our point of view. It is interesting that the recent positive movement in 2022, forward curves have brought pricing in line with Vistra’s point of view, especially in ERCOT. ERCOT sparks have increased primarily for the winter and summer months and we believe this is being driven by market participants reducing their overall risk tolerance following Uri and possibly the potential for market reforms, which could result in more favorable price formation for dispatchable resources in the future to support market reliability. In PJM, however, it is our view that the rise in power prices has been driven primarily by the increase in natural gas prices. As of July 30, Vistra is now 54% and 93% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, up from 40% and 50% respectively for 2022. We have similarly meaningfully increased our hedge positions in New York, New England, California and the MISO markets over the last several months taking advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads. The recent momentum in forward prices, primarily in ERCOT, supports our previously stated strong outlook for 2022. You might recall last fall at our virtual investor event in September, we offered an early outlook for 2022. Noting our view that in a commodity-exposed business like ours, looking at average adjusted EBITDA over time is a more appropriate way to evaluate the earnings power of the business. We further offered our view that we believe 2022 ongoing operations’ adjusted EBITDA could come in line with this average concept. Specifically, we noted that the average of our 2020 and 2021 ongoing operations’ adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoints was approximately $3.4 billion, which we believe could be indicative of 2022 financial performance and reflected our point of view pricing. At that time, curves were lower. With the recent uplift in forward curves, especially in ERCOT, we continue to believe 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations could be in the range of $3.4 billion, excluding the impact of the retail bill credits from Uri, with a 60% to 70% conversion to adjusted free cash flow before growth. I am now on Slide 8. As we mentioned on our business update call in April, Vistra is taking several actions intended to address the risks we were exposed to during winter storm Uri. First, we are investing nearly $50 million in 2021 prior to the 2022 winter on improvements to further harden our coal fuel handling capabilities and to further weatherize our Texas fleet for even colder temperatures and longer durations. We intend to spend up to another $30 million in 2022 to further enhance the ability for our fleet to withstand extreme weather conditions. We have also contracted for a meaningful amount of additional gas storage, which performed well during the storm to support our gas fleet and we are installing dual-fuel capabilities at our gas steam units, while similarly increasing the fuel oil inventory at our dual-fuel sites. Last, we plan to carry more generation linked into the peak seasons, increasing the level of physical insurance we carry to protect against volatility. The absolute level of excess generation we carry will be a function of our investments, in our generation infrastructure and the ERCOT market improvements that are implemented going forward. In addition to these improvements, we are making on a standalone basis, the Texas legislature recently passed legislation that provides for mapping of the integrated gas and electric systems, which should help to alleviate gas deliverability issues by identifying critical infrastructure, allowing for weatherization and registration with the transmission and distribution utilities to ensure that those assets continue to operate in the inclement conditions and receive power in the event of rolling outages in the future. We have already seen a significant amount of registration activity since Uri. We intend to play a role in ensuring the efforts to map and identify critical gas and power infrastructure are carried out in a manner that results in the intended reduction of risk to the integrated systems. Last, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas are evaluating various market reform alternatives to reduce risk and ensure that dispatchable resources have adequate revenues to incent investment and serve to balance the system with a growing number of intermittent renewables. We believe any such reforms could further improve ERCOT’s risk profile for market participants and enhance the attractiveness of the market. The process is in its early stages. So, it is difficult at this time to speculate on what form these reforms might take, though very clearly, ERCOT and the PUCT are focused on ensuring that Texans have reliable electricity going forward, reinforcing the importance of dispatchable resources like Vistra’s. The most likely potential areas for reform are to the operating reserve demand curve, including reducing the price gap and extending the amount of reserves on the curve and additional ancillary services to incentivize new investment and maintain existing dispatchable generations. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I would like to comment briefly on our strategic direction and capital allocation review. As we noted on our business update call in April, the events of Uri required us to step back and rethink our strategic direction, enterprise risk and how we allocate capital. The goal is to unlock the value of our company that we strongly believe remains intact. As you likely know, the events of Uri also have setback the timeline for a potential investment grade rating to at least the end of 2022 or at some point in 2023. The strategic review will undoubtedly address our leverage targets in the pursuit of investment grade credit ratings. However, regardless of the direction we take, Vistra will always maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand extreme risk, pursue business opportunities and attract investors. We understand the urgency of this work given where our stock is trading, but we also want to be prudent in our deliberations. We intend to provide more information when we have news to discuss on our longer term strategic direction, no later than our third quarter earnings call in early November. Probably the most important point is that our deliberations have confirmed our confidence in the long-term value of our business. It is incumbent on us to put together the plan to realize this value and we intend to do so. We believe that our relatively young low-cost assets that we are de-risking will play a critical role in the energy transition for the next couple of decades, which when combined with our attractive retail and zero carbon businesses should deliver relatively consistent financial results, while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. At today’s stock price, investing in our stock has to be at the top of the list of where to allocate our capital. We look forward to talking more about our strategic direction and how we plan to allocate our significant cash flow in the months ahead. I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. As shown on Slide 10, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $825 million. Excluding the Uri-related bill credits and fuel cost adjustments, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $909 million, results that are comparable to our exceptionally strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $109 million higher than second quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives in ‘21. The collective generation segments ended the quarter $213 million lower than second quarter 2020 driven primarily by lower realized prices in Texas after an exceptionally strong 2020 and lower capacity revenues. Importantly, the long-term earnings power of this company has not been affected by Uri, which was a highly unusual event. In fact, without the impact of Uri, we expect we would have been reaffirming our pre-Uri guidance today, which had an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint of $3.275 billion. Next year, excluding the impact from Uri bill credits, we believe we have the ability to deliver adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the $3.4 billion range, with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow before growth. All of this to say, we continue to believe this business will have significant capital to allocate in the years ahead, which takes me to Slide 11. Last week, our Board approved our third quarter 2021 dividend of $0.15 or $0.60 on an annual basis, subject to Board approval at the appropriate times. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, though as Curt mentioned, we believe we are still a couple of years out from a potential investment grade credit rating. In the second quarter of 2021, we did execute one capital markets transaction, issuing $1.25 billion of 4.375% senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2029. We used the proceeds to repay all of the outstanding principal amounts of the $1.25 billion, 364-day term loan A that we issued following Uri. Beyond our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet, we also view our stock is significantly undervalued. We continue to believe that share buybacks at these levels would be one of the most attractive uses of our capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reallocate capital for the remainder of 2021. Last, as we previously discussed, we are also evaluating alternatives to accelerate the pace of our renewable development using lower cost capital. All of these capital allocation tenants are being evaluated in our current review. So please stay tuned for more to come on these topics in the months ahead. In closing, while winter storm Uri was a significant one-time financial hit in the first quarter, our business has been able to get back on track and execute well in the second quarter. And with the recent uptick in forward curves in both PJM and ERCOT, our forward outlook has only improved, with management expecting that we will be able to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth in ‘22 and beyond. We believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. In fact, with our long-term view that we will be able to generate $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow on an annual basis, we could repurchase our entire market cap in roughly 5 years if we would allocate all of this capital to share buybacks, attractive value in our opinion our teams are committed to execution. We prioritize operational excellence, low-cost operations and disciplined financial management. As always, we are focused on delivering safe and reliable electricity to our customers, while creating value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Shar. Good to hear from you.
Shar Pourreza: Yes, same Curt. Just quickly, Curt, just on your comments regarding a review of your strategic direction, how you allocate capital, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. As you kind of continue to generate cash, can you maybe just speak on how you’re thinking about buybacks versus perhaps a special dividend, especially as we’re thinking about ‘22 and beyond, maybe more inorganic retail deals? Also, you kind of specifically also noted strategic direction, could that also imply that there is maybe an internal debate around a go-private scenario, if you continue to trade at these unsustainable high free cash flow yields? Could kind of go-private scenario be the avenue to realize value? Just maybe if you can elaborate a little bit more on that strategic direction comment and would you be prepared to discuss this by November or could this be pushed out? Thanks.
Curt Morgan: Yes, Shar. So thank you. That’s a great question, a lot in that question. So – but that – I mean I knew that I figured we get that question. I think after the Uri event, I think most people would expect that management team and the Board, we’re going to sit down and have a discussion about our business. And something that – obviously, it was a risk that we did not contemplate and to just brush it off and say we’re going to go at things business as usual. I don’t think that would have sat well with anybody and certainly not with me and not with the Board. So I think the first and foremost that we felt a sense of urgency. And of course, you got – you know this, I mean, our stock sold off big and more so actually than the actual math that you would put into it in terms of our shares divided into the loss itself. So there was a loss in confidence. And I understand that. But we had to rethink things going forward, and I think that’s what we’re doing. I don’t know that anything has really changed that much. But we – I think there are four main pillars that are driving us as we go through our strategic direction and as we think about allocating capital. Number one is our stock is incredibly cheap. And we went – we’ve done a lot of analysis, and we still believe that we’re significantly undervalued. And so we have to think about what’s the best way to invest in our own company. If others don’t believe in us, then we need to believe in ourselves, and we generate a lot of cash. And so I think we have to take a hard look at buying back our shares. And that ultimately adds value to the shareholders to stay in the company. And so it’s a good use of capital in our mind. We said this in our remarks, Jim and I did that we want to have a strong balance sheet. We never started this though with the idea that we had to pursue investment-grade rating. That kind of came along with it. And if we get there, that’s fine. What’s more important is we have a balance sheet that can withstand the kind of risk that we did with Uri. We were sitting here at 5 or 6, maybe 7x debt-to-EBITDA, like the IPPs in the past. We probably would be talking about a completely different situation right now than what we are. So we believe a strong balance sheet. It’s still one of the cornerstones of our company, but we’re not going to be penny wise and pound foolish. So we’re going to look real hard at that. We think dividend will continue to be a part of what we do. And finally, we did a review of our renewable and battery business. And we have one of the best businesses. We see just about every development company that’s trying to sell itself right now. We know what those teams look like. We understand NextEra has got an incredible business and kudos to them, but we’re not second to anybody else in our view. We’ve got a great pipeline. We’re using sites that have access to transmission. We have a tremendous capability in terms of development. Development is not just about going out and getting in the interconnection queue. You’ve got to have market knowledge and experience. You have to have construction experience and operations and maintenance skills. We have the economies of scale from a functional support standpoint. We bring a lot to the table. The key for us, though, is it’s a cost of capital gain. And so that’s where a partner may come into this. And so we’re going to take a real hard look at how we can accelerate the growth in that business and make sure that we have a competitive cost of capital in that business, and that could also mean that we may want to do some project financing, but certainly bring in probably some infrastructure-type investment. So that’s what we are working on. There is no disagreement with our Board. I think our Board and the management team are in lockstep. But these things take a little bit of time, and we’re sure we’re going to be prudent about it. We want to make sure whatever move we make is a long-term move. We don’t want to have a knee-jerk reaction here and then have to do something again. And I feel good, Shar, that we will likely do something no later than the Q3 call time frame. We’d like to obviously not do it on the Q3 call because that gets you guys all congested because you’ve got other things to deal with. We certainly would like to do it before that and separately, so that we can have the kind of time where we can spend time with investors and with you guys. So that’s where we are on this. We’re – we continue to believe in the long-term value of this company. I step back and think about it this way. We’ve got this incredible business that generates a tremendous amount of cash, and that cash can open up the opportunity for us to return capital. We’ve also got this burgeoning and very good growth business. And that business needs capital, and it also means a cost of capital advantage. That’s what we need to unlock. That’s what we need to solve for. And that’s what we are working on to do. And I feel very good that we’re on a good path to do that. But there is a lot of work to be done. We want to get to the market as soon as we can on this direction because we build the urgency, but we want to do it right.
Shar Pourreza: So just to reiterate, Curt, the strategic direction really isn’t about a debate on whether investors will ever properly reflect the value of an IPP as a public company and whether you’re debating whether we should go private because that’s what private is willing to pay for assets. This is more of a strategic direction, maybe a change in how you’re thinking about buybacks versus dividend versus organic growth versus inorganic growth as a publicly traded company. This isn’t a debate between whether we should go private or stay public.
Curt Morgan: Yes. No, look, we’re for sale every day. So if somebody wanted to pay an attractive price, but we’re not out with hanging our shingle out there because I’ll just tell you – I’ve said this before, you know this, . I’ve said it to you, but I don’t – I’ve been in the private setting. I know what it is. I know what it takes. I know what private investors want. And I think that there are others out there that have gone private that are realizing that if you go private, it’s the same thing that if we were public for these businesses, that it’s a long-term gain and the idea that a private equity firm would come in here and can somehow then exit in 3 to 5 years. I just don’t know who that exit would be. And the thing that makes it difficult for us is that it would take a big equity check and a significant capital raise in order to get this done. That doesn’t mean that it can’t happen, but that is not our primary direction. We want to take a direction that we control. We don’t control that direction. And so we do something that we control and that we think can unlock this value. So that’s where we’re focused.
Shar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you guys so much. Appreciate it.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.
Curt Morgan: Hi, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: Wanted to just talk a bit more about the opportunities for renewables that you’re seeing and just get your latest view on sort of the state of play there and as much as I love the idea of growing in renewables, it does strike me as challenging to kind of beat the economics of your own stock. And I know you just went through a long discussion of your review, so I understand that this is in process. But just would you mind talking a bit about that opportunity set in renewables? What you’re seeing broadly? I would guess there might be some degree of distress among some of those smaller players out there. But just could you talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing there?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Good question, Stephen. So look, I think I tried to say this, but I’ll make it as clear as I can. We think, at the top of our list of things to use the capital from this great cash generation machine that we have is our stock right now. And so you see the free cash flow yields. The math is pretty clear. And so – but we also want to have a strong balance sheet. I went through all these things and we do think paying a dividend made some sense. And so we are going to do that. The real challenge is can we return capital and grow what we believe is a very good and like I said, burgeoning renewables and battery storage business. I mean these are opportunities because of the sites that we have and we’re in locations like California. California is talking about 12,000 megawatts plus of batteries that they need to put in. We’ve got sites that can do that. We can’t walk away from that value proposition. We want to partner with PG&E and others in the state of California and with the state of California to help them solve their – where they are trying to take their state. And we have the sites to do that. And so I think what we’ve concluded is there are ways to do both. And that’s where we’re headed. We also want – we believe that partnering with people, who have, let’s say, an advantaged cost of capital and will put us in a position of having an advantaged cost of capital will put us in a better position. We have everything else there is to compete in this business, and we have the full suite of capabilities. So I don’t think it’s a question of whether you can do one or the other. I think we can do both. The real question is, how do we go about doing that? And that’s where we’re spending the time right now is concluding that effort, so that we can pursue both. There are great companies out there. I used NextEra as one. I think NextEra is a great company, and they have been able to do both. And I think we can do both. And so we’re going to just have to balance that. That’s where we’re headed.
Stephen Byrd: Makes a lot of sense. I wanted to follow-up on Illinois and just get your latest thoughts on kind of the state of play there, the opportunity set. It strikes me sometimes folks don’t appreciate the potential there for you all. But I’m just curious what you’re seeing on the ground? What your view is of where that may head?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean this is an interesting one because Governor Pritzker would like to move the state of Illinois in a very progressive way to a leadership position in the area of clean generation. And he’s pushing very hard on doing that. And he sees an opportunity with an Omnibus energy bill, if that’s going to happen. And I’m interpreting he is not telling me this. I’m telling you what I’m reading through the discussions that I’ve had. And in so doing, that’s a difficult thing because he would like to see emissions rates from thermal resources to decline and part of the legislation is pushing hard on that. And of course, that creates disruption. And there are some co-ops that own coal plants have just built them or munis I should say. That just built them not too long ago, and they still have a huge amount of debt that are on a number of different municipalities. And that creates a lot of angst. And of course, there is others like us that own thermal resources, and we’re trying to sort out how does that happen. And I think even within his own party, there is a debate going on as to how you actually accomplish that. So – and that has created a bit of a divide. And I think at the end of the day, they are going to try to work together. And I believe they will because there is too much at stake here. And they will come to a reasonable conclusion to move the state forward in terms of lowering its emissions. We are in the middle of that trying to help that. The one thing that I have tried to mention to people is that if you get the Omnibus bill in place and you put the kind of stipulations in the direct auctions and require developers to actually complete their projects and get them online. That – by that very nature, will end up crowding out thermal resources and will reduce emissions without having to have a heavy handed set of criteria that forces those to happen in an unnatural fashion. And so I think if they get this bill passed and they put the right teeth in, so that they can get the development that they want of the renewable and battery resources, they will accomplish a major amount of what they want to get done. So, the real essence, though, at the end of the day, can something get done. We are cautiously optimistic that there will be a way – a path forward that everybody will come together because again, there is too much at stake. There is a lot of investment that they want to do in renewables. Our coal to solar is part of that. We feel strongly that we are solidly in the legislation. We have a very good program. It helps communities that are losing jobs from the fact that we are shutting down coal plants and investing in those communities, bringing property tax base. And we are real – we are a real company. We have real projects, and we can bring those online in a very short period of time. And so we think there is a lot in that for us as well. And so we would like to obviously help bridge this gap and work together. And that’s what we are doing. We are working together with as many people as we can to try to help bridge this divide. I think it will get done, Stephen, but you would never know. And we are cautiously optimistic, but there is a lot of stake, and we think – of course, the nukes, I didn’t even mention that. Those are very important to the state. They have made that very clear, so all that has to come together. Most of it is already together. At the end of the day, it’s just getting through this, what do we do in the long run with thermal resources and the glide path for those to exit. And I think that’s where we need to come up with a compromise, and I believe we will be able to do that.
Stephen Byrd: That’s really helpful. Thank you so much.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, good morning.
Curt Morgan: Hi Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, Curt. Just on the – could you just remind us the current capital plan? What was in there in terms of dollars for renewables CapEx over the next few years? And maybe just also give us an update on where you stand on projects there, particularly the ones you were planning to do in Texas?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So Steve, we had said that we would put $0.5 billion – roughly $500 million. Jim, while I am answering this, Jim may be able to find the exact numbers that we have. But $0.5 billion a year, we have said for 10 years. And when we put out that 10-year view – and I think we are largely – it’s a little bit more and a little bit less in a couple of years, but we were going to reinvest that amount into renewables and batteries. And we are tracking sort of in that range and that was the investment. In terms of the projects themselves, I don’t have the list in front of me, but I know that we have, and I don’t know, Jim, if you have that list and if you have been able to find that, but if you can pull up that list of where we are on each of the different projects.
Jim Burke: Sure. Steve, we had in our Investor Day, we had talked about a capital allocation plan that would put over $600 million into ‘21. We said $650 million approximately in ‘21 and $500 million in ‘22. We scaled the $650 million down to $425 million for this year. And we did that as part of the earlier questions. We are kind of reading the market signals on where we should best allocate our capital. And we control these sites. So, these were sites that we can bring on in the timeframe that we would like. We are going to be the off-taker predominantly for the Texas sites. And so this gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to bring them on and do it in the timeframe that makes the most sense for us. As far as the sites themselves, we have both the Moss 300 and 100 which were completed and those are operating with an RA agreement from PG&E. The other sites that we are focused on are the Brightside Solar project, the DeCordova battery project, which is our hybrid project here in Texas. We have got Emerald Grove, and we have got just a little bit of spend to keep some options alive at a few other sites. That’s the bulk of our spend for this year. And we are going to continue to build out for the balance of this year. We have got some Phase 1 projects that we had announced earlier. We just slowed the path down, and we haven’t gotten going yet on Phase 2. So, the strategic review that Curt has mentioned, will obviously dictate a lot in terms of the pace and can we find a cheaper form of financing that helps us accelerate this, but still use our capital for kind of its highest return. And so we will share that as we bring the details of that going forward. But it’s the pipeline we talked about before, just a little bit slower go given we were resetting post Uri. But the projects that we have are moving forward well and the battery projects in California are performing well.
Curt Morgan: And Steve, one thing – one other thing to add on that, Andrews County is one that we pulled back when we pulled back to this lower spend. And that was initially – this is why I talked about having the capability and having the discipline in development. If you are a development company, then all you are going to do is kind of build this thing up and flip it, it’s a little bit different. But we were going to have to live with it. But we had some issues with congestion. And we have worked with Encore, and we now believe that side, you could go up to 200 megawatts. But this is the kind of stuff that we have a dedicated group on transmission that are incredible at what they do. And they can keep us out of issues by over-developing in an area and then having congestion and having the price reduced significantly. And so that – we have pulled that back, but now since we have been able to work it, it’s a project we will do later. And as Jim said, we control that site. So, that was part of why we also pulled that back.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Just I guess, a high-level question related to the renewables is just in your slide, you mentioned the alternatives to accelerate the pace of development using a cheaper cost of capital, which makes a lot of sense and it frees up a lot more capital for buyback. In terms of then the mix of the company, if someone else is going to own some of this, like can you grow the business fast enough, quicker that even if somebody is going to own some of it, the overall company keeps moving a lot greener over the period, if someone, if you have a partner?
Curt Morgan: Yes, sure. So yes, I mean that’s a really good question and one that we have spent a lot of time. Jim and I have recently, by the way. But you are talking about whether – how do you do this, is this a JV and those things tend to have governance associated with them, and there is a lot to them. I think the way we are thinking about it, Steve, is there is a couple of ways to do this. There is – you can have an equity investment, you can also have sort of, what I will call, a structured financing where it’s – maybe it’s a preferred – convertible preferred or something like that. There is a number of ways to cut this in terms of how do you raise the capital against the spend and the value of the company that can allow you to grow this company and to maintain the ownership and the governance that allows you to control the shots, because you can’t get into a situation if you don’t have the right partner, where it can get gummed up. And that’s not what we are looking to do. What we are looking to do is get access to – there is a lot of capital out there right now and a lot of infrastructure funds and a lot of people looking for companies like us that are legitimate that have a capability. And so we think that we can raise reasonably priced capital in a governance-friendly manner to continue to allow us to grow our business. And so we will see and the extent of how much the party would have a governance position in the company will depend on the size of the capital investment and the type of capital investment, and there will be a balance that we will make there. We have got a number of good friends out there that are interested in this. And we know this because there are people – there are inbounds coming to us because I am making comments like this on calls like this. But we know that there is interest in this. And then it comes down to just what do the terms look like. But we have people that we know that were like-minded with that we can – that we could work with. And that we believe that understand what we are trying to do, which is accelerate this, not slow it down.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hi. Good morning team. Just on the sort of the – just on the strategic review, you have mentioned the size of the check. I am just wondering like as you go into the sort of the Q3 call and as you think through this, is there a possibility to not sell the company outright, but perhaps get a like-minded partner, who sees the value in the cash flow stream, sell a portion of the assets or a portion of companies. Is that a possibility?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Absolutely.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. And then just in terms of just the buyback you mentioned, obviously, the currencies, is heavily discounted. On the Q3 call, should we expect sort of a form of program to be announced or like what to sort of – you had this previous guidance of – I think it was $1.5 billion worth in share buyback. So, should we expect a larger program or would you have done – you have taken some actions before then?
Curt Morgan: I hesitate to get into precise numbers because we are working through this. We have a pretty big program that we already have out there for the next couple of years. I think what you are going to hear though is what we would like to do even longer term. I mean I think we would like to paint a picture, again. We have got this core business that generates a lot of cash. And I think we would like to earmark that to returning a bunch of cash. And so we want to give a picture of the future that goes multi-years and just kind of shows just how much return of capital that we can do over that period of time from that business. And then I think we also would like to paint a picture of what the growth side of our business would look like. And those two, let’s call them, two separate businesses and two separate tracks. But at some point, those two ultimately merge again. I think our biggest problem has been is that people can’t envision the company long-term. They say, well, at some point, those thermal assets are going to go away. But if you have two tracks, one that you are generating a lot of cash and you are returning it to shareholders from your core business and you are building this large burgeoning renewable and battery business. At some point, those merge again. And then you have solved your long-term terminal value because our retail business isn’t going anywhere. And we are going to grow that business. It’s how we manufacture power, electricity that matters. And we have got a great business that returns a lot of capital. And I think will continue to do so for a long time that we can return to shareholders. We also have advantaged sites in a core capability to be able to grow in renewables and batteries. And we want to be able to unlock both of those things. We think bringing in partners and additional capital is the way to do that. And then at some point in time, those two merge again and that you have this – you can then visualize this company in the long run because the supply side of our business has been essentially replaced from thermal to renewable and batteries. That’s really the vision here. And then we need to get into the details of how that happens.
Durgesh Chopra: That makes a ton of a sense, Curt. Thank you. Just a quick one here, could you – could there be share buybacks this year in 2021? Potentially, previously, you have said because of Uri and sort of the balance sheet there would be no share buybacks in 2020, but could you reevaluate that?
Curt Morgan: We could. We could reevaluate that. Yes.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate you taking time.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thanks again everybody for joining the Q2 call. I know it’s a busy – a very busy day. We tried to – we thought it was a pretty yeoman like quarter. The company has rebounded well. So, we didn’t want to take the full hour. Hopefully, this will give you some time. But we – a lot to talk about in the future, in the near-term we will be getting back to you soon with the strategic direction and the capital allocation. So, thanks again. I hope everybody is well. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-26 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to this Vistra Fourth Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations for Vistra. Please go ahead Ms. Sorg.
Molly Sorg: Thank you Carol, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistra corp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-K and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Sides two and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non--GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning everybody. We appreciate your interest in this call. Today, this morning, I would like to start out with the elephant in the room. We had a rough week last week, to say the least and for our investors who are listening to this call, I want to say on behalf of everybody at Vistra that we are disappointed and our inability to deal with this unprecedented event in a way that was favorable for the company. But I can assure you that we did everything we could to try to count come out on top. And I would like to take you through a little bit and Jim Burke will to the events that ensued. And what we tried to do to deal with those events, what happens, and also just to tell you on the front end, that it has taken us until middle of this week, to really sought out what really ultimately ended-up happening. And, and so therefore, we felt it was imperative that we have this discussion, even though we have not sorted out everything, that we have this discussion today, and started the process, have a conversation about, what actually happened, and then we will get to the final numbers. I can assure you that there isn't anybody more disappointed than us. And it is disappointing to me, that we let you down, because we pride ourselves in execution. And I think we have done a darn good job of it over the five years I have been here. And within literally an hour or two, our worlds kind of turned upside down. First of all, it was for Texas, maybe for those of us who lived in the northeast or the North know that, may not have looked as a big deal. But in Texas, it was an unprecedented event, the infrastructure, and I don't mean just the electric infrastructure. But I'm talking about housing and other things are built really for the heat. You don't see this kind of event. And I think history tells us that this was one of these, so called one in 100 years now, it did happen. And the reality is, even if it is one in 100, it can happen. So, there is no excuse. But it tells you the depth of what happens is, as I understand it, the coldest three days stretch that they can that they have on record in Texas, the 14th through to 16th. So, what did that mean? Well, that meant that we had unprecedented demand. So, - to take you back, and I think it is important to lay this out. I think it was the ninth of February. Steve Moscato, who is on this call, came to me and said our meteorologists that we have on staff came to him and said, we have got an unprecedented event from a we ran the numbers, and we were seeing load in 72,000 to 74,000 megawatts. Now, let's put that in perspective. The worst case scenario or the or the one of the - I guess you call it that, that that overcrowded perform was about 67,000 megawatts or so maybe 67 or 68. And Steve was concerned, not just because of the load. But we also were looking at wind forecasts. And we were concerned about solar. And the fact of the matter was that we didn't have enough steel on the ground to cover that load. So, and I have been testifying to this in Texas, I'm still here in Austin. Last couple days, and I will be talking more again today. But we did vote to Orca. And because they had I think it was about 65,000 megawatts for Monday. And this is by the way for Monday, Tuesday, 15th and 16th. Just to give you a timeline. So we were out in front of it. I have testified to this, I believe, and now that I have been lifting the other testimony that I believe, or Pat thought to say that they had it under control, and I will tell you in a minute what happened. And I think they weren't even prepare it for what ends up happening. But the bottom line is the company positioned itself relative to that to be long or flat. And in some instances we were short going into that, but then we went out and bought power at very high prices, because we believe that power was going to go to the cap, that it was not if it was wind. And so we were prepared, we also spent, and we have been open about this, about $10 million in preparation. We brought on about 200 additional contractors on site. We essentially did our whole winter readiness in Texas all over again, which we normally do in the fall. - And we felt very well prepared going into that. And then Monday came and I was on the phone with Steve and it was 1:00 AM, and Steve like he always does, we talk about, okay, here it comes. We think load shreds going to begin. And of course, we were supposed to be rolling blackouts, and then it started. I mean, we all saw it because, we were 30 minutes on, 15 off, and that went on for a relatively short period of time. And then Steve told me that we almost lost the entire grid. Frequencies were erratic, it tripped a couple of our units, and then shortly after that, everything locked down. And for what we find out on testimony, now, the transmission distribution entities, not ERCOT, essentially locked down each of their systems at wherever they were, because they were afraid they were going to lose the system. Now we have a book, and then all of a sudden that book of business changed. Loads, we are down to about some 40,000. And the reason they locked it down is because we were losing generation on the grid left and right. And the reason we were losing generation on the grid was predominantly because gas pressures, but also there were outages. Unfortunately for NRG, and this is public South Texas project Fripp. And I think this was a component of events for ERCOT. And for the two years, that all of a sudden they were managing a very different risk profile with a about 30,000 megawatts of generation, and they could not run a system on rolling blackouts with that level of generation. And so they just had to preserve the system. So that was the first event that changed our books. How did it change? It, locked whatever loads you had in your area based on what was on at that time. So if you were rolling blackouts and you were on, North Texas was on which we were that throws that at a particular level. And then we started getting our gas Trek because of pressures. So all of a sudden our book went from a flat, so long books into a, a book that was long, short, mixed, and we were scrambling at that point. And then upon our right on that, we had gas contracts, people declared force measure. So we had gas and then we didn't have gas. All that happened within a very short period of time. And we were managing a different reality at that point in time. And so frankly, we had millions of people without power in the state of Texas. We were scrambling to get gas. Gas prices shot through the roof. And we said this is a survival mode we turned our attention to preserving the Texas market and the grid and putting every megawatt we could. We said to ourselves we have to put everything on it and we will count this up at the end, But the one thing we know we need to do is serve customers, stabilize the grid, and then we will sort it out later. And that is what we did. And I look back on that every day and over the nights when I can't sleep. And I say to myself, "What could we have done different, Curt? How could we have played this differently?" And I think those decisions, as I play them over and over again were right. Now we had some things. And by the way, I know it doesn't matter in life. You know what, it doesn't matter if you lose the Super Bowl. No one goes and says, "Oh, that is just because you know you had a mistake or the rep had a call." You lost. And so I get that. I'm just trying to explain to you what we were trying to do to manage this situation that was unprecedented to us, and we were trying to do the best that we could. And it took us frankly until the middle of this week, in fact all the way up to last night, we were having a Board meeting to really get a sense of what that range would be and so we still don't know exactly what all these numbers are because we are still getting in - because ERCOT shut down for a while, it wasn't providing voices. We didn't know what the load looked like, and we are beginning to get that picture. So if you think about what happened, there was a confluence of events. But the biggest which - that we have not seen it is all the way from the wellhead, we were having freeze ups. So there wasn't enough gas to inject into the pipelines. We had gas processing facilities that were having winter issues. And one of the biggest things that happened is that the TDUs didn't have an updated list of critical infrastructure. And so all of a sudden, they couldn't help it. They just shut down what they didn't think was critical. And all of a sudden, we had gas compressors that are run on electricity that pack the pipes, they were shut off. They weren't listed as critical infrastructure. We had gas processing facilities that were shut off because they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. And we had wells, producing wells that were shut off for the same reason. So then we had to triage. We had to go upstream, looking for people and saying and finding out what was wrong, why we weren't getting gas. And we were helping people with the TDUs turn back on critical infrastructure. And in order to get that to happen, it took a couple of days then for those to get on, and then you have to - in order to repressurize the pipe, it takes a good day to do that. So it took the balance of the week to get gas restored. So we had a significant amount of curtailments, and we are buying gas at a very high price. Now, one on us is we had some problems with our coal fleet. We had just some toll issues at Martin Lake, which were derates. We didn't come off-line. We just didn't produce at a maximum. And then we had you guys may know this, but Okra, we ship coal. We mine lignite and we ship it, and we had the rails froze up, and then we had plugging, and that took us down for about a day and a half. Now why does that matter? Well, it matters a lot because Oak Grove has about $5 a megawatt hour cost structure as opposed to having to essentially replace it with gas at hundreds of dollars in MMBTU. So the margin that we were getting for that days and a half was less. Now we got it back. That was a good thing, but we lost for about days and a half days. That was a lot of money that we lost, and Jim is going to go through these numbers. The other thing I heard is that there was a pricing glitch on Monday. So we are in what we call an EEA3, which is the highest alert at ERCOT. That means you have really no reserves. In fact, we had 30,000 megawatts of negative reserves. Where was the price? Price was trading at LNPs, in some instances $1,000 below our cost. And so we are calling ERCOT. What is going on? Well, we determined there was a pricing, let's call it anomaly. We went to the PUC the next day. And they came out with an order and said, "We are going to reprice that at the cap, and then we are going to have it stay at the cap until we come out of EEA3." Frankly, the right decision, and that was a big deal for us. Inexplicably, 18-hours later they reversed the decision, and they decide to do it prospectively, but not retroactively. And they claim that during the wee hours of the morning on Monday, that people relied on that price. Ridiculous. And so Monday was a big day for us because we were long that day. Because the gas infrastructure was just beginning to come off, and so we lost that value. Now that is something that we could - are still take a hard look at, but that was tough. Again, "Curt, what does it matter? It still happened to you." Yes, it did, but we didn't expect it. Nobody expected when we are in EEA3, that the price would be anything but at the cap. How could it be when you have negative reserves? It absolutely is preposterous, and yet that is what happened. So all of those things happened. We didn't know what the book was. We went through that week. We performed actually relatively well. We put on 25% to 30% of all megawatts on the grid relative to our 18% market share. Good. Again, no good deed goes unpunished. The problem was we had a mismatch when they locked the system down between megawatts and load. And the other thing is we were producing from higher-cost assets than we expected. So our cost of goods sold mix was not helpful. So I have taken you really through the two first slides. I will say a little bit about the market because I think the other very fair question is, "Okay, well, what's this mean for the Texas market?" And frankly, I thought it was the best market in the country. And this event has made me think. Not just me, but a lot of people think about it. But I still believe the basic tenets of a very good market are here. But I think the one thing that we are going to have to work on with the policy makers, the regulators, and I think we have good momentum on this, is that the grid in Texas today when we put in the all energy market and the price caps, is a grid that is different than the one that existed when we went competitive. So when we were competitive, it was a very different grid house where we have a lot less dispatchable resources. In fact, we have less dispatchable resources than our peak loads. So we rely much more heavily on renewables. Renewables are good. Nothing wrong with that. But it changes the risk profile. Renewables during this event were at capacity factors from 5% to sort of 15%. They didn't really contribute a lot during this event. And that is why I said when we were at 74,000 peak load, we didn't have enough megawatts in the system. Again, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. And we were telling people that. So on the market design, reserves has to be, in my mind, the number one - emphasis. And so there is a number of ways to get more reserves on the system. But I also think that we have to take a hard look at the balance between market and the competitive markets and reliability. And I think that puts a lot of things on the table. That puts could be potentially greater reserves that ERCOT has to acquire in order to maintain the system. It could be a capacity market. I know that that may be blast for me to some in Texas, but I think it has to be on the table. But what I think comes out of this is still a very good competitive market that still has opportunities for people to do well, but moves on the spectrum of competitiveness to reliability, move that a little more toward the middle. But we are going to sort through that and more will come out of that, but I'm confident that Texas will rise to the occasion. This economy mandates it, and the policymakers in the governor and others know that this economic engine is powered by electricity. And with electrification coming, we have got to get it right. And we are a big player. We have a big seat at the table. We have a lot of good ideas, and I think the market actually advances to a good point. Now the weather event, I mean we are believers in climate change. We don't know this type of event becomes more frequent. But I think if you just let history tell you something, that this is not a frequent event, but it could happen. And so we have to adapt. We have to. And it is not huge numbers, but we are going to have to batten down the hatch, so to speak, and to harden our assets. The one thing I'm going to be on a say about is making sure that the gas and electric systems work seamlessly, that the TDUs upgrade their critical infrastructure, and that the gas system puts the money in, just like we, do to harden the system. It cannot be acceptable to not deliver gas at the maximum pressures in the middle of a natural disaster. And you can't say, "Well, my hands are clean on this. I don't regulate that." Well, let's change the regulations then. So we have work to do, but I still have confidence, very much so, in the market. Now, this has been difficult. We hope that we hope to maintain your trust in us. But at the very least, we hope to earn it back. I'm disappointed. And it hurts, but it is what it is. And it is easy to lead when things are going well, and I think it is time to lead going forward. And I believe that the franchise is in place, the financial strength that we worked so hard to build, thank goodness, has helped us through this. And our better days are still ahead of us. And the integrated model still works, and we just have to do some things, some tweaks. We have to work on the market design, but I still have faith in this business and in these markets because they are too important. Electricity is the lifeblood of the economy. We have to get this right. there is no choice when you say, "Well, how do I trust that?" Texas can never go through this again, and they know that. So that is what I trust. And we are a big player here. And so what comes out the back end of this, I believe, is going to be good for Texas, good for the market and good for Vistra. So with that, I'm going to move into, and I just hate this, but I will move into 2020. Not that I hate 2020, or maybe I do. But I will moved into 2020 because we had such a great year, and this event has overshadowed it. And the men and women have worked so hard at Vistra in 2020 in the face of COVID, in the face of social issues and everything that is been thrown at us, performed as about as good as anybody could have expected. It enabled us to pay down a significant amount of debt. Our retail business was exceptional, getting close to almost $1 billion of EBITDA. We continue on the cost savings front. And by the way, I'm not going to throw a number out there today and say that we are going to save a bunch of hundreds of millions of dollars. We have a lean business, and I'm not going to starve this business. You cannot starve power plants for maintenance costs. It will bite you in 2022 and 2023. But we will as we always do, and we will double down. We will look for opportunities to optimize earnings going forward once we determine what the full effect of this is. And I'm convinced that we do every year, we will find opportunities and we will let you know what those are. But I'm not going to throw a big number out there that I don't think is good for the company in the long run, and we are playing this for the long run. 2021 and this event are a onetime event, and we are going to move this company forward in a way where it can compete and be even better into the future. In 2020, I'm now on delivering the financial results slide. Just a phenomenal year, $3.77 billion of EBITDA and almost $2.6 billion in free cash flow before growth, almost a 70% conversion ratio. I remember when I was talking to you guys in the Dynegy acquisition, and we put out the - I think it is S-4 and we had a set of projection numbers. And just looking at what we were able to do in 2020 relative to what we had in that is, in my opinion, truly remarkable. And I think we did that with very disciplined investment into the business, and I'm proud of what we were able to do and what the numbers we were able to put up. I think since I took over, we have got I think almost $600 million above midpoint of guidance over those years. What just kills me is we gave it all back and more, but we have been through that story already this morning. I won't take you through it again, but that is tough. You don't want to get back what you have created, and that is a difficult thing for us. The OP initiative continues, and it will continue. We baked that now. That is just a part of who we are. And we like to give this to you just because we want you to know when we tell you we are doing something, that we do it. But it is really embedded in our EBITDA. And then we are on track on our synergies for the - and namely the Crius and Ambit because Dynegy is pretty much done Even on the system side, the technology side, that is pretty much done at this point in time. And the last thing I will say and I will hand it over to Jim. Through all this, we still have - and I'm on the last slide here, prioritizing all stakeholders. Just briefly to touch base, this has been who we are since I have been here. We have been about all stakeholders. We continue to do it. We have made huge advancements on the environmental side with our employees and contractors and customers and suppliers in our communities. We are proud of that, and we expect to continue to do that. And I know we did announce that we had $5 million to help customers. And some people may say, "Well, there is a cost savings right there, Curt, why did you do that?" And it is because of what I said earlier, two things. One is we are about helping people. As a company, not just about making money. We do care about that, but we have a bunch of people down here that are in need. This became a survival game. This became a human's needs effort, and we took that seriously, just like we take seriously being the guardians of your investments, we do care also about people. And it is very important to the franchise of our retail businesses that we are out there, and we are helping others. We have not lost those franchises. This weather couldn't take the franchises away from us, and they have extreme value. And we have to keep investing in those franchises, but helping people is also a very important thing. And so we made that hard call in the face of adversity and uncertainty because that is who we are. That is what we are about. So with that, I'm going to give it to Jim. Jim is going to quickly go through financial results. And then I know you guys have Q&A, and we will try to answer everything we can as completely as possible. And so I will turn it over to Jim. Thank you.
James Burke: Thanks, Curt. I'm going to quickly cover Slide 16. As Curt said, I know we want to get to Q&A. I want to just hit two slides. Our full-year 2020 retail results were 176 million higher than our full-year 2019 results, driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, plus strong ERCOT margin performance partially offset by milder weather. The 197 million favorability in our collective generation segments was driven by higher margins in our Texas, East and Sunset segments, including the higher period-over-period benefits from our OPI initiatives, partially offset by lower capacity revenues. As it relates to the impacts of COVID-19, Vistra was able to navigate through the challenges brought on by the pandemic with minimal impacts to our financial performance. On the retail side, we only saw a small uptick in bad debt during the year, while our lower business volumes were offset by higher residential volumes. And as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May of 2020, our commercial team executed some opportunistic transactions in anticipation of the market volatility caused by COVID-19, resulting in a positive benefit to Vistra for the year. In addition to these strong financial results, our retail business grew its residential customer count in Texas year-over-year, reflecting strong performance by our legacy brands, while our generation business once again executed with commercial availability of over 95%. On the liquidity side as of year-end 2020, Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility. This strong liquidity position enabled Vistra to effectively manage the collateral requirements related to the winter storm Uri. As of February 25th, Vistra had more than $1.5 billion of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility to meet any liquidity needs. We can close with Slide 17. Vistra repaid more than $1.5 billion of debt in 2020 to end the year at our long-term leverage target of 2.5 time net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As of February 23rd, we have repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $21.15. $1.375 billion remains available under this authorization. We are continuing to execute on our strategic renewable and energy storage investments, including our Texas Phase I and California battery projects. As we have communicated to you, we will be disciplined as it relates to deploying capital, regularly evaluating all growth projects for financial viability. We will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns. As a result of this continuous review, we are currently pausing one growth project in West Texas due to updated economics driven by higher-than-anticipated congestion costs. I know many of you are wondering how our existing capital allocation plan will change as a result of the impacts of this winter storm. We expect to provide an updated capital allocation plan for 2021 on our first quarter earnings call. We remain committed to our dividend trajectory and to maintaining a strong balance sheet. The challenges brought on by the global pandemic in 2020 and this historic winter storm in Texas last week have tested our business model. We truly believe it was a one-time historic event. The winter event was a significant financial hit. Our people worked in very tough conditions to generate as much power for the greatest possible. Importantly, our business still has the strong assets that it had just two weeks ago. Both our customer base and our generation footprint remain intact, and we believe with solid growth prospects. We are a resilient team and we will stay focused on bringing value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Thanks so much for taking my questions and I really do appreciate the very frank and kind of thorough review that you all provided. So thank you. Just first, maybe on the natural gas supply situation. In terms of just the supplier obligations to you, is there a potential to litigate to the extent that firm supply was not provided or is that not likely?
Curtis Morgan: No, there is a potential to that.
Stephen Byrd: Okay. In the sense that sort of folks who had some firm supply obligation to you did not provide the gas. And the situations in Texas wouldn't necessarily excuse their delivery obligations?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. I mean look, so it is going to come down to - and I don't want to actually litigate it, but there are provisions and contracts. Every one of them is a little bit different, and it will come down to whether those provisions applied in this instance or not. And to be a very simple analysis, what I will say is there is potential. We are still doing the analysis as to whether it will make sense or not, and we can update you guys on that. But obviously it is something we need to take a look at, because we thought we had gas at a particular price. And obviously we didn't, and that was a big hit for us. So we will see where the stakes is, but there could be some disputes.
Stephen Byrd: Yes. Understood. And then the ERCOT pricing glitch on Monday, that is obviously - I share your frustration. That just seems like a tremendous just mistake by the - in terms of how the price was set. Is that also possible to - I know there was language about sort of adjusting that. But could that be adjusted? And obviously that would have a very substantial impact to your loss position. So I was just curious how you think about that.
Curtis Morgan: So I think the interesting thing on that one, Steve, is first of all, yes, it can be disputed. Secondly, it is going to be disputed on both ends. So the prospective increase to the cap and actually keeping it at the cap on Thursday into Friday is going to be something, I think, that is going - not only will be maybe challenged with Public Utility Commission, but it may be challenged at the legislature. So we absolutely believe that when you are in EEA 3 and you don't have reserves, you have negative reserves that you can't be anywhere but the cap. But there is a particular mechanism in pricing scheme that actually kicked in that had the prices being set at LMPs that were below the cap at times. And I think the commission rightly so determined that the price should be at the cap. Ultimately, I think they have the authority to make that order. I think we will likely challenge the notion that you can't retroactively price. But I think there may be others like retailers who may challenge whether it should have been set at the cap. So it is an unfortunate thing because billions of dollars changed hands in a week. People are going to go out of business over it. And I think people are going to try to see what they can do to change the playing field. So we won't really know until we get through all of that math, which I think will go on for some time. But we are probably going to contribute a little bit to the mess because there are some things that we think are legitimate to be - to dispute, and we may do that.
Stephen Byrd: And Curt, just on that, this point about the position gas power plants were in, it strikes me as such a problem from a market design point of view, in the sense that the gas plant owners were in this on Monday, this really tough position. Do you buy gas at very high prices, first, not knowing necessarily whether you are going to dispatch, but secondly, into a price --a power where you are going to lose a lot of money. And yet at the same time, you want to provide as many electrons as you can so the people of Texas. Am I getting that right or I may have misunderstood.
Curtis Morgan: No, you have got it exactly right, Stephen. And this was the dilemma that we were faced with. With an unknown load, an unknown financial obligation, but an absolute obligation to human needs. And this is the problem, and I said this last night, yesterday to the House and the Senate in Texas that I don't believe Texas can stop this type of an event, and I don't think any state really can'. I don't think they like the price cap. They don't like the grid products. They don't like consumers having it passed on. We don't like consumers having blips like this passed on because they will shop for another supplier or retailer. And so we all agree that the volatility in this market is probably not what it should be. On the other end of the spectrum, I'm not sure that everybody is ready to go to some full capacity market. But I do believe there is something that can be done in between where the price cap comes down and you increase the amount of reserves, which increases the revenues into the market and it increases the steel in the ground. So it brings this thing a little more stable with less layouts and less risk to consumers. Because what's a problem with the model now for us is as a retailer we don't want to increase price to consumers in the middle of this type of an event, yet our suppliers are increasing prices at will. And we get squeezed in the middle. That is an untenable situation. That is not something that can last. And I believe I made some good points and people are beginning to realize that in this market. So I am convinced that market design will help with that. But the other thing is we cannot let the gas system fail again, and it did. And I don't care what anybody says. All the way from the wellhead, I mean we are producing right now oil and gas in North Dakota. Don't tell me it can't be produced in that kind of weather. And so we can't have that happen again. I don't care if we produce more gas than we ever have in Texas because of demand. The reality is the pressures on the lines were not sufficient enough to get gas generators what they need it in order to be at the top. And we are in a virtuous cycle. We need to provide electricity for compressors and for gas processing and for production sites. We need gas bill to produce electricity. So they all have to work together. And sometimes, that is what regulatory - that is what regulation does and that is what policymakers do. And we need to make sure that happens.
Stephen Byrd: Very good. I could ask 50 more questions, but I will hand it over to others.
Curtis Morgan: Well, I think we are going to give a chance, I hope Tuesday.
Stephen Byrd: Yes, sir, Tuesday I think next week. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Fleishman: Hi good morning, thanks. I will try to limit to the one question and follow-up.
Curtis Morgan: You can do more than one.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Thanks, Curt. Just I think just a couple of days ago, you raised the dividend, and I think more - frankly, more than you were initially planning to for this year. Could you just talk about your thinking in doing that in the context of everything?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, that is an excellent question. So you know we moved it in September. And then we decided to just move it a couple of pennies and to $0.60. And it was $10 million, Steve. And we had made the call, and we just didn't go back on it. $10 million's still $10 million. So we decided to go forward with it and thought it was still the right thing. This is one of these things where if you do it, some people say, "Why the heck are you doing, raising your dividend?" Regardless of how much it is in the middle of something like this, honestly I think the way we are thinking about this is that this is a onetime event. It is unfortunate, but we are still on the trajectory when 2022 rolls around. We are still back to where we were on our capital allocation plan in 2023 and forward. And so we made the call to continue with that. Relatively small, but still obviously it is an obvious change in the middle of this type of situation. It certainly can be second guessed, but we thought it was the right thing to do to move forward with it. We still are very interested in our dividend. We think it is important to our investors. And so we decided to stick with it. Because we made that decision, Steve, by the way, before this hit. As a Board, we decided to do this, and we did not revisit it. We said we are going to go ahead and move forward with it.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. But I assume you did that with context knowing that you could get - even though this was a big hit, it is manageable in the scheme of the whole company?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So from a liquidity standpoint, we feel good. And not only do we feel good with what we have, we feel good with the partnerships we have with a number of different financial institutions that have frankly been very supportive. And they didn't know anything, by the way. They didn't know if we made money or we didn't make money. But they also knew people were winners and losers. And they have come to us and said, "Look, we believe in your long term. If you need it any kind of liquidity, we would be happy to make our balance sheet available to you to help you through this, if you needed it." I’m convinced that this is not a liquidity crisis for this company. This is a short run-material hit. We took a body blow. But I also believe that we will come back or out of this and move forward with strength. And the fact that people are willing to help us out in this, and they understand, they believe in us, that is huge to us. But Steve, I don't see this as a situation we are in dire straits. I would tell you, if we hadn't got our debt down and we are still the old IPP model, we would be in a different place.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, good. And then just a follow-up is just thinking - trying to ignore 2021 and what happened and looking to 2022 let's say and beyond. Can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about both generation, which I think forwards have moved up some? But is there any different strategy there for you? And then retail, how are you thinking about the implications it is for retail at 2022 and onward?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So a number that Jim talk a little bit about retail. But I will just say - I'm sorry, what was the first part of that? I got the -.
Steven Fleishman: Generation and hedging.
Curtis Morgan: Yes, yes, yes, sorry.
Steven Fleishman: Ignoring 2021, focusing for the future towards 2022.
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So I guess gets in a little bit to the capital allocation discussion too. I mean first of all, we still believe probably more so than we ever have, in Texas. Until there is a market design change, the generation is pretty darn important. And now we know obviously supply chain around our generation with gas is even more important than we ever thought. But we still believe that the generation that we have is important. I still think that we are going to see coal retirements. And we believe, probably even more now than ever, because my guess is this is also going to impact development in the ERCOT market. But we think there is value in these - in the projects that we are doing. So we continue to want to do those. I will say, though, Steve, that how we finance those and how we realize the value from them. I think we always have been open-minded, and we will continue to be open-minded about - I'm talking now about the renewable investments that we are doing. And so there could be some things that we do. I think we would like to buy our shares back, and we are going to probably need to do that even more. So the real challenge in 2021 is there is not going to be a lot of money to do that, unless we were to do some project-level financing or something like that, which we will consider. In 2022 and beyond, by the way, retail actually held up through this. And Steve or Jim can get into the details and tell you his thoughts on retail real quick. But we are looking not only to maintain our retail, but we may end up getting - we are a provider of last resort in ERCOT. And we may get some of the customers, if in fact customers drop their customers to the provider of last resort, which is a mechanism in ERCOT. We may get a significant amount of new customers. And we are also open to continuing M&A around retail. So we have been saying we would like to get a little more retail in our business. I think we are continuing that. We like that business. We are good at it. And so I think that hasn't changed. On the generation front. We were sort of reducing our generation exposure a little bit anyway, and we are becoming more and more matched. I know this event obviously shakes people because we ended up being short. It was because of things that we did not, could not have planned for. So I still think that we are going to head down a path where our generation is going to be reduced in terms of megawatts as we retire coal. And we will add some renewables and batteries, and we will still have generation. But I think we will be a much more balanced company as we go forward. Even with this event, we still think that is the right move. I hope that I -- Jim, do you want to say anything about retail quick?
James Burke: Yes, sure, I would. Thanks, Curt. Steve, I think over the evolution of the markets here in ERCOT, we have seen these events come every three to five-years. And it disciplines retailers to think differently about some of the collateral requirements and the hedging that is necessary to survive. This event had the chance to really create a runaway scenario for swing for the retail segment, for any retail business in ERCOT. And then the load shed capped out that exposure for some, and it actually it did for our business as well. And so the retail business held well. However, there still are some retail businesses that experienced swing, and they are reporting some results that are unfavorable. I think this business takes more capital than most people think. And it takes more discipline around hedging than most people think. And we found ourselves even in a business that we are very familiar with, having assets ready to run, being in a position to run and having trouble with the fuel supply, which we did not see coming to the extent obviously that had occurred. So I think there is going to be some retail consolidation. I think whether it is through the [indiscernible] process or whether that is through a chance to take a look at some books. I think we are going to come out of this in a relative position in a very strong place. And we look at 2022 and beyond as back to normal. And to your point about the curves, the curves being up in the next several years is a 200 million to 300 million difference than where we were just a few weeks ago. And so we will see how that plays out. But this is a tough one, tough one to get through. But I think coming out on the other side, we are going to be relatively positioned in a good place.
Steven Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you for all the color and commentary. I wish you guys the best. Can we talk about capital allocation? I know you mentioned an update coming, but there is some - you just alluded to it, so I want to bring it up more directly here. It seems like there is some latitude in the budget, especially if you think about having a probably disproportionate preference to review buybacks here. How do you think about investments in renewables and the ability not to pursue them, but to monetize those selectively as you complete them? Certainly, it seems like an added source, but also can we address the credit rating and your thought process, perhaps initially with the rating agencies?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, great questions, Julien. So on the renewables, I think you sort of stated accurately. And I tried to portray this, maybe I didn't do a very good job on it. But I think there are some opportunity to potentially raise capital in a different way, let's put it that way, that could add capital to buy back shares. And I think we would like to buy our shares back. So I think we are going to be very open-minded. These projects have value to them. And now that can be somewhat contingent on also having contracted projects. And of course we have a retail business that we can look at to contract with, but we also can do that externally with third parties. So I think there is some work in 2021, we will do to make sure that. But we are not in a position where we have done it ahead and that we absolutely have to do it, but I think it is worth doing. And we were considering it even before this event, but I think it is an even higher priority. Jim, do you have anything you want to add to that? But that is kind of how I see that. And then I can answer the next piece of it too.
James Burke: Our view is very similar to Curt, and I think there may be opportunities to look at current operating assets in the market, are those underway, as current owners or projects might have seen the performance get and how they hedged some of those assets in this market as well. And so I think there could be other opportunities that weren't on the horizon just a few weeks ago.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It sounds interesting.
Curtis Morgan: We have looked at that, Julien. And the problem is again if you want to sell it, and return to the hedge, I suppose you could do that. But the values just aren't there. There is so much generation that is either explicitly or implicitly for sale in the market that - and I don't feel like we have to do that. But if we found an opportunity to do that, that made some financial sense, we don't need to own all the megawatts that we have, and so we would consider that. But I'm not - we are not going to rush to that because we are not in a financial distress. And I think we are going to be a little more disciplined. I think I would rather look for ways to save money and to do things like that rather than to force a sale in the middle of a market that is not a particularly good market to sell assets in.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I understand.
Curtis Morgan: You asked about the ratings - yes, so rating agencies I will just say this, we have had some early discussions with them. And this is, like it is to you guys, it is an initial shock. They know that we are still disciplined, and we will continue to pay down debt and that we have been that way. And so look, I think we have had constructive discussions. I have nothing to announce at this point in time about that, and they don't either. But I would say the discussions have been constructive. And I'm going to spend some time I could. I was in these hearings all day yesterday. I'm going to spend some time with a couple of the agencies myself because I couldn't make the meetings and talk to them. But I found the discussions to be very open and honest and constructive, and I'm hopeful that we will be okay there.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Shar Prasa] (Ph) from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
James Kennedy: It is actually James for Shar. Curt, to build off your policy points about middle ground between high-priced assets and a capacity market, I mean we watched the hearings yesterday. It sounds like there is sort of momentum kind of from where we stand today. Could you give us any probability on policy change actually coming out of the spring session in the legislature?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So look, we were asked to bring back ideas in a week. This event has really shaken the state of Texas from the very top. I was able to speak with some of the obviously the leadership in the state of Texas, they don't want this to happen again. I think they are beginning to realize that the mix of assets in the market combined with the structure itself is not sustainable, pretty obvious to them. And they also know this was a big weather event. And we can't lose sight of that, that this was an extreme weather event. But at the same time, they have to ask themselves even so, do we really want to even have to take the risk of this type of event. And I think they are asking themselves, and they know the answer, none of them can stomach really the idea that a bunch of this high pricing power is going to get passed on to customers. And so they realize that that is an untenable position to be in for us, and they are worried about having enough generation. And they realize if you don't have a market structure that works, people aren't going to invest. So that tells me that there is a very good probability that we could get something done here, and I would say north of 50%. And I wouldn't normally say that about any process like that, but I see momentum. And I know our company is going to have a seat at the table. And we are going to be working on this extensively in the next few days, because I do not want to lose the momentum. I think we do need a change. And were already considering these things, and so we were prepared. And I think it is time to get everybody together and find a way to move this market. Still using competitive market principles, but I think stabilizing it somewhat.
James Kennedy: Got it. Thanks. This will be it.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Amit Sakar] (Ph) from BMO. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey Curt, thank you for taking my questions. I’m in Houston. So I hope you will indulge me since I just got the power back. So I figure I have earned it too. I think Curt, you kind of f talked a little bit about the Oak Grove coal supply issues with some of the rail transportation not kind of getting through. I'm just curious, but don't you typically have like a coal power that would represent a couple of weeks of burn? I guess you aren't shipping it coal every day to kind of burn that coal. Can you kind of fill us in a little bit on kind of the issues there?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, I will, and then Jim can jump in. But it was kind of two things. Getting coal to the coal silos, but it also was wet coal that we actually had. And so what we were - and that was creating issues with the front end process to eventually burn coal. And so it was those two things. So we were trying to get fresh coal in, and then we were having problems with the rail. Because the coal we had on the ground was frozen, and it was also wet in going up and causing problems that we end up having to take the units down. But that is what I understand it. But Jim has been working on this night and day. So why don't we let him also explain his knowledge of what happened?
James Burke: Sure. Thanks, Amit, for the question. That is one of the benefits of having a mine operation right there is that we can self-supply we have several days worked at the plant. And then of course we have at the mine, we have much more under whole barn, a covered area. So the thought was when the coal pile, which is right by the plant, is exposed, it froze over, becomes basically chunks of ice that you can't put through the equipment without tearing it up. So the goal is to try to get the dryer coal over from the mine to the plant. And that transportation system is really tough, not just the tracks, but the railcars, the doors that you used to dump the call they are freezing. So they were freezing shut and then we couldn't actually once we got them open, we couldn't get them back closed. And so we had a supply chain even within our own system where it was effectively difficult to work in the freezing conditions that got worse through the middle of the week Before we were able to find ways to work through that. So that wasn't about a rail coming in from elsewhere. It was really between the mine and the plant and trying to get the best fuel we could. At Martin Lake, we obviously do have also a supply on hand. It was a derated plant because of the freezing temperatures and also dealing with the pile, effectively turning into ice. And so we ended up our conveyor systems where we are transporting this call up through to the plants, they are exposed as well in many parts of the country. Those are completely enclosed. So these systems, as Curt mentioned earlier, they were designed for the heat and the warm weather, not the freezing temperatures we were in. So we took de-rates on that plan as well. We ended up at a 70% capacity factor for coal during the week. So the capacity factor is certainly lower than we expected and wanted to have. But that 30% that we were not able to keep going, and that includes the de-rates and being off-line. That just became a very expensive prospect for us. Because as Curt said, we were replacing $5 to $20 a megawatt hour fuel with $2,000 fuel in the form of gas that we were burning in some of our old gas steam units. And so a little bit of miss on the volume there multiplied by the delta on fuel cost was substantial. So we are going to have to look at the coal handling and look at what resiliency we need to build in for this type of a cold weather stretch at our coal plants.
Unidentified Analyst: And I guess that kind of leads into my follow-up question. Just going back to kind of the press release you guys put out Wednesday, I guess kind of in the midst of all of this. And I have heard - I think you testified to this yesterday in front of legislature as well. If I kind of look at the percentage of load of cut you kind of reserving, and I kind of used Monday as an example since that was kind of the height of this. Is it fair to say if we set aside MGP, assume that ran - that your fossil fleet kind of ran at a kind of a blended kind of capacity factor of like 70%, 75%?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. And so like with prices kind of on Tuesday and Wednesday kind of clearing at the cap, and it looked like you guys had some length or heat rate length open going into this. I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around on kind of on why the losses where they were to such an extent. Are you guys kind of saying that because you did such a good job in a light state on in north zone versus say Houston zone that you just - and the demand was so high there relatively, that you guys kind of found yourself short, whereas other kind of generation units that were pointed at Houston zone basically had the benefit of the load just basically being cut, so they basically weren't short anymore? Yes. So I mean - go ahead.
Scott Hudson: I mean yes in essence, this was a very interesting pattern because heading into the weather event when you see what the temperatures were going to be. This looked like we are generators, specialty generators with length would have an opportunity to make potentially a good return on their efforts. And retailers, no matter how much they were headed, whether it was through a P95 or P99 scenario, they were going to swing and likely pay much higher prices to cover their obligation to their customers. So it was originally going to look like a good generator segment opportunity and probably a tough one for retailers. Once the load shed happened and the load shed happened, not just curtailing load for retail but it actually curtailed and contributed to the gas supply issues, the retailers kind of got stopped out on their exposure to the swing. And in some cases depending on how much load was shed, could have become lost on their supply position. And the generators and the ones that were online including ourselves, we could not get the fuel to meet the obligation of what we had sold forward to both third parties as well as our own supply book. So it shifted this load curtailment shifted the entire risk from what should have been on a retail segment back to a generation segment, because of its linkage to the fuel supply challenge on particularly natural gas. And that is we were long. We had an ability to capture this, but you are long if you get the fuel. If you don't get the fuel, you are short. And that is why when we put the press release out, we put a lot of emphasis on the fact that we were having fueling challenges. And we also wanted to do address that our units were winterized, they were there running. And we have an opportunity here if we can solve the field challenges. And despite all that, we were still a disproportionate amount of the generation on the grid. So it played out very differently than we would have thought a week or two ago, but those are the major drivers.
Curtis Morgan: And Jim, I will just add that what happened is too is Monday, as I said, pricing was not at the cap. For this very strange reason, we were long Monday. Then we started having gas delivery issues, pricing issues as well as pressure issues. And then we lost Oak Grove for about day and a half, which is our low-cost fuel. And so it is like one of these sayings where if it could go bad, it did. And all those things contributed, but a big chunk of it really was around gas. The cost of gas as well as the amount of gas we were getting delivered. And then there was another - that is a big bucket. That is like, I think Jim has said, about two-thirds. And about third of it was around our coal of that total. And I know - because - I mean you can only imagine what I was doing to meet - I was like pulling my hair out. Like I thought we were long. I thought we were in a good position. We are one of the biggest generators in terms of percentage on the grid. You think $9,000 cap, you are thinking everything is going well. But when you start tracing through it, it begins to make sense and unravel as to how our position changed and how we were - had the inability to really do much about it. But we did the right thing, but it was financially not good. And that is a tough thing when you do things and you know that you were doing the right thing and the outcome doesn't swing your way, it is very difficult.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate all the time, Curt. I know you had a hell of a day yesterday. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan: Yes. Take care.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call, and I would like to turn it back to Curt Morgan for final comments.
Curtis Morgan: Well, I appreciate people that are still hanging in there. But thank you very much for your interest in our company. Tough week last week, but this company is strong, resilient. It is a good company, and we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. I hope you all have a great weekend, and look forward to talking to you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you once again for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to this Vistra Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering third quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release.  Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Hudson, Executive Vice President and President of Retail; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives on the call to address questions in the second part of today's webcast as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. We appreciate your time and interest in Vistra during this busy third quarter earnings season. It was just five weeks ago when we last connected with you at our virtual investor event, where we laid out our capital allocation plan for the next few years and provided additional details regarding our planned portfolio transformation. As we announced on the call, we expect to transform our generation fleet, including growing our renewable and energy storage presence, while retiring the majority of our existing coal plants, significantly decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our operations. We believe, we are our natural owner of renewable and energy storage assets given our capabilities and competitive position, and have a high degree of competence that we can generate healthy return from these assets through the same skills and methodology by which we extract significant value from our existing fleet.  We are not going to give away the value to others by entering into below market power purchase agreements, and we have the capabilities to manage the market risk.  We also own a portfolio of highly-efficient low-emitting natural gas assets that can provide reliable dispatchable power and complement the intermittent nature of renewable resources. The diversity of our portfolio enables our team to structure renewable products that can ensure reliability at an affordable price.  As we have recounted in the past, every reputable and objective study on the changing power generation landscape has natural gas playing a significant role for several years to come, especially as we electrify the economy. The most recent study by E3, a well-respected energy consulting firm, is another good example. And let's not forget, we already serve nearly 5 million retail customers, many of which are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable sources.  I know we did not spend as much time on our retail business during our virtual investor event in September, but it is one of the cornerstones of our business model, and we expect to prudently invest in it, as evidenced by the announcement of a highly attractive tuck-in retail business we announced today that Scott Hudson, the President of our Retail Business will discuss. Through growing retail and reducing our exposure to coal generation, we will continue to optimize our retail to wholesale match.  It is important to keep in perspective that it's going to take trillions of dollars of investment over several years for the U.S. electricity grids to meaningfully transition away from thermal resources. The current generating fleet in the U.S. was invested in over many decades. In this respects, we will play an important role in that transition, as well as provide critical reliability via our flexible gas assets.  As we have just recently spent considerable time on these topics, we plan to focus today on the very strong third quarter and year-to-date results of our integrated business. We will also provide a business update on our retail operations.  Before I turn to our third quarter results, I would be remised not to acknowledge that the country is experiencing another wave of COVID-19 cases as we enter the flu season, albeit with a lower mortality rate.  As we have said before, the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have had only five cases we can trace to being contracted at work, successfully containing further spread. Vistra is dedicated to staying vigilant and focused as we continue to operate safely to keep the lights on in this unprecedented environment. We will also continue to focus on helping our communities and customers through this difficult period by making corporate donations, procuring computers for children in need, and offering payment plans and deferral programs for our customers. Just a few examples of our commitment to helping others in need. We hope all of you are also staying safe and healthy.  I'm going to start on Slide 6, where we set forth our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. In the third quarter Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1,185 million which is 10% above third quarter of 2019 results despite operating through a pandemic in 2020. These higher results might appear counterintuitive, as it was in the third quarter of 2019, when the Texas market saw meaningful scarcity pricing intervals. We did not see similar scarcity pricing this summer as the hottest days fell on the weekends, and fleet performance across Texas was exceptional, exceeding what was already strong performance in the summer of 2019.  As we often reiterate, scarcity events typically have an overall limited impact on current period results, as we are usually largely hedged heading into any given summer. Rather, where scarcity pricing events can be the most beneficial for Vistra’s financial results, relates to the impact they have on forward pricing. We saw this phenomenon play out in the summer of 2019, as it was in August 2019, when the summer 2020 forwards in Texas rose meaningfully. The ERCOT forward stayed at elevated levels through the end of the year, giving Vistra several months of opportunity to hedge our summer 2020 output at attractive prices that were on average higher than the average prices realized for 2019. We're also continuing to see the benefits of our Operations Performance improvement or OP Initiative materialize.  As a reminder, our OP program is on track to deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020 as compared to 2019. With the benefits of our OP program combined with the Dynegy, Crius and Ambit synergies projected to reach an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year end.  Our retail business had lower adjusted EBITDA period-over-period driven by the additional volume from Crius and Ambit acquisitions. You will recall that our retail business can generate negative EBITDA in the third quarter in periods of higher wholesale pricing due to the seasonality and power costs in Texas, which is why this incremental value drove EBITDA lower in the period. While approaches vary across companies, we do not levelize our cost of power throughout the year. Rather we flow through our actual costs while our retail pricing and revenues are relatively flat.  However, it is important to note that our retail business results exceeded management expectations for the quarter, which are embedded in our guidance as a result of stronger margins and lower sales costs contributing to our 2020 guidance raise for the segment during our September investor event. In addition, our three legacy retail brands once again organically grew residential customer counts in Texas during the course. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2,964 million, results that are tracking ahead of management expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by nearly 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model.  It was a strong performance through the first part of the year that led Vistra to raise its 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint by $150 million and $165 million respectively in September. Year-to-date, this Vistra is tracking solidly above this recently raised adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint. And as we've mentioned before, it will be the fifth year in a row that we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, not exactly the kind of performance associated with the stock or the free cash flow yield in the 20s.  Today, we are reaffirming our recently raised 2020 guidance ranges as set forth on Slide 6. Though, assuming we once again successfully execute in the fourth quarter, we are expecting another adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint be. Importantly, our financial guidance implies an adjusted EBITDA through adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion ratio of approximately 69% for the year, which supports our recently announced capital allocation plan and the anticipated significant return of capital to our financial stakeholders. We have been able to significantly exceed our original free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint and achieve this high conversion ratio even with the early receipt in 2019 of nearly $95 million of alternative minimum tax refunds that were projected in our 2020 guidance and while accelerating some planned outages in 2020, and opportunistically taking advantage of business opportunities that required a higher use of current year cash flows. Turning now to Slide 7. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, which we initiated during our virtual investor event in September. We have continued to execute since that time, increasing our confidence in our 2021 guidance ranges, and further supporting our view that the upper end of the guidance ranges are achievable.  Importantly, Vistra’s fundamental analysis continues to suggest that the current 2021 forward prices in ERCOT are meaningfully discounting the probability of summer scarcity events. When evaluating all the supply and demand variables at play, we are bullish as ever regarding our opportunity to capture value in 2021. In fact, last Monday, a random Monday in late October, the ERCOT market found itself in a period of scarcity, where prices surged to over $1,000 per megawatt hour around 7 p.m. and stayed well above $100 per megawatt hour for most of the day. These price outcomes were driven by several factors including load coming in 1,500 to 3,000 megawatts higher than predicted in the day-ahead market. Lower available thermal generation due to the post-summer outage season for most units significantly lowered renewables contribution than expected, including wind coming in approximately 13,000 megawatts lower than anticipated during the peak 7 p.m. hour partly driven by icing issues on the turbine blades and the limited contribution from solar throughout the day given the cloud cover. Importantly, the observed strong demand levels extending into the evening hours was also a key contributor to the strong pricing we saw on Monday. As we know and have observed in other markets, the presence of strong evening hour demand does not line up well with the solar contribution profile. This mismatch between demand and the solar generation profile is an emerging trend in Texas, and it will likely be an increasing source of volatility as the supply stack evolves, volatility that Vistra's commercial team and generating assets are positioned to capture, as we have demonstrated time and time again. This is just another reminder of how quickly prices in Texas can change when intermittent renewable resources are not available. While the value of the forward curve at any single point in time leading into the delivery year is important, what is most important to Vistra is that we are able to strategically capture value as market opportunities arise, just like we did last Monday in Texas. Our assets and business positions offer significant levers to capture value that can be represented and captured in the forward, or it can be locked into through bilateral transactions. We have been able to construct a realized wholesale price curve that has supported our consistent overperformance for the last 5 years. We are continuing to make progress in this regard and executing for 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. We believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range, and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. The market clearly does not share this view. As action on climate change accelerates in private institutions, and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for Vistra. In our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting Vistra's valuation. There is no justification for Vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company. Free cash flow yield at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress, with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. None of this applies to Vistra. The only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect Vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. In our view, Vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double-digits, especially when taking into account where the company's debt trades and the prospect for investment-grade credit ratings in the next year. The debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding. Rather, if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%, the recent prices where Vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to Vistra's generation segments. In our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current ESP environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis. The bulk of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from its generation segments is derived from its relatively young, low-cost, highly flexible gas field generation fleet, with 2 of the lowest cost nuclear and coal plants in the country in Comanche Peak and Oak Grove, both in Texas. We believe these assets will continue to be critical resources in the markets where we operate and will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, most of which will be returned to investors. There is absolutely no way that these assets have zero equity value, and in fact, they have significant positive value. In addition, the assumption of no value from our generation fleet extends to our investments in solar and batteries, yet standalone renewable companies are garnering lofty valuations in the markets today. An appropriate free cash flow yield applied to the true long-term free cash flow of Vistra would produce a stock price substantially above our current trading price and at least in line with most sell-side analysts’ price targets. As long as this valuation disconnect persists, we will continue to buy back our shares. If you turn to the next slide, Slide 8, we have set forth how we think Vistra will be able to not only compete but to lead over the next couple of decades. Since 2016, when Vistra was first spun off from its parent as a publicly traded company, we have taken actions to build a business that prioritizes a strong balance sheet and low-cost and market-leading integrated operations with high-quality assets. We also took a company that was 70% coal and transformed it by retiring 16,000 megawatts of coal, adding natural gas renewables and battery generation and growing our retail business by over 3 million customers, all while significantly reducing costs, improving generation performance and expanding our EBITDA at highly attractive returns, which we highlighted at our investor event. We derive approximately 95% of our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA from our 4 core operating segments, Retail, Texas, East and West, where we believe we have meaningful and attractive transformational growth opportunities into the future. Of that 95%, only 15% now comes from coal And we convert approximately 65% of our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth, which has enabled the return of more than $6 billion of capital to our financial stakeholders over the last 4 years. With our expectation that we will return an average of $1.5 billion to our financial stakeholders annually, we estimate that we will return another approximately $7.5 billion by 2025 and a cumulative approximately $15 billion by 2030, with total annual returns of 15% or more projected. As we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, we also believe we are on track to achieve investment-grade credit ratings next year. The steps we have taken over the last 4 years have created a strong foundation from which we can launch our future initiatives. True to our name, we have a vision for success and a tradition of excellence. And now we have introduced our Vistra Zero brand, which will build on this vision and tradition as our zero carbon growth engine for our generation transformation. As we look ahead to 2030, we expect we will continue on this path, evolving into a market-leading integrated business that plays a key role in powering America through its renewable transition by making prudent incremental investments in renewables and energy storage, growing our retail business and offering innovative green products and value-added services to our customers and supporting the reliability of the electric grid at affordable prices with our flexible natural gas fleet. In fact, by 2030, we project that more than half of our adjusted EBITDA will be derived from our carbon-free operations, with 90% of our adjusted EBITDA coming from our retail business and low to zero-carbon generating assets. We believe we can grow our EBITDA over the next decade, even while retiring the majority of our existing coal portfolio, by investing only a modest fraction of our free cash flow back into the business. We expect the majority of our free cash flow will be returned to our financial stakeholders, primarily through dividends and share repurchases. And if we allocate only $1 billion per year to share repurchases at the recent prices where our stock has been trading, we can buy back the entire market cap of our company in less than 9 years. This is all while maintaining balance sheet strength and expected investment-grade credit ratings, a pretty impressive value and growth story, if you ask me. As difficult as it is to project 20 years into the future, as the decarbonization of the economy continues, we expect our disciplined transformation to accelerate into 2040. By 2040, we estimate at least 70% to 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from our carbon-free operations, including retail, nuclear, renewable and energy storage. We continue to believe that gas plants will remain a key component of the supply stack up until 2040 and beyond, initially as a base load and reliability resource and, over time, as a transition resource complementing renewables. The playing field is changing. ESG, in particular, environmental stewardship, especially as it relates to climate change, is an increasingly important component for portfolio managers’ investment decisions, and Vistra is committed to prudently be out in front in the transformation leading a sustainable company reaching its fair and full value. Before I turn the call over to Scott, I did want to highlight 3 new slides we included in the appendix to our investor presentation this quarter related to our broad focus on our stakeholders as part of our ESG efforts. We believe a company that prioritizes employees, customers, communities, suppliers and investors is one that will attract the best talent and retain customers and investors. Slides 15 through 17 in our appendix highlight some of our recent ESG initiatives in these areas. We will update these slides on a quarterly basis, and we hope you find them informative and helpful. I will now turn the call over to Scott Hudson to discuss our retail business in a bit more detail.
Scott Hudson : Thank you, Curt. Turning to Slide 10, we wanted to spend some time on today's earnings call highlighting the stability of our retail business, its resiliency through the COVID-19 pandemic and our opportunities for continued growth. As many of you who have been following Vistra for some time might recall, Vistra's retail business has been a stable contributor of EBITDA since the retail market in Texas opened fully to competition in 2008. Prior to the Dynegy transaction, which closed in April of 2018, Vistra's retail business grew solely through organic activity. And over the period from 2008 to 2017, we generated an average of approximately $800 million of EBITDA annually, even in the face of a number of volatile power price cycles, including the extremely hot summer of 2011 and the polar vortex of 2014. The Dynegy transaction that closed in 2018 expanded Vistra’s reach from a Texas-only retailer to one with operations in 5 of the top 10 competitive markets in the U.S. Then last year, we added both Crius Energy and Ambit Energy to our portfolio of businesses, expanding the Vistra Retail footprint to 19 states in the District of Columbia, adding several new brands, high-margin residential natural gas to the portfolio and a powerful network marketing channel. Vistra's customer counts grew to nearly 5 million, and our total delivered load grew to approximately 95 terawatt hours. In 2018 and 2019, our retail EBITDA averaged approximately $825 million. And we are currently on track to exceed our recently raised 2020 guidance midpoint of $955 million, with our 2021 adjusted EBITDA projected at nearly $1 billion. This expected performance in 2020 is particularly impressive in light of the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. In May, we estimated that COVID-19 could potentially be a negative driver of our 2020 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $70 million due to anticipated higher bad debt expense and the anticipated impact of lower volumes on our financial results. We now expect the impact from COVID-19 to reflect only $10 million to $15 million of higher bad debt expense in 2020, as lower business volumes during the year have been largely offset by higher residential volumes due to increased usage from the work-from-home population. Our strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic is a direct result of the numerous initiatives we implemented to help our customers through these unprecedented times. For example, we utilized our data and analytics capabilities to proactively contact customers whose usage patterns had changed due to working-from-home requirements in order to make sure that they were on the right electricity plan. These efforts resulted in higher retention rates and enhanced customer satisfaction. We also offered payment flexibility to customers unsure of their financial future. Our experience has shown that if you help a customer through hard times, he will be a customer for life. Importantly, TXU Energy, our flagship retail brand, continued to maintain its 5-star rating in the ERCOT market and was the top-performing major retail electric brand in each month of the third quarter. In addition, TXU Energy has been a leader in innovation year-in and year-out, as evidenced by products like Free Nights, Free Nights and Solar Days, Free Pass and many others, all of which have been copied by our competition. In short, our strong 2020 is proving out. Vistra Retail continues to provide stability and robust financial results for the integrated model. As we look to the future, we expect to continue to grow our portfolio, both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. In addition to the organic growth on the residential customer side, Vistra has demonstrated its ability to organically grow its business markets portfolio each year in ERCOT, and we have line of sight to consistent business markets growth in targeted regions outside of Texas. We also plan to continue to strengthen our customer relationships through various value-added offerings. On that point, Vistra has been active in the cross-selling of non-commodity products and services for over 8 years. We have invested in our platform, and we have seen significant growth, with customer interest growing threefold since 2013. We currently offer services like home warranties and insurance, smart thermostat, HVAC services and a variety of solar, energy storage and green products. We offer most of these products through an asset-light partnership model, which allows Vistra to nimbly test which services resonate with our consumers without making large capital investments. Beyond the opportunity to earn incremental EBITDA through these bolt-on product offerings, we have found that the expanded relationship results in a stickier portfolio, ultimately extending the life of our customers. As a result, we are continuing to expand the universe of value-added products we offer. On the natural gas side, our portfolio is focused on the high-margin residential and small business segments, where approximately 1 in 4 of our Crius and Ambit customers carry a natural gas product into the fuel markets. We are exploring expanding this offering into new markets in the future. We are similarly continuing to be opportunistic when evaluating potential M&A transactions. On that note, I'm excited to announce today that we have just executed an agreement to acquire the Texas electric retail customers of Infinite Energy and Veteran Energy. The transaction will expand Vistra's retail footprint in the attractive Texas market, where we currently derive 95% of our retail profitability. The transaction, which was executed at an estimated acquisition multiple of approximately 3.7 times is expected to close later this month. This acquisition is just another example of Vistra's ability to take advantage of our scale and market position to grow our business through attractive tuck-in opportunities.  Vistra Retail has the lowest cost structure of any major retailer in the country, and our operations are incredibly cash-efficient, dropping over 90% of our EBITDA to free cash flow. Retail continues to be the most attractive channel for Vistra to sell its generation [light]. And after accounting for the recently announced retirements in our generation fleet, we expect we will be more than 80% matched generation to load. We have an exceptionally strong retail business that is focused on the customer and a leader in innovation, and we will continue to leverage these capabilities as we grow.  I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.
David Campbell : Thank you, Scott. As shown on Slide 12, in the third quarter, Vistra once again outperformed management expectations embedded in our guidance. Ongoing operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.185 billion, which was $108 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our Retail segment down $53 million, and our generation segments up a collective $161 million. As Curt described, the positive year-over-year variance in generation was driven by higher margins in our Texas segment. The negative variance in our Retail segment was a product with higher volumes from our Crius and Ambit acquisitions during negative margin months. You may recall from our discussions during third quarter performance last year, our plan projected negative adjusted EBITDA in our Retail segment during the third quarter. This phenomenon is a result of the seasonality of power cost in Texas where power prices are at their highest in August, driving up our third quarter cost of goods sold, whereas retail customer prices are generally at more consistent levels through the year. This negative third quarter margin is offset by higher gross margin in the first, second and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, Vistra's ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $2,964 million or $346 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. The favorability is driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, our operations performance improvement initiatives and higher energy margin, primarily in our Texas segment. With 3 quarters of outperformance relative to management expectations for the year, Vistra is tracking solidly above its recently raised adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for 2020. This quarter, we are also reporting our financial results in accordance with our new segments. Of note, the new Sunset segment includes plants that have announced future retirement dates, providing transparency into the contributions and potential liabilities from those facilities, and more importantly, separating their financial results from our longer-term assets and businesses. Once the Sunset assets retire, it will be moved into the Asset Closure segment. When evaluating the best path forward for these plants, Vistra explored a potential sale. However, the bid-ask spread on the closure cost was [too great], as buyers were generally too conservative due to relative lack of experience and the transactional requirements were too complex. In the end, we determined that Vistra is better equipped to handle the wind-down of these assets as we have significantly more experience in the process than most others. We can manage the retirement of the assets without taking a significant hit to value, while benefiting from the cash generated from the leased facilities prior to their retirement. Once the assets are retired, Vistra has had very good success in divesting some of these facilities in associated closure liabilities to third parties. In addition, retiring the assets, as opposed to selling them, has a greater impact on Vistra's greenhouse gas emission reductions, as selling the assets would similarly reduce our baseline. It is better for the company and for the environment for Vistra to take the action to retire the plants. Turning now to Slide 13. Vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020, as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA. As of September 30, we have paid down approximately $1,150 million of debt this year, including the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which totaled $550 million as of the end of the second quarter, as well as the redemption of all of the remaining senior unsecured notes issued by Vistra Corp. Last week, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. With respect to credit ratings, shortly following our September virtual investor event, we received an upgrade to BB+ by S&P ratings, which also maintained its positive outlook. This upgrade positions Vistra to one notch below investment grade. And of note, all 3 credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch and S&P have Vistra on positive outlook. As a result, we expect that a potential upgrade to investment-grade is achievable before the end of 2021. In furtherance of our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation plan for 2021 and '22 calls for incremental debt reduction of approximately $550 million over the 2-year period, while the bulk of our free cash flow of more than $2 billion is expected to be returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As it relates to the dividend, it is our intention to increase our dividend by approximately 8% in 2021, at the high end of our expected 6% to 8% annual growth rate. In 2022, we anticipate a step change increase in the annual dividend to $0.76 per share. Both of these increases will be subject to Board approval at the appropriate time. Our recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program begins on January 1st of next year and replaces any repurchase authority that remains outstanding under our existing programs as of the end of this year. The last component of our 2021 and 2022 capital allocation plan is to grow our business through investments that have attractive return profiles and support our continued retail growth or expansion into zero-carbon resources. We expect we will allocate approximately $1.15 billion of capital to transformational growth investments over the next 2 years, which includes capital for our previously announced Moss Landing and Oakland battery storage projects as well as our recently announced Texas Phase 1 renewable and storage development projects. These investments exceed our threshold of 500 basis points to 600 basis points above our cost of equity and are consistent with our strategic transformation plans. Vistra's track record of delivering on our financial commitments, combined with impressive conversion of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth, supports our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet on both investing in our business and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Our strong performance year-to-date in 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, is further evidence of the resilience of our integrated business model. We remain optimistic that with the ongoing successful execution of our business plan, our stock price will ultimately reflect its fundamental value. I would now like to turn the call back over to Curt to make a few remarks on the election.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, David. And Scott, thank you as well. So not much to say at this point. I think most of you have been following the election and things look pretty tight, too tight to call. Of course, it's going to be interesting to see whether we'll have divided government or whether we will have a single-party control. That, of course, would end up being the Democrats, because it looks like the house will go to the Democrats. The point that I'd like to make about the election is that -- and we've said this before, that we feel like we can be successful under any administration. We're an apolitical entity. We have friends on both sides of the aisle. We've worked very well with both Republicans and Democrats. And we, of course, studied, like most of you have, where the policies might go and feel like we can benefit under either administration. So we look forward to working with whoever the administration is and with whatever the Congressional makeup ends up being. And we feel like we can make progress under either administration, and however Congress gets set up. So it's a little too early to tell on this, as you guys know. This could drag out for a while as well, given what we're seeing. But we believe that Vistra is well-positioned under either control administration by Democrats or Republicans. So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just, Curt, a couple of questions here. I know obviously, you did the small retail acquisition in Texas in the quarter. It looks like a pretty healthy multiple. Very high cash flow conversion on that. Can you just maybe shed any more details on the process there? Is this something that we should kind of expect intermittently? Or was it more of a sort of one-off? And are you seeing any additional opportunities?
Curt Morgan : Good question, Shahriar. So, we are seeing these types of opportunities come up. What can happen is, and what we typically do through our M&A team, as we will reach out to entities like this, and in some cases we'll reach out and say, are you interested in exiting the business? And in other cases, they may be looking to exit. We happen to know a couple of the principals. And we actually do the supply -- we actually do their supply right now for Infinite. So, we have a relationship, an existing relationship. And I think when they decided that it was time for them to do something different, they of course looked at us as one of the top candidates for buying their business. So, this one, I think, came to us a little bit different. But we have an active process where we are reaching out to some entities. And then again, some will reach out to us.  And there are, I'd say, a few of these, it seems like all the time. And some of which we are able to sign a deal with and some that we are not. So, I would expect that this can continue. And they're just -- they're smallish in nature, but they add up over time.
Shahriar Pourreza : Then you noted that in the upper end -- you've been at the upper end of your '21 guidance, and that's fairly achievable. Can you just maybe refresh us on what the drivers are that may be giving you a little bit more incremental confidence? I mean, it looks directionally like you're pointing to the economy and supply demand. I guess, how has that improved since late September? So maybe just a little bit of drivers there.
Curt Morgan : Yes. So, October has turned out to be a pretty decent month for us on the retail side of the business, although we're still closing out things. But there's a potential that we -- the weather was decent, and we still have to take a look at what the final tally looks like, but it could be in a favorable position. And we've also -- as you know, we were pretty well hedged on the wholesale side throughout the year at some reasonably good pricing. So, I think that we also go into things a little bit, as you might expect, because we don't know exactly what's going to happen with weather. And our retail business actually does well in these shoulder months, that we tend to go a little conservative even when we revise our guidance. And I think what's showing is that we're more on target with where we thought we would end up being. Plus I think we may see a little better October.  All of that is beginning to give us more confidence. This is just a situation where our confidence is growing around getting somewhere above the midpoint and heading towards the upper end of that range. And that's simply what it is. But I think October also may end up being a favorable month. Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we haven't closed out the books yet.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And I was referring to -- I'm assuming you're referring to '21, correct?
Curt Morgan : Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said -- okay, you're talking about '21, I apologize.
Shahriar Pourreza : Yes, exactly. No, it's okay.
Curt Morgan : In '21, so that's a little bit different. I apologize for that. In '21, I mean, I alluded to this in my comments that there's -- our business position and assets do offer us option value. And the market, depending on whether you're short or long, or where your book is positioned, people look at our business position and they see value for them and we see value in our business. And we're able to either transact in the forward. Sometimes, the forwards recognize scarcity. And sometimes, they recognize the value that's embedded in our assets and you can use that to hedge. Sometimes, like right now, it's not fully reflected in the forward curves, but that value is still there and you can capture it on a bilateral basis. And so I think what we're seeing, though, is in the market, that the value in our portfolio is there. It's just a matter of how do you want to transact and capture it. And we're seeing that value and we're realizing some of it. And we feel like that gives us a lot of confidence that ultimately '21 will turn out to be a year where we can get to the midpoint or even better than that. So, it's just really what you see in the marketplace. And it's not always -- I try to tell this to people, the forward curves are not the end of the all, especially as you get out beyond a year where they are thinly traded and they're not very representative. Have we gone back and marked our book to the forward curves 5 years ago, we would be coming in with EBITDA over that 5-year period at less than $3 billion. But that's not how it ended up. And so you got to be very careful about just choosing the forward curves. I know it's an easy thing. And I know it feels right for people to do it. But that's why we invest a bunch of money to try to analyze and model and understand the fundamentals of our business. And I know people get worried about models and all that. But for us, we have to do that along with the forwards and understand -- to understand really the value of our business. And for '21, we think there's a lot of value that's not reflected in the forward curves and there are multiple ways to realize that value.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll make this quick. So you all talked about, shall we call it growth initiative, a few weeks ago here. So at the time, I think you alluded to having a shortly upcoming Phase 2 update on Texas specifically. Where do you stand on expanding on your initial growth efforts, first? And then secondly, related, more structured, how should we think about your tax appetite going forward relative to the pace of renewable and/or storage investments, right? As I think about it, I would think that you would key the pace investments off of your ability to absorb those tax attributes directly? Or are we mistaken in making that assumption and thinking that perhaps the retail -- the direct retail sales would drive some of those growth ambitions? So a lot of in there, but I'll let you have at it.
Curt Morgan : Yes. So I'll take a shot at that. And David or Jim -- Jim Burke is on here with us, if you guys want to add to it. But in terms of the Phase 2, I'm thinking that, that is probably more a '21 -- later '21 type event where we would talk about that. We still have to -- we still have a significant pipeline of things that we announced in Phase 1. We haven't decided exactly when we would come out with our Phase 2 details, but I would guess it's more of a '21 event. In terms of tax appetite, of course, tax appetite is going to be somewhat driven by the election and where tax rates go. But we -- what we do is we look at the present value of the tax benefit relative to what the cost is of bringing in tax equity. And what we have found so far, Julien, is that we still have a tax -- we still have an appetite. Depending on where prices go, so we look at it both using our point of view, our fundamental modeling, as well as market, and when we become taxable, does affect the NPV of those tax attributes. But in all cases, we have an appetite for tax attributes because we will ultimately become a taxpayer after we run through the NOLs. And of course, you know that we have this unique TRA payment that actually will kick in before federal taxes will. And so we also look at that because that helps us defer the TRA payment as well. And that also affects our appetite for the tax attributes of renewables. So it's going to be a little bit fluid just because we don't know exactly what tax rates are going to end up being. But under -- whether it's today's tax environment or something different, we still continue to have tax attribute -- or excuse me, appetite. And we believe we will continue to have that even into our Phase 2 build-out. Does anybody, David or Jim want to add anything to what I just said?
David Campbell : Well I was going to say, we look at this from an overall return perspective, of course. So tax attributes are a factor in our overall analysis. And ERCOT Phase 1, we -- the products exceeded our return thresholds with utilizing the tax benefits on the schedule that we can utilize it. That's how we model them. And as Curt described, there are higher benefits use internally in a third-party marketplace. So as we look at ERCOT Phase 2 and beyond, we'll do that same assessment of what's the maximum opportunity to extract further tax benefits. And we'll fold that into our overall customer accounts and to make sure that the project exceed our returns. Jim, over to you. 
James Burke: Thank you, David. Sorry about that. Curt, as you described it, most of our Phase 1 spend, it peaks in 2021 and starts to taper off in '22. So we would expect to announce the Phase 2 in 2021. So fill in some of 2022, and then the bulk would be in 2023. You can try to levelize around the $500 million or so in growth capital. So that's how I see it sort of feathering in at this point.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Quick follow-up here, Curt. Given the feedback after the Analyst Day, are you committed going forward to continue to see that level of CapEx even after Phase 2?
Curt Morgan : Yes, we are. We are. I think, Julien, we see what everybody sees in terms of where the world is going. And I don't think that the ESG world is going to change in the next couple of years. And we want to be a part of that transition. And we also believe that we have the projects, the capabilities and understanding the markets to be able to invest and to generate very good returns. Of course, we always will look, at any given time, if something were to change, then we would obviously let you guys know that. And I'm not saying that we can't change. We're not stubborn about it. But we still see opportunity, and we haven't seen anything to change our view on the long-term fundamental view of markets that we have today and then our ability to create value from investment. We think a quarter of our free cash flow makes a lot of sense to reinvest in the business. But as we have said before, if we begin to see a market environment where we don't believe that we can generate the kind of returns that we think we can, then we will return that money to our shareholders. But at this point in time, we feel like we can continue to do that. And I think one of the things that really is underappreciated, in my mind, is that there is going to be a supply response to newbuild. There was a supply response when combined cycle plants came into the market, and there were a number of retirements in coal plants and higher heat rate gas and oil units. And that's going to continue to happen in these markets as you bring on new technologies. And I think that's largely being ignored. And we certainly are a company that has had to make the hard decisions, and I expect we will continue to do that. But I do believe that this country's generation landscape is going to change significantly. And there's absolutely no reason why Vistra cannot be a part of that. I also believe that you have to have a return on that investment in order to get people to do it. You can't just invest in renewables and say, okay, well, it's zero marginal cost. So now we're going to have free power forever. There has to be a mechanism, a pricing mechanism that incentivizes people to invest. And if we're going to spend trillions of dollars in this country to invest, there has to be a price clearing point that allows that to happen. You can't just invest and then go to zero marginal cost. Zero marginal cost doesn't work in the long run to support an industry. And so if you believe in economic theory, like I do, ultimately, pricing is going to settle at a point where people can get a return of and on investment. And that's why we're encouraged by it. And we'll watch that.  There are periods of time in all competitive markets where markets can get oversupplied. And then there's times when they get tight and they're undersupplied. I am certain that is going to happen. But there will also be a supply response when there is an oversupply, and that will bring markets back to equilibrium.
Operator: And your next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Search.
Steve Fleishman : Just first, is there a price or EBITDA that you've disclosed for the new acquisition?
Curt Morgan : We haven't, but we can, Steve. It's $13 million, in that range. And then I think we said that it was about 3.7 times when you look at the multiple. That includes synergies. Synergies come from back office and other functional units largely. We were already a supplier to these guys.
Steve Fleishman: $13 million is the price paid or the EBITDA?
Curt Morgan : No, well, I'm sorry. That's the price paid. EBITDA -- I don't know that we've disclosed that.
Steve Fleishman : No, that's fine. I can figure that out. And just to be clear on -- when you're making the decision-making on growth and your cost of capital, I mean, if the stock stays in this range around where it is, are you using that as your cost of capital? Or are you using something higher than that, when you think about...?
Curt Morgan : You're talking about the yield on the stock? Are you talking about...?
Steve Fleishman : No, just the general cost of capital, the embedded -- yes, the free cash flow yield, whatever, in terms of making the decision to invest in the growth, are you assuming something better? And so then what happens if we're here 9 months from now and you're making the growth decision investment and the stock is still at $18?
Curt Morgan : Yes. Look, that's why I get paid the big buck, that's the tough decision, right? I mean, I don't know where the stock is going to go. I do -- there's obviously the famous CAPM, which would tell you that our cost of capital is much lower than where the free cash flow yield is, right? But we don't invest in anything anywhere close to what a CAPM model would tell you where we should be. And I won't say, though, that every investment -- although there are some that we have done, that every investment has a 20%-plus return either. And I do believe that we believe -- you know this, since you've covered us, we've been at 15% free cash flow yield. It just so happens that we're up in the 20s right now. But we typically would be in excess of that 15%. But it is something that we have to look at. This is why I believe that we are trying to take a balanced approach and actually one that errs on the side of returning more capital and buying back our shares, more so than reinvesting in the business, and it's something that we're going to have to follow. But then you know this because you've asked me this question, a sustainable 20% plus free cash flow yield has far-reaching implications well beyond whether we invest in solar projects or not. It has a lot to do with, can this company get a reasonable free cash flow yield for the kind of company that it is in the public market setting? And the management team and the Board, over the next couple of years, is going to have to wrestle with that. But there is no easy way out either. It's not easy just to go private either. I know how money is made there, too. And that's no panacea. But at the end of the day, we are going to search, as much as we possibly can, to find a way to get the full and fair value of this company. And I think part of that is investing in the changing technology on the generation side. But we absolutely have to do that in a prudent fashion. And your point is a fair one, and one that we have to wrestle with. And I think we try to balance that. But we've been investing in what we believe are compensatory type returns given where we are.
Operator: This brings us to the end of today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, everybody, again. I appreciate your interest in Vistra. Had a great quarter. We hope to close the year out strong. We're tracking in that direction. And thanks again for your time.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Vistra Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Molly Sorg. Thank you. Please go ahead, Molly.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering second quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release.  Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives on the call to address questions in the second part of today's webcast as necessary.  Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides two and three in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra especially during these uncertain times. Cases of COVID-19 have been rising throughout the country, including in many of the states where we operate. Cities are facing social unrest as citizens are fighting for equality and demanding change, while the political climate is polarizing and masked by uncertainty heading into this presidential election season. While it all seems overwhelming, I remain convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I have seen proof of the resiliency of the American people through the lens of our own team members and their dedication and commitment to keeping the lights on in the face of these macro challenges. And instead of the strife in our country dividing us, we have rallied together as a team and as a family, seeking a better understanding of one another and recognizing that the only way we advance as a company and as a country is to listen and take action to ensuring quality for all. We say at Vistra, we want to be a company that works for everyone. Our people are our number one asset, and they have continued to show up day after day to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. The second quarter results we are announcing today are evidence of this dedication. On slide six, we show our strong second quarter and year-to-date results. In the second quarter, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which is 30% above second quarter 2019 results. The quarter-over-quarter favorability was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit in the second half of 2019 as well as strong execution by our retail, generation and commercial teams. Specifically, our retail team grew customer counts in the second quarter in all five of our ERCOT residential retail brands, all while earning all-time highs in our post-interaction customer surveys, reflecting our team's laser focus on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our generation team executed 86 spring maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Our overall performance came in on time and under budget despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, positioning our fleet to be available for the critical summer months. In addition, our teams continue to drive savings and revenue enhancements through the ongoing execution of our operations performance improvement initiative, which we expect will deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, reaching an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year-end. And last, our commercial team once again optimized the value of our generation fleet through hedging and optimization transactions. Vistra's second quarter 2020 financial results benefited from both portfolio positioning executed in anticipation of COVID-19 as well as from higher hedged energy margin realized in ERCOT and PJM. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.779 billion, results that are tracking ahead of expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by more than 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model. As a result of this strong performance through the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, as set forth on slide six. And while it is early in the year to formally reset our guidance ranges with the important summer months ahead, we are currently tracking above the midpoint of our 2020 guidance ranges. As it relates to the potential impacts from COVID-19 that we outlined on our first quarter earnings call in May, year-to-date results would indicate that these initial estimates could prove to be overstated, particularly with respect to bad debt, though we will continue to monitor the situation, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases in Texas and now that the federal unemployment benefits have expired as of July 31. Despite the political wrangling in D.C., we continue to believe there will be a phase four stimulus package that will help bolster the economy, although perhaps the unemployment benefits will not be at the same level. After all, it is an election year and neither side wants to come up short when it comes to helping voters. On retail volumes, in the second quarter, residential usage were just approximately 5%, while business volumes were down anywhere from 5% to 15% during the quarter, with significant improvement in demand seen across all markets by the end of the quarter as states began to reopen.  Importantly, data suggests that ERCOT demand is now virtually flat to expected pre-COVID levels, even with the rising cases in the state, as we depict on slide seven. On this slide, we have updated the demand decline impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late July as compared to those we observed in April of this year. ERCOT, the market where we derive approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is the most resilient, with peak demand already back to expected pre-COVID levels. The balance of the markets where we operate are also showing meaningful recovery with demand within 1% to 5% of expected pre-COVID levels across the board. This strong recovery in demand, particularly in ERCOT, is a positive data point for our 2021 outlook, bringing us to slide eight.  Vistra's fundamental point of view continues to suggest that our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially slightly lower than the 2020 guidance midpoint. Even though forward curves for the summer 2021 peak have recently followed the lows of approximately $80 per megawatt hour, we do not believe this is where the 2021 forward curve will ultimately settle as we have seen this pattern play out in each of the past three years. The supply/demand fundamentals remain tight in ERCOT, and we believe stronger pricing than current forwards is supported by our detailed fundamental analysis. In fact, it has always been our view that estimating Vistra's future EBITDA based on a single point in time on the forward curve marginalizes our opportunistic hedging capabilities and ignores the volatility in the ERCOT forwards and our proven ability to take advantage of this volatility to optimize the value of our fleet. Rather, we have consistently delivered financial results in line with our point of view, reflecting the stability of our integrated operations and strong commercial execution. To illustrate, the graph on the slide demonstrates how, historically, ERCOT forward curves have risen in the late summer or early fall of the immediately preceding year. It is typically during this time when retailers start to hedge their exposure for the upcoming summer and traders move from the prop summer to the forward summer, increasing liquidity. As such, the forward summer begins to reflect normal weather and supply/demand fundamentals, with less emphasis placed on the specifics and sentiments of the prop seller. With 2021 reserve margins likely to remain tight, the risk and scarcity pricing remains. We anticipate this risk to persist in the longer term as well, supported by the annual demand growth in Texas, coupled with the market's increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources during peak hours. All it takes is one week of hot temperatures, in either low wind output or an unplanned outage for scarcity pricing to materialize. While market participants might be currently bearish summer 2021 because we have yet to see any meaningful scarcity events in 2020, recall that we were in the same place at this time last year. In 2019, we observed a couple of weeks of hot July temperatures in Texas, but wind was also strong and unit performance was exceptional. Scarcity pricing did not materialize and 2020 five times16 summer prices fell to the low 90s per megawatt hour by the end of July. But then in August, we observed 72 15-minute intervals of $1,000 per megawatt hour or higher pricing, including 12 intervals that reached the $9,000 per megawatt hour cap, primarily driven by high temperatures and low wind. It was then that the forward for 2020 started to move higher to reflect the underlying fundamentals with 2020 five times16 summer prices rising more than 50% to approximately $150 per megawatt hour by the end of October. Much of Texas summer shows its teeth in August and September, so the greatest opportunity for scarcity pricing remains in the forefront.  With demand back to expected pre-COVID levels, we expect 2021 forward curves to once again rise this fall in anticipation of another tight summer, and we will be there to take advantage of it. As we illustrate on slide nine, ERCOT price spikes in recent years have been caused by moderate to strong loads combined with either unplanned outages or low wind or solar output. In 2018 and 2019, ERCOT saw a total of 31 hours where prices were greater than $1,000 per megawatt hour, with 71% of the hours occurring in August, September or October. The average price for these high-priced hours was $2,921 per megawatt hour, which increased the around-the-clock price by $5.17 per megawatt hour. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals, both this and next summer. And with residential demand coming in more than 5% higher-than-expected pre-COVID levels, we could see meaningful new peak demand records as residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to the increase in air conditioning load. Moreover, we expect year-over-year demand growth in ERCOT to remain strong, necessitating the addition of incremental renewable resources just to keep pace with the higher anticipated load. It is important to remember that the new resources coming online in ERCOT to serve this load are renewable resources, which by definition, are intermittent in nature. The more the grid relies on these renewable resources to satisfy peak demand, the greater the risk of scarcity intervals occurring in the future.  In summary, all of the necessary ingredients to drive scarcity pricing intervals, both this summer and next are present: tight supply/demand fundamentals, year-over-year demand growth, a recurring theme of delayed or canceled new renewable development and an increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources to satisfy peak demand. While the Texas weather patterns haven't yet yielded scarcity pricing intervals in the early part of 2020, historical data tells us that it is a question of when, and not if, these events will occur, especially now that we are seeing wind output return to more normal levels. In fact, in the last two days, we've seen wind output in the hundreds to low thousands already begin to occur. And if you couple that with high temperatures, you're going to see scarcity value. Just like in 2019, we expect our company will be ready to perform and capture value when the opportunities present themselves. We continue to believe our integrated model is well positioned to deliver relatively consistent financial results while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. It is important to stress that we believe in balance and integration between retail and generation. We are not a short retailer and believe owning generation remains fundamental to risk management, especially as intermittent resources continue to comprise a greater percentage of the supply base. We also have the operational, technical and commercial capabilities to capture attractive stand-alone returns in generation with superior integrated returns.  We look forward to talking more about how we plan to allocate our significant capital at our virtual investor event in September. We have spent most of our time this morning talking about the financial strength of our organization. Of course, our investors are interested in our financial results, but as you all know, ESG is garnering greater and greater interest. We believe that is a good thing. So we would be remiss not to spend some time talking about the value we place on all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and communities, including the environment. In fact, one of our four core principles states, "We care about our key stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities, suppliers and investors." We also are committed to maintain aboveboard honest and ethical relationships with elected officials and regulators. Another one of our core principles is we do business the right way. A just company is a sustainable company that we believe attracts and retains talent, customers and investors. In the second quarter, our company brought these core principles to the forefront as we continued our long tradition of corporate stewardship and initiated some new programs. One in particular that has meant more to me as a CEO than perhaps any other initiative which I have ever been a part, in June, in response in particular to the George Floyd death, we initiated sessions with our employees, where members of the leadership team came together in small groups with employees to listen to their thoughts and experiences on race in their lives and within the workplace. Something just went off in my mind that life's playing field in this country for people of color, especially African-Americans and Blacks, was still not level as much as I wanted to believe it was. I wanted to believe so badly that we had evolved. The stories our employees shared about the challenges they continue to face most outside of the office, but some within our own walls, simply because of the color of their skin, were sobering. We have now completed 21 listening sessions in just over a month period for a total of about additional 40-hour work week, and I have attended every single one of them.  The feedback we received during these sessions was invaluable, helping us to identify pockets of issues we must address to unlock the full potential of our employees in our company. As a result, we have new diversity and inclusion initiatives in flight that we are excited to roll out in the weeks and months ahead. Some of the social issues identified are, of course, bigger than Vistra. But we will start with what we can control. We intend to become more vocal on issues that are occurring outside of our company as well. In addition to the listening sessions, which were a new initiative for Vistra in the second quarter, we also continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and contractors through the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring a reliable electricity supply. We have maintained many initiatives we instituted in the first quarter, including our work-from-home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities, thorough cleaning of our facilities between shifts, temperature testing and then entry questionnaires at all of our locations and requiring facial coverings and distancing where possible.  We continue to test employees for antibodies in the virus if they show symptoms or suspect potential infection and support quarantine with pay. In the first half of the year, we shipped our employees and their families more than 5,000 facial coverings to help keep them safe in the public spaces and also sent nearly 30,000 masks to organizations in our local communities, including hospitals. We have similarly continued to support our customers, launching our 22nd annual Beat the Heat program by tripling the funding due to COVID. Beat the Heat is a critical program, including drive-thru distributions of new air conditioning units and fans, education on heat safety, tips for saving on energy costs and financial assistance for TXU Energy customers. In total, we assisted 4,400 customers impacted by COVID-19 pay their electric bills through $1.1 million in donations to TXU Energy Aid, which is in addition to the $2 million we donated to nonprofits and social service agencies for COVID-19 relief. Similarly, in June, with a focus toward social justice and equity, we made a commitment to donate $10 million over the next five years to support the advancement of business and education in diverse communities, including enhancing our minority, women, veteran and LGBTQ+ supplier programs. In the second quarter, we also enhanced our environmental stewardship initiatives by publishing our 2019 Sustainability Report that, for the first time, adopts the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks.  A link to our sustainability report is available on slide 10. We recognize the importance of providing complete and transparent information to the many stakeholders who have interest in our ESG-related activities, and the publication of our 2019 Sustainability Report in June was the first step toward enhancing these disclosures. This fall, we intend to publish a climate report, adopting the task force on climate-related financial disclosures framework. So please keep an eye on the Sustainability section of our website for the latest news and events around our social, economic and environmental initiatives. On the development front, in the second quarter, we announced the expansion of both of our battery energy storage projects in California. Phase two of the Moss Landing project will add an additional 100 megawatts for a total of 400 megawatts, with commercial operations expected to begin prior to August 2021. In addition, we increased the capacity of our Oakland project by more than 80%. As a result, we now have nearly 450 megawatts of battery energy storage developments under contract in California, with another nearly 3,000 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects in our development pipeline, primarily in ERCOT. We believe these projects are only the start of Vistra's expansion into zero carbon-generating assets with our market-leading commercial team, development project management skills, technical prowess, operational and maintenance capabilities and attractive sites. We are a natural owner of these assets. We know how to manage the volatility and risk associated with renewables. And we serve nearly five million retail customers who are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable resources. We are also a large purchaser of renewables through long-term agreements with over 1,000 megawatts contracted. We plan to provide more details regarding our near-term renewable investment pipeline during our virtual investor event on September 29. Before I turn the call over to David, I did want to comment on a federal rule the Environmental Protection Agency finalized last week relating to coal combustion residuals. We have mentioned this pending rule in the past, as we believe it will have far-reaching implications for the power sector. At a very high level, the rule requires certain coal plants that dispose of coal ash and surface impoundments to either make necessary capital investments and operating changes to bring these coal ash disposal sites into compliance with the federal rule or to permanently retire by 2023 or 2028, depending on the size of the surface impoundment. Importantly, decisions on compliance must be made by the end of November this year. Now that the rules have been finalized and will be published in the Federal Register in the next couple of weeks, we are fine-tuning the steps we plan to take in each of our impacted sites. We expect to provide formal details of our plans on a site level basis at our virtual investor event in September. It is important to note that our valuation suggests that there are several coal plants, especially in PJM, that will be under pressure due to this rulemaking. As I close this morning, I want to reiterate that Vistra is committed to lead as we strive to achieve a safe, inclusive and environmentally conscious company and one that is a positive contributor to society. In doing so, we expect we will be able to create a sustainable company that can produce enduring value for all of our stakeholders in both the near and long term, reaching its fair and full value. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.
David Campbell: Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which was $212 million higher than the same period in 2019. Our retail segment increased by $108 million period-over-period and our generation segments were up a collective $104 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit and favorability in our ERCOT and PJM segments, reflecting our operations performance improvement initiatives and commercial optimization contributing to higher energy margin. As a reminder, due to the retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the associated movement of the financial results of those plants into the Asset Closure segment, our 2019 results have been recast, increasing ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA by $9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $10 million in the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, Vistra's ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $1.779 billion or $238 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. The favorability is driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit as well as higher energy margins in our ERCOT and PJM segments. In both the second quarter and the first half of the year, Vistra's financial results are coming in ahead of management expectations. As a result, Vistra is currently tracking toward the upper half of its guidance range. Turning now to slide 13. Vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020 as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. As of July 31, we have paid down nearly $750 million of debt in 2020, including the redemption of the entire $500 million principal amount of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 as well as redemption of the entire $166 million principal amount of our 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2026. Last week, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. We plan to provide details regarding our long-term capital allocation plan at our virtual investor event on September 29. You can expect that our plan for 2021 and beyond will remain aligned with our core tenets of maintaining a strong balance sheet, being opportunistic and disciplined with respect to growth investments, investing in retail and renewable growth opportunities only when our internal return thresholds are met and, in aggregate, returning most of the cash available for allocation to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As part of our virtual investor event in September, we plan to provide details regarding a 2-year share repurchase program as well as a multiyear dividend announcement. A high-level agenda of planned topics for the event can be found on slide 14. We also expect to update our 2020 guidance, introduce preliminary 2021 guidance and describe our plans to further transform our generation portfolio between now and 2030. On the portfolio side, we plan to provide additional details regarding our expected reduction in coal exposure over the next decade as well as details about our current growth pipeline. It should be an exciting event, and we hope you'll be able to join us. In closing, Vistra's strong financial performance through the first half of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, continues to support what we believe is our attractive value proposition, which is our ability to deliver consistent financial results with a high conversion of EBITDA to cash flow as well as capture value through high-return investments and acquisitions. Our low-debt, low-cost integrated model can and does deliver. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
James Kennedy: It's actually James for Shar. Congrats on a great quarter and looking forward to September. I just have two quick questions for you. Building off of some of your COVID data points, are you seeing or expecting any inorganic retail opportunities to arise in Texas or the East due to the virus? Any stress on smaller books?
Curt Morgan: Well, yes, we I mean, we have seen pockets of books and companies that have seen some signs of stress. The summer hasn't shown up here yet in ERCOT, and so that has provided some relief for some of those companies. But we could see that and we're active, as you might guess. And most people are going to come to us before they transact with somebody else. So we're in the flow on that, and we are seeing some of it. And I would expect if we see what we think we're going to see in terms of scarcity value, particularly in ERCOT, we may see some more of those books come available. I will say that when we evaluate those, we're obviously looking for quality books, it can extend beyond a year. And some of these companies have the value of their company is atrophied because they may be door-to-door, more face-to-face-type contact. And what's happening with the virus, those types of channels have been a little more difficult. And so you've got to really dig under and just make sure you're getting something of value. And we're not going to do a deal just to do one. We want to make sure we get value. I don't know, Jim Burke's on the line. And Jim oversees over our retail business. Do you want to add anything to that?
Jim Burke: Curt, I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is that, with some of the COVID impacts having a little bit more focus on the business impacts to demand, some of the lower-margin business-focused books are seeing a little bit more pressure than some of the residential books. But in general, the theme that Curt mentioned that the summer hasn't shown up yet in ERCOT, is probably the prevailing consideration, and we are constantly monitoring the market for these opportunities.
James Kennedy: Got you. And then this one might be more for David, but could you give us an update maybe on the conversations with the rating agencies? Are you still targeting investment grade maybe by the end of next year? Or has that kind of slipped to 2022?
Curt Morgan: Yes, David. You there?
David Campbell: Yes. So the conversations with the agencies continue to go well. The with S&P, they've indicated and right now they've got us some positive outlook for getting the BB+. And they've indicated that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter. That's possible they'll wait for the third quarter results. We expect that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter of this year. And they haven't put a fixed time line out for consideration to investment grade, but that often can take a year or so afterwards. Moody's is on a faster trajectory. They and their when they upgraded us to the equivalent of BB+, indicated that they would consider an upgrade as early as the middle part of 2021. So obviously, we don't control the time line. We expect it's going to be next year, middle or latter part of next year. But the key thing is that I think the agencies have both recognized and affirmed that the strength of our company through the pandemic and through the financial crisis is something related, crisis related to the pandemic is something that they're watching and evaluating and can help to reinforce the resiliency of our business and our business model. And we think this quarter's results and our expectation is that you're willing to reinforce that. So we think we're on a positive trajectory with both the agencies.
James Kennedy: Great, guys. That's it for me. Thanks for everything. Congrats on a great quarter and looking forward to September.
David Campbell: Thanks.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Team. Thank you very much for the time. So if I can ask a couple of questions. Let me just start first with a high-level question. As you think about this larger update in the next couple of months, how do you think about growth investments and where you want to be positioned on that front? And I'm thinking specifically on storage, but also just in terms of generation, you've seen your peers enter more into PPA structures to further align their generation business with retail. How do you see the growth side of the equation initially coming in? And I know this is, to a certain extent, pre-empting some of your updates coming ahead here, but just think more strategically here on growth as part of the capital allocation. Where are you going with that?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. And I tried to allude a little bit in the comments to this, and I will say, obviously, some for September, some of the details, but I think more at a 10,000-foot level strategically, and I made a very specific comment for a good reason. I think we may think a little bit differently than or maybe other competitors do. But we kind of balance between having investment in physical assets, in generation and in new technologies, renewables and batteries and PPAs. Like I said, we've got over 1,000 megawatts of PPAs as well as we've invested in batteries in California, we put up in two which is a battery. And I think you should expect us to do the same. I mean there are times where we have opportunities to sign up a PPA that is good value and we may back-to-back that with a retail deal. And then we also have times where we have because of a location we might have or because of our retail business and also because of our commercial capabilities and our ability to manage projects, those types of things, we have the capability to also invest in solar, predominantly solar and batteries. Of course, we've got a really good location in Moss Landing and then also Oakland in California. You can only imagine, given the size of our company in Texas, we've got a number of really good sites. And when it comes to renewables and batteries, it's kind of like real estate. It's location, location, location. And I think there's an opportunity for us to use our skills and capabilities as well as our locations and to invest in assets as well. And we like that balance. We like a balance of both new technology investments, and then we also like the balance of PPAs. I'm also a little concerned right now about the depth of the PPA market. And so also, you don't want to put your eggs all in one basket because you're going to try to cover a short position with PPAs and the PPAs are not there, then you got to go to something else and lean on the market. And so we like a balanced approach, and that also manifests itself in a balanced capital allocation plan. And that means we're going to put a little bit of money back into our company, and we're going to put a lot of the money back to the shareholder. And that's we're going to get into very into the very detailed specifics of that and our overall portfolio and how we expect to manage it in September. And so we just want to see this summer play out a little bit. And I think we're by the time we get to September, we'll be in a very good place to lay all that out. But we do see ourselves as a balanced and integrated player with a balanced mix of assets and PPAs and that we are going to deploy some capital into projects that we know we have an advantage and have superior returns. And we've also said, if we don't find those, if we don't have those, and we'll be able to get into the details in September, then we're plenty fine with returning capital to shareholders. In fact, we're excited about the fact that we're getting our debt down to the level now where we have to allocate less and less to debt paydown and we can now start to allocate more and more to returning capital to shareholders. Julien, you still there?
Operator: And looks like we might have lost Julien. Julien, are you on mute?
Curt Morgan: Maybe we can get him back on here in a minute.
Operator: Okay. And we'll move on to the next question. And your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein: Is there any reason why you're tracking in the upper half of the guidance range? Is there any reason why the second half of the year might bring that back down to the midpoint of the range at this point? I mean is there are there any specific things you're looking at? Or is it just COVID-19 uncertainty that we should be worried about?
Curt Morgan: Well, look, I think certainly, COVID-19, and we still continue to believe that we may do better on the bad debt expense side. But you just don't know. And like we said in our remarks, I'm a little worried about the additional unemployment and insurance payments coming off at the end of July. We think that's been helpful, people paying their bills. And we want to tread a little bit lightly, you guys know the cases in Texas have exploded. And this is really uncharted waters. So and then that's one of the things that I think could be a place where we might give something back. We haven't played out the whole summer out yet, and we still carry a little bit of length in the summer. And so we'd like to see how that plays out. But I think we were also trying to say in our remarks that we feel pretty good about where we are at this point in time. And so we didn't want to change the ranges. We typically don't do it this early. I think we'll probably talk about that in September. That's even earlier than we normally do. But I think we're going to be in a position to talk about 2020 in the range then in September. I think for us, and you know us well, I think you do, for us to even talk about the fact that we're tracking above the midpoint, I think, tells you that we're feeling good about 2020. But I do want to emphasize, there is still there are still some things out there that we want to keep an eye on for the remainder of the year, but we're feeling good about it. And I don't know, David, if there's anything you want to specifically mention, please jump in.
David Campbell: Curt, I'd just emphasize where you closed, is that we feel good about how we're tracking, even our commentary. I think you can see, Michael, in the script, reflects our view that we're tracking well. So Q3 is always a big quarter for us, so that's why we typically don't update the range at this time of year, but we're feeling good about how we're tracking. The business has performed well. And it's an unusual year. So that, plus the normal dynamics of Q3 being our biggest quarter, are why we haven't changed the range, but still signaling the strength. Go ahead.
Curt Morgan: Sorry about that, David. I will mention this, Michael, that I think people I think they now know this about us, but we kind of have a balanced year that we have. So the retail does pretty good and can do pretty well in the shoulder months where the supply cost, because we have a levelized retail price where the supply costs are lower. And then in the summer, we don't make as much money in retail, although we're doing pretty well, obviously, right now. And then in the winter months, in the fall and the winter, we get that lower supply cost again. And so it's important that volumes stay strong for us in the remainder of the year on the retail side. So October can be a big month for us. November and December can be big months on the retail side. And if you get if you had a situation where in Texas, you had an issue with demand because of COVID, that might be a little bit of a drag. We're not seeing that, though. We haven't seen it through up to now, and we've seen, obviously, a lot of cases. And so we're pretty optimistic that we're not going to see it. But also the relief program in ERCOT is coming off at the end of August. And so all those things are going to factor into what's going to happen with our retail business for the remainder of the year. We're optimistic, but we want to keep an eye on it, and we've provisioned for it, too. And when we're telling you where we think we're going to be, we also take into account that we do think that there could be higher bad debt expense than we normally have.
Michael Weinstein: Right. And one place you mentioned about that renewable investments would only be done if it meets your return criteria. How does that look now? Are renewable investments presenting some attractive return possibilities for you? And I'm not just talking about just in Texas, but maybe in other states, where gas and electric prices might be a little higher.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So there are opportunities out there for people like us that have the locations, the capabilities, have the integrated nature of the business. You can see what I'd call attractive returns. And we're going to get more into that. And we'll actually in September, when we go through this, we'll actually show you how that builds up. Because I know what people have in their mind, they have a PPA, sort of what the returns are for some of the developers that are putting these projects out there. And they're wondering, how are you making something that looks attractive? Somebody's getting that value. That value exists given where market prices are clearing in ERCOT. It's who's getting it. And so the developer wants to get paid the development fee, and they need to get financing to get the project to go. So they need a PPA with an investment-grade firm in order to do that. And then somebody, the investment-grade firm, is getting the value. How they choose to monetize that value is up to them. They can sell the PPA to us and we can back-to-back it with a retail deal. They can take it to the market. Many of these guys don't want to take it to the market because there's risk taking it to the market. And if you don't have the capability to do that, then you don't want that risk. And so you're going to offlay that risk. But the value is in the market. And as we move more and more, Michael, to merchant investment, because not everything in Texas or across this country can be built through a PPA structure, when we get to the point where somebody has to put down real dollars per merchant, then the kind of returns that we're looking for and that we see, they're justified. They need to be there in order to justify the risk. And then you have to have the capability. You have to deal with basis risk and market risk and weather risk and all of those things that go into it. We have that ability to do that. We've got a whole infrastructure that knows how to do that. Not everybody knows how to do that. And so but we are seeing the opportunity, and we're one of the in my view, one of the view players that really have the integrated nature and the capabilities to actually monetize and to extract those kind of returns.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys. Just one quick question on the retail side. I saw the customer count versus March came down maybe about 1%. And your but your slide says you grew counts in ERCOT across all classes. So I'm presuming other regions saw customer accounts come in and maybe that was partly sort of intentional. But could you just give us some perspective on what's going on there?
Curt Morgan: Yes. David, do you want so Jonathan, to be clear, do you want us to talk about what's going on like in the PJM area, ISO New England, just what's going on with customer counts there as well as ERCOT? I just want to make sure that I got the question right.
Jonathan Arnold: If you could touch both, and just to make correct that the counts did come down in PJM or elsewhere.
Curt Morgan: All right.
Jim Burke: This is Jim. I'm happy to take it.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Go ahead, Jim. Yes. Go ahead, Jim.
Jim Burke: Yes. Jonathan, so we had talked on the last call that a couple of our partners, the brands that we acquired, Crius and Ambit, are more dependent on face-to-face selling and the Midwest, Northeast markets have had some of the biggest restrictions on face-to-face selling. So Crius and Ambit, for instance, did well in Texas. Texas reopened in mid-June to allow some face-to-face selling. Many of the other markets, particularly Illinois and Ohio, where we've got sizable presence, have not reopened yet. So the quarter one to quarter two drop is largely a function of the markets not enabling that kind of channel performance. We have moved to other channels. There's more online activity that you would expect. There's definitely more. We're doing through the phones, but not through face-to-face selling. So that's the main driver. And fortunately, the strong ERCOT performance of TXU as well as the other brands in ERCOT more than overcame that in the quarter. And that and we see sort of the full year playing out in a similar fashion.
Jonathan Arnold: Perfect. And then just kind of one question on last quarter, you had talked about your point of view, and you'd also had a specific comment on what you where you thought 2021 would track relative to 2020 based on the March forward curves. I mean they don't seem to have moved very much. So I'm curious if that prior comment still stands or if hedging and other things might have moved the needle there.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So I think we're pretty much where we were. We see we were trying to convey a message that we're kind of flattish to midpoint guidance from 2020, which was, I think it's like three four, three five, we're kind of flattish to lower. We also, I think, if you remember, Jonathan, we said that we had stressed down further than that, and we were within 10% of EBITDA. But that was to give you guys a sense, because we were getting feedback from people that especially we were really in the throes of COVID and it was really new at the time, they wanted to see what a stress case would look like. But I think where we are right now is we're sort of flattish to slightly lower. And that was similar to where we had come out last time. We haven't seen anything yet that would change that view, and we'll probably know more because we'll be through most of the summer and into September. We'll also be able to see where the 2021 curves go as we roll out of the summer and into that fall period that we showed on that graphic where you start to see people turning their attention to the next summer. And that's where you get liquidity, and that's where pricing starts to firm up. Some of that pricing is supported by what happens in the summer, people the prompt summer. People like to look and see, well, was there scarcity or when conditions for scarcity showed up, didn't show up. That kind of thing does affect the market. And so we'll see where the rest of the summer goes. But if we get some high temperatures and low wind, people will be looking to see how the market reacts to that. All that sort of factors into affecting the forward curves. And for us, I think you know this, we would prefer to hedge up most of our long exposure in ERCOT, in particular, as we go into the next year, and then fill in the gaps throughout the initial part of the year and going into the summer. I don't know whether we'll get that opportunity, but we think we will, and that's what we're going to be looking for. And that's when you'll see more of the summer exposure that we have, hedging will occur sort of between now and the balance of the year. And then you'll see us sort of shape it a little bit as we go into next year. But we feel pretty confident we're going to get the opportunity for 2021 summer, which is really our biggest exposure for length. We'll get plenty of opportunities to be able to hedge going into that. And we still feel really good, when we look at our detailed supply/demand fundamental and modeling, we still feel good that we have a pretty tight market. And it's a market that's relying more and more on intermittent resources. In fact, you no longer have a situation in ERCOT where you can supply all the peak load with dispatchable resources like coal and gas and nuclear. So you have to rely on a certain level of renewable resources in order to be a reliable market and to actually meet the demand in the market. And with the volatility and intermittent nature of those resources, the inherent nature of that, you're going to get a few days in a market like ERCOT where you have extremely high temperatures in July and August and September time frame. There are going to be some days where it's going to be tight, and that's where the scarcity comes into play. And with the ORDC standard deviation moving up this year, we ought to see some pretty good pricing. It will be a function of weather, of course, and wind and unit performance. But we're pretty we go into this we're pretty confident that we'll see opportunities.
Jonathan Arnold: Great. And just one final thing. Your most obvious listed peer reorganized their segments this year to be to show more kind of an integrated look of the businesses. Is that something you would potentially consider? Or do you expect you'll continue reporting the way you are?
Curt Morgan: That's a good question. I don't think we're going to do what they did. But I think in September, you'll see that we have a slightly different way that we are going to take a look at our business, that we hope will actually increase transparency and provide more information to you guys. And that will be the goal of what we do. And we'll give you a better sense of the business from a longevity standpoint and our strategic focus. So we do have an idea that we've been working on for some time now, and we would like to roll that out commensurate with the remainder of our longer-term capital allocation plan.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand the call back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. And as I stated at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. I hope everybody stays healthy and safe through these trying times. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Vistra Energy First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering first quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives available to address questions in the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to our investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially during these extraordinary times. First and foremost, the Vistra family sends our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to those adversely impacted by the COVID-19 virus. We know the Northeast U.S. has been hardest hit and many of you on the call may have been affected. As tough as it is, there is hope, as I am convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I never thought I'd be hosting an earnings call from my home with our management team dispersed across the North Texas metroplex. And yet, that is where we find ourselves today. These are challenging times as we face the highly disruptive COVID-19 disease, which has already created unprecedented harm to society, threatening the health of not only the population, but of our economy and businesses as well. Now more than ever, I am proud to lead a company that is providing such an essential service to society, the electricity that powers our lives. Roughly 3,000 power plant team members at Vistra have no choice but to go to work every day to fulfill our obligation to society, and they have done it with pride and without question. We would not be able to work from home, power medical equipment and devices, and keep critical infrastructure running without electricity. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the U.S., Vistra has been focused on keeping our people healthy and safe while maintaining our essential business operations. Vistra took actions early on to prepare the company for a COVID-19 environment, putting us in a position of relative strength as we sit here today. In fact, we sowed the seeds of financial strength long before COVID-19 ever arrived. And we've been levered like the IPPs of the past, back in October 2016 when we emerged from bankruptcy, we may be having a very different discussion today. A strong balance sheet is as important as ever, and we intend to continue on our path to 2020 to our leverage target. We have logged well over 100 new activities that we are performing on a daily and weekly basis because of COVID-19, and we have provided a high level list of some of these actions on Slide 6, through steps such as: being one of the first U.S. generators to implement temperature testing and entry questionnaires at our locations, and contact tracing; instituting a work from home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities and nonspecific work location requirements; requiring face coverings and social distancing; thoroughly cleaning facilities between shifts and emphasizing hygiene; and executing commercial transactions to better position Vistra for the anticipated market moves, we have been able to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. It is very important to note that these health and safety procedures must be implemented in a holistic manner. We are continuing to evolve our health and safety guidelines with an eye toward widespread testing. About three weeks ago, we also launched our planning ahead team to evaluate coming back to work for the nonspecific work location team members. This team has already started developing the necessary plans. In the end, the productivity of our team members working from home has been so strong that we can afford to be very deliberate about our returning to work. And frankly, we will not return until we feel that it is safe to do so. On the generation side, in addition to going to work locations to continue to perform their normal functions, our team members also completed or are on schedule to complete 86 maintenance outages this spring in the midst of the pandemic to ensure plant reliability for the critical summer months ahead. We analyzed the necessity and scope of each outage, rescheduling and scaling back if possible for the sake of our people without sacrificing reliability. On the retail side, our call center operations maintained service levels at greater than 90% for the first quarter and greater than 92% for the month of April, while managing the transition for most to working from home. And perhaps most important, I am proud that as of today, these procedures have contributed to eliminating our COVID-19 positive test to only two in a population of approximately 5,500 employees and over 3,000 contractors on our sites in 20 states and the district of Columbia, with both of these cases contracted outside of work. Fortunately, both of these affected individuals have fully recovered. I am also proud that we have been able to help our customers and communities during this difficult time by implementing programs to waive late fees, extend payment days and provide payment plans for those impacted by the COVID-19. We are also offering additional payment assistance to those in need through our TXU Energy Aid program, and we donated $2 million for COVID-19 relief efforts to nonprofits and social service agencies in the communities we serve. This is not just good business, is the right thing to do and reflects one of our guiding principles. I know the potential financial ramifications of COVID-19 on businesses is front of mind for investors today, which is why we have dedicated most of our prepared remarks to this topic. We believe Vistra is well positioned to deliver strong financial results in 2020, even in the face of lower demand driven by COVID-19. In fact, we are reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance today. Our confidence in our ability to continue to meet expectations in 2020 despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19 is a result of a few critical points, all set forth on Slide 7. First, our generation business is now approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure for the balance of 2020, limiting the impact of near-term price volatility on our 2020 financial results. Second, our retail business derives approximately 90% of its adjusted EBITDA from the residential and mass business customer classes, and we expect residential load will increase in 2020, mitigating the expected negative impact of lower business volumes.  Last, approximately 70% of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market, which is proving to be relatively resilient as compared to the other markets where we operate. Historically, Texas has outperformed other U.S. markets during and coming out of economic downturns, and we expect it to be no different this time around. Our strong balance sheet and favorable position heading into the COVID-19-driven economic downturn gives us confidence in our working capital and liquidity position. And through the operations preparedness actions we have implemented, our fleet is ready to deliver safe and reliable power in the months ahead. While COVID-19 is making it virtually impossible for businesses in various sectors such as retail, real estate, airlines and hospitality, to estimate the potential negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations, fortunately, Vistra offers and essential product, electricity, which is critical to a well-functioning society. Our strong balance sheet and highly efficient generation fleet have supported our ability to opportunistically hedge minimizing the impacts of near-term price volatility. And our lean integrated operations have created a foundation for us to produce relatively stable financial results in a wide range of wholesale power price environments. Unfortunately, you wouldn't be able to come to this conclusion just by looking at our stock price over the past several months. It remains perplexing to me why our stock would trade at such a high free cash flow yield with our 2020 guidance intact and a relatively robust long-term outlook. As always, we will continue to focus our efforts on execution. Hopefully, with time, the financial markets will begin to appreciate the relative stability this low debt integrated model can deliver, which when combined with our nearly 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, we believe makes for a very attractive investment. While our stock price is disappointing, I am optimistic that as we approach our leverage target this year, announce our long-term capital allocation plan, still scheduled for September of this year and continue to execute and deliver in a variety of markets that we will unlock the value of this company. Turning now to Slide 8. Given the focus by the financial community on the impact of COVID-19 on electricity demand, we have summarized in a chart on this slide, the impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late April. Similar to what we observed during the 2008 to 2009 recession and consistent with my earlier comments, ERCOT is proving to be relatively resilient. This is an important point for Vistra, given that, as I mentioned previously, approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market. Moreover, while on their face, these demand declines could appear to be significant, we expect Vistra's hedges and substantial residential retail portfolio will mitigate what would have otherwise been a more dramatic negative financial implications from the COVID-19-led economic downturn. Turning to Slide 9. Let's start with our generation segment. Early in the first quarter, Vistra's exceptional commercial team read the tea leaves early on and executed a few opportunistic commercial transactions in anticipation of some of the market volatility we are now seeing materialize. These transactions resulted in a positive benefit to Vistra in the first quarter. In addition, our commercial and generation teams were able to dispatch our Permian Basin CTs in the first quarter to capture high prices in the West zone, resulting from low gas prices and local congestion. These actions put Vistra ahead of our financial plan for the quarter, contributing to a positive variance to our original 2020 guidance range for our commercial segments, which we depict in more detail on our guidance walk forward on Slide 11. For the balance of the year, Vistra is approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure, limiting the impact of changes in price levels to our 2020 financial results. Vistra's primary exposure to commodity price movements for the balance of the year is to the ERCOT summer, where we typically retain some generation length in order to protect from the downside risk of being caught short on a volatile summer day. As has always been the case, we continue to expect we will be able to manage this commodity price risk within our guidance range, particularly as we value this open position at well below market forward prices for planning and guidance purposes. And while we do expect lower peak demand in 2020 as compared to ERCOT's latest estimate published in its biannual supply demand forecast, called the Capacity, Demand and Reserve or CDR report in December 2019, we have already accounted for this anticipated lower demand and its expected impact on summer power prices in today's guidance reaffirmation. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable, driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals this summer.  As we saw during the summer of 2019, low wind or high temperatures have the potential to drive scarcity pricing, and this impact could be even more pronounced in 2020 now that the Operating Reserve Demand Curve or ORDC has shifted by another quarter of a standard deviation. As you may recall, the ORDC is an administrative construct designed to provide additional revenues to the market as real-time operating reserves diminished to scarcity levels. Importantly, while we are observing decreased demand across all markets, residential demand is coming in slightly higher than weather-normalized expectations. And residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to increased air conditioning load, especially as more people are working from home. In short, even if lower business demand brings down the ERCOT peak in 2020, higher residential load on a hot summer day in Texas could still result in scarcity pricing intervals.  And we estimate that it could take only two degrees of the increased summer temperatures to offset the lower demand impact from COVID-19. As usual, ERCOT summer will continue to be a critical driver of Vistra's financial results for the year. However, we believe our guidance is conservative as we have already embedded risk from lower demand or mild weather in our financial guidance. Let's turn our attention now to our retail segment. I'm on Slide 10. We do expect that lower demand across our markets will have certain negative impacts on our retail segment's results for the year. Specifically, we are anticipating higher bad debt expense in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 driven financial distress among some of our customers. This risk of higher bad debt expense resides primarily in our ERCOT portfolio as in markets outside of Texas, the local utility generally controls the bill and assumes the customer selection risk. In ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas recognized that the retail electricity providers could be unduly harmed by continuing to supply power to customers who cannot pay their electric bills due to unemployment or lower income and enacted a COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program in response. This program includes, among other things, a mechanism for retail electric providers to recover $0.04 a kilowatt hour for nonpayment by a qualifying set of customers in exchange for not disconnecting these customers. While the program applies only to a limited set of customers that must go through a number of steps to qualify, we expect it will provide meaningful mitigation to what would otherwise have been even higher bad debt expense in 2020. Next, we similarly expect our retail segment will be negatively impacted by lower volumes, including lower recovery of fixed capacity costs on our Midwest and Northeast large business portfolio, and lower margins driven by reduced consumption across our business customer classes. We expect these negative variances to be partially offset by higher residential volumes among our existing customers. We are more focused than ever on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our customers depend on us to keep their lights on and to power their daily lives. Recognizing that some of our customers will find themselves in financial distress as a result of the COVID-19, we have already instituted programs to waive late fees, extend payment dates and provide payment planned alternatives. We are continuing to offer bill payment assistance through our partner, TXU Energy Aid, which uses donations from customers, employees and other Texans to help around 20,000 families keep their lights on each year. Our commitment to our customers is as high of a priority as ensuring the safety of our people. As we turn now to Slide 11, you can see all of the variables we just discussed accounted for in our 2020 guidance walk forward table. While we are reaffirming our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance ranges today, there are some puts and takes that get us there, primarily, our above plan performance in the first quarter of 2020, offset by anticipated COVID-19 impacts. Specifically, we expect our generation segment to be up approximately $60 million with some potential for upside as compared to our initial guidance forecast as a result of the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities we executed in the first quarter, which I just discussed, as well as lower fuel expense, partially offset by the potential for lower power prices driven by covenant. We expect this positive variance in our generation segment to be potentially offset by a $60 million negative variance in our retail segment as compared to our initial guidance forecast. This forecasted retail variance is comprised of an expected $10 million benefit from lower costs and an accelerated capture of synergies from our Ambit and Crius acquisitions, offset by $70 million of expected headwinds related to COVID-19. These COVID-19 headwinds reflect an estimated $40 million increase in our bad debt expense for 2020, as well as an estimated $30 million driven by lower volumes in our business segments, partially offset by expected higher volumes from our residential retail customers. In total, we had a strong first quarter, and we are tracking strong for the full year with the expectation that our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA will be well within the range of the $3.285 billion to $3.585 billion, which is yet another example of the resiliency of the integrated model. We are also reaffirming our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of $2.16 billion to $2.46 billion. Now that we have covered 2020, let's turn the discussion toward the potential impacts COVID-19 could have on future market environments. Despite what is, on its face, a dampening market effect of lower demand from COVID-19 that we expect to continue into 2021, albeit at a lower level, the economic slowdown could have some ancillary impacts that are constructive to market dynamics. Starting with ERCOT, which is a market with relatively tight supply-demand fundamentals, we are already seeing evidence that renewable development is slowing for projects that were slated to come online in 2021 and beyond. ERCOT, as an energy-only market, was already difficult for market developers to secure merchant project financing. The uncertainty that has been created by the COVID-19-led economic recession is exacerbating this challenge.  We have received calls from a number of developers seeking to sell the development rights to their projects for very nominal fees given a lack of confidence these projects will be able to advance in today's environment. We are also observing that the appetite to execute power purchase agreements has decreased among investment-grade off-takers. As these entities begin to meet their goals or refine their programs so that their projects are located near their actual load as opposed to serving as virtual offsets. As a result, we estimate the 2021 supply estimates in ERCOT's December 2019 CDR report are almost 2.5x what we believe will be feasible to develop in this environment. If we do, in fact, see renewable development slow, this will be a meaningful offset to any decreases in peak demand that could flow through to 2021. As a result, ERCOT reserve margins could be very tight when demand growth returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. Similarly, the decreased oil drilling activity we are observing is reducing the supply of associated gas, making us somewhat bullish on natural gas prices in 2021 and beyond. Higher natural gas prices could further push up the price of power in the markets where we operate. With these factors as a backdrop, combined with the relative resiliency we're observing in Texas demand, we continue to like our position in the ERCOT market. Moving on to PJM and ISO New England markets, we similarly expect COVID-19 to have an impact on the supply side of the equation, both as it relates to the likelihood of new thermal development as well as the potential for incremental retirements. On the new development side, in our view, market economics did not support new thermal development prior to the COVID-19-related demand declines, and the current forward outlook is even less supportive of new build. As a result, we would not expect any new thermal development in either PJM or ISO New England in this environment. Further, we could see incremental retirements of higher heat rate or higher cost assets as the energy markets are challenged by lower demand expectations. The recent capacity auction clear in ISO New England and the uncertainty related to the upcoming capacity auction in PJM are not helpful for development and also present challenges for inefficient existing generation. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect we could see a range of outcomes in our 2021 financial results with the midpoint shifting somewhat lower. As we describe on Slide 13, many uncertainties remain, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19-led economic downturn, which makes predicting a likely outcome for 2021 even more challenging. Prior to COVID-19, our fundamental point of view suggested 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially higher than 2020 expected results. As of April 30, we are now 57% hedged in ERCOT and approximately 60% to 70% hedged in all other markets, which helps to limit the range of outcomes we expect to see next year. In order to balance risk with potential upside, we are continuing to opportunistically hedge, albeit at lower than previously expected power prices. Even with this incremental hedging activity, however, given the distribution of potential outcomes, we still expect there is a meaningful chance that 2021 guidance could be flat to 2020 guidance midpoint. Just looking at forward curves as of March 31, 2020, which already reflected a level of uncertainty around COVID-19 impact, which suggests 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $200 million to $250 million lower than our 2020 guidance midpoint or about a 6% to 7% reduction. As we have seen, however, ERCOT forward curves have shifted upward in the back half of each of the past three years as the curve begins to reflect fundamentals and becomes more liquid. We believe there is still a possibility we could once again see this play out for the 2021 forward curve this fall. So the probability is likely lower due to the COVID-19 related uncertainty. In addition to looking at current forward curves, we also modeled fundamental supply and demand drivers in a number of economic downturn scenarios in order to better inform our views on the potential range of outcomes for 2021 financial results. Over the past two months, ERCOT's peak load has trended in the range of 2% below expectations. As the Texas economy begins to reopen, we may see this gap start to narrow. However, given the risk of slower economic recovery, our review of downturn scenarios included two consecutive years of peak demand trends below ERCOT's most recent forecast in its CDR report.  On the supply side, the current environment has clearly impacted the prospects for new generation investments. Nevertheless, in an effort to be conservative when testing the potential risk to our 2021 results or downturn scenarios, assume that the majority of the projected supply additions from the CDR will come online despite the historical trend of the CDR significantly overstating new supply additions as its purpose is not as a forecast tool, but as a representation of new generation in the development pipeline that have met certain criteria. As a result of our analysis of these fundamental drivers, we currently estimate that even in our most punitive downside case that holds supply constant to pre-COVID-19 levels and demand growth to 1/4 of the pre-COVID estimates from 2019 to 2021, 2021 results would still be within 10% of our 2020 guidance midpoint. And with so many different variables influencing the range of potential outcomes, we still think there is a meaningful possibility we can achieve flat EBITDA from 2020 to 2021. Importantly, this means that even in our most punitive modeled case, we still expect we will be able to deliver approximately $3.1 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations in 2021. With an expected 65% to 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, this would translate to more than $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, meaning that even in a recession created by an extremely low probability pandemic tail event, we expect to maintain very strong liquidity. And we expect we will have significant free cash flow to return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I suspect not many businesses today can say this. The market appears to be discounting our relative resilience. Even more than before, we believe the recent decline in our stock is unwarranted. In our view, Vistra should have been a stock investors fled to for relative safety in these economically uncertain times, and yet our stock has continued to trade with a free cash flow yield in the range of 20% to 30%. It is frustrating to say the least. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We supply an essential product and our low-cost, low-debt integrated business model comprised of leading retail businesses and advantage-generating assets is designed to manage risk and mitigate volatility. Our robust free cash flow should enable us to both reinvest in the business at modest levels while returning a significant amount of capital to investors. However, we are keeping the faith that as we pay down our debt and announce our capital allocation plans in 2020, we will be on the path to reach our fair and full value. As always, we will keep our eye on the ball of execution and continue to prove out this thesis. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.
David Campbell: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 15. Vistra delivered first-quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $850 million, results that exceeded management expectations for the quarter. The favorability was driven by our ERCOT segment, reflecting the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities that Curt mentioned previously. Our first-quarter 2020 results were $26 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our retail segment up $54 million and our generation segments down a collective $28 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, partially offset by lower results in our MISO and New York, New England generation segments, driven primarily by lower capacity revenue. As a reminder, due to retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter, our first-quarter 2019 results have been recast, increasing by $9 million to account for the movement of the financial results of those plants out of the MISO segment and into the asset closure segment. Next, on the topic of liquidity. Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $1.834 billion as of March 31, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $717 million and $1.117 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In April, we repaid $550 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, on May 1, we notified the holders of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 that we will redeem the entire $500 million principal amount outstanding on June 1. Our teams have modeled various scenarios to stress test our liquidity, and given the company's strong cash generation profile, we are confident we will have ample liquidity to operate our business even in a recessionary environment. Before we conclude today's call, I would like to offer a brief reminder of our capital allocation plan for 2020 and 2021, a summary of which is set forth on Slide 16. As we have consistently emphasized, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. In fact, it is in economic environments like the one we're in right now where the value of having a strong balance sheet is even more pronounced. Despite the low levels where our stock has been trading in recent months, our investors and stakeholders remain supportive of our commitment to advance toward our long-term leverage target of approximately 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. Last week, we announced that our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. As we look ahead, even with the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we still expect to have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond. We plan to lay out our long-term capital allocation plan in late September this year, the basic tenets of which we have been articulating for several quarters now. Specifically, we expect we will allocate approximately 25% of our capital available for allocation to growth investments on an annual basis, but only if our investment thresholds are met.  If we do not find projects that we believe are an attractive use of capital, we plan to return that capital to shareholders. We expect that the remaining 75% available capital will be returned to stakeholders through a quarterly dividend with an attractive dividend yield combined with share repurchases. Please stay tuned for more specific details on our long-term capital allocation plan in September of this year. In closing, we are proud of our team members for their unwavering commitment to producing and delivering power to our customers in these challenging times. Our business remains resilient, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver stable results on an annual basis, even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges. Our hope is that the successful execution of our business plan in this environment will further instill confidence in Vistra by our many stakeholders, ultimately unlocking what we believe is the true value of our company. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: Glad you're safe. Can we just -- a couple of questions here. Can we talk about sort of the landscape of potential retail growth opportunities as we look at the second half of the year into '21? Does the PUCT's rate relief program and kind of your lower estimates around peak demand maybe take some of the pressure off the smaller ERCOT books to sell and potentially shift your focus back to buybacks, i.e., that 25% of capital that's allocated to growth, like David just mentioned? Could that present further opportunities as it shifted towards buybacks with sort of credit metrics on pace to hit IG by '21? So how do we sort of think about that growth portion and given some reprieve that's been given to the retail providers?
Curt Morgan: So it does help. I mean, if they did not put the program in place, I think our view is, Shahriar, that it would have been carnage. No doubt about it. But to be clear about it, what's happening is there's -- what is being recovered by retailers is the energy component or the generation component and the T&D component, the margin that retailers typically get is not embedded in that. So while it's helpful for some of them, some of the retailers that are smaller, not as well capitalized, maybe not as sophisticated from a risk management standpoint, there's still risk and there continues to be, in our view, significant risk going into the summer months. And given the situation, it may be harder also for them to hedge and post collateral. So I do believe that there is still some risk to retailers in this market, and we've seen a little bit of that. Whether that turns into some kind of an opportunity, we'll see. But there is certainly some movement of foot by some retailers given that this isn't exactly everything that a retailer would have wanted in this situation. The other part of this is, is that the margin that is being forgone, you can collect on afterwards. But this is a customer class that is very difficult and will be difficult to collect on. So the ability for the retailer to actually try to claw back, if you will, that lost margin is going to be extremely difficult. So we'll see whether something comes out of this or not, that's certainly something that we are keeping an eye out for. But it's hard to predict at this point in time. I think we're still comfortable, Shahriar, really, with the roughly a quarter of our free cash flow on an annual basis, although it's going to be a bit lumpy, just depends on opportunities and depends more importantly on the economics of any deal that we might want to get into or a project we might want to do. But we still think that quarter of our free cash flow a year, it seems reasonable. I think in September, we're going to put a little more meat on that bone, both the growth side of it, but also, I think, put more detail around what the 3/4 is, which I think is the most important part of our capital allocation plan. And I think September will be a big time period for that.  And then the other thing, I think in September, is that we got some things that we want to talk about in terms of our overall portfolio positioning as a company, our asset mix and how we're going about sort of the future. But I think all of that's going to happen. We're only now -- it seems like years away, but we're only five months away now from that happening. This is the point in time that I've been waiting for since I've been here, to get to the point where we can actually be at a steady state.
Shahriar Pourreza: And so just a follow-up. So I have to imagine that the sustainability of the model that you're displaying today should provide some level of comfort with the agencies, right? Is there any updates with your conversations regarding a ratings upgrade to IG? Also any potential for the time line to slip due to COVID? Are you still kind of shooting for that Q4 '21 for IG? So how is sort of the dialogue going with the rating agencies? Because I have to imagine this quarter should provide a little bit of a reprieve on whatever concerns they have from a business risk standpoint.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Well, what I understand is that -- and I think S&P made some comments to this effect. But I think it slipped a little bit, Shahriar, because what I heard is that S&P is probably going to wait to see how the year turns out to move us another notch. And then I expect them to it -- to be at least a year and probably a little bit more. So I think we've slipped a little bit on the IG. But my own view is exactly yours, which is, I think when the dust settles, I actually don't think this is going to end up being a negative period of time, but actually a highly positive period of time. And the agencies are going to look at this and say, in what is I don't think anybody can argue that this is not a tail event. This is a truly a tail event, probably as bad or as close to as bad as the great depression in terms of what it's doing to unemployment. And they're going to have to step back and look at that. It's not like just a normal run-of-the-mill recession here. And just the resilience of our business model what I believe, and I think this is incredibly important for our company, is that the business risk that has been ascribed to this sector for so long because of the poor execution, the bad strategies, I think when they look at this model and the execution that we put forward, that it's actually going to end up being a positive in the long run. So I still have some hope that by the end of year '21, we could get to investment grade. But I actually believe based on comments that I have heard, we may have slipped a little bit.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the results. I will jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.
Curt Morgan : All right. Thanks, Shar.
Operator: Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, I hope you all are well.
Curt Morgan : You, too, Stephen. Hi.
Stephen Byrd : Congrats on the good results in a challenging time. You gave some really good color on the state of the renewables market. And I just wondered, does that make you want to potentially be more aggressive in terms of growth just because of the opportunities? I just want to make sure I kind of understood how you're thinking about the implications of what's happening there.
Curt Morgan : Well, I think there was a number of implications that we were trying to get across. I think one of them was that we just think the growth in renewables, in particular in ERCOT, may have slowed down a bit. But I will tell you that when we stressed to get to that within 10% in 2021, we really didn't cut back the amount of renewables that we had previously thought we're going to come in back when we gave guidance, back in November time frame. So in my view, it's a bit punitive, but we wanted to stress the system a little bit. So I think that's one point. In terms of the point that you're making, I think we have some ideas about what we would like to do around renewables. And I don't know that this has really changed it much. We still have a strong cash flow that if we want to do some projects, we're going to follow through. I think you saw that we increased the battery opportunity out at our Oakland site. I think there may be some other opportunities at our Moss Landing site. And then, certainly some potential opportunities in ERCOT. And so I don't know, really, Stephen, I don't think it's changed our view. I think the difference is, is that we have the ability to do the things we want to do, whereas some people, I think, it's going to be more difficult just because it's difficult to attract the capital to support their plans. The developers are having more difficulty. And we know that because they're approaching us, for us to take over their projects and then pay them a small nominal fee to take them over. So I think there is an opportunity there and that we're working on that opportunity, whereas maybe there's some good projects that may come to market at a relatively cheap price, and we'll take a look at that and add that to our backlog. We don't talk much about just the amount of projects we have around renewables, in particular in Texas, but we also have them in other states. Of course, we have the coal to solar, thing going on in Illinois. But this company has a fairly deep backlog of opportunities to invest in renewables. But we're going to be deliberate about it, and we're looking for those kind of opportunities that offer the kind of returns that we expect, that sort of 500 to 600 basis points above cost of equity. And we have some of those, and we'll talk more about that in September.
Stephen Byrd: That's helpful. It sounds like it's a pretty rich opportunity set so we'll stay tuned on that. And just on the demand outlook, you gave a lot of good color in a number of ways. I wonder just on residential demand, and I apologize if you did lay it out. Could you quantify just sort of the percentage increase in residential demand you've seen or that you expect, especially down in Texas this year? What's your general kind of view on how meaningful that may be?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Since I'm not in the same room with everybody, I'll ask David if he has that. But between David Campbell and Jim Burke, we probably have two folks that can put a little more detail to that. So David, do you want to start? And then, Jim, if you have anything to say, please jump in.
David Campbell: Sure. So this is David. Thanks, Stephen. With respect to residential, what we've seen is impacts actually in the second quarter. So for the past month or so, it's been in the 5% to 6% range. We've modeled it relatively conservatively, around 2% for the back 9 months of the year, but we've actually seen increases, reflecting people working from home in the 5% to 6% range. And that's what we're expecting in the second quarter and moderating in the back half of the year. We've kept pretty conservative assumptions around load declines in other segments, but we -- to be conservative, we had that moderating. So the overall increase for the back 9 months is about 2%.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And I guess just as a follow-up on that. I mean, that's -- that sounds -- that makes sense. That sounds reasonably conservative. So if demand is actually -- if demand for residential is stronger, presumably, that's relatively meaningful given your business mix?
David Campbell: That's exactly right, Stephen. It's our -- especially in ERCOT, where residential demand is weather sensitive and it's our highest margin segment. We think that there's potential upside there, particularly it's folks -- scenarios where as businesses reopen, you still have a large segment of the workforce working from home. So you'll see some uptick or moderation of the demand declines on the business side, while at the same time seeing the uptick in the residential side being sustained. So I do think that it provides -- it's a meaningful impact for us given the profitability of our ERCOT residential segment.
Curt Morgan: And Stephen, one other thing I'll mention at this point, I think we've tried to be pretty conservative. We're only at the beginning of May here. And we typically aren't going to change guidance this early in the year, especially given just how important the ERCOT summer is and how volatile it can be. But there were words in my script and there were words in David's and then also on these slides about tracking strong and that we're well within the range. And what that really means is, I think we've been conservative on our estimates for 2020, and we feel very good, very good about the midpoint and we think there's some potential for upside. But we want to be cautious about that. I think what will be a better indicator is when we get into the second and certainly, the third quarter earnings calls, when we have a better insight as to what the summer and ERCOT is going to look like. But from where we stand today, even with COVID-19, 2020, it looks to be a pretty strong year if we can execute the way we believe we can.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research LLC.
Steven Fleishman: So just one question in thinking about capital allocation. So if the rating agencies are going to take longer to determine investment grade, I just wanted to kind of get a sense when you make your next decision on capital allocation, are you going to focus mainly on just hitting your debt-to-EBITDA metrics? Or are you going to be trying to kind of do things to keep getting to just the investment grade, i.e., what -- is it the metrics or the investment grade that are the priority in making that decision?
Curt Morgan: Yes, that's a very good question, Steve. Look, I think the simple way to think about this, and of course I've got a -- we've got a whole session coming up in July with our Board, so I really don't like to get out in front of them but I'll explain it this way. We've dedicated 2020 to pay down debt, and we're going to do that. And that's a bit of a sacrifice to also returning some money to our shareholders, which we would like to do, especially in this environment, but we also had to balance those priorities. And I think what you can expect from us in September is a capital allocation plan that is focused on returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting in our business. And given that it appears that things may be pushed out a little bit and the fact that we've never started this venture to get to investment grade, that was an outcome that kind of came up, that we're not going to chase things around.  We are going to get to where we think the capital structure of this company leaves us in a position to be as strong as possible. And we just so happen believe -- to believe that with our business risk, which we are demonstrating is quite solid through all this and just the metrics themselves, they speak for themselves. And we still have to make a jump to BB+ with S&P, and so we want to get to that next. And then we'll get into dialogue with them about what it's going to take to get to investment grade. But I think the focus for us in September is going to be squarely around the two big buckets that I just talked about, reinvestment in the company and some opportunities that we have -- that we think are quite good. But more importantly, the big 3 quarters of our free cash flow talking to our investors about returning that in some form or fashion. And it's not rocket science, it will be a mix of what do we do with our dividend and what do we do with potential -- probably potential share repurchases. So that's -- and we'll see where we're trading, obviously, and all that will go into it. But I suspect that will be the two big buckets. And I think there's also some other details we're going to get into on that call as well that I think are important for people, about what's the long-term focus of our company and how we think about managing our portfolio of assets for the future. So a lot going to be packed into that. I think we want to get through the summer, see how things go and then we're ready to go in September. But that's how we're thinking about it.
Steven Fleishman: That's great. That makes sense. And I don't think you want to be chasing the rating agencies all the time. Okay. And then, just on the unfortunately, I have to ask since the CDR has become a bit of an event in recent times. I think it's coming out maybe next week for the summer. Just any sense on what we should expect for that? And do you think we'll actually see this reduction in some of the renewables or delays, or is it likely not to show up in that? Just any color on the CDR.
Curt Morgan : Boy, I'd tell you, I have a hard time predicting what is going to come out of that CDR because it's not all that difficult for people to get projects to the point where it shows up in the CDR. And as you know, there's no economic overlay. And I think even ERCOT has tried to distance themselves from this being something to use for forecasting purposes. So it's hard to say. I do think there may be some pullback, Steve, but I also believe what's likely going to happen is it may be deferral more than it is anything actually leaving. And so you may see more kind of like it did last year when everything got pushed from '20 into '21, and there was a big bucket of projects that showed up there. And then, I think that you may see some get deferred even again. But I wouldn't be surprised, honestly, that people were still working -- developers are working on projects and getting them in the queue, interconnection queue and that more may show up. For me, it's less about that. We have a development team on the ground, we know this market very well. And it's more about what we're seeing in terms of real activity on the ground and getting equipment, signing contracts, getting financing. And that's where we're seeing things really pull back. And I think the other area where we've seen pretty big pullback is just the support on the PPA side. And that we have yet to see -- for example, on solar, we have yet to see a merchant solar plant get financing in the ERCOT market. It's just really difficult with an all-energy market to do that. And so without a PPA behind these, it just makes it more and more difficult. And we've seen that PPA market slowed down quite a bit. So even though the CDR could be a wildcard in all this, and I know that we're going to have to deal with whatever comes out of that, for us, it's more about what's really going on, on the ground. And for me, that's why our team is constantly not just looking to develop things, but also to try to get intelligence about what else is going on.
Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thanks so much.
Curt Morgan : Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Hope you all are well. Wanted to follow up on some of the various ways it's been asked on prior questions, but when you talk about the '21 outlook and you put a few comments in your slides, I won't repeat them. But what are you reflecting with respect to, first, the latest uptick in power prices even in recent days when you think about '21 EBITDA relative to '20? As well as you just talked about an improvement in residential sales, for instance, how does that also figure into the meaningful chance that '21 guidance could be flat to '20 at this point? What are you assuming?
Curt Morgan : Yeah. Yeah. And Julien, I'm going to take that as being largely focused on ERCOT, is that correct?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. You tell me what the meaningful factors are, for example.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Well, look, I mean -- so 2020 -- actually, what we've seen is that from where our fundamental view is, 20 -- 2021 summer pricing in ERCOT, which is really always the big ticket for us, that will really end up being the swing that will either get us to flat or something less than that. Those prices have come off pretty hard over the last few weeks, and that's liquidity. It's a whole bunch of different reasons why that has come off. We don't believe it's fundamentally driven. And so it will really depend on kind of how quickly we come out of this -- the COVID-19 event and how quick the recovery is. And so that's why we're being a bit cautious in trying to draw distribution around the outcomes.  But if we were -- if we saw pricing up near where our fundamental view is, we would be very much closer to a flat year-over-year. If prices stay where they are now, they'd be more like in the -- what we had talked about in the presentation, that $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. So it just really depends on where ERCOT pricing comes out. And I think on the retail side, the numbers that year-over-year, from '20 to '21 are not that big in terms of our retail outlook that, that's really the swing factor. It's really going to end up being summer ERCOT pricing that will end up being the big ticket item. In the other markets, it's really not -- they're not that big of a player in this either. So I think if you really draw a circle around it, it's really going to end up being where does the summer '21 in ERCOT come out. And we see a distribution around that and still a fairly good chance that you could see a pretty strong year, especially if the development that we talked about doesn't come to fruition and the economy in Texas recovers quickly, which could happen. You could really see another tight situation in ERCOT.  And then we're talking about a very different set of numbers, probably something more closer to flat year-over-year relative to our guidance in 2020. But if we see a more prolonged effect from the COVID-19 virus and prices stay a little more depressed going into the summer, weather doesn't show up, then you could be on the lower end, that kind of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range. And David, I don't know if you want to add anything on that or not.
David Campbell: I think you covered it, Curt.
Curt Morgan: Okay.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. If I can just quickly follow up. On the C&I exposure, to the extent to which obviously 90% of the business is resi and mass biz. I just wanted to understand how you all are thinking about that exposure more in terms of the margin impacts, even on that small piece that would seemingly be the partial offset to what are otherwise very positive trends on the resi side.
Curt Morgan: Yes. David, do you want to take that one?
David Campbell: Sure. So Julien, you saw that we noted that there's some downticks from LC&I that we cited on Slide 11. And it's a combination of factors, the margin from that segment is pretty low. So part of it is lost margin, part of it is the loss of the hedge position. So we valued reselling back that power into the market at lower prices. And part of it is some of the impacts of certain fixed costs like capacity and transmission, particularly in Midwest and Northeast. So that's what gets you up to that sum total of the $30 million for the year, partially offset by some higher residential volumes. So that's some total of the various impacts, the margin is a relatively small piece of that. And again, that's our projection for the full year. It's with a view that we could have sustained impacts in the downturn. So we've tried to be pretty conservative in our assumptions. But it's the sum total of those various impacts of that segment.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Understood. Hey, Curt, just a real quick clarification for the sake of the call. When you're talking about growth here real quickly, and you made some comments earlier about growth expectations, renewables, et cetera, and just reconciling against, obviously, where the stock is, et cetera, how committed are you to seeing through growth relative to allocating capital back to buybacks, dividends, et cetera? Just want to be -- just exceptionally clear about growth capital right now.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean we look at -- we balance that. So the priority for us is obviously, to use capital efficiently. But at the same time, you've got to balance that a little bit in terms of growing the company over time. And -- because we are a going concern and buying back our shares. But we do an economic analysis, it's very simple. The real key, Julien, you know this, is what share price do you assume when you do the economics of buying back your own shares? And that is a really -- that's an art more than a science. So we look at a variety of share prices when you look at the return that you get for buying back your own shares, and we don't just look at one price, and we try to be realistic about it.  And we have to look at that over a period of time. And so depending on how long the period of time is, that dilutes the return on buying back shares. But we try to balance that, and we try to -- if we're going to invest in our company, we want to -- back into our company, we want to make sure that those returns also stand up to buy -- the alternative of buying back our shares. And I'm pretty happy to say that when we have done that, the returns have been definitely in the range of what we thought the value of buying back our shares has been and we're going to continue to do that kind of analysis, knowing that we also have to balance that we have to -- we're going to have to invest in our company. Our company is going to -- we're going to see coal plants retire. We've already been very straightforward on that front. We'd like to replace economically, obviously, the EBITDA from that, and we'd like to grow our EBITDA. At the same time, we know our stock is cheap. And so it's a balancing effect. There's no simple formula to it. But we do, do the math that you would expect us to do to try to see the relative returns of investing back in the business and investing in buying back our shares.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Well, once again, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. I hope everybody stays safe and healthy in this difficult time. I can't tell you enough how we appreciate your interest in our company, given the extraordinary COVID-19 virus. We're excited about our company, and we're excited about the months coming ahead. And until next time, please be safe and be healthy.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation, and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. We know this is a busy time of the year, so we intend to keep today's remarks concise, focusing on what we believe are the key drivers of Vistra's success, past, present and future. First and foremost, as we will discuss shortly Vistra has a strong track record of execution supporting our conviction that we have the right strategy and business model for long-term success. Second, I believe we have demonstrated that we know how to grow the company and create value for our shareholders. Experience and execution will be essential in the years ahead. And last, our underlying fundamentals remain sound making Vistra well positioned to continue to deliver consistent results. Not only weathering future volatility but also capitalizing on it. I'm going to star on Slide 6, as you can see in the last row of the table, Vistra finished 2019 reporting adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $3,393 million, results that are above the midpoint of Vistra's recently increased guidance range of $3.32 billion to $3.42 billion. Perhaps more important however is that this is the fourth year in a row that Vistra has delivered financial results above the midpoint of its guidance range For those of you counting, that is all four years Vistra has been a public company, meaning that we have established a consistent track record of delivering on our commitments and not only that, in the same timeframe we have also grown EBITDA by more than 100% and returned nearly $5 billion of capital through our equity and debt holders. All of this against the backdrop of a wide array of commodity prices in prompt and forward periods and changing customer preferences. As we lay out on the next slide, Slide 7 Vistra has been able to double its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in just over three years through a disciplined approach to growth investments and a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving plant operational performance. We have grown our business through both acquisition and investment, with the acquisitions of Odessa, Crius and Ambit and investments in solar and battery storage and Upton 2 site in Texas, and at our Moss Landing and Oakland sites in California, all of which are forecasted to delivery very attractive returns utilizing conservative assumptions. And as you know, the investment we announced in 2017 that continues to exceed expectations and offer outsized returns as the acquisition of Dynegy. Since the time we announced the acquisition we have more than doubled our EBITDA synergy and operational performance improvement targets from $350 million to $715 million. We have also increased our after tax free cash flow target by nearly 5 times and preserved the utilization of Dynegy's net operating losses resulting in a net present value benefit of approximately $900 million, applying and 8 multiple to the synergies and an 8% free cash flow yield to the free cash flow synergies would imply that we created more than $8 billion dollars of value from the Dynegy merger alone, not to mention we have increased the expectation for 2020 financial results by more than $600 million above the 2020 adjusted EBITDA target projected in connection with the merger announcements, substantially more than filling the gaps adjusted by forward course and from the Dynegy business due to a lower PJM capacity cleared. This increases large delivery results of the growth items I just discussed as well as our relentless focus on cost management and planned performance. Including the Dynegy merger value leverage we have identified nearly $1.5 billion of cost savings in just over three years. This impressive EBITDA growth, couple with our high free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 65% to 75% has supported our diverse capital allocation plan, where in addition to making prudent growth investments, Vistra has returned nearly $5 billion of capital to its financial stakeholders in just over three years through a combination of dividends, share repurchases, and debt reduction. While in 2020 we are focusing on reducing debt to achieve our long-term leverage target 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, we expect we will be in a position to roll out our long-term capital allocation plan in the second part of this year. As I have mentioned in the past, Vistra's robust free cash flow should enable us to both reinvest in our business at modest levels while returning a significant amount of capital to stakeholders. More to come on this topic later in the year, but suffice it to say that we are confident that this business model will continue to generate meaningful free cash flow for allocation year after year. Our teams have a proven track record of identifying efficiencies that maximize the value of our operations and we have been successful of identifying tuck in growth opportunities that are both EBITDA and free cash flow accretive with very attractive returns while requiring only modest levels of our capital to pursue. In short, this is a business model we believe can endure. Turning now to Slides 8 and 9, we wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing the six key tenets of our business model, as these tenets have formed the base line of our success over the past four years and importantly remain intact to support our positive outlook for the future. They include financial discipline, low cost operations, diversification, a leading retail platform, and in the money generation fleet and commercial optimization. Starting at the top, financial discipline is the foundation of our business model. It is imperative that commodity exposed businesses operate with more leverage. A strong balance sheet allows a company to weather commodity cycles without creating financial distress and allows management teams to make sound investment decisions at the right times in the business cycles. Vistra is committed to achieving its long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and we are equally committed to being good stewards of capital, making investments only when projected returns meet or exceed our investment threshold and returning a significant amount to our financial stakeholders. Just like I dubbed 2019 the year of execution, 2020 is the year of financial strength and capital allocation clarity and of course execution will always underpin everything we do. Vistra's financial strength is similarly supported by its commitments to low cost operations and its diversified revenue streams. Vistra is a market leader in low cost operations. Through our operational performance improvement program we have identified $425 million of annual EBITDA enhancements putting our generation fleet in a position to remain viable as the supply landscape evolves. Our scale also enables us to operate with comparatively low overhead costs and gives us the unique ability to leverage our platform to create synergies when attractive growth opportunities present themselves. Vistra's scale and diversification further lessens any potential negative impacts from one time whether events or regulatory changes for example. With operations in six competitive markets in the U.S. and diverse revenue streams from retail, capacity and energy, Vistra believes it is well positioned to deliver stable earnings in a variety of market price environments. It is also important to note that we have taken steps to transition our generation business to compete in the age of climate change, going from mainly coal just a few years ago to mainly gas today, while prudently investing in renewable and batter storage technologies. On the retail front, following the closing of Crius and Ambit acquisitions in 2019, Vistra is now the largest competitive residential electric provider in the country, serving nearly 5 million customers up from the approximately 1.7 million we served at that time our predecessor emerged from bankruptcy in October of 2019. Our Texas retail operations continue to demonstrate strength and stability with our legacy residential business in Texas growing accounts in 2019 for the second year in a row. We now have 12 brands and more than 200 product offerings and operate in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Our growth in retail, both organically and via acquisitions, has resulted in our retail business being the consumer of nearly 60% of our generation output on an annual basis. Our retail segment is the most attractive channel for us to sell our generation LinkedIn as a result of the higher margins it offers and collateral and transaction efficiencies we realize when transacting on an integrated basis. Here in retail and wholesale also helps to create more stability in our cash flows, which we believe makes for a predictable and attractive investment. This is true in part because of the nature of the assets in our generation fleet. Vistra's generation assets are relatively young, low heat rate assets with over 60% of our capacity coming from gas fuel generation and more than 50% of our fleet comprised of highly efficient and flexible combine cycle gas turbines. This is important for two primary reasons, first because our assets are generally in the money meaning they are low enough on the supply stack that they learn most of the time. We have a greater opportunity to hedge our forward commodity exposure at favorable pricing periods and create higher and more stable earnings. Second, as the country continues to transition to lower carbon technology, our flexible natural gas assets are very likely to remain an integral part of the generation mix. We expect our gas asses will be a critical backstop for the grid and is becoming increasingly reliant on the intermittent renewable resources. We have seen this phenomenon pointing out in renewable heavy California and Texas in the past year. As intermittent renewable resources become a greater percentage of the supply stack, the market is introducing risk of entire class assets underperform in a correlated fashion, meaning the grid is more likely to lose a significant percentage of its generation all at once. Historically, asset underperformance was predominantly a function of uncorrelated power plant forced outages. In order for the grid to remain reliable in this circumstance we will need these low-cost, dispatch able gas assets. As a result, we believe Vistra's generation fleet is well-positioned to continue to drive meaningful EBITDA from energy, ancillary services and capacity revenues in the future. The last component of Vistra's integrated business model is commercial optimization. Our ability to take advantage of the volatility and forward curves to hedge our open generation position at attractive pricing generally insulates our financial results from near-term fluctuations in commodity pricing, in particular natural gas prices. We saw this play out in 2019 and expect it to in 2020 as well. Importantly, our commercial team executes our hedging strategy with an approach to manage risks and our goal to create a stable earnings profile. And it has a proven track record of success in this regard. When you combine in the money assets, price volatility and the financial strength to forward hedge, Vistra can construct a rolling, stable earning profile and we now have a four year proven track record of success to support this thesis. Turning now to our full year results on Slide 10, Vistra ended the year delivering adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations $3,393 million, results that exceeded our increased guidance midpoint from November. And when you back out the negative $40 million impact from ERCOT retail backwardation, we talked about on our last earnings call, our 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would have been $3,433 million, which is higher than the upper end of our guidance range for the year. Recall that we did not plan for the volume or the impact of these long dated contracts in our initial 2019 guidance, meaning that our integrated operations absorbed this impact and still delivered financial results at the high end of our guidance range, another testament to the strength of this integrated business model. It is also notable that this drag on 2019 earnings will reverse itself in future years as increased EBITDA and the underlying transactions are NPV positive. Our 2019 ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth was $2,437 million, results that are $187 million above our guidance midpoint at $137 million above the high end of our guidance range. This favorability in our 3019 adjusted free cash flow before growth is a result of higher adjusted EBITDA as well as continued capital expenditure disciplined by our operational teams. The favorability was also due in part to the early receipt of an alternative minimum tax credit refund of $93 million which we have planned to received in 2020 and included in our 2020 guidance. This robust free cash flow generation translates to a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 72% in 2019. Consistent with our past practice, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range as shown on Slide 10, including the adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range despite the timing of the AMT refund. We are very early in the year and a lot can change to improve our view of cash. As the year progresses, we will evaluate whether an update to our free cash flow before growth guidance range is warranted due to the timing impact of this tax refund. Before we move off of this slide, I want to once again comment on the outlook for 2020-2021. The 2021 forward curves in ERCOT have come down from where they were trading in October of last year. We continue to believe that the forward curves are dislocated from fundamentals and not reflective of where pricing will ultimately settle, a view we have been accurate on for the last few years. Our fundamental view continues to support our belief that 2021 results have a good chance of being plateau if not better than 2020 results. I'm going to wrap up this morning on Slide 12 and 13. Given the spotlight in recent months on the sustainable footprint of public companies and specifically public companies with exposure to coal, we thought it would be helpful to provide some numbers behind our exposure while emphasizing where we think this trajectory is headed. As you can see on Slide 12 in just three years with the retirement of seven coal plants and growth in retail, gas assets, and renewables in storage, Vistra has reduced its exposure to coal by nearly half with less than 30% of our capacity, approximately 20% of our revenues, and only 17% of our EBITDA forecast to come from coal assets in 2020. This is a dramatic shift in a short period of time and one we expect will continue over the next decade. In fact if we turn to the next slide, you will see a picture of what we believe our business could look like in 2030 based on the 10 year view we introduced on our third quarter earnings call in November. Clearly, this is and illustrative outlook, but it is rooted in rational market principles and fundamentals, a recognition of current power technology, and a future asset mix that will be necessary to ensure system reliability and an expectation for realistic investment in the company at reasonable returns. Assuming economic and environmental challenges result in the retirement of another approximately 7200 MW of coal assets over the next 10 years and we invest approximately 25% of our free cash flow in renewable and battery assets and retail over that same time period, 10% or less of our EBITDA and capacity would come from coal assets in 2030. Under this scenario, not only would we transform our generation fleet to be nearly 20% renewable and batteries, we would also expect to drive more than 50% of our EBITDA from retail, renewables and batteries and nuclear. As we have mentioned many times, we believe natural gas generation will remain a key dispatch able resource needed for power system reliability with proliferation of intermittent renewables. We have as efficient a gas fleet as anyone and we expect it will continue to be a strong component of our EBITDA contribution. Importantly, this business mix and market outlook is expected to grow EBITDA and result in approximately $15 billion of capital available to be returned to shareholders. And if we do not identify investments that meet our hurdle rate, we will return that capital as well. As we announced in October last year, we have a clear line of sight to achieving a greater than 50% reduction in our CO2 equivalent emissions by 2030 as compared to 2010 base line. Coal economics continue to be challenged and I expect Vistra's exposure to coal will further decline meaningfully over the same time period. Our business is already participating in the energy transition and I believe we will continue to be leaders in this effort in the future. Our unique capabilities with expertise managing risk, operating assets with scale and efficiency and providing innovative products and services to our retail customers make us well positioned to capitalize on the transition to a lower carbon economy, improving our environmental footprint while continuing to create value for our shareholders over the long term. Before I turn the call over to David, I feel compelled once again to comment on our stock price. Setting aside the rent sell off due to the coronavirus, not surprisingly we believe the recent decline in our stock is unwarranted and what was a significantly undervalued stock prior to this decline is now an absurdly undervalued stock. In our view, there is no rational explanation for an over 20% free cash flow yield especially when compared to other commodity expose, capital incentive, capital companies with far more risk in the climate change age. Nevertheless we believe we are on the right track and we are committed to unlocking value. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.
David Campbell: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to slide 15, Vistra delivered 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3,393 million exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. As you know, during our third quarter call we increased our 2019 guidance reflecting expected impact of the Crius and Ambit acquisitions. The favorability relative to our provided guidance was driven by higher gross margin from our ERCOT segment compared to planned results. Our adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations also exceeded expectations, coming in above the high end of our guidance range of $2,437 million. This favorability was due in part to the early receipt of alternative minimum tax credit refund of $93 million which we previously expected in 2020. After excluding the AMT refund, our free cash flow before growth still exceeded the high end of our 2019 guidance range. This outperformance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA as well as capital expenditure discipline reflecting the impact of our ongoing operations performance improvement efforts. Focusing on the fourth quarter, our 2019 results were $55million higher than the same period of 2018 driven by the additions of Crius and Ambit and higher gross margins in ERCOT generation, partially offset by lower capacity revenue in our PJM and New York, New England generation segments. Before we move on to our final slide this morning, I will note that due to the retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter, we moved the financial results of those plants out of the MISO segment and into the Asset Closure segment. We have similarly recast our 2018 results to account for this shift, which is why you will see that our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for 2018 is $1 million higher than what we reported at this time last year. Slide 16 provides a summary of capital allocation. As of February 24, we have executed $1.418 billion for our $1.75 billion share repurchase program, leaving approximately $332 million of capital remaining for future share repurchases. You'll recognize that this is virtually the same amount of capital we had available under our share repurchase program as of our November earnings call. During the 2019 calendar year, we returned a total of $899 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we emphasized during our November earnings call, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. We believe the achievement of our targeted leverage levels will support an upgrade to our debt ratings, and keep us on the path to investment grade. We also believe that advancing toward an investment grade credit rating can be one of the most powerful catalysts to rerate our equity, as it will be yet another proof point that the new business model we are operating is significantly de-risked from the IPPs of the past. We have heard from many investors, they will be more inclined to invest in our equity or will be more comfortable taking a larger position in the equity with an investment grade credit profile. We believe 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA is the appropriate leverage level for our enterprise in order to withstand business cycles and maintain investment flexibility independent of the consideration of investment grade credit rating. As a result, we remain committed to debt reduction in 2020 and delevering will be our near term capital allocation priority. However, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate repurchasing shares, or investing in promising growth opportunities, especially those that have a minimal impact on our credit metrics. Turning to our dividend, we announced earlier in the week that our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our annual dividend, resulting in $0.135 quarterly, or $0.54 per share on annual basis. Our first $0.135 quarterly dividend will be paid on March 31 to shareholders of record as of March 17. As we look ahead, we expect to have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond. We plan to layout our long-term capital allocation plan in the second part of this year. Our history has demonstrated that we have the discipline to be good stewards of your capital, returning meaningful excess cash to our stakeholders while investing in growth only when attractive opportunities arise. You can expect that long-term capital allocation plan will reflect a similar philosophy, including the significant return of cash annually to shareholders. We remain optimistic that with the ongoing successful execution of our business plan, our stock price will ultimately reflect its fundamental value. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. You just raised your dividend by 8%, you're delevering is on pace, could you just get a directionally talk about the scale of the next buyback with another $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of free cash flow that's kind of at your disposal in 2021? I guess I'm trying to get a sense on what you mean by significant annual return of capital to shareholders. An exact timing when you're going to initiate, not announce, the new program with 21 story being sort of going to IG ratings. I mean, can you start incremental buybacks this year versus the current 322 that remains under the old program?
David Campbell: Thanks Shahriar. So look, I think to be very clear about this, in 2020 we are focused on paying down our debt and getting debt to our leverage targets. And look, I think a time like this frankly, essentially for me reconfirms that where we're headed whether our leverage is the right thing. When you get into situations, like what's going on with the pandemic, and it seems to be growing, I think financial strength is going to be proved out to be very key. And so, while we would like to buy our shares back, I mean, let's just be honest, we know that we're trading now, 20 and plus some change. It's a very attractive buy. We're also File 7 Higher gross margins in ERCOT generation partially offset by lower capacity revenue in our PJM in New York, New England generation segments. Before we move on to our final slide this morning, I will note that due to the retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter, we moved the financial results of those plants out of the MISO segment and into the Asset Closure segment.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. You just raised your dividend by 8% you're delevering is on pace, could just get a directly talk about the scale of the next buyback with another 2.3 billion, 2.4 billion of free cash flow that's kind of at your disposal in 2021. I guess I'm trying to get a sense on what you mean by significant annual return to capital shareholders. An exact timing when you're going to initiate not announced the new program with 21 story being sort of going to IG ratings. I mean, can you start incremental buybacks this year versus the current 322 that remains under the old program?
Curtis Morgan: Thanks Shahriar. So look, I think to be very clear about this in 2020, we are focused on paying down our debt and getting debt to our leverage targets. And look, I think a time like this frankly, essentially for me reconfirms that where we're headed whether our leverage is the right thing. When you get into situations, like what's going on with the pandemic, and it seems to be growing. I think financial strength is going to be proved out to be very key. And so, while we would like to buy our shares back I mean, let's just be honest. We know that we're trading now, 20 and plus some change. It's a very attracted buy. We're also equally committed to get our leverage to where we said we were going to do it and we're committed to do it in 2020. So beyond that we've said later this year we will give a little more clarity about what we're going to do in 2021 and beyond. But I think we've given a little bit of a view of that, by saying we think we can invest in our business about a quarter what we believe on an ongoing basis will be about $2 billion plus of free cash flow. So I mean, the math just tells you that that's $1.5 billion that we can return to shareholders. I think the real question is going to be for our company is how do we do that. And I think that's a mix of recurring dividend and whether we side with the Board to change the yield that we're paying on the dividends that will definitely be on the table. And then, clearly if we're trading below value and our thought of what fundamental values this company, then the remainder that will go to buy back shares. I mean, it's not rocket science, and I'm not, speaking out of turn, it's just that's the way we think about it. And so – I think that's the – the next couple of years that's what it looks like. But we need to get the debt down to where we want it to be and we're committed to do it in 2020. We pushed it out once before, and we're not going to do it again. I think this is the right thing and I think to strengthen the company from a financial standpoint, it's the right thing to do. I’d also think it's very – and David alluded to this in his comments that we believe that ultimately, getting the debt down to where we want it to be will also be very accretive to the equity. So that's what we're doing in 2020 and 2021 and beyond. We have a substantial amount of capital return and it will be a mix of a recurring dividend and probably share repurchases.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it, got it and that's because they are obviously looking at inorganic opportunities, the thresholds aren't there yet, okay. Let me just ask you Curt one more question is, there's obviously been a lot of headlines about strategic opportunities, including privatization, which we get given these obviously very high or irrationally high free cash flow yields. What's your sort of updated thoughts there? What's your trigger point? Are you sort of patient right now? Do you want to see what happens with your free cash flow yield once you go to IG before making this decision I guess, what's, yours and the Board's level of patience on these valuation models?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, so very good question Shahriar. Thanks for asking that. So look, I think we are patient. We believe that getting our debt down to the 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA range this year is very important. And then I think also giving clarity to that long-term capital allocation plan, putting another year behind us and showing that we can meet or exceed our expectations, I think is also helpful. That's helpful to the agencies as well. I think one of the things they'd like to see is whether we can withstand the business cycles, including things like what's going on with coronavirus right now, which I think in 2020 we're going to have a very good year despite what could be, symptoms of a recession off of that, off the coronavirus. So I think we're very strong company, I think we’ll show that in 2020, but I think it's very important, for us to do that. Now, in terms of the direct question about, strategic options, I think we'll be patient through 2020 and into 2021 to see that play out. But I can also assure you that, the Board continually thinks about what's the best way to unlock value. You know that I spent a lot of time in private equity. And for me, the only difference between being a public company and a private company, is that every day I wake up I get a scorecard. I get my report card, it's in the form of our stock price. And from a private equity standpoint, they market on a quarterly basis, but I can assure you that most of those companies are marking their quarterly mark of their value based on what the public markets are creating at. And frankly at the end of the day, you unlock value the same way in both private and public market settings. You either do it over the long run or you do it at particularly with the private equity firms, you look for an exit, and the exit is limited. You know this right now, there's many private equity firms that would love to exit their generation, but there is no exit for them. And if they try to exit into the public markets, they have too much leverage and they don't have an integrated business model, which is what it takes to compete in the public markets. So, we think we can unlock this value in a public market setting it just may take a longer period of time. And we've got to be patient to do that, but I don't see that if there some silver bullet by becoming a private company that all of a sudden there's going to be this huge value uplift, because you've monetized the value of a company the same way whether you're public or private.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it, that's helpful and I completely agree with your exit strategies are the hindrance. Thanks so much, guys, I appreciate it.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fleishman: Thanks. Good morning.
Curtis Morgan: Hey Steve.
Steven Fleishman: Hey, so just maybe just curious, Curt if you can give us a little color on, as you mentioned feel good on Texas market, I assume mainly Texas market fundamentals. So could you just give - a little bit of an update on just overall the U.S. supply/demand impact of solar adds that you're seeing and things like that?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, so just you know that Steve that we do our own point of view, when it comes to reserve margin. We have – I don’t know if this is well known, but we have a very good development team. And one of the best ways to get intelligence on what's going on in terms of development in any market is to have a team that's actually out there and doing it. And so, we have a pretty good sense of things. Plus we know historically, in particular in Texas, kind of what the build out rate has been, from the CDR to what actually gets built, which has been a little bit below 50%. And what happened in the CDR this time, which I think most people know what that is, right. It's not, I wouldn't take that to the bank, anybody that invest on, by looking at the CDR is foolish. I mean at the end of the day, it doesn't have an economic overlay to it. And so, what happened though, is everything that was supposed to get built that didn't get built 2020 got pushed into 2021and that's kind of what happened and so it just keeps rolling out. So the CDR actually shows a big uptick in building and we think there's probably a little bit less than 50% of that, that's actually on the ground getting built for 2020. What that results in is a very manageable reserve margin going into, from 2020 into 2021, which in our view, if you look at low growth, and that's the big key really in Texas. But we've got some people who think it's going to be 3%, some people – around more like us about 2%. Either way, that new build is barely going to cover load growth in the State of Texas. So that's why we feel that the market is still fundamentally strong. The last point I'd make about that is that, the growing intermittent nature of the new build, because all that new build by the way, is going to be solar and wind and wind is dropping off by the way, just because the PTC is going away. And so wind – excuse me solar is the build out. And we all know that, there's an intermittent nature to that, depending on how the sun shines on any particular day. And we saw this last summer. And the reserve – overall reserve margin is not as important frankly, as the reserve margin ex, the intermittent resources. How much steel is on the ground, and especially in the summer months, when neither the wind or the sun are not performing at expectation. And that's really what's key to figuring out what the increase in pricing is going to be in the summer. And when you look at that, the market is really tight for those types of resources during those periods of time. And we expect we're going to get, probably four or five, maybe even up to 10 of those in any given summer and we're going to see high pricing. Then the key for us, frankly, is that we have assets that can perform. And we had – our commercial availability, which is basically, when you're available when you're in the money weighted by margin opportunity was almost 95% this year, which is extraordinarily high when you've got older coal in your fleet. So, we have to have that same performance. If we do that, and we see these same kind of fly-offs and given the supply/demand in Texas, we're going to see another good summer. And you can boil our company down in terms of the range that we give you guys on any given year, given the way that we hedge, you can boil it down to the summer months in ERCOT. That's really the game for us. And we think we're well positioned to that. We like the links that we have, especially given the fundamentals in Texas. And so, we're looking forward to this summer. We think with the ORDC, the core increase in standard deviation, this is going to be a real interesting summer again and there's going to be a great opportunity for our company.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, and then I guess separately, just want to get more color how the Crius and Ambit deals are going in terms of just meeting the performers you had and overall dynamics in ERCOT retail market - market share things like that?
Curtis Morgan: Sure, Steve, you know Jim Burke he is here. I was going to have Jim address that for you please.
Jim Burke: Certainly, good morning Steve. Yes we obviously started to integrate Crius ahead of Ambit. I think both integrations are going really well. We have $45 million to $50 million of synergy opportunities with those two. Some of that is technology driven. So it's a multiyear process, but from a hedging and supply standpoint or customer behavior standpoint, and the initial cost synergies achieved those were on track. We’ll continue to build synergies over the next two to three year timeframe. But we like how those two books are operating at this point and I think we feel really good about the multiples with which we acquired them and the long-term value for this generation to retail match, particularly in ERCOT.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, thanks that’s it from me.
Curtis Morgan: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, Jim. Can you hear me?
Jim Burke: You're a little fade, but we can hear you. Okay, Julien, how you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good excellent, thank you very much. I’m quite well, Happy Friday. Perhaps just to come back to your commentary about the cash flow this year and the taxes, can you talk about some of the strategies to minimize taxes, not just this year, but especially on an ongoing basis. I mean, this has been something you've been successful at in the past. You made an allusion to it, if I heard you right on the call, what kinds of strategies, what kind of opportunity exists there – well I'll ask it open ended?
Curtis Morgan: Okay I’ll take a shot and then David, I'd like you to comment too, but you’re just talking about like federal taxes right, I mean Julien that's what you're talking about.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: You made some comments about AMT earlier as well.
Curtis Morgan: Okay so.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: An improvement to the overall FCF [ph] this year?
Curtis Morgan: Sure that AMT refund really came from the Dynegy acquisition. We're all too happy to have it, but that was really where that came from, that opportunity. But just to remind everybody, we haven't been and we are not a taxpayer, I think through 2023 roughly. And, and then after that, we always are looking, we have very good tax group and we're always looking for opportunities to minimize our taxes. But we are not a tax payer and have not been paying on the TRA and won't be until we project probably out into 2024. And then, we will obviously we'll have plenty of time to try to see what tax strategies we might be able to deploy to minimize that. But, we at least on the forecast right now, it looks like we'd be a tax payer again in 2024. And so, we've really had, there's a couple of things happened, one the NOLs that we received, and there were some, what I'll call esoteric, sort of integration between new tax law and old tax law. We had a window of opportunity that happened and then closed right after closed the Dynegy deal, but since we closed before that, we were avail to the opportunity to be able to use 100% of the Dynegy's roughly $4 billion plus dollars of NOLs which as we've said many times has an NPV of about $900 million. So that has been a big contributor to us not paying taxes. David, do you have anything to add?
David Campbell: I’ll add – just to reemphasize Curt’s point, this is David, that we, our tax group is very active managing this other than property taxes and some state franchise taxes we do not pay. And we do not have federal income tax liability or cash payments in 2019. And we don't expect to be a cash taxpayer for the next few years. And we're going to keep manage – actually managing that, keep that trajectory going as long as we can, very important to us. And as we noted, we received an AMT payment of $93 million in the fourth quarter. We also received another $35 million in the first quarter this year related to as Curt described some AMT claims from the Dynegy situation. But we’ll continue to very actively manage down our cash taxes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome, excellent guys. And then looking at the slides here on the hedging front, 2021 versus 2020, just as you provide the sort of initial look here, the expected output is backward dated. I assume that's just tied to the forwards here, but just want to understand if there's anything changing in how you view things?
David Campbell: You have it just right, Julien. These were based on forwards, if we were to shows, you know our proprietary point of view, you'd see very similar volumes to what you have in 2020. And so, I think what the big key will be is just what ultimately plays out in the market. But we feel pretty confident that our point of view, which has played out over the last four years will play out again for 2021. And of course, then we'd have the same level of production volumes that we've had from 2020 to 2021.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, all righty, I'll pass it off. Thank you very much, guys.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, guys. Along those same lines about production volumes, on Page 25, the hedge portfolio and portfolio sensitivities, it looks like generation, total generation output is declining especially in ERCOT and a little bit in PJM from 2020 to 2021. And I'm wondering how I can, how do you square that with the comment on Slide 10 that says that the EBITDA for 2021 will be, at or above 2020?
David Campbell: Yes so, Michael it’s a good question. And I tried to address it there with Julien, but I'll try it again, I obviously didn't do a very good job of it. If you were to take a - strictly mark the curve off the curves, you'd get what we're showing on Page, what is it Page?
Michael Weinstein: 25.
David Campbell: So, on a pure marked basis, because of the backwardation and the curve, and I think you know this, but what this is showing is our delta position, which effectively means, what is in the money at a particular curve. And so, and then what's the production resulting production from our power plants. And what we based the comment on Page 10 is our point of view, which - if we were to put the two curves out.
Michael Weinstein: Now I get it.
David Campbell: 2020/2021 point of view versus 2021 market, you would see and we've said this, we think there is a decoupling between where the curves are and where our point of view has been. We've also said that we've been saying this now for about four years where, and we've been accurate on this where the market has actually as we rolled into the prop year. For example going from 2020 to 2021 we've seen those curves pop up, as the market understands that the market remains tight, and that the supply/demand fundamentals are strong, which we expect to happen given our intelligence of what new build is going to look like and our understanding, of what load growth looks like. So again, that's the Page 10 comment is based on our view of the world, and Page 25 is based on a strict mark of the curves.
Michael Weinstein: I get it, I get it, so over the course of the year, we'd expect this page to change with those numbers coming up?
David Campbell: Yes that’s correct.
Michael Weinstein: As it catches up with the point of view, right? And then also nothing is...
Curtis Morgan: Hey Michael, can I mention one of the things really important?
Michael Weinstein: Okay yes.
Curtis Morgan: So as the forward curves, because they're going to be volatile, and there'll be periods of time where the price will pop up. And that's what, this is what we try to tell people, that's when we will hedge. And so, whether the market settles there or not, we are able to capture that value by hedging at the high points of where the curve is. And so, that's another key piece of how we create value in this company.
Michael Weinstein: Well that makes sense, that's the value of having a point of view, I guess.
Curtis Morgan: Yes.
Michael Weinstein: Also the natural gas position, I guess is this a normal thing just in the early part of the year to see a very big short position out in the 2021 timeframe for ERCOT or does that represent something?
Curtis Morgan: [Indiscernible] once a year, you're pointing out the short position that we have on natural gas in 2021, but it's pretty natural and we think about hedging our natural gas equivalent position. So we went into in looking at our forward position, we went in with a point of view that we wanted to hedge more of our gas position relative to our power position. So that's why you see the big, relatively sizable short position on natural gas. So we're fully hedged for relative natural gas of 2020 in our view we’re about 85% hedged in our natural gas position for 2021. And that's just a view on how we like to – we want to put that hedge on and we're pleased that we did. So that just reflects the desire to hedge the natural gas equivalent position, and we can do that separately in ERCOT relative to the underlying heat rate or power position.
David Campbell: And all I add Michael. So we're various gas and that we have been various gas that’s proven out to be right. And we hedge that and then we continue to be bullish the heat rate and that's how power trades, that's where the liquidity is in ERCOT. That's not true with all the markets, but in ERCOT power sort of trades, gas and heat rate. And so, we are less hedged on the heat rate as you could tell, and we are more hedged on gas. And that is because we had a pretty strong conviction around just some bearishness around gas and frankly, it's sort of proven out to be the case.
Michael Weinstein: Right hey, just a follow-up on Steve's question about retail. And I think I've asked you this before, but has there been any consideration towards going into residential solar or some of the higher growth sectors of the retail energy complex? I mean, the residential solar players are looking at growth rates anywhere from 15% to like 60% year-over-year. It's really pretty impressive and their stories get a lot of traction. I'm just wondering if that's something you might consider just from a strategy point of view?
Curtis Morgan: We have studied that. I mean, there is growth rates, and then there is making money. And so, we want to put our money where the best returns are, and we just haven't found them in that part, but we have our eyes on that. I don't think we felt like we wanted to be an early mover on that, that we felt like if we wanted to get into it, we could probably buy our way into it at some point in time. But we have looked at that, we’ve looked at some other things as well like behind the meter type investments. And we just can't quite get to the hurdle rates and get comfortable with the acquisition, but it is something we take a look at, and it's a good point on - from your standpoint, that there are a lot of growth rates and we do expect, for example in California, we expect obviously that to be a burgeoning part of the business, it's right now it's kind of dispersed in a number of different players. And no one really has a particular business model that seems to work. There are some good companies out there that are performing, but we just haven't found that it meets the hurdle rate that we have. Jim, do you have a comment?
Jim Burke: Yes Curt, I would just add, Michael, this is Jim Burke. From a customer interest standpoint, we do need a lot of their need, particularly in ERCOT with some of our designs or products that we did off of our Upton 2 solar farm. And those products don't require an install on the roof and you can still obviously get the solar energy. When you look at rooftop in most markets it’s a savings play and in Texas, there's not full net metering. So the savings opportunities are not as attractive to put the rooftop solar on the house. And then when we've looked at these business models, we have partnered with, so we will sell those systems through partners. But we've seen companies commit to a fixed capacity of sales and installation resources, and then that becomes its own cash burn that you have to be able to keep up with through the install base. So as Curt noted, we know what the customer interest is. We participate in that sale, but we have not put the fixed cost structure in place to execute against it. And we will continue to monitor that. And if that becomes a bigger play for us, we will obviously be in front of it because we've got the customer insights to do so.
Michael Weinstein: Great understood. Thank you very much.
Curtis Morgan: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question.
Curtis Morgan: Hey Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold: Hi, I just kept, Curt can I ask you to give us a little update on your views on - fundamentals updates on PJM and maybe policy as well as New England. I see you have a slide on FCA-14 and maybe you could just kind of speak to that a little bit?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, so I assume, you're talking specifically PJM, about the PJM capacity order now that had recently come out. Is that correct, Jonathan?
Jonathan Arnold: Yes I mean, unless you feel there is other things you want to touch, but that would be top of my list.
Curtis Morgan: Okay yes so, I mean that's probably the biggest thing I mean, I know we have fast start that we're waiting on that had a technical kind of glitch to it that I think will get resolved. And then the ORDC that’s pending up and we’re at FERC that we think those two things will be I'd say, modestly helpful on the energy side. But if you put those aside, I mean, the elephant in the room is what's going to happen given the PJM order from FERC. As we know, many, many people are asking for rehearing. Recently, I think people got a little bit confused by an order tolling for FERC to give – tolling that the rehearing decision, which effectively means that they're going to continue consider whether they're going to rehear anything, they probably will rehear some things. But that final decision has not been there. I think the next big milestone frankly, is the compliance filing that's coming out, from PJM. Our own take on this has been, and continues to be. And I think it's even further reinforced by some of the analysis that a lot of people were putting out, including the IMM and our own analysis. That when you look at the net ACR, which is the net go forward cost for many of the different assets, such as renewable, such as nuclear, that it is unlikely to have much of an impact on the capacity clears and it's not, this big windfall that I think states we're worried about and some of the generators we're celebrating. We think there's a really a modest impact. And what's probably bigger is how much new bill do you get in any given year? And how much retirement do you get in any given year. And those fundamentals are what should drive the market, and what should not drive the market or subsidized resources. And nor do we think that the market, the ruling that came out of FERC should have also given us a big windfall. I mean, at the end of the day, we've got a market that's got nearly 30% reserve margin. And for a combined cycle plant, it returns about three quarters of new build cost. I'd say that's a functioning market. And so, we didn't expect a big windfall and I don't think that's what's going to happen. Now, having said that, there's a lot of hyperbole and a lot of emotion going on about this and there's hearings going in the state Illinois which we are going to be a part of and others. And there's a lot - people throwing around FRR. What I have heard, when I talked to people in Maryland and – let's put New Jersey on the side, because let's just say this, what this really is about at the end of the day is offshore wind. Those are the folks that are likely to get screened out, because of the high cost of offshore wind, and other types of renewables are still going to clear the market. And so, we don't think it's a big deal other than offshore wind, and that's where the big argument is going to come in. But given that there is also an opportunity through FRR for some people to push things like a clean energy agenda. However, we've been saying this too, that in Illinois, you can break apart clean energy, and FRR. We're not opposed by the way to FRR if that's what the state of Illinois wants to do. We can compete in that world as well. We just don't think that it is necessary. But we're happy to compete in an environment with FRR. And we are trying to work with all stakeholders including Exelon who we have a very good relationship with and others in Illinois to bring. If there's going to be legislation to bring proper legislation and make sure that the elected officials understand what's at stake when they make that decision. So I'll wrap up with what I said on the beginning, which is we don't really see the order really changing much in terms of capacity price clears. And I think – just like I said, there has been a lot of emotion around it. But when you put the pencil to paper, the analysis shows that it's really not going to make a big difference. And on FCA-14, obviously a disappointing clear, not a very big impact for us. But nevertheless, a very disappointing clear our bidding behavior was a large piece of that. And that's true of most of these capacity clears. We do think there is some fundamentals if in fact mystic units are able to come out from FCA-15. We think there will be an uptick, a potential uptick from the $2. If for some reason, that mystic cannot come out, because ISO New England is not able to get their new weather based order in place through FERC. And the market adjustments that they want to make, then we might be down to $2 again. However, what I would say is there's a number of units that probably cleared at the $2 and decided to be a price taker, who are not going to be able to stay in this market for multiple years of $2 players. And so that's the next piece in the next shoe to drop as do people come out – do they come out of the market? I would expect that some way, but we cannot control that. So I think we're in this place where we're somewhere between, maybe the low 3s to $2. We can run our business that way most of our plants can make it in that environment. And we still make decent money up in ISO New England. But I have to admit, it's a disappointing clear and I don't think indicative of the value of the units that are necessary there to keep reliability in that system. And I suspect that ISO New England is somewhat worried about that as well.
Jonathan Arnold: Great, thanks for the fulsome answer, Curt. And then just one quick housekeeping thing that probable maybe more for David on the CapEx side. The growth, I think you just reshuffled things a little bit, but can you just confirm that?
David Campbell: Yes, thank you, Jonathan for raising that so you’re referring to Slide 22.
Jonathan Arnold: Yes.
David Campbell: Included in prior versions of this chart we had not shown what we described as growth CapEx, we only included a portion of it. So for example, the Moss Landing battery, so the way we've recast this page is to include all of our capital expenditures, including the growth capital expenditure. So for example, we've shown the row of growth CapEx $104 million in 2019 and $315 million in 2020. The significant majority of which is relates to our Moss Landing development, the battery development in California. So we just wanted to give folks a complete picture of CapEx because there was some confusion on that part of presentation, so it's an attempt to add to clarity.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, so it's not that you've added things, it’s that you've just shown things [indiscernible]?
David Campbell: Yes.
Jonathan Arnold: The ones in [indiscernible] particular.
David Campbell: Yes these were things that you could piece together previously, but you had to piece together in different places, but we've not added CapEx, we've just tried to show a holistic picture on this page in particular.
Jonathan Arnold: Perfect, thank you very much.
David Campbell: Yes if you look back from a year ago, our capital expenditures in 2019 were about $30 million lower than what we showed about a year ago. So the team showed good discipline on how they approached it and relative the last quarter for example, all in CapEx for 2020 is unchanged from what we showed.
Jonathan Arnold: Perfect, thank so much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Curt Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Curtis Morgan: Okay, yes thanks, everybody for taking the time this morning. As I stated earlier, and as we always say, we really do appreciate your interest in Vistra and we look forward to continuing the conversation about our company. Have a great day and a great weekend.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Vistra Energy Third Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's investor webcast covering third quarter 2019 results, which is being broadcast live, from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation, and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. We expect this call to be lengthier than usual. We have a lot to cover including Q3 results, 2019 guidance, 2020 guidance with a glimpse of 2021, an operations performance initiative update and a 10-year view based on our detailed fundamental analysis. So let's get started. Turning to Slide 6, Vistra finished the third quarter of 2019 reported strong adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $1.064 billion, results that are once again in line with the management's expectations for the quarter and results I am pleased to see relative to guidance that's already incorporated, high ERCOT wholesale power prices, especially for the summer of 2019. The quarter began with an unseasonably mild July following one of the mildest Junes in over 10 years. In fact, there was a very, very, sentiment out there and our stock had sold off. On our second quarter call we outlined why we remain bullish on the markets, especially ERCOT and our company. Of course, we know that August turned out to be a different story than July, as the tight supply/demand dynamic in ERCOT resulted in sustained scarcity pricing. We saw 12 15-minute intervals clear at the price cap of $9000 per megawatt hour during the month. To give you some perspective of the magnitude of the difference between July and August pricing at ERCOT, the average 7 x 24 price in August was $131 a megawatt hour, more than four times higher than the average July sell price of approximately $30 a megawatt hour. Our fleet performed well during the summer peak period, resulting in August favorability in our ERCOT Generation segment offsetting the headwinds from July and importantly bringing realized prices for the quarter back in line with management expectations for the year. This is a key point and one I want to emphasize. In ERCOT, an order for peak hour forward curve that is well above $100 per megawatt hour to be realized. The market has to see some level of scarcity pricing materialize. In fact, for peak forward curves to trade at these levels a certain number of scarcity pricing intervals are assumed. In order to achieve financial projection as they are based on the forward curve going into the year, we need to see some of these high priced intervals occur. In short, each high priced interval is not necessarily additive to financial results on a standalone basis and some of this volatility is required to achieve the expected outcome. Scarcity pricing did materialize in August in ERCOT in September of this year and Vistra's integrated model performed well. Our net length in ERCOT was able to cap the scarcity pricing in the market while also covering swings in our retail load including the incremental Crius load we acquired on July 15. Crius came to us like many other standalone retailers, under-hedged for the ERCOT summer and right in the thick of it. As a result, the Crius book was more exposed to summer volatility in 2019 than it would have been under our ownership. In fact, the scenario that materialized this summer is exactly why we prefer to be net long in ERCOT. Our incremental length is first available for risk mitigation to ensure we have the appropriate amount of generation available to cover the forward sales from our generation asset and our retail load requirements. Incremental generation is then available to capture any scarcity pricing in the market providing upside opportunity. Of course, the overwhelming majority of our generation position is used to hedge retail and much of the excess generation is hedged before we arrive at the prompt [ph] periods creating a lower risk, more stable earnings profile. We believe this is the right way to run out business, especially in a market like ERCOT that exhibits such extreme volatility in energy pricing. In fact, we expect we will see even more volatility in ERCOT in the coming summers as the market relies more heavily on intermittent and renewable assets. As a result, the types of volatility products that have historically been available for retailers are becoming more expensive and difficult to find. Given the change in composition of the generation mix in ERCOT and the expectation for increased volatility, we will likely want to go into future summers carrying at least as much length as we have historically, a topic I will discuss in more detail momentarily. Turning now to year-to-date results, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for the first nine months of the year is $2.586 billon, which is in line with management expectations that already incorporated robust summer wholesale power prices in ERCOT as I've previously discussed. With our strong performance for the first nine months of the year combined with the addition of the Crius business as of July 15, and the Ambit business which we just closed last Friday, November 1, we are both narrowing and raising the midpoint of our full year 2019 ongoing operations guidance range. We expect we will finish the year delivering adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.32 billion to $3.42 billion in the top half of our prior 2019 guidance range. In effect, our base business is generally tracking as originally projected for the year with Crius and Ambit providing EBITDA upside to our prior guidance range. We are similarly narrowing and raising our adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to the top end of our prior guidance range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Our improved outlook for adjusted free cash flow before growth is a result of the expected increase in adjusted EBITDA for the year. You will also see in the guidance table on Slide 6 a column highlighting illustrative guidance for 2019. This illustrative guidance is $40 million higher than our updated 2019 guidance range as it backs out the negative impact of ERCOT's retail backwardation we expect to realize in the year. When we talk about retail backwardation, we are referring to the near-term impact of long-dated contracts executed with retail customers supplied by our native generation. For example, if we can execute a new three-year contract with a retail customer, often the pricing under that contract is flat for the entire three-year term. Given the backwardation that exists in current ERCOT market curves, that usually means the contract is out of the money compared to the market in the earlier period of the contract, but meaningfully in the money thereafter, such that the net present value of executing the transaction is favorable. While we have historically realized some level of retail backwardation in our results, the total impact has typically been minor. However, for 2019 and 2020, we are projecting a much larger impact as a result of the greater curve backwardation entering into both years coupled with increased interest by market participants to enter into long-dated contracts in ERCOT. For 2019 we are estimating the impact of the ERCOT retail backwardation to be approximately $40 million. If we were to exclude this negative end year financial impact, our adjusted EBITDA guidance range would have increased to $3.36 billion to $3.46 billion reflecting a midpoint that would have been at the high end of our guidance range. We wanted to provide this illustrative range to give you a sense for exactly how well our integrated operations are executing in 2019. In fact we believe, excluding the adverse backwardation impact from 2019 adjusted EBITDA is the proper way to look at our 2019 results as we did not plan for the volume or the impact of long-dated contracts in our initial 2019 guidance and moreover, the future of favorable impacts from these retail transactions will be included in our prospective guidance range. Our core business demonstrated stability in a volatile summer market. And with the additions of Ambit and Crius we are expecting incremental upside to our base results. Turning now to Slide 7, we're also announcing today our guidance ranges for 2020. We have been reiterating for the past year our belief that 2020 results could be relatively flat to 2019, in part because we were confident the historical 2020 forward curves remained dislocated from fundamentals and would improve after we got past the 2019 summer, a phenomenon we have witnessed in recent years as depicted on the next slide and one we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. We have forecast summer reserve margin of 10.5%. Summer 2020 is expected to remain tight and in March of next year, the loss of load probability in ERCOT operating reserve demand curve shifts by another quarter of a standard deviation, which should further increase the probability of scarcity pricing intervals during the summer. The recent uplift in the 2020 forward curve, as well as the addition of the Crius and Ambit businesses, has raised our prior expectation of relatively flat to a projected increase of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. Specifically for 2020 we are projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.285 billion to $3.585 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth of $2.16 billion to $2.46 billion. Summer of 2019 we have provided on this slide an illustrative guidance range excluding the projected negative impacts of our ERCOT retail backwardation. For 2020 we expect these impacts to be approximately $70 million higher than what we expect to realize in 2019 partially due to the addition of Ambit, whose portfolio will also be impacted by contracts with retail backwardation in ERCOT. Excluding these impacts, our 2020 guidance midpoint will be approximately $3.5 billion, a significant increase over our expected 2019 results. In fact, many of you will recall, the five-year financial projections we've published in our joint proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the Dynegy merger announcement in the first quarter of 2018. At that time, our Board of Directors evaluated the merits of the Dynegy transaction assuming the 2020 adjusted EBITDA of the combined business would be $2.81 billion which included an estimated $350 million of value levers announced in connection with the merger. The midpoint of our 2020 guidance is more than $600 million higher than that previous estimate. In only two years we have improved that 2020 financial outlook by more than 20% with the vast majority of this improvement being driven by items entirely within our control and largely unaffected by commodity prices. Specifically, approximately $425 million of the improvement in adjusted EBITDA is attributable to the hard work our teams have done to increase the expected merger value levers by nearly 70% while also adding incremental EBITDA through growth investments. Two years ago, when we announced the Dynegy merger, the market was concerned about the long-term viability of this business, pointing to a $200 million decline in capacity revenues that would materialized in 2020. The 2020 guidance we are providing today is just one example of the resiliency of this business model. Our teams continue to identify efficiencies to maximize the value of our operations and we've been successful at identifying tuck-in growth opportunities that are both EBITDA and free cash flow accretive with very attractive returns while requiring modest levels of our free cash flow to pursue. We are confident that this business model will continue to create value for our stakeholders, a topic we will discuss in more detail shortly. And I must say, in our view, this stock price does not reflect the resiliency, stability and level of EBITDA and free cash flow of this business. A final note on this slide, you might notice that these guidance ranges are slightly wider than our prior guidance ranges, reflecting bands of a $150 million as compared to our prior bands of $100 million. We believe our guidance range based on a percentage of EBITDA is most appropriate and a range of plus or minus approximately 5% is reasonable and in line with peers. We believe a wider guidance range also better reflects the potential range of outcomes for our business, particularly, in ERCOT, with its tight reserve margins and increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources. This market dynamic is increasing the volatility in ERCOT as well as the potential to capture value if managed properly with the right assets. In fact, it is now more important than ever that we have length on the days where there is volatility in the market, especially when taking into consideration the size of the load reserve. As a result, we might find it prudent to carry more length into December 2020 and beyond than we have in years past. Given this past summer and the likely influx of more intermittent resources, the cost of managing risk in ERCOT has gone up especially for short retailers. While the range of potential outcomes may be wider for us in ERCOT, we are well positioned to take advantage of the increased volatility given our high quality long asset position, integrated business and commercial capabilities. Furthermore, as I will discuss in connection with our 10-year outlook, our fundamental analysis continues to forecast a high probability of scarcity events occurring in ERCOT in future years. The ERCOT market is changing. Increasing intermittent resources will inevitably increase the appropriate level on reserve margins. A cost to run the power system with significant intermittent renewable that is yet to be fully understood and recognized by stakeholders. This increased volatility suits our integrated business position and capabilities quite well. So we remain bullish on the ERCOT market and are building to capitalize on opportunities likely to arise in the future. Turning now to our thoughts on 2021, though actually we still believe 2021 adjusted EBITDA could be relatively flat to or higher than 2019 and 2020. If you take a view based solely on the forward curves, 2021 adjusted EBITDA would look slightly down compared to prior years. However, as we have discussed, and as we depict on the next slide forward curves that are more than a year out tend to understate the tight supply and demand dynamic and increase likelihood of volatility in ERCOT in particular. The graph on Slide 8 is a helpful visual of this phenomenon, where there was a significant uplift in forward pricing in 2018, 2019, and 2020 as each delivery year approached. This uplift was especially prominent for 2019 and 2020, appropriately reflecting updated scarcity pricing expectations including the modifications to the ORDC and the tight market conditions. As you know, we develop our own point of view of where we believe forward pricing is likely to materialize based on rigorous analysis of market fundamentals. As it did for 2020, our point of view for 2021 would suggest that current market curves are not representative likely pricing outcomes. As a result, when looking forward to 2021, in the context of our internal point of view, we believe 2021 adjusted EBITDA would exceed 2019 and 2020 results. Recognizing that there are a range of potential outcomes for 2021, we are comfortable given our fundamental analysis that 2021 has a very good chance of being relatively flat to 2020 if not higher. A relatively flat outcome would reflect a nearly $700 million improvement in the adjusted EBITDA that was forecast for the business at the time we announced the Dynegy merger two years ago. The outlook for our business continues to improve and we remain believers in our business model. Turning now to Slide 9, I'm excited to announce today that we have identified $50 million of incremental EBITDA enhancement opportunities from our ongoing Operations Performance Initiative under the leadership of Jim Burke. Our teams on the ground know that in order to remain viable as the generation landscape evolves, we must ensure our assets are operating at the highest levels of efficiency and at the lowest cost while first and foremost prioritizing safety. The OP process is critical to our success in this regard and it continues to deliver results. Incrementally, within the fleet rationalization bucket of our OP process we have also improved our financial forecast with the retirements of four coal plants in downstate Illinois. As you know, this year it was required to retire 2000 megawatts of nameplate capacity in MISO zone IV in connection with an amendment to the Multi-Pollutant Standard which was finalized this summer. Three of the plants, Coffeen, Havana and Hennepin were retired effective November 1. The fourth plant Duck Creek, is scheduled to retire on December 15, of this year. As a result of these retirements, Vistra has improved its 2021 adjusted EBITDA forecast by an incremental $100 million which is net of the previously identified OP opportunity at these sites. Taken together, these updates improve our OP target to a total of $425 million per year, up from the $125 million we announced in connection with the Dynegy merger. Including synergies in OP the EBITDA value level of target we have identified from the Dynegy merger have increased from $350 million annually to $750 million which includes $290 million of traditional merger synergies, $345 million of OP value leverage identified, and a net $100 million of EBITDA improvement in 2021 from the retirement of the four MISO plants. It has been two years since we first announced the acquisition of Dynegy and the financial benefits of the transaction continued to improve. Financial synergies however, were not the sole reason we made a decision to acquire Dynegy. Another important factor was the opportunity to transition Vistra's generation fleet from one that was heavily weighted toward coal to one that is now approximately 64% natural gas by capacity. We believe we are relatively young, low heat rate generation fleet will be able to create value for our stakeholders over the next decade and beyond which leads me to the discussion of our 10-year fundamental outlook. Before I get into the discussion, I would like to explain why we believe it is essential for us to present a longer-term view of our company and the key power markets where we operate. First, at a minimum, we believe it is important to frame the potential impact of our recently announced greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets on the business. Furthermore, we believe it is imperative to our company's valuation that we explain the long-term prospects for the business, even our perspective on technological and climate change impacts on the sector. Simply put, there is a terminal value question for energy companies and we believe it is necessary to address it head on. The good news is that the power sector stands to grow over time as a result of electrification across all sectors of the economy in response to climate change and we are well positioned. Slide 11 summarizes our 10-year view. As most of you are aware last week Vistra announced for the first time our long term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets which include to achieve a more than 50% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions by 2030 compared to a 2010 baseline. Notably, Vistra has already retired or announced plans to retire 14 coal plants and 3 gas plants since 2010 resulting in a reduction of CO2 equivalent emission of approximately 42%. As a result, in reflecting marginal profitability at some of our coal units in particular, we expect we can achieve our 2030 emissions reduction target to an incremental retirement actions representing only 2.5% of our projected 2020 adjusted EBITDA. While any such retirements will advance our progress toward our long term emissions reductions target our fundamental analysis would suggest that future retirements of this magnitude will be warranted based on economics alone. In fact, we estimate generation assets representing approximately 5% to 8% of our projected 2020 adjusted EBITDA could be at risk of retirement in the next decade, predominantly from new build and particularly renewable and expected infrastructure [ph] expenditures. Importantly, this small percentage of our total EBITDA can be replaced on relatively minor growth investments over the same time period. At Vistra's targeted return levels we could replace 2.5% EBITDA reduction projected to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target with less than $500 million of investment. The incremental at risk EBITDA would require only $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment. To put this side of investment into perspective, we have already more than replaced the equivalent of the EBITDA risk through our recent retail and battery investment, not to mention our incremental EBITDA improvement initiatives such as OP.  In addition, this level of investment represents only about 2.5% to 7.5% of our anticipated free cash flow over the next 10 years assuming we generate $2 billion of free cash flow each year on average. The bulk of business current adjusted EBITDA is derived from its relatively young, low cost, highly flexibility gas fuel generation fleet with two of the lowest cost nuclear and coal plants in the country in Comanche Peak and Moss Landing. We believe these assets are well positioned for success in markets with increasing reliance on intermittent [ph] resources, in particular, we expect our flexible natural gas assets will run more and remain critical to the reliability of the regional power markets in which we operate. We are seeing this phenomenon play out in California now as a percentage of solar assets in the state increases. For example, resource adequacy contracts for gas assets in California are being transacted at $7 to $7.50 per KW a month right now, which as a frame of reference is almost double the revenues awarded in ISO New England's latest capacity auction. We also saw this play out in ERCOT during the summer peak as our gas fuelled peaking and steamer assets played a key role on low wind days. Our fleet, which is approximately 64% natural gas by capacity is well positioned to capture value and support market reliability as renewables are built out across the U.S. Similarly, we believe our retail business will remain a stable and growing contributor of our performance over the next decade and we project fundamentals in both ERCOT and PJM our core markets will remain strong. Turning to Slide 12. Let's start our fundamentals discussion with ERCOT. Getting right to the punch line, our fundamental analysis projects that ERCOT prices are likely to remain in the mid '30s or higher per megawatt hour through 2030 with scarcity pricing events remaining consistent feature in the market over this time period. In reaching this conclusion, our team factored in an estimated 1.5% to 2% annual loan growth through 2030, and the scenarios that we evaluated included the addition of up to 50 gigawatts of new renewable assets including approximately six gigawatt of battery storage with no sustained transmission capacity constraints, although we do expect there will be price differential zone. We similarly modeled potential retirements in the market based on economic factors or plant obsolescence assuming only 3.5 gigawatt of retirements over the next decade. While we believe our analysis is conservative if it proves to be too bullish, we believe there are more than 15 gigawatts of generation in ERCOT supply stack potentially at risk of retirement which should further mitigate any downside scenarios. In arriving at our conclusion on expected market price outcomes, we ran a bottoms up, hour by hour simulation model with explicit assumptions around new build, retired and low growth and we calibrated our model relative to ERCOT's history. What market observers perhaps do not appreciate is how markets will evolve with the rising intermittency from increased reliance on renewable assets. The greater the percentage of renewable assets in the market, the higher the levels of volatility, we expect to see. This is true, even if the market has increasing reserve margins as the expansion of reserve margins is driven by renewable assets, which tend to rise and fall together. Renewable penetration effectively lowers the overall median price observed in a year as renewable assets with a zero marginal cost shipped to generation stack further to the right. However, and most important, the higher percentage of renewables in the market will significantly increase the probability of scarcity events in pricing volatility, resulting in a significantly higher average annual price relative to the median price. If you think about it, renewable assets of a lifetime in the same geographic area will generally be available or offline as a class. In many instances the renewable assets will not be able to capture price back because in large part, they will be the cause of the scarcity event during the correlated nature of their failure to perform. For example, all solar will be offline at 9:00 PM and all wind drops when front stall over a geographic area. And increasingly important metric to pay attention to in ERCOT will be net load defined as load less renewable, as that is ultimately what the ISO has to manage on a delivered basis. Net loan peaks rather than overall demand peaks are expected to be more highly correlated with scarcity events in the future. This was the case in ERCOT this August when price by us were driven primarily by lower availability of wind generation on days with strong, though not extreme demand as we depict on the next slide. Slide 13 shows that on August 15 of this year, power prices in ERCOT spiked to the market cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour. However, peak load was less than 71,000 megawatts, approximately 5% lower than ERCOT's 2019 peak summer demand. The real driver for the price hike was the low level of wind output, which was approximately 2,500 megawatts or less than 15% of nameplate capacity during the intervals at the cap, compared to an average output of 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts per peak summer wind. Renewable resources by definition are unpredictable, with renewable assets forecast to make up a greater percentage of the ERCOT supply base over the next decade, market participants should expect sustained volatility, as well as increased reliance on flexible and efficient natural gas assets of which we have many. Ensure renewable penetration in ERCOT should not meaningfully depress market pricing, rather our fundamental analysis which suggests average market price will remain stable to rising over the next decade. Our ERCOT fleet which is comprised of low cost base fuel of coal, solar and nuclear assets, highly flexible and low heat rate CCGTs and gas peaking and steam units is well positioned to capture value as the market evolves. Before we leave ERCOT and move on to PJM, let's turn to Slide 14 where we back half 2019 actuals to prior years in order to further demonstrate our view that 2019 is representative of ERCOT's new normal. As you can see in the chart on the top half of the slide, despite the scarcity pricing we observed in August and September of this year, 2019 was not an outlier of extreme temperature days in Texas. As I just discussed, the scarcity pricing was driven more by a combination of strong load and low renewables, a phenomenon we can expect to see more of in ERCOT over the next decade, particularly as a greater percentage of the supply base is comprised of renewable assets. The bottom half of Slide 14 shows the result of recasting 2011 through 2019, based on our fundamental point of view of the 2020 supply stack. The results reinforce our expectation of persistent scarcity events going forward. For example, 2018 modeling to 2020 supply stack, we would have expected to see 14 hours in north of pricing above $1000 per megawatt hour compared to the poor hours, we actually observe in the year. This back cast highlights that a small number of incremental renewable assets in the supply stack can have a noticeable difference in pricing outcomes. Last, let's not forget that beginning in March of next year, ORDC pricing will kick in even earlier than it did in 2019, further increasing the probability of scarcity pricing outcomes. We remain steadfast in our view, that the long-term forward power curves do not reflect the underlying fundamentals of the ERCOT market. As we have discussed in the past, the backwardation of the forward curves were not reflective of fundamentals so exert a certain level of discipline on the market, especially related to merchant thermal new build. It will also impact future renewable development as we reach a saturation point for renewable PPAs. Let's not forget that merchant investments require the ability to hedge five to seven years out to secure capital. In addition, the market must support sufficient revenues to justify merchant investments. There are some that believe around the clock pricing in ERCOT will decline to a sustained low 20s per megawatt hour. But this ignores the likelihood of incremental retirement at those price levels as well as the need to have long-term pricing that supports adequate returns for the lowest cost merchant investment, likely renewables. In fact, this low price draconian view is neither supported by any reasonable analysis, nor can it sustain the market in the long run. Our analysis indicates that the current market rules in ERCOT can and will provide adequate revenues, but they will be more volatile and less predictable. We will see if this market construct will support the level of investment, especially merchants that will be needed to maintain a minimally acceptable reserve margin as we have assumed in our fundamental analysis. We believe our existing ERCOT generation fleet, with assets that are low cost, flexible, and well positioned on the supply stack, will remain valid and critical to ensuring a reliable cost effective risk. Turning now to PJM, I am on Slide 15. Unlike ERCOT, PJM has delivered relatively stable energy and capacity revenues over the last several years. From 2010 to 2018, the average PJM CCGT earned approximately $9 to $12 per KW month from the combination of capacity and energy. In fact, capacity and energy revenues has historically moved in opposite directions, resulting in a relatively stable earnings profile in total, and over time. The graphs we depict on Slide 15 demonstrate this phenomenon. For example, in 2016, you can see that gross capacity prices for RTO [ph] zone were offset by on peak spark spreads that were at a four-year high. Similarly, in 2017, on peak spark spreads in EMAAC were relatively low when capacity prices in the zone were at a peak in the second half of the year. We have seen this dynamic play out in PJM over the years and in a similar fashion, our fundamental analysis results in expectations of flat to gradually rising overall energy and capacity pricing through 2030. Our fundamental analysis is driven by the expectation of gradually tightening reserve margins, the possibility of slightly rising natural gas prices, and prospects were ongoing retirement of older, less efficient coal, oil and gas steam units. We also assume that the results in the capacity market will not change materially from recent clears with expected highs and lows. While we expect renewables will be added to the supply stack over the next decade, PJM is the least favorable market for renewables with largely low onshore wind intensity and low sun irradiance. As a result, we expect renewable development will be driven by state RPS [ph] standards rather than economics. As reflected by the consistent band and the historical returns in PJM with over 180,000 megawatts of installed capacity, it is difficult for either incremental new supply or retirements to meaningfully move the market in one direction or the other. Just as we have seen in recent periods, we expect total revenues to vary year-to-year, though it will remain consistent with historical levels overall. As it relates to Vistra specifically, we believe our large fleet of efficient CCGT units and PJM will continue to generate a significant amount of EBITDA for our consolidated operations as they collect significant revenue streams from both capacity and energy markets. However, our PJM coal units could be at risk of retirement, just as other high costs coal, oil and gas units will be over the next decade. We have factored any potential future retirements into our EBITDA at risk analysis, which takes us to our last slide on our 10-year fundamental outlook. Slide 16, our analysis supports our view that Vistra can generate relatively stable to growing EBITDA in a wide range of scenarios, including generating approximately $2 billion per year on average of adjusted free cash flow before growth to either return to shareholders or to invest in growth opportunities. If we invest on average $500 million a year on growth opportunities, roughly a quarter of our projected adjusted free cash flow on an annual basis and achieve our targeted returns, we could deliver an incremental $90 million to $100 million dollars a year of EBITDA. Our track record today with the acquisition of the Odessa CCGT plant in West Texas, the development of the Upton 2 [indiscernible] solar and battery project and the acquisition of Crius and Ambit on the retail side has demonstrated that we can be successful in finding high return tuck-in growth opportunities on a regular basis. In fact, those projects have exceeded or expected to exceed our targeted return levels. Continuing this history of executing on opportunistic growth projects, likely in retail, renewables and battery storage, would not only require only a small portion of our overall anticipated cash flows, but it is expected to result in a growing business that would more than offset the impact of potential plant retirements over the next decade. In fact, even after allocating capital to growth projects and paying in annual dividends, district could still have a significant amount of cash available to return to shareholders. We expect we'll have meaningful cash to deploy beginning in 2021 after we achieve our long-term leverage target. As we always mentioned with any discussion of growth, if we do not find opportunities to invest at attractive returns, we will return capital to shareholders. This is always our litmus test. In summary, our assessment of the 10-year prospect for our business reinforces confidence that our business model is resilient and compelling, taking advantage of the way we have positioned our company as a low cost, low leverage integrated business within the money assets and attractive markets. We have covered a lot today. I hope that it has been a worthwhile discussion for you and I hope you walk away from this call with a better understanding of a few key points. First, renewable penetration is not an insurmountable threat to our business, rather a higher percentage of renewables in the market will merely change the distribution of price outcomes, placing more importance on unit performance during high priced intervals, and increasing the reliance of efficient CCGT assets and peaking units of which we have many. And we will have the opportunity to invest in the technological changes impacting our business, but in a disciplined manner. Second, well, certain of our units specifically our coal plants in MISO and PJM could be at risk of retirement over the next decade. These assets are not meaningful contributors of EBITDA today. Our modeling suggests that given the favorable position of our generation assets on the supply stacks in the markets where they operate, only 2.5% of our estimated 2020 adjusted EBITDA will be lost in order to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. And a modest 5% to 8% could be at risk through 2030, from new build penetration and environmental expenditures. The assets that are most exposed to a higher penetration of renewables are the older, high heat rate assets, of which we own very few. And third, we expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. Using only a small percentage of this free cash flow, we can make attractive growth investments to not only offset any EBITDA loss from future asset retirement, but to grow our business. With our strong free cash flow and market leading position in the core competitive electric markets in the U.S., we can participate in the evolving power markets where it makes sense, while also returning capital to shareholders. We do not believe our business is a melting ice cube. Rather, through cost management and efficiencies, financial discipline and execution, we believe we can continue to create value for our shareholders over the long-term. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued, and the math tells us that the market must be discounting our future value. We believe this analysis is one piece of compelling evidence, suggesting that we can produce strong results on a consistent basis over a long period of time, and we have demonstrated our ability to execute. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.
David Campbell: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 18, this year delivered third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1,064 million which as Curt mentioned is in line with our expectations. Our third quarter results were $89 million lower than the same period in 2018. The quarter-over-quarter decline was driven by lower prices and volumes in our Midwest and Northeast segments. Lower retail gross margin in 2019 was offset by higher prices and margins in our top wholesale segment. As you know, we're expecting negative adjusted EBITDA on our retail segments for the quarter, given the stream peak in August 2019 heat waves observed in the market at the time we were procuring power for the year, which drove up our third quarter cost of goods sold. As we discussed in our second quarter call, we shaped the cost of goods sold for our retail business with the actual power curves rather than straight lining these costs over the year. The retail backwardation that Curt mentioned earlier was concentrated in the third quarter. The negative $40 million impact has already been fully recognized in retail year-to-date results. In fact, the negative impact in the third quarter is a little higher than $60 million, with some reversal occurring by year end. As you may recall, we realized higher retail gross margin in the first and second quarters of 2019, as compared to their respective quarters in 2018. We expect similar results in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations is $2,586 million, which is also in line with Management's expectations for the period. The next two slides set forth our 2019 and 2020 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance ranges. Given that Curt already covered our guidance announcements, I won't spend much time on these pages, but I do want to mention the updates to our Asset Closure segment guidance for 2019. You will see that our guidance ranges for the Asset Closure segment now assume a more negative impact as compared to our prior 2019 guidance. Primary driver experienced is the transfer of the four MISO plants retiring in the fourth quarter as a closure. This impact flows through the Asset Closure segment projections in the 10-year update we have provided on Slide 28 in the Appendix. It is important to remember that projected Asset Closure expenditures have already been accounted for in the asset retirement obligation on our balance sheet. Retirement of the assets merely buckets the anticipated cash flows in the Asset Closure segments as opposed to our ongoing operations. Let's turn now to Slide 21 for an update on our capital allocation plan. As of October 31, we've executed $1.415 billion of our $1.75 billion share repurchase program, leaving approximately $335 million of capital remaining for future share repurchases. You'll notice that the pace of our repurchasing slowed in the third quarter, which was a direct reflection of the improvement in our stock price during the period. With respect to $335 million that is outstanding under the program, we'll continue to be flexible. At the present time, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. We are focused as a Company on reducing our leverage in the range of our targeted levels, which will support an upgrade to our debt readings and keep us on the path to investment grade. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate your purchasing shares or investing in promising growth opportunities, especially those that have minimal impact on our leverage. Our dividend is continuing as expected. We announced last week that our Board approved the next quarterly dividend of $12.05 per share or $0.50 per share on an annual basis, which will be paid on December 30th, to shareholders of record on December 16th. Following review and approval by our Board, we plan to announce the annual increase to our dividend on the fourth quarter earnings call in February 2020. Management still anticipates the dividend will grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8%. Lastly, paying down our debt remains a key capital allocation priority for Vistra and we are continuing to track toward our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. We believe achieving our long-term leverage target will further reduce the risk profile of our business, for opportunistic growth investments, and enhance our long-term equity value by increasing the value of the company available to shareholders and appropriately reducing the risk premium implied in our current free cash flow yield. We continue to expect that we will have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond supporting a growing dividend, future growth investments and meaningful excess free cash flow to return to shareholders, including repurchasing our stock when appropriate. We expect to discuss this more as we progress through 2020. One final comment before we open up the line for questions. We have made a few changes to our hedge disclosures this quarter. The new disclosures can be found on Slides 30 and 31 in the appendix. Updates include the addition of power price sensitivities as well as the breakout of the hedge value that is embedded in our total realized price. We continue to try and improve our disclosures to make them more user friendly and we hope that you will find this new format helpful. In closing, we remain confident that our business has the necessary elements to thrive now and through the long-term. The strong performance of our integrated operations during the third quarter reinforces our view that our business can generate stable EBITDA and free cash flow in a variety of market environments. Our fundamental analysis supports that the core markets in which we operate, will remain attractive over the next decade and we believe our relatively young and efficient generation fleet comprised primarily of lower heat rate, flexible gas assets will be critical to fulfilling the nation's electricity needs as the country transitions to lower carbon technologies. Our projected strong free cash flow generation will ensure that we can participate in this transition where economics are supportive of investment. We are excited for the future and we hope you are as well. With that operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Shar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just two quick questions, first could we get a little bit more color around the future investment, kind of about, that might arise over the next decade? I mean the annual investment of $500 million per year is sort of a big part of the growth story there?
Curtis Morgan: Yes so, I think what we mentioned in the script may not been that prominent, but I think we still view more near term that retail opportunities are the biggest opportunity, I mean you guys can see that the value that we bring and I'd say in our view, probably brings to the table given our capabilities and less in particular, given our long position and we can take out not only just sort of the back office and any other types of costs, but we can manage the commodity price risk exposure better and then there is just inherent in that difference there is a much lower multiple for retail, so we see some real value. I think they're going to be smaller in nature though going forward Shar. I don't think there are many larger, and when I say larger more on the Crius type Ambit size deals out there, but there is other ideas out there that we will likely pursue. I do believe that we will participate at the right point in time in renewables and battery storage. As you know, we have some real opportunities out in California to continue to build out our battery build at both Moss Landing site and our open site. I think we'll probably do some investment in that. We have a good pipeline of opportunities on the development side, not only in Texas, but also in few other states where we have sites from some of our existing assets that will become available. All that is going to be driven heavily by economics. And I think you guys know there is a lot of capital right now flooding into green investments by people who really don't have any business owning a wind project or a solar project, but they want to wave the green flag. And I think that is – the returns that we're seeing on that are pretty low. I do believe that it is sort of like the CCGT build out in the early 2000s that there is going to be opportunities after the fact for us to take a look at it. And so I think when you think about the 10-year period that you mentioned sort of early on it's more of a retail focus. I think it will be more sort of early on, it's more of a retail focus. I think it will be more on an intermediate period of time there is going to be some opportunities around renewables and batteries. And I'd also say that there may be a few little tuck-in opportunities inside of ERCOT on the solar front. We've got - like I said, we've got a pretty big pipeline, got a lot of acreage, and it's some really good acreage, but we have to be very selective around that to some extent that will also be in support of our growing ERCOT retail business now that we've got the Ambit brand in here. So, there may be some opportunity to do a project or two around that. But I think that's really where the growth is going to come from. And I think we're just going to have to be patient and incredibly disciplined. It's going to come, in my view, in a lumpy nature or so despite $100 million a year is probably, I mean it's a great modeling exercise, but it's probably not exactly how it's going to happen.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly Curt, I mean obviously the plan you presented today should provide a lot of comfort with the agencies, right? Cash flows are sustainable, the EBITDA can actually grow, the balance sheet is healthy. You're definitely building a solid natural hedge with the retail business. You've talked sort of in the past around your ratings in sort of a two phases, right. First BB+, second investment grade. Can we maybe just get a little bit of a status on how the dialogue is going with the agencies? Your sense on timing first around the notch improvement and then second investment grade, especially in light of how you're presenting your plan today? That’s it. Thanks.
Curtis Morgan: Yes, so you know, we're going to go and - I think we're going to go in and talk to the agencies because we're updating, obviously we have a 10-year view, but we're also finishing up and taking to our Board in early December our updated long range plan, which is our - it's generally a five-year view and then we need to sit down with the agencies on that. Moody's for example has asked for some of that information because I think they were going to go to committee. I think they're going to talk about not only us, but maybe others in terms of upgrading. We've been on positive watch with them for some time. So, we think that in the next quarter or so, we should be in a pretty good position hopefully with all the agencies, especially with what we're presenting today to potentially get an upgrade to that equivalent of BB+. On the investment grade front, that may be a little lumpier and may - and probably, you know, from that point where we would get upgraded probably a year beyond that and before we get there, I think with Fitch and Moody's, the metrics were pretty well 2.5 times. And with S&P, because of the way they look at certain things, at the 2.5 times we're not necessarily exactly there on the metrics, but with a business rating improvement, which we believe that we're squarely in line to get, that would put us in the investment grade range. So I think what we're really looking at is sort of first quarter, 2020, we're hoping are in that range of getting an upgrade across the agencies to that BB+ range. And then we're looking at a year to maybe a year and a half beyond that to get to investment grade with all three of the agencies. But I think that might be a little lumpy or just given the way the metrics were. So, we're going to keep doing what we're doing because I think the more we execute, the more we continue to perform the way that we say and that this business model becomes more and more apparent to people just how strong it is. And then also, you know, the quality of our assets, the quality of our retail business, you know, that's going to be really helpful with all the agencies, because I think what really, is the bigger hang up is, is this real? Are people that, are they going to be disciplined and does this business model work? And I think, so that's probably a bigger thing if anything, and I think that takes a little bit of time. But we feel like we're in line for this next upgrade in the near future and then we're going to obviously continue to execute and we think we've put ourselves in a good place for investment grade rating.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Congrats Curt on this execution. It is terrific.
Curtis Morgan: All right, thank you, Shahr.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning and congrats on a very constructive and thorough update.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, thanks David. Good to hear from you.
Stephen Byrd: I just wanted to touch on your point you raised about solar in ERCOT. You gave a lot of good color around that. I guess if you run a very simple sort of solar and LCOE model, you could see that maybe solar could work in a $30 plus market, but the point about practical limits on the growth of solar, I think it was a pretty important one we're often asked about. Could you just add a little bit more in terms of the volumes that you see that's realistic in terms of actually getting a hedge, getting financing, et cetera; or any color around that would be really helpful?
Curtis Morgan: That is a good question. So one of the things we've been trying to get our arms around, I think you guys know this, but the renewables that have been built in ERCOT, and frankly, pretty much everywhere have been PPA supported. And as the large players have come in and allowed - basically used their balance sheet to do PPA's and that does allow, obviously, to get financing and take lower returns, right? Especially to get investment grade counterparty on the other end. But there is a saturation point where you start getting into smaller companies who don't want to own a wind project or a solar project. And at some point time in ERCOT, given the size of at least that 50-gigawatts of renewables coming into this market, I mean that's more than half of the current nameplate capacity of the market. Someone has to going to end up being merchant. I think the big question in ERCOT, being an all energy market, as you add more intermittent resources and during the periods between when you actually see volatility and high pricing; prices are going to be lower, because you've got intermittent resources with zero marginal cost. And so the question is, is there going to be enough revenue and enough frequency of that revenue to support merchant build? And I don't care what kind of merchant build it is. It can be renewables or it can be combined cycle plants. Now a combined cycle plants are way out of the money. Renewables that we see when you run the numbers, if you can get proper leverage on them, can get these levered returns currently. And I expect that we'll continue to see some cost decline in that. But once you get into the merchant side of things, because no one's really built a merchant solar plant yet in ERCOT, but once you start to do that, and all energy market with a backwardation of the forward curves, as stupid it is, it's tough to get the financing that you need. And then you've got to get someone to come in and put in the equity dollars. And the problem with that if it's just a single asset owner situation, it's going to be a little white knuckle time between when you're actually getting lower, in the off peak periods, lower megawatt an hour pricing, and then you have to wait for a good summer to come in. Someone like us can do it, because we can - we've got a balance sheet and we can basically stand in between cycles. But someone who's a single asset owner with leverage on top of it, it's going to be a real tough day. That's my biggest question is what's going to happen with ERCOT market as you get more zero marginal costs, assets setting price for most of the hours, and you see a much more volatile business, can you get the kind of development that's going to be necessary? Because I don't believe you can build this 50 gigs or so out with all PPA's. I just don't think the market has that kind of depth. So that'll be an interesting thing. My sense of it is, if we don't, there's going to be further changes to the market, whether it's an increase in the ORDC, or even maybe some changes of ancillary services to get more revenues in the market to make sure that there's enough revenues. I mean, I just don't see ERCOT going to a capacity market. And when you think about outside of ERCOT, you do have capacity markets which can get additional revenues. And I think you hear Gordon [ph] and Willie (ph) say that's an ice in New England, because he's worried about the revenue stream from energy because of offshore wind coming in. But he still dispatchable resources, mainly the gas resources in New England. And there's nothing new getting built, because you can't get a gas pipeline up there. So he wants to keep those around. So he knows he's going to have to get revenues stream into the capacity market, because that's the way to basically keep assets around and hopefully, get some new build. So, I mean, that's kind of how we see this playing out. I mean, it's going to be real interesting. Obviously, we have a big seat at the table, so we'll be a part of that discussion. But that's sort of how we see it.
Stephen Byrd: That's really helpful. I'll let others ask questions. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning. Good update. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan : Hey, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Just to be clear, you assume 50 gigawatts of new nameplate renewables in the Texas market. I think that that – just that number alone will really cause people a lot of heartburn even if you're modeling that you can still generate stable cash flows out of that. But just to be clear, if that's your aggressive case scenario, you don't necessarily believe that that's where we're going to end up in 2013 given the constraints you just articulated?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, I think what we try to do Greg – this is a conservative view of the market. We didn't want to come out with something that looked very self-serving. And I just mentioned this, and I'll say it again I'm not sure how this actually plays out. I mean you can model things and we sort of force function some of this new build to happen. Whether that can really happen or not on a merchant basis I have a lot of questions about that, and if that doesn't happen, you're still going to see increased volatility and higher pricing, it's just going to be higher pricing then what we've assumed here. And so I - we don't really know I mean this is a modeling exercise we wanted to be somewhat conservative on it, but there is a lot of leap of faith in this, that at some point when the PPA market grows up, there's only so much depth to that. If somebody is going to have to come in here and build on a merchant basis and that's tough in an all-energy market. And I don't see people like us or NRG or Exelon are others who have the ability to do it on balance sheet, we've all seen what can happen in ERCOT if you overbuild the market. So I just don't see that happening. And then of course we mentioned in the script and I've said this before, there is still 15 plus thousand megawatts of higher heat rate oil and gas and coal units that if we did somehow overbuild, which I just don't see happening would come out of the stack. So that's why we're bullish on this ERCOT market even in what we would consider a very conservative case that we put forward here.
Greg Gordon: Great but my second question is – you're obviously bullish on the fundamental value of the company and to some degree the arguments around the investment thesis in merchant power. Are this basically the durability of cash flow argument with the melting ice cube argument, which you're attacking head on. But to the extent that you really believe you're going to generate free cash flow after growth investments that, over the next 10 years, that's greater than your current market cap. And why aren't you plowing further ahead, more aggressively with the buybacks in the short to medium term. And I don't know I understand but the very short-term answer is you want to get to investment grade, but to the extent you're confident that these cash flows are going to show up. We're basically looking at another 300 some odd million of buyback in the short to medium term and then a pause in 2020 while you sort of done the engine to get e debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times. Right so how do you balance with investors who were saying, well, if you're so excited about the future. Why aren’t you being more aggressive with the buyback?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, I mean that's a good question. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike here. Look Greg there is no magic formula here and I think it's our judgment that the equity value of this company does better with a stronger balance sheet than not. And – there is also a credibility and commitment thing and we're not just committing to equity here. We're also committing to people who own our bonds and we're trying to satisfy an entire capital structure here at the end of the day. But I think I watch Calpine do this and I know we're not where they were, but I watched them do a bunch of share buybacks and the market never believed their fundamental story and their stock continue to decline as they bought back shares. And I think that was just the risk premium that the market required because of the concern financial distress of the business and the business model. And so, I said when I first got here that we need to run this thing at a debt level that would put us in line to potentially be investment grade and that's what we're going to do. Look, I understand that when you have debt that's even at 7.5% and you're trading at a free cash flow yield of 15 the math I get I just think that at some point we have to focus on getting our debt down, and I think this is really a one-year issue. And then on the back end of 2020, I think what you'll hear from us, is a discussion about what we're going to do in 2021. And depending on where our stock is trading at that point in time, I would not be shocked that the board would want to do some sort of a strong buyback program, but I think what we are trying to tell you guys right now is that we do believe that following through on our commitment to get in that range of 2.5 times is important for our company. And we did outline it and I think that David said it in his comments. I think there's a lot of reasons why the equity should be supportive of us doing that. But it's a balance in, you can make the argument that you've made here and others, but I think this is sort of what we believe is the right balance right now.
Greg Gordon: No, I actually completely agree with you. I just wanted to hear you articulate it. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Michael Weinstein: Hi. Good morning guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey Michael, how are you?
Michael Weinstein: Hey, all right. Pretty good. Just to follow up on the same line of questions, I guess once you get an investment grade credit rating and you're assuming that does improve valuation on the equity side as well, you've got really good cash flow and you know, from your own profile, so there's sort of a limited amount of investment going forward. Retail acquisitions will be smaller. I'm just wondering where, what would you do with a better balance sheet and better valuations and better reception from investors at that point? Where does the company go? What can you do more that you can't do with the current cash flow profile?
Curtis Morgan: Hi. I think we sort of outlined what we think is sort of the track of this thing. And I wish I had a better sense of timing of it, but we still believe in the generation side of the business. We think it's still fundamentally important. We're not going to a retail only model and a short model. And so I would expect us to put some investment predominantly on the renewable side because that's going to be the workhorse. But the other thing I will say that we haven't said a lot about, but it's also part of this modeling thing was good for us too to understand kind of what's going on. But there could be some small investment in what I refer to as volatility assets where either assets that actually can be around during the peak periods and they're very cheap type assets, now whether that's batteries or whether that's a gas fired peak or something like that we would look at it, but that's small potatoes. I mean, I think the real thing here is that you'll see our company invest in generation in the future as we retire generation. And by the way, that retirement of this generation is going to be needed anyway. Most of these coal plants we're talking about are going on 60 plus years old. They're becoming obsolete and they're not economic. And I think any business that is a capital intensive business, whether it's airlines, or chemicals, or refining or whatever, have to replace, you know, their hardware at some point in time. The question is going to be, what kind of hardware are we going to replace it with? I think it's going to be renewables and more important than that it's going to be when do you do it? And right now I just don't - there's so much money going into this that I think, this was not the place. I think retail is a better place for us to invest at this point in time. And we'll see where the cycle goes. But I think that at some point in time though, there are going to be opportunities for us, whether that's PPAs to come off of the renewables and you know, they become merchant and we have the capability to run them and see more value than somebody else, I really don't know how that's all going to play out, but I do expect us to have a greater share of our business in renewables over the next 10 years. Now whether we could spend that, what roughly $5 billion, we're talking about $500 million a year, over 10 years. I don't know. If we don't, then we're going to return capital to shareholders and that's just the way it's going to be and we still generate a heck of a lot of cash. I think what this thing shows you this 10-year deal, which we think is very conservative then if we don’t put a dime back into the business, we're only losing 2.5% and maybe on every 6.5% of EBITDA, which means we're still generating a boatload of cash. And so this is still a really vibrant business even if you don't reinvest in it. So we don't feel like we have a gun in our head to actually go out and spend money and we're not going to do that. But I think the good news is that our company, if we've got the scale and the capabilities, I think we've proven that we can buy things and we can extract value that others cannot. And I think we're going to get that opportunity around renewables. It's just a question of when.
Michael Weinstein: That makes sense. We cover the renewable industry, and a lot of the retailers, the distributed renewable, distributed rooftop solar players are growing at 15% a year sales. Do you see yourself maybe evolving into a retailer, perhaps let's say, for example, centralized renewable energy, or perhaps maybe even a distributed power retailer to compete against these rooftop players at some point?
Curtis Morgan: I think there is something that we will consider and have considered and continue to consider. I mean, absolutely, I think that is an area for our company that we will, and have taken a look there.
Michael Weinstein: Okay, thanks a lot.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much. Hi guys and I really appreciate the update.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Praful, thank you.
Praful Mehta: Hi Curt. So maybe just on all the investment that you've talked about over the next 10-years, what I find is, in your position, having both the retail and generation, you have the opportunity to step in and buy assets, rather than grow them organically. I wanted to understand if that's a fair view, given the volatility that you're seeing or you're expected to see, do you expect to be this opportunistic around acquisitions? And what kind of examples can you give us where you kind of have seen that in the past and you'd expect to see that in the future?
Curtis Morgan: Well, I think everything we've done so far, in my own opinion, has been pretty much an opportunistic thing. I mean, I think what we did with the Odessa plant in Texas was a good example of - we had a view of the future and we had somebody that was not a natural owner of that asset that wanted to get out and I think we were opportunistic. And it turned out, obviously, to be a very good acquisition for us. I would say, that was part skill and part luck. Because we know people are going to pay us to take natural gas. But we did have a view that natural gas would be relatively cheap in the Permian, to other hubs. So I think, that's an example of being opportunistic that I think we've been able to do. I think the other thing is, almost day one when we took over for Dynegy we were in discussions with PG&E around the battery project in Moss Landing which, our predecessor owners were not. And I think that was because we had the cash, the balance sheet and maybe the willingness, I don't know, to do something there. But I think we will be opportunistic. That's why I mentioned Praful, that there could be some small asset things that would fit sort of, like I said, fit the profile of being a volatility type asset that we might take a look at, that I think would be opportunistic. Maybe somebody that owns it today doesn't see the same value that we do and I think we'll continue to be that way. And I believe that most of our renewable that I'm talking about this renewable spend is going to be pretty much opportunistic. It's going to be waiting for the right period of time. And I've seen this business for a long time, and there are going to be opportunities around renewables where somebody overpaid, somebody can't make it, and those assets are going to come available. And we'll be around and pretty much all the deal flow comes through us in most of the markets that we're in, and we'll get an opportunity to take a look at it. So I do think that the large portion of what we do and what we will do will be more opportunistic. And I do think operating assets - one thing I like about operating assets, in particular, retail, is they really don't have a lot of impact on credit ratings. So you can do them and that they generate cash immediately. The problem with a development, big development pipeline, is you get that couple year gestation period and that takes a while and it is a drag on you until you actually get some kind of operating cash flows. So I think we do lean a little bit - plus just across the to build something is higher than what the cost to buy something is, except I'm a little worried right now that where the renewable side of things are with the number of players that have decided to enter, at least right now.
Praful Mehta: Got you. That's super helpful. And I'm sure the balance sheet will also help you be opportunistic. Just a second question quickly. And we've got this a lot, which is, if there is a Democratic President, does this change your view in any way in terms of how ERCOT or PJM or how your assets are positioned? How would you think about that?
Curtis Morgan: That's a good question. So, again, I've been around some time. I've seen administrations come and go. Because it's so difficult to actually make things happen, even when we've seen where we've had Republican controlled Presidency with a Republican controlled Congress or Democrat controlled Presidency and Congress, things just don't move that quickly and so I haven't really seen that big of a change. There have been some things obviously that the tax legislation was a pretty big deal for us as a company and I would say that and there could be other things. But if you talk about just what people are speaking about, there is a pretty big divide. The current administration in my opinion is less of a principal administration and probably more, I call them more opportunistic looking for ways to actually surgically improve the economy. On the other side of the equation, you see a fairly progressive Group. And – the front runners are fairly progressive and some of the things that I've heard, such as ban on fracking and just making it very difficult for gas pipelines, and interestingly enough it is actually good for our company. We are a long natural gas equivalents company. And so, if you start fracking natural gas prices will go up that is good for our company. It might make me think about I wish I didn't shutdown the coal plants that we did because those are obviously natural gas equivalents. I'm not sure everybody has thought that through yet. You still have to run the power grid and you have to have assets and if you shutdown gas drilling that's going to increase electricity costs. So, but I have not really seen a change that much I don't expect it to change that much. We're sort of agnostic when it comes to who is in the Presidency in the Congress. I saw something recently where somebody came out and had us sort of pegged I think under Democrat - Presidency in a Democrat controlled Congress that we don't do as well, I just don't see that. I mean – and I also think we expect to be a participant in the renewable side of the business. But one of the key points we tried to make in this discussion today is that when you bring in a significant amount of intermittent resources, you need some level of dispatchable resources that you can count on. And right now given where gas prices are in this country natural gas, efficient natural gas plants fit the bill. And we purposely did a deal to get long those types of assets. So, we feel very good about how we've positioned ourselves and I feel like we will do well under any administration.
Praful Mehta: Got it, that's super helpful. Thanks a lot guys and I appreciate the color.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning team, thanks for your patience. I just wanted to run by the illustrative 2021 and how you think about that sort of a year-over-year walk, if you will, from 2020? I know you guys have laid out a number of different pieces of that, but can we talk a little bit through it? And especially given the context for the updated hedges, I just wanted to make sure I understand this right. So looking at the hedges that you guys provided late in the deck, I think it's about 580 million for 2020, how do you think about that rolling off and rolling into 2021 that might be a different way to ask of – like what kind of embedded hedge value you are putting in 2021 as well?
Curtis Morgan: Yes so – first of all I want to be clear that we don't provide, we're not providing guidance on 2021. There is always, we tried to do this, because I know people and in particular you Julien, I know that you care about that out year. And so, part of this is just to try to give people a window into it. Admittedly, here is the story for 2021 and I think we said this in the script. If you market to market, just take the curve, we'd be a little bit below where we're coming in 2020 which 2020 is a pretty strong year but we would be below that. When we run very detailed fundamental model for 2021 and we did this last year and we got the same viewpoint, at this stage right now, we would say that our fundamental view is above – where the market is trading. And so when we market to model if you will, we would be above where 2020 comes in. And if you stripped out the base business, if you stripped out the retail businesses it kind of falls in that same line. I mean we'd be a little bit below, on the base business, but then on a mark to model we'd be above. The question is going to be, are we going to see the curves move up? And we tried to show this because we've seen it and it has been very pronounced at '19 and '20, where when we rolled through the prompt period, the one year out period moved up as we went through the summer of '19, '20 moved up when we went through the summer of '18, '19 moved up, and it happened as people began to realize that the market remained tight, but also they got glimpses of the volatility in the market and we expect that to happen again. But that's - we tried to arrange that for you guys to say that, but we feel pretty confident that we'll have an opportunity to hedge 2021. But I will tell you that we are going to be patient on that. But what we typically do is we're usually 80% to 90% hedged going into any prompt year. I don't expect us to deviate from that too much. But I think we did try to say today that we might carry a little more length than we have in the past, one because of the volatility and the fact that the volatility products that people have used to hedge swing risk and ERCOT are not as available because everybody's starting to realize this volatility, but also because we added Ambit, and Ambit also has swing risk associated with it. So I don't know if that gets an answer to your question, but I think we're going to be patient around '21. We think it right now is below where fundamentals who would see it. And so I wouldn't expect this to move our hedge ratio up a lot right now in 2021. But I do expect as we go through the balance of '20, as we get closer to 2021, we'll be likely hedged about the way we normally are, somewhere between 80% and 90% going into that year.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But just in terms of the year of your walk here, any other large factors to kind of keep in mind? I just want to make sure I'm hearing you clear as you kind of think about, you're illustrative outlook?
Curtis Morgan: I mean - so - just a couple of things that are a little bit different. So when we go from '20 to '21, we'll have the battery facility at Moss Landing, so that will be included in 2021. We will get to a full run rate on Ambit and Crius and because it takes us some time to do all the integration and all that. And so that, I think we've said before, we're around $50 million on the battery, I would expect us to pick up maybe $15 million to $25 million on the Ambit and Crius side. So you are seeing some of that, that would show up, which is contributing to offsetting some of the lower curves that you have for '21. Then if we mark the curves through our models, that's when you go above 2020. But those are two things that will be coming on that are new, and then we will be reaching full run rate of OP in 2021. So that $50 million will come on and then we'll be at full run rate by the end of 2021, but we'll be picking up some of that in 2021. So those are the things that I would say are contributing, to right now offsetting relative to the ERCOT curves. And by the way, the PJM curves are down. They are backwardated and so as I saw the way, they're smaller though impact on 2021. And so, the real swing on this, and this is true of us pretty much all the time, is the real swing on this will be what does ERCOT end up doing. And we feel very confident that our modeling is more representative of where things will come in and that will obviously push us to either be flat but more than likely higher given all those other things I just went over with you that we would end up being higher '21 to '20.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the patience guys. Cheers.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on retail sort of a little bit. Did you guys notice any increase in customer attrition in the retail business from the volatility and the summer power prices or would you say it's a little too early because of the long-term nature of those contracts?
Curtis Morgan: So, actually, we did not, I mean, we actually saw sort of the opposite. What tends to happen in a high price environment, our competition has to raise prices intra month because most of these guys are hanging on razor thin margins. And so, when that happens, you tend to see people move from, sort of the fly by night, if you will, to safety and TXU Energy obviously is a safe bet. So we actually saw through those months, and I think we actually grew customers during that period of time. So - and that's typical for us and the good news for us is we get a customer, we typically can hold a customer for a good period of time, so and it was net-net beneficial to us over that period of time.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. The other question I had was on how important the IG rating is for you guys? So as you think about achieving your leverage target of 2.5x, is it absolutely critical in your mind to cross over into the IG territory, or would you just be comfortable getting to that leverage level and maintain it going forward?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, that's a good question. We never came out and said you know that is a fall on the sword issue. I mean, and what I do believe and I think we've tried to say this is that I think it's a strong indicator of the risk of the business. And I still believe there's a risk premium that sits in our free cash flow yield, because people were just uncertain as to whether the business model is sustainable and the business is sustainable. So we've tried to tackle this in a couple of ways. One is through pure execution, and discipline, and doing the things we said. And part of that is reducing your debt. I mean, I think that's one way to reduce that risk premium. The other one is to try to draw a picture for people about what the long-term resiliency in this business is, which is why we give the 10-year view. So, I would say, the investment grade is less about credit spreads and more about the risk of the business overall, which I believe then translates into a higher equity value because investors view that they don't need the risk premium that they once thought they needed for this business, that the risk profile is business is much lower, and they can own it, get a 10% free cash flow yield, not a 15% free cash flow yield. And I've said this a bunch of times. This Company trades at a 10%, free cash flow yield at $7 billion plus dollars of equity value. I mean, that's a huge change in the value of our Company. There's nothing I'm doing every day or anybody in this Company is doing every day that could come close to creating that kind of value. And so, we're doing everything we can to prove to people because we believe it, that the business, the risk of this business has changed substantially by the way that we run it. And the amount of cash we generate is enormous. Who would have known it was embedded in this situation where people had too much debt and they were blowing money on bad things at the wrong time and we've cleaned that up. I think we just have to do it year-over-year, which we're doing. But I think a part of that puzzle is getting our debt down and investment grade would be a visible tangible sign that the business risk of our of Company is significantly lower and I think that would have some impact on our free cash flow yield.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Curtis Morgan: Sure.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Curt Morgan, for closing remarks.
Curtis Morgan: Once again, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I know, a long call. Really appreciate the questions and the opportunity to talk to you about our business. It's always a risk when you talk about 10-year view, but we thought it was important. I think we've explained why we think that's important. And we always appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy Second Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's investor webcast covering second quarter 2019 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. Before we get into the materials, I would like to comment on what has been happening to our stock price the last three months, seemingly started by the ERCOT CDR report and then exacerbated by a series of various events such as weather, prospect for PJM, capacity auction, potential new CCGTs and PJM and nuclear subsidies, clearly not a good stretch. It is important to note that we are grounded in today's reality and recognize where forward curves are today. However, that does not mean that we have to agree with the forwards, and we certainly do not have to transact at the current price levels especially in 2021 and beyond. It is as if some investors in the competitive power sector were conditioned to sell off at the first whisper of any potential bad news. Yet we are a vastly different company than the IPPs of the past with lower debt, integrated operations with strong retail brands and a much lower cost structure. We have continued to execute, return capital, make sound investments, lower costs, strengthen our balance sheet and diversify our earnings stream from a substantially expanded and improved asset base and retail businesses, all things we committed to and delivered. We have clearly differentiated ourselves from the failed IPPs of the past, and we have strength and staying power. We have inexplicably, to us anyway, lost approximately $3 billion of equity value, yet we expect our EBITDA for 2019 and 2020 will be over $3 billion with free cash flow expected to be in excess of $2 billion. Sure, the curves have fallen off, but we believe we have a concrete pipeline of future revenue streams on the way requiring minimal investment. In our view, the question is, can we put up sustained strong numbers year in and year out in various market price environments while producing very strong free cash flow with the opportunity to return value to shareholders and/or invest in our business? To us, the answer is an unequivocal yes. As we have tried to emphasize, our view is that we are a value play, and we are executing accordingly with strong free cash flow to show for it. We have seen the volatility in commodity prices, yet our company continues to put up numbers given the stability of earnings from retail, cleared capacity auctions and hedging. Yet now the market is being led to believe that we should apparently be valued off of forward power curves in 2021 or beyond as if these forward curves will exist into perpetuity with no competitive response, no ability to manage the volatility and hedge and no opportunity to further enhance EBITDA through efficiency and/or growth. As evidence of our resiliency, when we acquired Dynegy, the company came with an expected steep decline in EBITDA from 2019 to 2020, and the market valued Dynegy off of the lower 2020 expectation. We not only expect we will cover that decline but have also grown the overall pie. Our current stock price implies over a 20% free cash flow yield or some extraordinarily low EBITDA and free cash flow assumption. Nevertheless, the market has spoken. But that does not mean we have to agree and we certainly do not. As you know, we have been repurchasing our stock and, needless to say, we are eager to continue our current buyback program. As difficult as this current environment is to accept, we have not lost faith in our long-term value proposition, our strategic direction and our commitment to our shareholders who are committed to us. Today's earnings presentation is the beginning of framing why we remain confident in our company's ability to succeed long term. As I mentioned earlier, we know where the power markets are today. We get it so we have a view that in some cases can help shed additional light on a complicated and somewhat volatile business and the competitive position of our company. It is not a denial, but perspective. We believe you expect us to have a view. We also expect to continue this discussion on the third quarter call, when we further lay out our view of the long-term prospects for our company. Now finally I will move to the presentation beginning on Slide 6. Vistra finished the second quarter of 2019 reporting adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $707 million, results that are in line with both consensus and management's expectations for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2018, Vistra's results were approximately $44 million favorable, driven by higher retail gross margin reflecting the seasonality of power cost quarter-over-quarter. Vistra has been able to deliver these strong results despite some recent headwinds, including a June that was the mildest Texas has recorded in the past 15 years, with average temperatures approximately 20% below normal. Our diversified, integrated energy company model centered on low cost and market-leading operations continues to prove out its ability to weather these types of externalities and produce relatively stable EBITDA and free cash flow. Importantly, we believe our commitment to achieving our merger synergy and operations performance improvement targets also support this relatively stable earnings profile. I am happy to say we remain on track to realizing $430 million of EBITDA value leverage in 2019 with the full run rate of $565 million expected to be realized in 2021. We are also increasing the after-tax free cash flow benefit expected to be derived from the merger to $320 million following our recent financing transactions. Our team continues to show proficiency in identifying and capturing savings opportunities, which ultimately drives value to the bottom line. In total, through cost cutting and OP initiatives, combined with merger synergy opportunities, Vistra has meaningfully reduced the cost and enhanced the value of its operations, adding more than $1.25 billion of value since our predecessor entity emerged from bankruptcy in October 2016. And that value creation does not include the nearly $1 billion of value we expect to realize from the net operating losses acquired in the Dynegy merger. Year-to-date, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations is $1.522 billion, right in line with management expectations and approximately $276 million higher than the estimated adjusted EBITDA for the pro forma merged company for the 6 months of 2018. We believe our performance in the first half of the year sets a solid foundation for 2019. We are reaffirming our full year 2019 ongoing operations guidance today, reiterating our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.22 billion to $3.42 billion and our adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. After receiving FERC approval, we closed the acquisition of Crius Energy Trust on July 15. Our teams are actively integrating the Crius and Vistra portfolios and working to capture the approximately $15 million in annual EBITDA synergies and additional approximately $12 million of annual free cash flow synergies anticipated from the Crius transaction. We expect the acquisition of Crius will contribute approximately $50 million to Vistra's 2019 financial results. We are not increasing 2019 guidance ranges to reflect the addition of Crius at this time given that we have key months ahead for our business. To be clear, we continue to expect the Crius acquisition to be EBITDA and free cash flow accretive on a per-share basis on day 1. Given the overall size of Crius relative to the overall company, we believe it is most prudent to maintain our 2019 guidance ranges at this time. Beyond 2019, we still expect we will be able to deliver 2020 adjusted EBITDA that will be relatively flat to or within the range of 2019 results. Clearly, the recent decline in ERCOT and PJM forward curves have put some pressure on potential 2020 outcomes. But with seeming clarity on the MPS and Dynegy merger value lever realization, we have a reasonable path at holding 2020 EBITDA in the range of 2019. Including Crius would put us in a strong position to possibly exceed 2019. Importantly, we still have nearly half a year before the start of 2020, leaving plenty of time for incremental volatility in forward prices. In fact, it was the fall of 2018 when 2019 forward curves in ERCOT started to meaningfully move up as retailers more aggressively procured power for the 2019 summer. We expect we'll be able to provide an update on the anticipated MISO plant retirement as well as an OP update on the third quarter call, along with guidance for 2020 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth. In general, we believe the recent pullback in our stock, which appears to be in direct response to ERCOT and PJM forward curves, has been overdone. Unfortunately, in our view, it seems as though we are currently suffering from the sins of the over-levered IPPs of the past. So I as I noted earlier, we believe Vistra is very different from these predecessors. Turning now to Slide 7. Vistra's retail segment has delivered an average of $800 million of adjusted EBITDA for the past 10 years in periods of both rising and declining wholesale power prices. Importantly, this relatively stable EBITDA profile contributes to lower earnings volatility for Vistra's consolidated operations and is generally achievable year-over-year as a result of our proven ability to lock in term margin through forward power purchases combined with the flexibility we maintain in pricing our month-to-month portfolio. Of course, we expect the overall contribution to EBITDA from our retail business to increase with the addition of Crius. Our sizable retail portfolio also supports our ability to weather near-term volatility in the wholesale power market as we typically observe a delayed competitive market response decline in wholesale power prices. As a result, when power prices are on the decline, our retail business can capture relatively higher margins in the near term. Ultimately, however, in a competitive market experiencing sustained wholesale price declines, you will eventually see retail competition put downward pressure on market retail prices as well. This will result in long-term margins and EBITDA in the retail business that are relatively stable. While retail providers can attempt to hold revenues constant and increase margins during periods of sustained year-over-year wholesale price declines, this is a risky approach as customers will naturally look for more competitively priced retail electricity plans. As a result, even integrated companies are exposed to long-term commodity price volatility as relatively stable retail margins are not an automatic offset for the impact of sustained or multiyear wholesale price declines on wholesale margins. Typically, retail pricing action to expand margin in any price environment must be driven by competitive dynamics. A more balanced or short retail wholesale portfolio player will also have more difficulty in expanding margin through longer-term hedging as the trigger to lock in margin is driven in the first instance by the retail side of the transaction with the desire to tandem hedge, not to optimize the generation position through forward curve volatility. A more balanced or short player can always take a position by only hedging one side of the transaction, but that is a very risky proposition. On the other hand, a net long generator has the opportunity to capture significant wholesale margin on the net long position by taking advantage of wholesale volatility. A more balanced or short retailer is more exposed to the wholesale piece and corresponding volume risk. Which brings us to Slide 8. Our retail and wholesale businesses are supported by a sophisticated commercial team that has and we expect will continue to create value for the enterprise by taking advantage of volatility in the market. Vistra takes an opportunistic approach to hedging our net link. We developed a fundamental point of view of where we believe prices will settle in the future, and we hedge our link only when the forward curves are at or above this fundamental point of view. In periods of trough pricing, where we believe the forwards are disconnected from fundamentals, we can remain patient or even procure power at these low prices to further optimize our future earnings opportunity. To reiterate, we see this volatility not as a risk, but rather an opportunity. And we have a demonstrated track record of creating value through this approach. It is important to recognize that this commercial approach to hedging or net link is only possible due to the in-the-money nature of Vistra's generation fleet. Our assets are largely newer, highly efficient generation assets that are well-positioned on the supply stacks in the markets where we operate. As a result, these assets are in the money more frequently than older, higher heat rate generation assets that would require more meaningful price spikes before a forward hedge would become economic. In very low wholesale price environments, these higher heat rate assets sit on the sidelines with no opportunity to earn an energy margin. Importantly, following the merger with Dynegy, Vistra generation assets increased to approximately 60% gas-fueled, comprised primarily of highly efficiency CCGTs and earning diversified revenues from both capacity and energy. Nearly half of Vistra's gross margin is derived from 3 year forward capacity revenues and the contribution from a relatively stable retail portfolio. We believe this revenue diversification and our integrated business model reduced Vistra's earnings exposure to single-year impacts from mild weather in any one region, capacity auction outcomes or regulatory and political changes. It is our view that our portfolio enables Vistra to generate more stable earnings and cash flows over time and in varying commodity price environments. And as you know, there are hundreds of trading days between now and 2021, giving Vistra plenty of time to capitalize on future volatility in the forward curves. A lot can change between now and then. We continue to believe the forward curve backwardation is not reflective of longer-term fundamentals, and our analysis suggest forward curves should move higher than where they currently trade. The key for our commercial model is volatility, and we fully expect there will be volatility in power and gas curves on a sustained basis. Turning to Slide 9. Let's start our fundamentals discussion with ERCOT. While recent months have resulted in a decline in summer 2019 forward curves, we believe these price declines are an overreaction to a wet spring and a relatively mild start to the summer. ERCOT remains a very tight market on a supply/demand dynamics. In fact, on a Sunday in June, the ERCOT market saw several 15-minute intervals where real-time prices settled in the hundreds of dollars per megawatt hour and a couple of 15-minute intervals where real-time prices settled in the low thousands per megawatt hour. This was on a day where the high temperature was only 93 degrees in DFW and in Houston, reflecting the tight market conditions. Similarly, in both June and July, we saw days where peak pricing averaged anywhere from approximately $70 per megawatt hour to approximately $135 per megawatt hour, even though temperatures were relatively mild, in the mid-90s, and peak low was negatively normal. On Tuesday this week, DFW hit 100 degrees for the first time this summer. Real-time prices were approximately $156 per megawatt hour, which included on ORDC at or approximately $106 per megawatt hour. These outcomes support the thesis that if we do see a string of hot weather days in August with low wind and normal outages, the real-time prices could be meaningfully higher. Notably, we have gone into a relatively dry period in Texas, and temperatures are beginning to rise. As a reminder, it only takes a week in ERCOT in the summer to have a significant impact. In our view, the risk of high peak pricing could persist for several years as we believe ERCOT will continue to have a relatively tight supply/demand dynamic for the next 3 to 5 years. At a high level, this view is based on three key factors: First, the CDR does not evaluate economics when including new supply in the report. It merely reports development projects that have met certain milestones. And the CDR does not take into account competitive dynamics, such as retirements in response to new supply. As a result, the CDR consistently overestimates new build in the market, and many ERCOT experts have been reserved, if not skeptical, regarding the level of planned capacity in the CDR. ERCOT itself regularly clarifies that historically, only some of the new capacity represented in the CDR actually gets built. Second, reserve margins are still projected to be very tight. These results fundamental point of view would estimate a range of reserve margins in the high single digits to low double digits with levels remaining below the 13.75% ERCOT target through at least 2023. Yet forward prices in 2021 and 2022 would be more consistent with reserve margins in the range of 13% to 15%, respectively. Our analytics suggest achieving reserve margins this high will be quite a tall order, especially given the likely competitive response. To this end and thirdly, we believe there are more than 15,000 megawatts at risk of retirement in ERCOT over the next 10 years as renewables enter the market. This generation capacity is likely to act as a long-term supply and demand calibration feature in the market with the market reaction and calibration quicker and less volatile given the new build is forecast to come in lower megawatt increments via renewable development. That being said, we also believe incremental renewables are necessary in the ERCOT market to merely compensate for projected annual load growth of approximately 2% or in the range of 1,500 megawatts per year. In fact, ERCOT is estimating more than 2.25% load growth per year. As the market begins to rely more and more on incremental renewable generation to meet demand, we expect volatility in the market will increase. Any such volatility should benefit our efficient, flexible CCGT fleet. If you follow the California market, you can see this playing out in real time. We continue to believe the backwardation in the current ERCOT forward curves is, to some extent, driven by the lack of liquidity in the out-years. In 2021 and beyond, for example, a few long data power purchase agreements are currently setting the price of power. This is a relatively small slice of transaction activity and does not represent the fundamentals of the market. It is typical in ERCOT for power prices to rise as there is more liquidity in the market. We saw a similar phenomenon for 2019, as the graph on the right side of Slide 9 depicts. As we entered the summer and fall of 2018, many market participants locked in volumes and prices for the upcoming year, and we saw 2019 forward prices steadily rise to reflect the tight supply dynamics in the market. Given that the fundamentals are forecast to remain relatively tight over the next 3 to 5 years, we would expect this backwardation to once again reverse over time. Ironically, it is the backwardated nature of the forward curves that could keep new thermal generation on the sidelines in ERCOT and, to some extent, renewables. Unfortunately, the development model remains broken with developers earning some large fees on the front end while taking no risks on the underlying project economics. However, the recent financial losses from revenue puts in PJM, which I will discuss shortly, and the absence of a capacity market in ERCOT with prospects for significant congestion in the West, should bring caution to the forefront for capital markets players looking to invest in renewables in ERCOT. Our analysis continues to suggest that renewables, even with the tax credits, are borderline economic while CCGTs and peakers are uneconomic in ERCOT especially with the steep forward curve backwardation. In recent months, we have seen new asset owners enter the game, mainly large corporations who have decided they want to invest in green technologies to, in many instances, fulfill their ESG targets and for marketing purposes. In our view, many of these ill-equipped new entrants are wading into treacherous waters as not all have a proper understanding of the risk they're assuming. Over time, as the economics of these investments play out, we might see more reluctance on the part of large corporations to step into the merchant power space in this manner. Or at a minimum, we should start to see future pricing terms better aligned with actual project economics. Over time, we believe our expertise will bode well for us to partner with many of these large corporations to help them achieve their objectives without exposure to a complicated business where they have no expertise. In the near term, we have not yet given up on the ERCOT summer. Market conditions are very tight, and the recent shift in the ORDC has been effective at providing incremental revenues in the market. We remain steadfast in our view that long-term forward power curves do not reflect the underlying fundamentals in the ERCOT market, and we will be ready when favorable market conditions do materialize. Moving on to Slide 10. Let's turn our focus to PJM. As you can see on the graph on the left side of the slide, beginning in about mid-May, PJM forward curves started to decline as certain generators began to sell less, driven by an overall bearish view of the market and their own desire to take risk off the table. This decline in forward prices triggered additional selling by various market participants, who as I mentioned earlier had previously sold revenue puts to help finance new CCGT development in the region. As forward prices fell, these market participants effectively became longer and longer generation, forcing them to sell into the bearish curves to mitigate their risk in a period when they would normally be buying on a dislocation. As a result, what would've otherwise been a relatively minor move in the forward curves was exacerbated. Only recently have the forwards started to recover as the market sentiment has settled and the parties to the revenue put transactions have seemingly covered their positions. Despite this recent near-term volatility, I think it is important to remember that from 2010 to 2018, the average PJM CCGT earned approximately $9 to $12 per KW a month from the combination of capacity and energy, representing a relatively stable earnings profile. The market itself is competitive and generally efficient, meaning that energy prices will respond to both high and low capacity clears and vice versa. In a market with over 180,000 megawatts of installed capacity, it takes a meaningful amount of incremental new supply or retirements to move the market in one direction or the other, as we show in the chart on the right side of the slide. From 2014 to 2019, PJM has seen cumulative net additions of nearly 5,000 megawatts capacity while the average CCGT has still earned between approximately $9 to $13 per KW a month from energy and capacity revenues, a very stable revenue profile year-over-year on a relative basis. It is also important to note that new development of CCGT requires approximately $15 per KW a month for what most would consider a compensatory return. Speaking of new development. I know there has been a lot of discussion on this matter as we move towards the next PJM capacity auction. We believe it is likely new build will clear, but we also expect there will be incremental retirements in the coming auctions as has been the case in PJM. There are approximately 55,000 gigawatts of coal and approximately 10 gigs of other less-efficient, vulnerable generation in the supply stack in PJM. We also believe the pace of new development in PJM should slow, as it is our view that the asset owners are unlikely to earn a compensatory return from new development in PJM of any asset type, whether it be a wind, solar or a thermal resource. It is important to note that PJM is the least favorable market for renewables, with largely low onshore wind intensity in ideal locations and sun irradiance and limited access to offshore wind. Even with lower natural gas prices, CCGTs do not appear economic, especially with the backwardation in the forward curves. Moreover, market participants might now be less inclined to enter into forward transactions guaranteeing a floor on revenues for new development, which could make it more difficult for developers to obtain financing. Before we move on from PJM, I do want to address the recent FERC action ordering PJM not to conduct the 2022, 2023 capacity auction in August. We view this action as a potential positive as FERC should be able to resolve its apparent deadlock now that it will have an odd number of commissioners following Commissioner Lafleur's retirement, for whom we have the utmost respect. Consistent with past practice, we expect FERC will issue an order revising the capacity auction rules to ensure the market does not further erode given the aggressive and price-suppressive effects of out-of-market activity by state. Both FERC and PJM have been focused on maintaining the viability of the competitive market, and we believe that focus will continue with FERC's final order on this matter. We continue to believe that the outcome will be modestly positive or neutral at worst. In addition, we believe that FERC may issue an order in the near term on the PJM reserve pricing reforms. Let's not lose sight, however, on the more holistic view that the sheer size and balance sheet strength of our company and the diversified revenue streams should make the impact of any one external factor much less meaningful to our overall business as compared to the smaller, over-levered and less diversified IPPs of the past. We spent a lot of time talking about forward curves and capacity auctions, all topics that have been front of mind for investors as the market considers Vistra's future earnings power. Before I hand the call off to David, I want to highlight once again existing opportunities that we expect will be additive to EBITDA in 2020 and beyond. First as you know, we just closed the Crius acquisition on July 15 of this year. As a result, our 2019 financial results will only include a partial year of contribution from the Crius portfolio, with the full year benefit beginning in 2020. In MISO, we are currently awaiting a decision from the Illinois Joint Commission on Administrative Rules on the proposed amendment to the Multi-Pollutant Standard, which we are optimistic will be issued by late summer. If the amendment is approved as drafted, Vistra would be required to file with MISO to retire 2 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in MISO Zone 4 within 30 days. Our preliminary analysis suggest that these retirements could be approximately $50 million to $100 million accretive to Vistra's long-term EBITDA profile as some of our existing MISO assets are EBITDA and free cash flow negative in the current market environment. On the growth side. Our Moss Landing battery storage project should be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020 with the projected full year adjusted EBITDA contribution of approximately $50 million per year beginning to be realized in 2021. In addition, we are very close to completing a deal to build a 20-megawatt battery storage project at our Oakland site in California that should kick in, in 2022. We will also continue to evaluate tuck-in growth opportunities given our attractive sites, substantial presence and scale in our core markets. To the extent we are successful in identifying attractive opportunities that meet or exceed our investment threshold of 500 to 600 basis points above cost of equity, we could see incremental upside from growth-related projects in 2021 and beyond. As you know, we expect to have significant cash flow to allocate to attractive growth projects or return to shareholders over the next several years. And last, we expect we'll be at our full run rate of $565 million of merger value lever targets by 2021, and this does not include any potential upsizing of our current OP target, which I expect could be addressed as soon as our third quarter call later this year. Even without OP upside and new investments, we have line of sight to approximately $300 million to $350 million per year improvement to EBITDA, independent of commodity price impacts, which can move EBITDA in either direction. Importantly, however, all of the items listed on this slide are positive offsets that could help to absorb any headwinds that could come our way in the future. We expect that through execution of these EBITDA-enhancement initiatives combined with a relentless focus on business execution and the advancement of our integrated business model, we will be able to continue to generate relatively stable EBITDA and free cash flow in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell. As many of you know, David joined our company recently to be the CFO. This is his inaugural earnings call, and we wish David the best of luck. And with that, I'll turn it over to you.
David Campbell: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 13. Vistra delivered second quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $707 million, $44 million higher than second quarter 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the 8 days of incremental ownership of Dynegy in 2019, with the merger closing on April 9, 2018, as well as higher retail gross margins from the seasonal shaping of power costs. We saw a similar quarter-over-quarter phenomenon in the retail segment in Q1, with first quarter 2019 retail adjusted EBITDA $53 million higher than the first quarter 2018. As we explained on the first quarter call, the 2019 quarter-over-quarter variance was expected in the extreme peak in 2019 August heat rates we were observing at the time we procured power for the year. The peaky nature of August 2019 heat rates drove up our third quarter cost of goods sold and as a result, we expect a higher gross margin from retail in the first, second and fourth quarters of this year, all of which we expect will be normalized with the third quarter offset. In fact, our plan calls for negative adjusted EBITDA in our retail segment in isolation for the third quarter due to this phenomenon. Year-to-date, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations is $1.522 billion, which is in line with management expectations for the first half of the year. One final note on the quarter-over-quarter analysis relates to the information shown on Slide 23 of the appendix. You'll see that our estimated realized prices for 2019 and 2020 are down quarter-over-quarter in all markets relative to the data shown in our first quarter appendix slides. These changes reflect the recent decline in forward curves. While this decline is expected to result in lower generation revenues in 2019 and 2020, the impact to gross margin is projected to be much more muted as a result of a related reduction in expected fuel costs driven primarily by lower natural gas prices. The reduction in expected fuel costs is forecasted nearly $325 million in 2019 and over $300 million in 2020. The revenue side alone does not capture the full impact of lower fuel prices. Turning now to the capital structure. Vistra executed a series of financing transactions in the second quarter, as we lay out on Slide 14. In June, Vistra issued $2 billion of senior secured notes comprised of $1.2 billion of 3.55% senior notes due 2024 and $800 million of 4.3% senior notes due 2029. We used the proceeds together with cash on hand to repay $2 billion of term loans under our credit facility. This transaction resulted in annual pretax interest savings of approximately $24 million. The new senior secured notes contain provisions that will result in a release of collateral upon Vistra achieving investment-grade rating from two rating agencies. We view this transaction as another positive step that should augment Vistra's ability to achieve investment-grade credit ratings in the future. Also in June, Vistra issued $1.3 billion of 5% senior unsecured notes due 2027, using the proceeds to repurchase or redeem all of the outstanding 7.375% senior unsecured notes, due 2022, as well as to repurchase or redeem approximately $760 million of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024. These transactions resulted in annual pretax interest savings of approximately $28 million. In total, the secured and unsecured transactions will extend the average maturity of Vistra's outstanding senior notes while resulting in pretax interest savings of approximately $52 million per year. As always, we will continue to look for opportunities to further optimize the balance sheet in the future. Turning to Slide 15. I want to briefly reiterate the capital allocation plan we've laid out, setting forth our priorities over the next 18 months. First, we expect we will continue to execute on our $1.75 billion share repurchase program, of which we have approximately $462 million of capital remaining for repurchases as of July 25, 2019. Next, we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share or $0.50 per share on an annualized basis. Management expects that dividend will grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8%, which we believe can be supported by disciplined investments like the Crius acquisition. We also expect to pay down debt and continue tracking toward our long-term leverage target of 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. And last, we're on track for the development of the Moss Landing battery storage project in California with an expected completion date in the fourth quarter of 2020. We've articulated these uses of capital, and we are committed to achieving them, advancing our priorities by meeting our leverage target, growing our business through disciplined financial investments such as the Crius acquisition and the Moss Landing battery storage project and continuing to repurchase our stock at these low valuations. Our meaningful free cash flow generation is supporting this diverse capital allocation plan. At an estimated 60% to 70% free cash flow conversion rate, we expect we will consistently have consistent capital to allocate in the years ahead. In summary, we remain highly confident around the sound fundamentals and prospects for our business. We believe the recent stock price performance of the integrated energy companies is an overreaction to onetime summer dynamics in ERCOT and PJM, and what were prior to the FERC order concerns about a single-capacity auction. These onetime dynamics are not fundamental drivers of our business. We will continue to focus on execution and long-term value creation while advancing our capital allocation plan, and we remain confident in the value of our company. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Greg.
Greg Gordon: A couple of questions. Looking at the upside that you guys laid out on Page 11, Curt, there is actually, from my perspective, a couple of things that actually aren't in there. I know that there's a lot of debate over what's going to happen in Illinois this fall in the veto session with regard to Exelon's and renewable energy consortiums potentially passing a bill. But you also have a proposal in there that would allow you to replace some of your coal generation with renewables. That doesn't look like it's specifically in the build up here on your '21 potential upsides. Is that correct?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. That's correct. I mean - and you may remember this, Greg. There's two elements of that coal to solar and battery program if we were successful. One is that there would be some incremental payments, almost like a pseudo-capacity payment in the -- to the existing coal plants until 2025. And that is obviously to help them stay alive. And then there would be a transition to solar and batteries, and we would invest in those to come on roughly in that 2025. And then there would be economics from those investments as well. But we have not included those just because of the uncertainty with what's going to happen. I think you're well aware. I'm not speaking out of turn here. This is public. But we're a little concerned with some of the lobbying issues that are going on that appears ComEd has gotten itself into. And although I do hear Exelon, I think Chris Crane said he was feeling pretty good about something actually happening in the fall. We'd obviously work with Exelon and others because I think if this is going to happen, it will probably be part of a broader energy legislation. But we just have been conservative on this, and we have not put it in there at this point in time.
Greg Gordon: Yeah. And then the other thing I know you probably have to be cautious about addressing is, one of the other things that's impacted your shares in addition to the -- your competitors is concern over the Just Energy process, still a large retailer, and they put themselves up for sale. You guys have obviously been opportunistic, successfully opportunistic and continuing to leg out into retail when you see it as good value. You are a net long generator in some of the regions where they have customers. So to the extent you can comment on that, how much more retail do you think you guys need sort of to be a structurally sustainable countercyclical business model?
Curtis Morgan: Yeah, that's a very good question. I mean, look, here's how I see it. We don't comment on anything specifically, as you might understand. I would say though that we're not focused on any particular transaction that involves retail that would have a significant non-U.S. presence. So that probably gives you some indication of where our focus would be or would not be. Are we interested in other potential opportunities? We are. But we would remain extremely disciplined, especially given where our stock price is. It would have to be something very compelling. I will say that there are a few opportunities that may be out there that are attractive. And we'll see what happens about that. But we got to be really careful about something like that in today's environment. So I think I wanted to make sure that you guys, rest assured, that if we were to come forward with something, it would have to be very compelling to us. Now in getting to where we would like to be, I think I've been very clear about this. Over the next 2 to 4 years, we'd like to have a mass that's somewhere around 70%. Now some of that is going to happen naturally because I expect us to shrink our generation size because some of our coal, I believe we're going to have 2,000 megawatts, for example, that comes out with MPS. There may be others. So we're going to naturally going to shrink back. And we're pushing 50% as it is now and some of that is actually going to push us closer to 60%. But I wouldn't be surprised in the next few years that we do something. There is - the good portfolios are getting more scarce. And so I will say that if an opportunity came around, you have to take a look just because of that. But we're going to be disciplined about it. And as I said, we'd like to be 70 plus or so percent mass. We still like to be somewhat long. And I think in particular in ERCOT, we think it's good from a risk management standpoint. But we also think it's good just from an opportunistic standpoint given the fact that there are going to be -- with an all energy market, there is going to be -- and I know it's hard to contemplate this right now given where the forwards are, but there are going to be opportunities where this market is tight and where it's maybe not as tight. And those opportunities, those options that -- in the form of assets in ERCOT can be quite lucrative in the periods where things can get tight.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thanks for the details here. Have a great day.
Curtis Morgan: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much. Hi, guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Praful.
Praful Mehta: Hi. And really appreciate the detailed discussion on the call today, so it was very clear. I guess just following up a little bit on the retail. I know, Curt, when you've talked about acquisitions in the past, you've talked about it as comparing the opportunity to buy back stock. So now when you've highlighted the evaluation that you see your current stock price at, I'm assuming that's the bar you're talking about when you're talking about retail acquisitions and the value that you see in a potential acquisition.
Curtis Morgan: Absolutely. We - you know this, Praful. I mean the real -- when you're doing that analysis, the assumptions that you make as to the timing and the level of your stock price, appreciation for buying back your shares, is fundamental. So we look at it under a variety of scenarios as to how quickly and how high our stock price would move, because obviously if we buy back our shares, that's an investment. But we look at it - just like we look at when we do an investment in something like a retail business, we look at it under a number of scenarios. And so that is exactly how we will look at anything if we decide to do something, is how does it compare on a return basis relative to buying back our shares. And so it has to be. I will mention, because I'm sure it's going to come up and if you don't mind, I'd just going to pile on, on this one. But we have, as you guys know, we have obviously a number of constituents, but very key to us obviously are our shareholders. But also key to us are those who have loaned money to us, our creditors. And we still have more wood to chop as it relates to reducing the cost of our debt. We just were recently out in the debt markets. They've been pretty favorable to us. And so we are going to take a balanced approach, including continuing down the path of reducing our leverage to the 2.5 times. And I want to make sure to be clear about that. Even though I think if you pencil it out math-wise, paying down debt even at 7% relative to free cash flow yields at 20%, you can talk yourself into maybe pushing out, reducing your leverage. We understand that math, but we also have to balance out the different constituencies. And also, we want to have a very strong balance sheet to go forward on. So we still have a lot of dry powder left in our current buyback program. We can -- we are anxious to continue to buy back our shares at this price. But we're also mindful of the fact that we want to get our balance sheet where we would like it to be. And so we're committed to those balancing effects, and we are going to continue to stay that way.
Praful Mehta: Got you. That's super helpful. And that's where I was going, which is, there's so much significant free cash flow that you will generate between now and, let's say, 2021. If you are getting to your leverage target, let's say 2.5 is still the number you want to hit, you will still have significant dry powder like you said. Should we think about dividend being an opportunity in terms of an increase in that? Or do you kind of look at the current targets as where you want to go in terms of growth of the dividend? And otherwise, is it more growth potentially on the storage side? Where else are the avenues you think that capital allocation can go?
Curtis Morgan: Well, so I want to be clear though that a lot of our cash is spoken for until we get to 2021 in order to get to the leverage targets we want to be at. We obviously have some incremental room in all that. But that also assumes a dividend that we -- a current dividend. And management will more than likely recommend to the Board that we grow that at somewhere between 6% and 8%, as we've said. And we feel comfortable that we've got growth projects already in the pipeline that will more than -- well more than cover 6% to 8%. I don't think that you'll see us change though the dividend in and of itself other than some growth between 6% and 8%. But we also will look at -- we have some opportunities in California to continue to develop our two sites, which are very good sites. Those feel to me like they're going to be more 2021 and beyond-type investment. So they're not going to really affect our 2020 investment. So I'm -- we're not really concerned. Of course, I think we all know that we're somewhat interested in growing our retail book. But that is going to be opportunistic in nature, and I can't sit here and tell you that there is something out there that would affect '19 or '20. So bottom line is that we will continue to look at that balanced capital allocation plan. What's interesting about retail acquisitions is they have such a high conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. And if you have operating retail businesses, the cash flow is immediate. And so while an acquisition would have obviously an outflow of cash to pay for it immediately from a retail position. Within a very short period of time though, you're generating cash and the effect on your leverage ratios is minimal. I mean I think Crius was 0.03. And so I don't know if I call it self-funding, but they don't really distract. So it's not really -- in a retail deal, it's really not a choice between getting to the leverage ratio and doing that deal, it's just a matter of timing in terms of getting to the leverage ratio. And that's something we'll have to balance, right, at the end of the day. And of course as I said to you a minute ago, we're always going to put that up against buying back our shares. I mean it has to be compelling for us to be able to do it.
Praful Mehta: Got you. Super helpful as always Curt. Thanks so much.
Curtis Morgan: Thanks, Praful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, good morning.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, Curt. So I can't help but listening to your soliloquy this morning, sounds a little bit like that hell a little years ago with Calpine. So I guess my question is, I know this is a little premature, but just if the like public markets aren't going to give you credit for this model, how are you thinking about alternatives in the future? And do you think the private markets still value these businesses a lot higher than the public markets?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So that's a very good question. In fact, I just was with Thad a day or so ago, and he was smiling a lot. So I don't know what that meant. But look here's how I think about it, Steve. We talked about this and I think I've talked about it on the call before, we still have faith that the public markets will ultimately value this for what it is, as a strong value play. And that we can replicate this thing year in and year out, and on average we can generate really strong cash flows and that we're disciplined with our money and that will result in a stock price that we feel comfortable with. I will say that this recent downturn, which, look, we get, right? I mean commodity prices are down. We're a commodity business. While I don't like the magnitude of it and I think that people were not recognizing what we are capable of doing in terms of managing it, I understand it. But this -- the management team of this company and the board are going to constantly look at what's the best way to unlock value for this business. And I don't know with a sector of two, it's difficult. I don't know whether the public markets are going to embrace it or not. And I know this, that I've spent a lot of time, and David's joining me now too, trying to go out and talk to people, new investors, long-term investors that buy the story because we believe in it and we believe strongly into it. I'm hoping that through execution this year and next year and people getting more and more comfortable that we're not the old IPPs of the past through our actions and execution, that we'll unlock that value. If it doesn't happen, we have to -- we owe it to the company and the people who are shareholders of this company, have believed in us, we got to look for what's the best way to unlock value for the company. I don't know if that's taking it private or not, but that will certainly be on the list because it has to be. I guess - I mean we don't think that's rocket science. I'm not telling anybody anything that's probably very surprising. But we are -- we do believe that we can give this a go as a public company, and I think we've had some really good success at doing that. I mean, I look at where we came out, the stock price where we came out from bankruptcy, the things we've done, the value we've created. I still feel pretty good about where we are. I'm not happy about it, but I think I feel pretty good about it. The question for us right now is, is there another tier to this, another level to the valuation of this company that we think is there and should be recognized that clearly is not being recognized yet. But we're committed to putting up the numbers and doing the things that we said that we would do, and I have faith that it can happen. If it doesn't, we'll have to look at a lot of alternatives.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One other question just on the Ohio law that just passed. Could you maybe give your view on how -- what actions you might take, both with your portfolio and with the law overall?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So it -- so Steve, I'll tell you what -- first of all, I mean this isn't going to be surprising to you or anybody on this call, I mean, we were obviously against that. We're against -- in a well-functioning market, which I believe PJM is, we just talked about the numbers. $9 to $12 KW a month in a market that has a 28% reserve margin is a pretty good margin for combined cycle plants given that kind of reserve margin. So it's hard to argue that PJM hasn't been functioning in a reasonable manner. I think what we're concerned about is what happens from here with all these state-by-state activity. I think with the FERC, what's happening with FERC and Commissioner Lafleur leaving with a 2:1, I think there's probably going to be some action. And I think what happens really will be dependent on what they come up with. So we tried -- we were against the bailout. We -- I'll be clear about that. We continue to be against it. We think it's a fair thing that if those who are trying to get a referendum in place to let the citizens of Ohio decide on this one because the polling was quite clear that consistently through this that Ohio citizens did not like this bailout. And so if they get a chance to vote on it, we'll see what happens there. But I've always felt in this whole thing when people went to Illinois and they tried to go to the court system that this is going to ultimately have to be settled by FERC, and it has to be begun by the ISO. And I think PJM has to put forth something that FERC can take a look at. And then ultimately though, FERC is going to have to do it. And FERC has done a pretty darn good job over the last roughly 10 years or so trying to hold the fort against state activities, and I expect them to do it here. So my point on that and the reason I raised it around the Ohio thing is that, that could mitigate any negative effect if we have something in place that actually provides good mitigation against out-of-market activity. Absent that, we're going to have to continue to slug away at it. I don't think the subsidies in PJM are justified. I think I felt all along that FirstEnergy Solutions and those plants were making money. We've done the math. We own Comanche Peak. We're know what it takes to run those plants, and we think they were making money. At the end of the day, in my view, Steve, this was simply about FirstEnergy, to regulate utility, needed some assurance that FDS was not going to boomerang back to them and bring risk to them. And this was more about getting out of bankruptcy and getting the creditors to be willing to get out of bankruptcy than it was about anybody caring too much about zero emissions and things like that in Ohio, in Ohio I'm speaking specifically on Ohio. This was an inside deal, in my opinion, that was rammed through to try to help FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Solution get out of their bankruptcy. And we're just casual -- I mean we're just collateral damage in that whole thing. And I hope FERC will do the right thing and mitigate them out of the market, which I think is the right thing for them to do.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim and Partners. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. It's actually James for Shar.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, James. How are you doing?
Unidentified Analyst: Good. I just have a little bit of a narrow question I guess versus some of the other ones. But following on your combined cycle comments, has the addition of the Crius book versus kind of the dynamics that we've seen in MISO changed your thoughts around the independent combined cycle?
Curtis Morgan: I'm sorry, I....
David Campbell: Independence.
Curtis Morgan: Oh, Independence. In terms of whether we keep it or not or hold it?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Exactly, exactly.
Curtis Morgan: Yes, I'll tell you, frankly, it's a great asset and I think we're trying to do some things around it to improve it. I mean I've said this before: one asset in a market is not strategy. But I also will say that we're not going to do something -- we don't have to do anything because it either has decent cash flows, it's a nice asset. The team there is very good. And so we're not going to sell something that's dilutive, and that's not a particularly good market right now to sell something in. So our math says we're betting running it, getting the cash flow from it and keeping the asset right now than it is to sell it. Now if there's somebody that wants to build a business or has a business in New York that wants to pay what we think fair value is for it or more, we're happy to talk about that. But that's true probably pretty much of any asset we have, if somebody wants to pay us more than what it's worth. But we don't have any activity going on around Independence right now that -- in terms of selling that asset.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. And then just one more regarding the MPS amendment in Illinois. JCAR is running a little behind, I guess. If we don't get an answer until like late September, could that impact your plans to update with 3Q? Or is it kind of pretty immediate thereafter, you'll know?
Curtis Morgan: So depending on the timing, that could affect things, although I will tell you that the indications we're getting from MISO and Ameren, who are the two -- in terms of whether these would be needed for reliability purposes and whether -- because we've already done some prework on this. Already had both Ameren and MISO assess these plants. There could be a fairly quick action in terms of being able to retire the plant. So my sense is, is that under any scenario as it relates to JCAR that we will be able to retire these plants by the end of this year, and that's what we're counting on. I will also say, and I'm not sure that it's out yet. But I think we believe that we're going to be on the August 13, I can't remember if it's definite or not, but we're going to be on the -- what's that?
Molly Sorg: It's not definite.
Curtis Morgan: Okay. So it's not definite yet, but we think we're going to be on the August 13 JCAR agenda. And the reason we also know that is we're getting questions from JCAR staffers. So that's usually a sign you're going to be on the agenda. If we're on the agenda in August either - I think they may have two, maybe one on the 13 and one on the 28, if I remember correctly, there's going to be no issues of going through the process and then ultimately retiring plants by the end of the year, which is something that we would like to do. And clearly, we would also try be pretty well hedged up. And then we also like to do a fair amount of hedging around our retail business. We're - we don't take a lot of risk as we come into the summer as some do and leave a lot of open position there, especially in Texas. And so look, I think between those two, we'll be pretty well hedged up by the end of the year. But that could depend on just exactly where we see prices. What I also can tell you is that we look, we have a point of view. And we will measure any kind of hedging relative to where we think the market will ultimately settle, and we'll be disciplined about that.
Operator: This is all the time that we have for today's question. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Curtis Morgan: Well, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. As I stated at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. We hope that it's helpful. And we look forward to continuing the dialogue. As I mentioned earlier, I will mention this again, that in the third quarter, David and I are expect to have another sort of deep discussion around sort of long-term prospects for the company. We're doing a lot of work around that. And it's obvious that it's something that we should cover, and so we're going to do that on the third quarter call. I think it's instrumental to unlocking the long-term value of the company. So thank you for your time.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. My name is Jack and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy First Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's investor webcast covering first quarter 2019 results which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our 10-Q, and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation, and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the Appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning, to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. As you can see on Slide 6, Vistra finished the first quarter of 2019 reporting adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $815 million. Results are above consensus and in line with management's expectations for the quarter. Notably when compared to first quarter 2018 pro forma results for the merged Vistra and Dynergy entities, we finished the quarter nearly $240 million ahead of last year, primarily as a result of favorable realized wholesale prices in 2019, higher retail margins, and the realization of merger synergy and OP cost savings consistent with the estimated $565 million of annual EBITDA value levers we have announced. We also remain on track to capture the $310 million of additional after-tax free cash flow value levers from the merger which are bolstering our free cash flow generation and conversion percentage from EBITDA. On a smaller scale but equally important in advancing Vistra's operational and earnings diversity, we continue to expect we will be able to close the Crius Energy acquisition in the second quarter. At this point, the Department of Justice Review has expired and the Crius unitholders overwhelmingly voted to approve the acquisition at their special meeting held on March 28. We are still awaiting approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which we expect we could receive at any time in the coming weeks. We expect we will close the acquisition within five business days of receiving FERC approval. And we look forward to quickly integrating the Crius portfolio into our existing integrated platform. We have been working effectively with the Crius team on transition and integration and continue to be confident in the value of their retail portfolio. Turning now to Slide 7, we are reaffirming our 2019 ongoing operations guidance ranges of $3.22 billion to $3.42 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Our strong start to the year resulted in financial performance that was in line with management expectations for the quarter setting up for what we expect will be solid full-year results as we move into the important ERCOT Summer. While our first quarter results came in meaningfully above consensus, we are not resetting our full-year financial guidance at this time. There are a few important points to keep in mind as it relates to Vistra's first quarter performance. First, this year we had forecast internally that Vistra's retail margin would be higher in the first, second, and fourth quarters of the year, while lower in the third quarter as compared to historical performance. This expectation is due to the extreme peaky nature of the 2019 forward power curve with August heat rates forecasted to be meaningfully higher than historical averages, thereby altering the comparative dispersion of annual retail cost of goods sold. Second, as you know, the bulk of our wholesale earnings come in the third quarter of the year, and meaningful retail EBITDA's produced in the non-summer periods. As we have important earnings periods ahead, it is premature to alter guidance even though we remain optimistic especially with regard to strong pricing in ERCOT this summer given the tight reserve margin environment. And one last reminder, as it relates to our 2019 guidance, we have not yet incorporated the expected contribution from the Crius acquisition into our numbers but we'll do so following the closing of the transaction. Beyond 2019, we continue to anticipate that our integrated business model will generate relatively stable earnings. We still expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA will be relatively flat to 2019, which as you will recall, is a marked improvement from Dynegy's pre-merger forecasts. Prior to the merger, Dynegy's forecast for 2020 and 2021 reflected anticipated declining EBITDA due principally to lower capacity revenues in PJM. We now expect we'll be able to close that EBITDA gap as a result of improvements in forward-curve, high wholesale market conditions in ERCOT, and enhanced management expectations or merger value lever achievement. Creating earnings and cash flow profiles in consistent ranges is of critical importance to Vistra, as we continue to attract new long-term investors to the stock. We believe we will be able to achieve these consistent results in the future as a result of our diversified earnings profile especially in our retail business when capacity revenues were roughly half of our EBITDA derived and in the money generation fleet combined with the execution of our hedging strategies by our commercial team. Our retail operations also lead the charge in our ability to convert a significant amount of our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations into adjusted free cash flow. We expect this conversion ratio will be approximately 66% in 2019 which benefits from the Dynegy free cash flow and tax value levers and is meaningfully higher than the free cash flow conversion observed in other commodity exposed capital intensive businesses that trade at a considerably more favorable free cash flow yields. Our strong free cash flow conversion profile supports our diverse capital allocation plan which we announced in November of 2018 and is actively being implemented today. As of April 25, we had executed a total of $1.053 billion of our aggregate $1.75 billion share repurchase program authorization. As a result, we now have approximately 483 million shares outstanding as of April 25, and approximately 8% reduction as compared to the number of shares outstanding at the time of the Dynegy merger close. We still have nearly 700 million available for opportunistic repurchases under the program. So long as our stock is trading at the current high free cash flow yield and what we believe is a meaningful discount to fair value, we expect we will continue to allocate capital towards share repurchases, although our stock price is certainly moving in the right direction. In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend on March 29 of this year to shareholders of record as of March 15. The quarterly dividend was $0.125 per share or $0.50 per share on an annualized basis. We expect we will grow the dividend at approximately 6% to 8% per share annually going forward and can support this growth through disciplined investments such as the Crius acquisition, the Upton 2 solar and battery storage project, and the Moss Landing battery storage development opportunity. And last, but certainly not least, we believe we remain on track to achieve our long-term leverage target in the range of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year-end 2020. As you've heard before, balance sheet strength is a core tenet of Vistra's operating model and we plan to manage our business and cash flows accordingly with the opportunity to continue to improve our credit profile which we believe strengthens our business and ultimately our stock price. We are seeing our view materialize that our diverse capital allocation plan will attract new long-term investors. In the first four months of 2019, we have continued to withstand selling pressure from our two of our top five largest shareholders Oaktree and Apollo with relatively strong performance in our stock price. We believe this stability in our valuation has only been possible because we have been able to successfully attract new investors into the stock. As 2019 runs its course, we expect our shareholder rotation will be meaningfully complete which has helped to unlock the true value of Vistra's equity as we continue to meet investor expectations and execute on our financial and operational goals. While we were making progress, it is our view that our free cash flow yield remains inordinately high and hence our stock price is very attractive. I'm now on Slide 8. The topic I know has been at the forefront of discussion in our sector relates to expectations for the 2019 ERCOT Summer as well as logic behind the backwardated forward curve we're observing in the market. It is our view that the backwardation in the forward curves is dislocated from market fundamentals in particular beginning in 2021. As you can see in the chart on Slide 8 which is based on the ERCOT capacity demand and reserve reports or CDR, adjusted for the announced Gibbons Creek and Oklaunion retirements reserve margins are forecast to remain very low through 2023 reaching levels that are less than half of the targeted reserve margin ERCOT recommends by 2023. These anticipated low reserve margins are a product of projected 2% annual load growth in ERCOT, combined with relatively low new thermal generation coming online over the next several years. While both Vistra and ERCOT expect sizable new generation to be added to the market in the form of solar and wind assets, the intermittent nature had relatively low capacity factors of these assets is likely insufficient to offset the current shortfall of generation in ERCOT and the anticipated load growth in the state. As a result, we expect that the supply and demand balance will continue to be favorable for the foreseeable future. In addition, it is important to note that there remains 10,000 to 15,000 megawatts plus of thermal generation at risk in ERCOT that will likely act as a long-term supply and demand calibration feature in the market. And given that the new build will likely be wind and solar coming in much lower megawatt increments, the market reaction and calibration should be quicker and less volatile with a lower likelihood of the market getting overbuilt and resulting in prolonged depressed pricing. Despite these implied tight supply demand dynamics, ERCOT forward curves are materially backwardated with 2023 North Hub around the clock prices currently forecast to be nearly 30% lower than 2019 prices. This level of backwardation is clearly just located from market fundamentals; it is likely a result of uncertainty with market participants driving a lack of liquidity in the out years. In 2021 and beyond for example long-dated power purchase agreements are currently setting the price of power. This relatively small portion of transaction activity is not representative of where the market will ultimately settle as we get closer and closer to the prompt period. Ironically, it is the backwardated nature of the forward curve that should keep new thermal generation on the sidelines in ERCOT and to some extent renewables. Furthermore as renewables build out in the West, there will be congestion and discounted pricing further adversely impacting new build economics. Notably, district is a net long generator carrying at least 1,200 megawatts of length into the important summer months, some of which is used as a physical insurance against swings in retail load or to protect against an unplanned outage in our generation fleet. The physical link we hold as insurance and keep unhedged in the summer is critical to minimizing our risk profile and reducing our exposure to the $9,000 megawatt hour price caps in ERCOT which is an advantage we have over the many retailers who must manage their volatile ERCOT summer short position without physical assets. Turning now to Slide 9. I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the latest regulatory and legislative updates in MISO and PJM. As many of you are aware, Vistra's supporting legislation introduced in the Illinois General Assembly by State Senator Michael Hastings and State Representative Luis Arroyo of the Illinois Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Act. Before I get into the details, I would like to emphasize that our support for this legislation is a reaction to the completely ineffective and dysfunctional MISO market construct which has not improved after years of attempts by market participants. This is very much in contrast to PJM and ISO New England where both markets are functioning relatively well if not for unwarranted out of market activity particularly the nuclear subsidies. If our assets were in PJM and not MISO, we would not be discussing the similar form of legislation. Moving on to the details, if passed in its current form the legislation would redevelop downstate coal plant sites into utility scale solar and energy storage platforms while also providing a path to responsibly retire existing downstate coal capacity. While it's always difficult to predict the outcome of the legislative process in Illinois, we do believe that at least some or all components of the proposed coal to solar legislation have a reasonable opportunity included in a broader energy reform package. The legislation is designed to help the state achieve its long-term Greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets, incentivize in local investment and communities, and transition to downstate generation portfolio without negatively impacting grid reliability, all while having a minimal total impact on customers monthly bills. We believe the various components of the bill adequately address the ultimate goals of interested parties and we look forward to supporting the legislation as it advances. Also in MISO, we remain supportive of the amendment to the multi-pollutant standard that is pending before the Illinois Pollution Control Board and believe it will ultimately be approved by both the Board as well as the Illinois Joint Commission on Administrative Rules. The amendment if approved would allow Vistra to manage the emissions of its downstate coal plants as one fleet with overall lower mass-based tonnage cap. These amendments would provide Vistra the flexibility to operate its fleet in a manner that is the most economic while reducing overall total emissions. If the amendment is approved as draft, which we suspect could occur in the Summer timeframe, Vistra would be required to file with MISO to retire 2 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in MISO Zone 4 within 30 days. MISO then has 26 weeks to perform their reliability analysis which could put retirements in the late fourth quarter of 2019 to early first quarter of 2020. We believe MISO's reliability analysis could conclude prior to the 26 week deadline and we do not believe any of the plants will be necessary for reliability. Our preliminary analysis suggests that these retirements could be approximately $50 million to $100 million a year accretive to Vistra's long-term EBITDA profile as some of our existing MISO assets are EBITDA and free cash flow negative in the current market environment. We will keep you posted on the potential fleet rationalization as the MPS amendment progresses through the administrative approval process. As for PJM, in April, FERC approved the tariff change related to fast-start pricing. The order would allow units that can start within one hour and have a minimum runtime of no greater than one hour to set the locational marginal price. The order would also allow commitment prices to be reflected in wholesale energy prices. Even though the fourth quarter was ultimately more conservative than the tariff modifications requested by FERC, we believe the order is a positive step forward for price formation in PJM. We estimate the impact of the order could be an improvement in around the clock prices by approximately $0.50 a megawatt hour, so it is difficult to discern how much of this benefit was already embedded in the forward curve. Vistra's PJM generation fleet is well-positioned to benefit from this pricing reform as Vistra operates a relatively young low heat rate fleet. We expect in general all of our base low coal assets in CCGT should be online when the price data is triggered and we'll realize the higher locational marginal cost. While we do clear most of these assets in the day head market, we would expect the day head in real time market to converge over time. And as forwards reflect the new price formation, we will have the opportunity to hedge into this uplift. The changes are targeted to be implemented in November of 2019, so we do not expect a meaningful change to current year results. Now the order is an improvement in the market structure which is a positive for Vistra overall. Similarly reserve pricing reforms are currently in front of FERC as part of a PJM 206 filing which allows FERC to derive their own outcome in any final order. The reserve pricing reforms would effectively allow all generating units providing reserves to be paid for this service and a related change to the operating reserve demand curve would set an administrative price for reserves under certain operating reserve levels. Our very preliminary analysis suggests that these credential market reforms could lift around the clock prices at PJM by more than $0.50 per megawatt hour. As it relates to the status of the pending PJM capacity reforms, we still do not have any indication on when we might receive direction from FERC on this topic. PJM has notified FERC of its intent to foresee with the next auction in August and we are supportive of this approach as it allows parties to continue to advance the ball for 2022 and 2023 delivery year, although it does not address the price suppressive effects of the out of market activity most notably the nuclear subsidies. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call in February, we continue to believe the outcome of the capacity reform process will be at worst neutral to the current state given FERC's view that the existing capacity auction cost structure is unjust and unreasonable due to the anti-competitive impact of out of market subsidies. Action from FERC to neutralize these impacts will be even more important with the proliferation of nuclear subsidies that are becoming all too common place. We continue to be perplexed how state-elected officials can justify awarding subsidies to nuclear units that have shown no indication of economic need. While there are certainly some nuclear assets are economically challenged in the current market environment, it is our view that those assets are the minority. Yet nuclear subsidies are being considered very broadly. It is highly objectionable that the owners of these nuclear plants are holding the state-elected officials, utility commissions, and employees' hostage by threatening retirement of economic units. We remain cautiously optimistic FERC will find a solution that appropriately neutralizes these subsidies continuing its past practice of promoting balanced market reforms and supporting competitive markets. FERC has historically played a strong and decisive role in protecting markets against actions that are unjust and unreasonable regardless of any perceived notion that the markets they are charged to oversee are perfectly competitive or not after all what market is. We believe it is highly likely the outcome of FERC's deliberations on this matter will result in a neutral to modestly positive impact on capacity pricing in PJM especially given the more serious proposals in front of FERC. For example, even the PJM FRR proposal deploys PJM wide reserve margin in matching generation and load which if deployed would likely result into similar auction results to the existing market design only potentially in a just and reasonable manner. Properly designed mover [ph] would likely improve outcomes but only modestly. We should expect FERC to construct an order that creates a fairly functioning market not an outcome driven result that automatically improves pricing. PJM has healthy reserve margins and the market has contributed a steady margin over the past several years of approximately $9 to $11 per KW month for combined cycle plants, an outcome we believe is reasonable consistent under the circumstances. What we expect FERC to do is to ensure the market does not further erode given the aggressive nature of the out of market activity. In a nutshell, FERC must ensure just and reasonable markets despite state energy policies. Last, there has been meaningful chatter in the market about Exelon and Illinois exercising an FRR option under current rules to completely carve out its ComEd load serving this load with Exelon's nuclear units. For several reasons, we believe the potential risk of such an action to other generators have been overblown. First, we do not see Illinois as even eligible for the FRR option under the existing rules as there is a requirement that a load serving entity electing the FRR alternative demonstrate the ability to serve all of the load in its FRR service areas because Illinois has retail choice, ComEd does not serve all of the load in its service territory and is therefore not eligible to use the FRR alternative in our view. Second, ignoring this complication, if the Illinois Power Authority were to run an option to contract for the necessary resources, we believe it would be challenging for Illinois Power Authority to structure the auction in a way that would ensure the Exelon nuclear units are selected without running a follow first affiliate abuse rules. If you assume however that Illinois is able to bridge these hurdles, we still believe any resulting impact of the residual ComEd zone to PJM will be relatively immaterial as Illinois would not only need to take out the entire ComEd load but it would also have to cover the reserve margin requirement which should result in the balance of the market being relatively unaffected. Moreover if Illinois is successful in pursuing its intent to rotate away from coal towards renewables we believe the retirement of coal plants in ComEd and throughout Illinois could provide upside for ComEd gas plants on both the capacity and energy fronts as despatchable gas can take advantage of the greater energy price volatility that is typically present when base load assets are replaced with intermittent renewables. Given our approximately $175 million per year of PJM ComEd capacity revenue, any reasonable downside outcome would likely be in the $20 million per year range or less which is relatively immaterial to our overall EBITDA profile. In summary, we feel very good about the ERCOT market where we drive over 50% of our EBITDA and have a big seat at the table. PJM and ISO New England have seen several changes in market design over the years especially as it relates to capacity but these changes have largely resulted in improved markets. We expect that to continue but it will always be a hard fought battle. We also believe any downside scenarios in PJM and ISO New England are limited and less impactful to District given the size of our EBITDA and the diverse nature of our revenue streams. In fact, we expect MISO to be an upside after execution in 2019 and California has been a nice surprise to the upside for our portfolio. We are also on track to add future EBITDA from the Crius acquisition and the Moss Landing battery storage project. We remain optimistic about this visibility to generate relatively robust and stable earnings in the years ahead and we are not taking our eye off the ball. I will now turn the call over to Bill Holden.
Bill Holden: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 11. Vistra delivered first quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $815 million with both the retail and wholesale business units delivering results that were in line with management expectations for the quarter. Retail reported solid adjusted EBITDA for the quarter as a result of strong cost management and operational performance. The generation segments also collectively finished the quarter in line with management expectations as March weather drove favorable results in ERCOT for the quarter offsetting headwinds from a mild winter in PJM and New England. These results underscore the value of Vistra's diversified business operations which can mitigate earnings volatility from external factors such as weather or regulatory changes supporting Vistra's ability to deliver stable EBITDA across periods. Both segment results from this quarter can be found on Slide 15 in the Appendix. Also in the Appendix Slides 21 and 22 include our updated hedge positions for all markets in 2019 and 2020 reflecting an increase in hedges over the first quarter. Our commercial team continues to take advantage of the volatility and forward curves that incrementally hedge at prices that we perceive to be attractive. This hedging activity further supports our expected ability to generate relatively stable EBITDA over time. Before I move off of this slide, I also want to highlight the meaningful increase in Vistra's first quarter 2019 results as compared to the adjusted EBITDA of the pro forma merge Vistra and Dynegy entities in the first quarter of 2018. 2019 results were nearly $240 million higher as a result of favorable realized prices in 2019, higher retail gross margins, and the realization of merger value levers that continue to create value for our shareholders. Finally, let's turn to Slide 12 for the quarterly capital structure update. Vistra's long-term debt outstanding as of March 31 remained at approximately $11.1 billion. We are still forecasting we'll repay approximately $800 million of senior notes in 2019 as we work toward achieving our long-term leverage target of approximately 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year-end 2020. We will also continue to opportunistically optimize our balance sheet through refinancing transactions in the future and we are continuing to allocate capital towards opportunistic share repurchases under our previously announced share repurchase program. We also paid our first quarterly dividend in March and announced a tuck-in retail growth acquisition in February with the planned acquisition of Crius, a transaction we expect we'll be able to close in the second quarter. Our meaningful free cash flow generation is supporting this diverse capital allocation plan which we believe will continue to attract interest from new long-only investors in our stock. We have been receiving great feedback on our business model and as you know, we take input from our debt and equity holders very seriously. In the meantime, we look forward to focusing on execution and delivering on our commitments in 2019. With that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shahriar Pourreza: So just on MISO to start-off a couple of questions here. So it sounds like Curt, you remain confident that when the legislative session Illinois ends at the end of the month, we should see a positive outcome with the Coal to Solar Act. So the two gigawatts that would retire under the MPS agreement should obviously the Pollution Board accepted, how and when could we sort of see an OPI update in the context of your accretion guidance, you just highlighted. Is it sort of a fourth quarter driver or could we see visibility sooner?
Curt Morgan: And so lot of things in that. Number one, I will never predict the outcome of a legislative session in particular in my home state of Illinois. So I would say this sure that I actually think it's probably less than 50% that will get energy legislation in this session. I think we're in May the session ends within a month and I think things happen really quick with legislation in the state legislatures. But I would handicap it less than 50%. But in Illinois, they have the VETO session which is in November and I do think there is a higher probability that something gets done on energy with a new Governor and he's got other priorities. I just don't know that we'll see legislation on energy which is not in the top three or four priorities of the state. I'm not sure we'll get it done in this legislative session but I think ultimately in the VETO session, we have a reasonable chance. I mean it's hard to predict any kind of legislation. I think this one makes a lot of sense because we're cycling out coal and in the State of Illinois, I think that's really what the state and the citizens want to see. But we're also bridging the gap for downstate markets where many of these plants are very small communities that need property tax base and so it allows for a rotation of that property tax base. And it's also in an orderly fashion where we make sure that the electricity market doesn't get shocked quickly with a significant amount of retirements and prices rise quickly. So I think there's an opportunity there. With regard to this OPI and the interrelationship that that has with the overall MISO profitability, the way we see this is that we can either achieve OPI results which are with some of these assets or we into the extent that the OPI is not enough to reduce the negative EBITDA and the negative free cash flow to a positive situation then we will retire those plants either way, if there will be a significant EBITDA improvement, I think we gave those numbers that's $50 million to $100 million. And then the last part of your question, I think is around just generally the OP update. I think that is more of a probably a third quarter earnings call timing that we would probably talk about whether there is an increase, a further increase in our OP efforts. I think things are going well and so but we're not prepared yet. As I told you guys before, we want to prove this stuff up before we come out with it. And I think we need between now and sort of the third quarter call to get that done. So I think I hope those answer all your questions.
Shahriar Pourreza: No, that's perfect. And then just on around ERCOT, obviously thanks for the incremental thoughts around the dynamics down there and there's obviously been some better arguments and obviously it was somewhat of a healthy print for the quarter. So to what degree was the impact in the quarter from like sort of what you saw with the early March cold snap or additional sort of run times at a Dayton or West Hub peakers with access to cheap law.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So I think most of it was really March and that was really predominantly where the strength of the quarter, we did have a good quarter. So I look at it like an NBA basketball game. I mean you can look at first quarter but you'd better show up in the fourth quarter and you're never going to know who is going to win until you get there. But we like what we did in this quarter. But I think it was really in ERCOT, it was a March -- it was a March driven quarter for us really.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly on the capital allocation, $700 million is less than the buyback. You've got a very healthy dividend that's in place now. You kind of alluded to how you're thinking about capital allocation 2.0 you did obviously highlight given where the stock trades incremental buybacks are obviously that are out there. How are you sort of thinking about potentially additional retail deals and when do you sort of plan to update on a new phase of your capital allocation strategy?
Curt Morgan: So, good question. On retail, I think we are optimistic obviously, we'll close relatively soon in Crius, I think I've said this before. That was the one acquisition that we wanted to do. And when Crius came in play, we wanted to make that happen. We were able to do that and it does advance us significantly in these retail markets outside of Texas also helps us in Texas too. But I wouldn't expect anything in particular in 2019 around any kind of retail acquisition. What I think we're really focused on is we have the retail expansion strategy that we talked about before which was an organic strategy. And I think we're going to be focused given that we now have this catalyst in Crius to accelerate that expansion opportunity, we think it's a very good base to do that. So I wouldn't -- I don't know that we'll see really any kind of deployment in the acquisitions for retail in 2019. It's hard for me to say beyond 2019 though when we get into 2020 or 2021 on retail because it is an area, we'd like to grow. And so if there was an opportunity that suit our fancy, we would take a hard look at it. I think both retail and renewables are the areas where you could see the company expand through investment. And but I don't know that there's any in both of those categories; there's anything big on the forefront. I think this is going to be done more on a bit-by-bit basis for right now. And in particular given that 2019 is really -- we really have earmarked what we're going to do with the cash in 2019 later this year, we're going to obviously pay down a lot of debt we need to do that. We are held on getting to this 2.5 times range. And in 2022, we are going to pay down a lot of debt. Any kind of additional cash we would have, we would always balance as we always have, we balance between when we want to buyback our stock which will be a function of where it trades and whether we want to put it, deploy it, invest it in the business and those -- that's an economic analysis and we'll do that at the right time. I do believe though that we will be up for a discussion around capital allocation. I think at the end of this year probably third quarter, fourth quarter, because I do believe as we've executed on a big chunk of the capital allocation throughout 2019, we can then begin to talk about 2020 and 2021. We'll be given guidance on 2020 and we always like to give you guys a little bit of a preview of the following year. So we'll give a preview on 2021 and in that context, I think the company also then needs to talk about how they're thinking about capital allocation. So that's how, I'd expect that timing to come out.
Operator: Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Abe Azar: Good morning. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Abe.
Abe Azar: Hey. So your estimates for the first reform in PJM is well below numbers, we've heard elsewhere. How much of that is due to the revisions that FERC kind of required versus initial expectations from others being too high?
Curt Morgan: I think it's a fair amount of what the ultimate order came out to be. I don't -- when we had done the work previously, our numbers were not that far off. We were probably a little bit shy of what others were saying but we were in that general ballpark. I think it's really our interpretation of the order and the impact of the order which was the big reason why it's different than what the other estimates that are out there.
Abe Azar: Got it. Thanks for that. And then do you have any updates on potential non-core asset divestitures and could that be avenue to return to more capital?
Curt Morgan: Yes, good question on that front. So look we -- I guess I talk about it now. I mean we took a look at it and the market just wasn't there. We don't feel like we have a gun at the head in terms of generating additional cash that we weren't going to do a dilutive deal. And that's kind of what we were faced with. And I don't really want to get into what assets we were looking at because that's can be disruptive to the workforce and all kinds of things. But we took a look out there. We're always constantly be in the market assessing where the market is and whether there are what I'd call "non-strategic assets" that we could part with, if somebody is willing to pay more than we think they're worth. But we didn't get to the finish line where we felt like the deal was sufficient enough for us to pull the trigger. And so we felt like we'd rather run these assets than to do something that was dilutive and just not economic from our standpoint. But we're always open to if there is a better use of capital and if somebody thinks that something that we own currently is worth more in their hands, we're all ears and we will test the market from time-to-time.
Abe Azar: Got it. That makes sense. And then just a small clarification on Illinois, the $50 million to $100 million, I believe that was an EBITDA number, is that corresponding free cash flow impact as well with the maintenance capital?
Curt Morgan: On the free cash flow, hang on let me just a second. Sara, you are going to say?
Sara Graziano: I think they were not eligible for capitalization without the cash flows.
Bill Holden: Right, right.
Curt Morgan: Yes, that’s what I was going to say. Okay, thank you. I'm glad I didn't say any stupid. I think they're one and the same because the way it works because these assets we've brought them over we did not capitalize them because they had no real ongoing value. Everything we spend on those assets, say, it goes to expense. We don't capitalize anything with regard to the MISO assets. So the EBITDA and the free cash flow numbers are the same.
Operator: Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks, good morning guys. Sorry to beat a dead horse here but I just want to be clear that I don't conflate the two different opportunities you're seeking in MISO, just resolving the multi-pollutant standard amendment issue either through getting it and being able to optimize the fleet or not getting it and closing those units equates to about $50 million to $100 million or is it both of them together, the coal to solar and the multiple?
Curt Morgan: It’s just Greg -- I'm sorry this is confusing to me certainly but it's just the fifth center -- just the MPS and the optimization of the fleet. The transition payments as well as any EBITDA we would get off of the solar and the battery storage facilities are all incremental to that. So that is purely optimization of the fleet without any of the coal to solar and battery legislation.
Greg Gordon: No, it wasn't confusing; I'm just a little slow on Friday after 50 earnings. Thank you for clearing it up. The second question is you said you're going to give us an update. Obviously, 2020 guidance and talk about directionally where 2021 -- what 2021 looks like later in the year. I appreciate that but in the past you've said that you thought your business model would support EBITDA in a pretty tight range without much backwardation going out through time. I think if sell-side analysts were to sort of just mark their models to market for the decline -- 5% decline in the forward curve in Texas, we've seen since February that it would look like your EBITDA's backwardated. So to avoid investors sort of how do you give investors confidence that they will not just rely on that forward mark because you know the sell-side analysts and even investors -- most investors tend to just use the mark, the market which probably show backwardation here and I don't think that's the way you think that business is going to trend. So can you give us a little help with that?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So a couple. First of all, I think that's a very good question. And so I tried to talk a little bit about that in the script but I'll get into a little bit more. I think we also -- we believe in ERCOT for example that 2021, 2022, and 2023 that the backwardation in the curve is not fundamentally driven but it's more transactionally driven by a very small portion of transactions in the market meaning it's thinly traded. And we think it's a bit overdone out there. I will tell you that prices are likely going to be lower in 2021 and 2022 and 2023 than probably what they are in 2019. I think 2019 is probably a peak of the low-end of the reserve margin but that's all a function of what gets into ultimately gets built. But I do think that curve is a heck of a lot flatter. So one thing is I just think we're going to see higher contribution from the curves. We also talked about many times, the market is going to ebb and flow and we're going to have opportunities as the market increases or decreases pricing anyway in the forward curves based on views of tightness and we will be able to hedge into that. And I think we could construct a realized price curve that will be better and we've done this historically better than what you're seeing in 2021, 2022, 2023. The other thing is we have the Crius EBITDA, we have the up -- not up until, we have the Moss Landing and I'm sure we'll have some other things. So I believe that there are some things that are already baked into the system. And then the MISO uplift of $50 million to $100 million. So I'm pretty darn confident right now. I wouldn't go out to 2023 but I feel pretty good about that, remember, I've talked about this $3 billion plus number. I think we can achieve the $3 billion plus and I'll try to make that case. I mean we're not a sector where at least right now where the underlying product is growing much more than 2% in Texas and roughly 1% or less in other markets. And so for me to sit here and try to tell you that we're going to grow off of what is going to be hopefully a very big number in 2019, I can't tell you that. But what I've been trying to tell you guys is that we're a $3 billion plus a year EBITDA company. And what's more important than that is we're going to drop down 65% to 70% of that to free cash flow which is highly significant. So I think that's really who we are. I think we're a value play at the end of the day, we've got a good strong dividend, we expect to grow, and then we're going to have significant amount of cash, we can deploy some of that back into the company to grow EBITDA and we turned some of that to shareholders. That's just for energy, that's who we are. But I do stand by this $3 billion plus number. And I feel like we will be able to hit those numbers and that's what we're shooting for.
Operator: Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey can you hear me?
Curt Morgan: Hey Julien, how are you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good, thank you. I wanted to follow-up with a couple of items here. So just from a timeline perspective, just wanted to understand your comments earlier about the updates with third quarter, if they transpired that we don't have legislation in hand quite yet, right given the VETO session and all that in Illinois. And I know you don't want to necessarily predict that but just in terms of providing updates. Could we get an OP update with the third quarter timeframe even without some of the clarity in Illinois? And then separately later on whatever happens get a separate and discrete update on the future of the asset spend?
Curt Morgan: Yes, yes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. One does not preclude the other. Yes. Okay. We're just looking to clarify. And then separately just to understand the process itself. How are you thinking about the implications of legislation just in terms of leverage you have focusing more on the PJM side of the equation rather than necessarily the MISO leverage that you have at present that you've gone over already?
Curt Morgan: Well look, I mean you guys know this that there is a -- the way it works in Illinois, there's a big player and it's Exelon and I know that. And so Exelon is going to make some moves in Illinois. We think what we're doing is consistent with the things, they want to do. And so that's just the way Illinois goes. And so we don't have the big seat at the table that Exelon does. What I do think we have is, we have a very compelling and I think fair proposal. It's not a greedy proposal and it has a lot for everybody. It has something for the local communities. It has something for the environmental groups in terms of getting a certainty around what's going to happen with the coal fleet. And it also has reinvestment in renewables where that's where the state wants to go. And I think it's reasonably priced and in terms of its total impact on a customer bill, it's minuscule. And so I think we have -- we have a -- what I would consider, we have a lot of good things in that legislation which is why I think it has some strength. It's yet to be seen, where how high the support for it will go. But we've actually had really good reception on this legislation. I'm going to Illinois to spend a couple of days here pretty soon; I'll get a better read of that when I get there. Julien and I can always, we can pass that along through Molly and other, when we get back but I think that's why I say I think it's a reasonable shot here especially if energy, a broad energy reform bill gets moved in Illinois. And I still think that's got a better chance in the VETO session in this current session. But if it does get moved, I think there's a really good chance that this could get tacked onto it. And so that's why I feel pretty good about what can happen in Illinois. And clearly, PJM is a bigger, a bigger deal for us. I mean we've got more megawatts. Our retail business is going to end up being bigger there ultimately. And so that means a lot to the company and so we -- when we emphasize our time, we spend a lot of time around PJM. It's pretty simple. I think I can't remember the numbers but I think it's like 90-plus-percent comes from ERCOT, PJM and ISO New England in that order. And so we do spend a lot of time and I've spent time in Pennsylvania, I've spent time in Ohio because of the nuclear subsidy efforts that are going on there. And so we do put a lot of emphasis around PJM because it is important to our company.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A quick follow-up, if you don't mind more of a detailed question just 1Q adjusted EBITDA obviously straightforward. How do you think about cash flow for the quarter just to get it out there [indiscernible]?
Bill Holden: Yes, Julien so adjusted free cash flow from ongoing ops for the quarter was $395 million. Now that's about I think a 48% convergent ratio. But if you recall, we have some fairly lumpy outflows in Q1 that don't recur in the rest of the year. Those would include property tax payments and also the timing of annual incentive payout.
Operator: Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Hi good morning. Just I know this is you don't necessarily know this information but just curious Curt, if you have any sense on any updates on the selling shareholders on what we might see when they report holdings, I guess in mid-May?
Curt Morgan: I do know that the two large shareholders have and this is significant for our -- for the tax free nature of the spin that we had. We basically win, we became Vistra. But I think they're both below 5%. In terms of exactly where they are, Molly, probably has a better sense of that. I really Steve, I don't know exactly but Molly would you have anything to add around kind of where they are?
Molly Sorg: Not exact positions but definitely they've both been selling in the first quarter.
Curt Morgan: Yes. And we do know that that's the other thing, Steve, is that we know they've been active selling. And so I just don't have the exact numbers but I expect that we're going to see a pretty -- a pretty material move in their holdings when it's 13 has to come out. I think we're going to see a pretty precipitous move here. The nice thing I would tell you is that I think both Oaktree and Apollo have sort of settled into a selling operation, if you will, that's been kind of ratable, systematic, and I think my own, I don't talk to them about this, this is not my business. But I think we try to do some large trade, those tend to send signals to the market. They tend to be a little bit disruptive. I will tell you that the banks that actually execute them sometimes get a little ahead of themselves and create issues. And so they've kind of backed away from that and they're doing this more in a very systematic way. And I think because of that, we've seen that -- we've been able to sort of incrementally move the stock price up while they're doing that. And I like that better but I think they've moved quite a bit. I just don't have a guess at the numbers.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One other question, just you and NRG had much different retail kind of outcomes this quarter. I think it's mainly just due to the way, they do their transfer pricing. But just maybe if could you give a view of kind of just retail trends in ERCOT and just how you're seeing margins, customer account things like that?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So I will speak just quickly on us and ERCOT. I mean we -- I mean us and NRG. NRG does more of an average transfer price and we do not the pricing to retail in that market at any given point in time. So we should see lower margin -- contribution margins in retail and EBITDA in the third quarter than what NRG will see. And so I don't guide NRG that's just generally what we know about how it works. And we liked what we do it, the same they liked what they do it and that is a difference and that's so, I think that is a difference in this quarter for us versus them. Not the only difference but that's one of them. In terms of what was the other question -- was just generally around retail.
Steve Fleishman: It was just the overall trends. Yes.
Curt Morgan: That's generally around retail. I mean we did have a bit of attrition in the first quarter but very small attrition. We grew accounts last year; we still feel like that we have a shot at having a pretty good year on terms of residential attrition and small business because we're going to see some really peaky pricing in the summer. And sometimes what happens, when that happens is that we tend to get customers coming our way. In our guidance, we do have some net attrition. We always do. But we feel pretty good in a higher price environment we sometimes see customers come our way and we're obviously working toward that. We'll see. And then of course I think NRG said this, and I think I wouldn't say it again is that you never know what could happen this summer but some big books could come our way. I did say that we're not looking to do any real acquisitions but sometimes in this type of environment, if a retailer is not prepared well enough and we get some really spiky costs, we may see some opportunities to take on some additional customers from somebody that can't make it. So that could come our way as well. In terms of just margins, I would just say that our margins continue to be strong. I think our team does a tremendous job on how we price. And we're very cognizant of the attrition levels of our customers and so it's always a balance in terms of how much price you want to move someone up when wholesale prices go up and also being able to retain that customer. We tend to take a long-term view but over time, we're able to move prices up as the market moves up and we've got a very sophisticated and analytical group that helps us think through what's the right time to do that. Jim, I don't know if you have anything?
Jim Burke: Yes, Curt. The only thing I would add, Steve this is Jim Burke. The market all retailers entering 2019 were facing a higher annual power cost entering 2019 than they were facing entering 2018. That's on the order of about $10 a megawatt hour on the 7X24 basis. And then when you shape it then you have swing and ancillary just about a $15 increase. All of that was really showing up in third quarter pricing. So as Curt said we're trying to levelize our prices for our customers, our experienced quarter one 2018 versus quarter one 2019, power costs since we are transferring at market that did not vary much at all. But our revenue was higher in Q1 2019 in anticipation of having to deal with this higher annualized power cost. That's why Curt was emphasizing the margin for retail is really going to be in Q1, Q2, and Q4 because we're all climbing not only a rising curve but a peak year curve in 3Q. And so that's just a little bit of the financial dynamic that's different. I would say that's generally true across all retailers. The difference in intercompany may be if one company prices differently between segments and we do it on a monthly shape basis like the market unfolds.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Did that help, Steve?
Steve Fleishman: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So two quick questions. So on the Waha granted only a few of your plants really benefit from the weakness in this gas price but is there a way to actually tap into this hub with more generation assets. And then secondly, we've seen quite a dramatic move in RA prices in California. How does it -- how is it impacting Oakland and/or anything round Moss Landing before you actually start building your battery? Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Okay. I just want to make sure we will get to that last piece. I think the first piece was around just the Permian Basin and the advantage pricing, Angie is that right? And just kind of how that -- how do we think about it?
Angie Storozynski: Yes. I mean in the past you mentioned that there is that you're working potentially on sourcing gas from Waha for more of your gas plants.
Curt Morgan: Yes, yes, okay. So well as it relates to what's happening right now on the ground. First of all, I want to -- because I know there's been a lot of interest as to how much could this end up being in terms of this favorability in our guidance. I mean look I will tell you that both Odessa and then our Peakers that we have out there, either plants have done well because we're actually getting paid in some instances to take gas. It's not material enough because we just don't have as much capacity out there. But I mean it is -- when we build our guidance and our plans and I think you guys know this, at the end of the day we have value that we expect to get because we're in multiple markets. We have multiple revenue streams and there's a lot of optionality in our fleet. It's not necessarily defined but we know we will achieve it. And so part of that value in this particular year of that bucket, I think is partly being filled by the fact that we have a better gas price or fuel price, we are spilling up the bucket to get to the guidance. And so that's why we're not moving things around. Plus it's just not material enough to do that. In terms of your question about can other plants benefit? The reality is right now just because of the pipes that benefit is exclusively in the Permian area. We're not able to get that but we are advantaged with some of our plants because we see discount pricing off of some of the price points that we have. It's still the case that the Houston Ship Channel gas price, the units that use Houston Ship Channel gas price still set the price for power from many of our plants discounted gas price relative to the Houston Ship Channel. Today that's the reality. That may shift a little bit as the pipelines get built and a lot of gas wants to find its way to the ship channel but that's also a function of LNG but also just the overall balancing of the system because this system will be more balanced in that scenario because there's a heck of a lot more pipes down there than there are in the West Texas area which is the real problem. So I don't expect us to get a big advantage, incremental advantage from Permian gas prices for our other fleet that's outside of the Permian Basin in Texas. But we already have an advantage of some of our plants because we have discounted gas pricing. So that -- there was another question.
Angie Storozynski: So I was trying to gauge, if there is a way for you to benefit from the recent move up in RA or capacity crisis in California?
Curt Morgan: Well, I think we have. So in my comments, I probably there is a little bit vague on it but I talked about the fact that California has been a nice upside surprise for us and it's really because of that. But also there's been some issues around gas which has pushed up power pricing and we saw that last summer, we may see that again this summer. And so Moss Landing actually -- for Moss Landing EBITDA, we've seen probably a roughly 20% increase in EBITDA off of just Moss Landing, less so at Oakland, that's not really getting much of that. And then of course we still feel like Moss Landing, we're working on may have another opportunity at Moss Landing for another battery storage project and we've got a couple other opportunities at Oakland on that side for battery storage as well. So what we like about California is we think we can create a reasonable EBITDA out of something that we would pay for and we didn't expect to really have much of an EBITDA. But your point is exactly right. And Moss Landing has benefited and we expect it to continue to benefit. And what we're finding is and this is why we made the statement about Illinois is these flexible combined cycle plants in markets that have significant intermittent resources actually can see times where they actually are used more and actually can see higher pricing.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. As I stated at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy and we look forward to continuing the conversation. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes the Vistra Energy first quarter 2019 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Amy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations at Vistra Energy, you may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's investor webcast discussing 2018 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slides two and three in the investor presentation on our website, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data, included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly and good morning, to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. Turning to slide six, I am happy to announce today that Vistra concluded the year reporting adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $2.809 billion. Our results that are both above consensus as well as slightly above our 2018 guidance midpoint of $2.8 billion. When compared against our original 2018 guidance, which utilized October 2017 curves, we finished the year more than $180 million above the comparable midpoint. Vistra achieved these results through strong cost management across all markets which help to offset a relatively mild August in ERCOT. In fact, as you can see on the next slide, Vistra finished 2018, $25 million ahead of plan on achieving its Dynegy merger EBITDA value lever targets, $20 million of which we realized in the year. This relentless focus on cost management flow through to various capital projects we have forecasted for 2018. The Vistra operating team has exhibited meaningful CapEx spending discipline throughout the year enabling Vistra to achieve ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $1.611 billion results that were $61 million above the high-end of our guidance range, reflecting an EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 60% for the year. Since the close of Dynegy merger in April of 2018, we have developed an understanding of the operations and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures necessary to maintain the fleet of generation assets that we project will allow us to uphold this spending discipline into the future. Including the cumulative impact of the partial buybacks of the Odessa power plant earn-out, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would have been $2.791 billion and its adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations would have been $1.589 billion. As a reminder, when we executed the Odessa earn-out buybacks which we view as a growth expenditure, the economic benefit net of the premium paid was approximately $25 million which we largely locked in around the time of the buyback execution. Before we turn to our Dynegy merger synergy tracking update, I want to briefly highlight our recent retail growth initiatives. As I'm sure you are all aware, earlier this month we announced that we execute an agreement to purchase Crius Energy Trust, a retail energy provider with approximately 1 million residential customer equivalents in 19 states and the District of Columbia. We estimate the purchase at approximately four times EV to EBITDA and we project the acquisition will be immediately accretive to EBITDA and free cash flow per share. The transaction meets our internal investment return threshold and is expected to further approve our free cash flow conversion ratio as we estimate the Crius portfolio will convert approximately 90% of its EBITDA to free cash flow. As I'm sure everyone on this call is also aware, we did increase our purchase price for Crius due to an unexpected and hostile bid for the company. While unfortunate especially because this hostile bidder had an opportunity to be the successful bidder in the competitive auction process conducted by Crius leading up to the signing of our agreement. We continue to believe Crius is attracted to Vistra at this new price point. It is not our desire to get into a bidding war. We have put in place stronger breakup protections and together with Crius are moving quickly to obtain all necessary approvals including the shareholders proven to close the transaction, both of which support our bid over any potential future hostile one. Any hostile bidder, that would step in to the process now would have to justify the higher price including the increased termination fee and the delay in the approvals in overall closing timeline a tough thing to accomplish in our view. I would also like to emphasize that we are fully prepared to take any necessary legal action that we believe is available to us to defend our acquisition of Crius against any efforts by the hostile bidder to disrupt and interfere with our acquisition. Jim will provide more details about this transaction later on the call. But suffice it to say, we are very excited about the quality of the Crius portfolio and its strategic fit with our existing integrated platform. Last, I'm excited to announce that our retail team grew organically residential customer accounts in ERCOT by approximately 15,000 customers in 2018. This is the first year the team has achieved net growth on an organic basis since 2008 a tremendous outcome for the team and further proof that our marketing programs and customer satisfaction and service efforts in the ERCOT market have been effective. Let's now turn to slide seven for an update on our progress achieving the Dynergy merger value lever targets. On our last earnings call in November, we increased our synergy value lever target to 290 million from 275 million. And we increased our operations performance initiative value lever target to 275 from 245 million, we are reaffirming these EBITDA value lever targets today, anticipating we will achieve the full run rate of $565 million EBITDA per year by the end of 2020. I'm happy to report, as you can see on slide seven, that we finished 2018 tracking ahead of schedule capturing these merger value levers, realizing a $195 million of EBITDA targets in 2018 ahead of our initial forecast by $20 million. We achieved a run rate of $385 million by the end of 2018, $25 million ahead of our plans. Last, as a result of our latest balance sheet optimization transaction that closed earlier this month, we have increased our forecast annual after-tax free cash flow benefits by another $15 million to $310 million. We continue to believe there could be upside to the $275 million OP target. So, stay tuned for further updates on this topic in the second half of the year. Moving on to 2019. As you can see, on slide eight, we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, before growth guidance for our ongoing operations. We are calling 2019 the year of execution. As we complete the full integration of Dynergy merger and capture the value leavers implement our capital allocation plans and hit our targeted numbers. Of course, closing and integrating Crius will be important as well. We do not expect to update 2019 guidance to reflect the pending Crius acquisition, until after the acquisition closes, which we estimate will be in the second quarter of this year, perhaps even as early as April. Given that the Crius unitholder vote is scheduled for March 28. And as I mentioned earlier, the teams have already filed for the regulatory approvals. We do not expect any issues with obtaining regulatory approvals from the DOJ or FERC. Importantly, our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.22 to $3.42 billion, and our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of $2.1 to 2.3 billion represent a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 66%. As Bill will discuss later, we are significantly hedged in 2019 and have materially increased our hedges in 2020. We purposely have dry powder available in ERCOT in 2020, given our expectation that the more significant move in ERCOT prices due to the ORDC change will occur in that year. I have said it before, and I'll say it again. The 66% free cash flow conversion ratio is a highly attractive feature of our company and significantly higher than that of other commodity-based capital-intensive energy industries. As a result, we continue to believe that this evaluation should shift away from the historical EV to EBITDA multiple, which no longer reflect the value proposition of the sector for the free cash flow yield valuation metric at a proper yield. We believe our future valuation will eventually reflect this new reality as the financial markets continue to gain confidence in the new integrated power company model with the attractive features of low leverage, low cost and industry leading retail operations paired within the money generation all leading to relative earnings stability. Beyond 2019, we anticipate our integrated business model will enable us to continue to realize relative earnings stability as we are expecting 2020 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately flat to 2019. Our expectation for generally consisted adjusted EBITDA year-over-year is a marked improvement from Dynegy's pre-merger forecast which reflected declining EBITDA in 2020 and 2021 due principally to lower capacity revenues in PJM. Through curve improvements, changes to the operating reserve demand curve in ERCOT and enhance management expectations for merger value lever achievement, the previous Dynegy declining EBITDA forecast now reflects expected EBITDA strength and stability. In the near-term, we are continuing to focus on achieving our financial and leverage targets, returning capital to shareholders and meeting or exceeding our merger synergy targets. As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, our capital allocation plan remains on track as of February 15th, we had executed a total of $937 million of our aggregate 1.75 billion share repurchase program authorization slightly ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time because market technical gave us an opportunity to repurchase shares at an attractive price at the end of 2018. We now have 486 million shares outstanding as of February 15th, a 7% reduction as compared to the number of shares outstanding at the time the Dynegy merger closed with 830 million still available for opportunistic repurchases under the program. So long as our stock is trading at such a high free cash flow yield and what we believe is a meaningful discount to fair value, we expect we will continue to allocate capital towards share repurchases. We also announced earlier this week that our board has declared Vistra's initial quarterly dividend of $12.50 per share or $0.50 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019. Management expect to grow the dividend at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8% per share. As a reminder, the payment of the dividend of this size represents just more than 10% of Vistra's forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from the consolidated business and less than 35% of forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from our stable retail operations. We believe our targeted 6% to 8% per share dividend growth rate is supported by our projected free cash flow including tuck-in EBITDA growth initiatives such as our recently announced mass landing, battery storage project and the Crius acquisition. Importantly, the Crius acquisition is not expected to delay Vistra's achievement of its long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA by year end 2020. Balance sheet strength is a core tenant of Vistra's operating model that we plan to manage our business in cash flows accordingly. We believe the execution of our diverse capital allocation plan will continue to attract new long-term investors while providing our shareholders with an attractive total shareholder return over the years. In fact, we now consider 15 out of our top 20 shareholders to be long-term investors and Vanguard and Fidelity are now our second and third largest shareholders respectively replacing Apollo and Oaktree. Before I turn the call over to Jim to discuss highlights of our plan, Crius acquisition I would like to spend a few minutes giving a market update. In January, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved important updates to ERCOT scarcity pricing formula known as the operating reserve demand curve or the ORDC. The update simplifies the ORDC from 24 different curves for different seasons and time of day to a single curve and shifted the loss of wealth probability by half of standard deviation in two steps a quarter of a standard deviation in 2019 and another quarter of standard deviation in 2020. What all this means in plain English is that the market participant should expect to see modestly higher prices during peak periods as the scarcity pricing formula should now better pricing the risk of load shedding events. The goal of the market changes was twofold to better reflect significantly higher reliability risk in the market, as well as to provide better pricing those with an aim to help avoid additional retirement from marginal generators and to support new investment in generating capacity. We are fully supportive of the market changes as ensuring ERCOT has sufficient generating capacity to meet Texas demand for electricity is critical to the reputation of the growing Texas economy. We estimate the potential impact of these changes to the around the clock forward curves could be approximately $2 to $3 per megawatt hour in 2019, and approximately $3 to $4 per megawatt hour in 2020 modest overall increases in price that should support generation investment in the market. Well, not meaningfully increasing the price of power to Texas consumers. It is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these changes to district as it is difficult to do how the forward markets have already responded and will react in response to the new market design. Assuming the market fully values the impact of these changes and appreciates the risk inherent in the tight reserved margins forecast and we expect Vistra could see upside in 2020 where we are much less hedge than in 2019. In fact, some of the improved 2020 outlook that flattens EBITDA is due to the ORDC improvement. We have hedge some of our open position as we believe the 2024 workers had moved up in anticipation of the PUC potential action, especially prior to the action as there was speculation of a larger move. We believe this action by the Public Utility Commission of Texas was a necessary step to ensure the long-term success of the Texas competitive electric market and we continue to like our meaningful position in the ERCOT market where we forecast, we will derive more than half of our EBITDA in 2019. It is the right move balancing the need to support new and existing assets and cost to customers. With the end result to maintaining a healthy supply demand balance. Another market update has occurred since our last earnings call declaring of the most recent ISO New England capacity auction. This year's auction cleared at a price of $3.80 per kw-mo from $4.63 in the last year's auction. Despite the lower price district cleared nearly 500 more megawatts in the current auction, making the estimated negative impact Vistra of the lower clearing price approximately $60 million or less than a half a percent of Vistra's forecast 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. By the lower clearing price and the auction is certainly not ideal. It is relatively immaterial to Vistra given the diversity of our revenue sources from energy capacity and retail in multiple competitive electric markets across the U.S. More fundamentally, we continue to be confounded that anyone would be able to raise capital to advance a new gas plant and ISO New England at a capacity price of only $3.80 of kw-mo per month. As many of you know, a new 650-megawatt combined cycle plant cleared the latest capacity auction for calendar years 2020 and 2023. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Since the restructuring of the power markets began in the late 1990s. We are hard pressed to find merchant power plants for the original equity owner received an adequate return and many suffered financial distress and bankruptcy. Rather, it is the developers who earn sizable upfront fees to site, permit and construct new thermal resources that make money. Maybe the third-party debt and equity investors owning an uneconomic asset. One can only hope this reality will start to sink in with the financial community. So, debt and equity investors start making irrational investments like this latest gas plant slated for development and ISO New England. Our analysis is just that the entire equity and likely some portion of the debt will be underwater, the daily ISO New England plan is put into operation, if it ever is. In our view, something is wrong with the market design that allows a plant like this to clear and suppress prices with a high probability, it never gets built. The last relevant market update is, of course, the status of the pending PJM capacity auction reforms. Unfortunately, we don't have much to say on this topic as the devil will really be in the details after we hear from first. However, we continue to believe the outcome of any capacity market reforms will be at worst neutral to the current state. We call that in June of 2018 FERC label, the existing PJM capacity auction is unjust and unreasonable given the impact of subsidized resources have on the auction. As a result, it would see very counterintuitive to FERC's original intent to land and an outcome that is meaningfully worse for existing generators. History tells us that FERC has consistently promoted balanced market reforms that support competitive markets which by the way is their first order of priority despite political affiliation. States can formulate their own energy policy, but they cannot destroy competitive markets in doing so. Like all of you, we are anxiously awaiting FERC's decision on this issue and remain cautiously optimistic for a constructive outcome. We continue to believe that Vistra will be in a position to provide relatively robust and stable earnings in the years to come, given our strong balance sheet and low-cost integrated operations in the money generating fleet and market leading retail operations, which are about to become even more diverse with the closing of the pending Crius acquisition. On that note, I will turn the call over to Jim Burke to talk a bit more about the Crius transaction
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. Turning to slide 11, as you can see from the high-level bullets on the slide. We're very excited about the strategic fit of the Crius portfolio with Vistra's existing retail and generation platform. Importantly, as Curt mentioned at the beginning of the call, we believe the economics of this transaction are very attractive, exceeding our internal investment threshold and valued at approximately at four times enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, pro forma for the full run rate forecasted synergies. In fact, as a National Integrated Power Company, the generation of retail assets in multiple states, Vistra is uniquely positioned to create value with the Crius platform. We project we'll be able to achieve approximately $15 million in annual EBITDA synergies and approximately $12 million in additional annual free cash flow synergies following the closing of the transaction. The acquisition will also accelerate Vistra's previously announced organic growth strategy enabling us to forego approximately $29 million of expenditures through 2023 from this effort. Financial benefits aside, we're particularly excited about this transaction as a result of the quality of the portfolio we will be acquiring. The Crius portfolio has recognized established brands, market leading attrition rates and a demonstrated track record of successful customer acquisition through multiple sales channels. The portfolio compliments Vistra's was long generation position in the Midwest and Northeast markets and it's just mentioned will accelerate organic growth strategy in these regions. In addition, the composition of the portfolio is largely residential and small business should command a higher multiple due to the inherently higher margins in these segments. Let's dive a bit deeper into some of these points on the next slide. Crius with its approximately 1 million residential customer equivalents has demonstrated success with its high growth, high margin retail strategy focusing on higher value residential and small business customers, Crius has an impressive track record of new customer gains through various sales channels across multiple brands. And its attrition rates are the lowest among the peers and the markets where it operates. Crius has been successful in its customer acquisition and retention efforts as a result of leveraging its diverse sales channels and exclusive partnership strategies. These partnerships strategies are primarily executed through its energy rewards platform where Crius partners with established providers to cross-sell its retail electricity offerings. These integrated energy platform offerings will expand Vistra's existing sales and marketing channels, enhancing a strategic fit with our organization. Following the acquisition, Vistra will have a retail presence in 19 states in the District of Columbia with dual energy market offerings in many states. As you can see on slide 13, this rule now has a retail gas product portfolio in 13 states which we believe will be a great addition to our existing operations. Retail gas tends to have similar margins with electricity with gas customers tend to be a bit stickier as bill sizes often meaningfully lower in the segment due to lower overall volumes. Being able to sell a customer to services electricity and gas leverages the cost of acquisition by adding incremental margin to the customer relationship. In addition, retail gases are a naturally synergistic business for Vistra, as we are already one of the largest purchasers of natural gas in the country. To give you a bit of background on how the retail gas business works, the local utilities are responsible for ensuring that natural gas can be delivered to residents in their service territories. As a result, the local utilities contract for the necessary gas pipeline and transport capacity as well as for local gas storage and allocate the applicable transportation and storage assets to entities providing the retail gas product to the end users. Vistra therefore will only be responsible for procuring and delivering the actual commodity, which is very easy for us to do an affordable manner because we already are a bulk purchaser of natural gas necessary for the operation of our gas plants. In short, though the retail gas portfolio is only, approximately 15% of the Crius retail business by volume, we find it to be strategic fit for the organization. And we are excited to be meaningfully expand our retail gas operations as the transaction close. Finally, one of the greatest benefits of the Crius transaction is the incremental retail load Vistra will be acquiring, which meaning improves our expected generation for match. In closing and default service mode Vistra had contracted, we forecast we will be nearly 50% match in 2019 with approximately 90% of that forecast load being sold through our preferred retail channel. As we depict on the right-hand side of slide 14, our commercial team can sell Vistra's long generation through three primary channels, directly to one of our retail subsidiaries to utilities in default service options or directly to third parties in the wholesale markets. Of these channels we prefer selling our link directly to our own retail subsidiaries, as we are able to eliminate transaction cost leakage on the bid ask spread and reduce the total cost of the collateral postings. The other sales channels are effective, but marginally less attractive. With sales through default service options and third-party sales in the wholesale markets being the next most attractive channels in that order. The incremental load we will be acquiring with the Crius acquisitions primarily located in the Midwest and Northeast markets, which is exactly where we are planning to focus our organic growth efforts giving established brands sales channels and infrastructure as a platform for this organic growth. Over the last several weeks, the Vistra's management team has been working diligently with Crius to ensure a smooth transition. As our team have continue to interface and share best practices, we're even more excited about this transaction. The Crius and Vistra teams emphasize a high-performance culture with the primary focus on the customer. I have no doubt the Crius operations are right fit for organization and I look forward to announcing the closing of the deal hopefully in the second quarter. I am hopeful we can quickly close the transaction to avoid any further disruption that has a potential to erode the value of the business. I will now turn the call over to Bill Holden to cover fourth quarter and full year financial results.
Bill Holden: Thank you, Jim. Turning now to slide 16. As Curt mentioned, Vistra concluded 2018 delivering 2.809 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations. These results reflect a full year of operations from legacy Vistra and results from legacy Dynegy operations for the period from April 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Including the negative $18 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the Odessa power plant earn-out that we executed in February and May, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations would have been 2.791 billion for the year. Vistra's strong results coming in above consensus and just above the midpoint of management guidance were directly attributable to robust cost management across all markets, offsetting a relatively mild August in ERCOT. Retail also exceeded management's expectations for the year, driven by residential customer count growth and margin and cost management. For the full year, CAISO exceeded expectations due to favorable prices, higher generation volumes and lower SG&A expenses. While PJM was also favorable as a result of the NETCO [ph] plan retirement and subsequent move to the asset closure segment. Vistra's 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations was 1.611 billion, which as Curt mentioned is $61 million above the high end of the management prior guidance range. The favorable results are primarily attributable to CapEx spend discipline during the year. Including the negative $22 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the Odessa power plant earn-out, Vistra's 2018 adjusted free cash flow before growth from its ongoing operations would have been 1.589 billion. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations was $719 million or $721 million including the positive $2 million net impact of the partial buybacks of the Odessa power plant earn-out. Both segment results for the quarter can be found on slide 22 in the appendix. As Curt mentioned that today we are also reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges and we still believe 2020 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations is tracking relatively flat to 2019. Our confidence in our 2019 guidance range is and the improvement in our 2020 outlook is due in large part to the incremental hedges we have added for those years. As you can see on slide 17 and 18, as of December 31, 2018, we were largely heading for 2019 in our core markets, of ERCOT, PJM and ISO New England. And as of last week, we are nearly fully hedged in these markets for the year. Generally, as of December 31, 2018, we were largely hedge for natural gas in ERCOT in 2020, and we improved our ERCOT heat rate position to 42% from 28% at September 30. Also, on the fourth quarter of 2018, we improved on New York, New England and PJM hedge percentages by 8% and 32% respectively. As our commercial strategy is to take advantage of the volatility and forward curve, to hedge prices that are at or above our fundamental point of view, we have improved the 2020 hedge percentages even further in the first two months of 2019. The 48% for ERCOT heat rate and 32% and 66% for New York, New England and PJM respectively. We expect our hedging activities to further lock-in a stable EBITDA profile for the business in the out years. Finally, let's turn to slide 19 for a brief capital structure update. As you can see in the table Vistra had approximately $11.1 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018, reflecting debt reduction and as a result of approximately $120 million of open market repurchases of senior notes in the fourth quarter. In February of this year, we completed a bond issue and senior notes tender offer and redemption that reduced our annual interest expense by $20 million on a pre-tax basis. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our total debt as we work toward achieving our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year end 2020. And as Curt mentioned, we have now executed approximately half of our aggregate authorized $1.75 billion share repurchase program, leaving approximately $813 million available as of February 15, 2019. Following our share repurchases, Vistra had 486 million shares outstanding as of the same date. Despite our stock price recently achieving a new 52 week high to continue to view our stock price is undervalued. As a result, we expect we will continue to allocate capital towards opportunistic share repurchases under our existing program as previously announced. Our diverse capital allocation program is in full swing as we initiated our dividend program this month, continue to repurchase shares under our authorized share repurchase program delever and execute on tech and growth opportunities, including the Moss Landing battery storage project and the Crius acquisition. All of this is possible because of their relatively stable EBITDA and meaningful free cash flow generated by our integrated operations. We will continue to focus on execution and delivering on our commitments in 2019 all in an effort to create value for our investors. With that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning. Sorry, I did hop on the call just a tad late. So, if I'm asking you the question you already answered, my apologies. When you talk about the upside that you think you see in ERCOT from the change in the ORDC rules, how much of that do you think is already priced into the curves and how much of that do you think is needs to be sort of validated by volatility that we might see this summer that would cause the curves to move to where you think intrinsic value is?
Curt Morgan: Yeah, so this may be more than you're marketing for. I think it's worth just talking about how the curves have move, Greg because back after the summer we came out, there was a lot of chatter about needing to improve the ORDC or some other reform as you may recall, and then there was chatter out there that may be a one standard deviation move, no discussion about whether it be a single curve or the 24 curve but we were pretty certain at that point in time some amount of that was factored into the curve. I think people felt like they were a high probability that something would get done. We took some advantage of that in particular a little bit in 2020, but a little bit also we had some 19 still low, but we took advantage of it. And then if you remember, there was two or three times the PUCT sort of put it up on the schedule and then delayed it. I think curve is kind of drifted off a little bit because there was some uncertainty around it. And of course we finally got it through. And then there was a response pretty positive response after that and the reason I tell you all that is that I think it is ebbed and flowed and then recently - and this is not - this is pretty typical it's kind of - the curves are kind of drifted off a little bit and it happens sort of this time of the year. I fully expect that as we get close to the summer, we see our first hot day and people start to see how the market is going to react that we'll probably see another move up in power prices for 2019. And then typically when you get into 2019 summer, if you see a hot summer you'll see 2020 move up, but as it happen this year we didn't really have in August the summer we thought we would, but we still saw a move up in 2019 because as we rolled out, liquidity went from 2019 into 2020, so that's a factor but also people realize that reserve margins were actually going to go down not up. I think we'll see that same thing happen in 2020. So that's a long way of saying that. It's hard to really know for sure and I'm not trying to avoid the question, it's just very hard to know. But I would say right now, there is room to move in both the 2019 and the 2020 curves, for summer of 2019 and 2020 respectively. Just where the curves are today that's partly just due to - just how the market tends to move. But it's also I think the market has not fully realized the impact of the ORDC and I think one thing is probably still being digested, so this is all kind of esoteric step at the end of the day this whole single curve versus multiple curves and basically it really comes down to this loss of load probability and the mean of the loss of load probability and if it's on the single curve versus multiple curves, the standard deviation around that mean is actually higher which means the effect of the 0.2 and the 0.5 is actually higher than it would have been if it was under multiple curves. I'm not sure the market has digested it, because I don't know if they really know how that's all going to play out. So, I think this maybe a little bit of wait and see to that we're going to need to see how the market reacts. I think that the market is a little bit warm and we start to see scarcity in the ORDC comes into play. I think you could really see 2020 and 2021 off to the races. So, I think some of this is going to be driven a little bit by how weather turns out, but we do believe there is still some upside around the ORDC given where the curves are currently.
Greg Gordon: Great. And Bill could you reiterate where you said you are in terms of how much you've hedged for 2020 in ERCOT and I presume you used those are mid in run up sales opportunities but also can you I think you guys do when you talked about hedging that's net of a significant amount of megawatts that you hold back and take the spot during the summer to sort of self-hedge. So, can you just talk about that as well so we can understand how much exposure you have as the curves do move in your favor?
Bill Holden: Yeah so, the hedging that we've done through or 2020 since the end of the year, it would take us up to 48% hedge against ERCOT heat rates.
Curt Morgan: And that's in what we're building.
Bill Holden: And that's for 2020.
Curt Morgan: Yeah 2020.
Greg Gordon: Okay, so - but that's so you're 52% open but aren't you do I need to sort of take into account back that you're holding back that like 1200 megawatts or does that taken into account in that hedge percentage?
Stephen Muscato: I can answer that. This is Stephen Muscato here.
Curt Morgan: So, go ahead.
Stephen Muscato: Yeah, this is Steve Muscato. The way to think about it is, yeah, we do hold back some generation for basically potential outages or weather changes that make our load move up pretty rapidly with temperature. The way to think about it is, it gives us the opportunity to capture any deviations between the day ahead in the real time, because if the day ahead clears at a particular level, we could typically cover our load changes in the day ahead which then gives us a lot of that open generation for changes in the real time market.
Curt Morgan: Can we just - Greg just asked a simple question. In our hedge percentage, does it include the 1250 in it, so that open position or not. I think it does.
Stephen Muscato: It does.
Curt Morgan: So, Greg just asking is that against that, because you've got this whole back. And it does include it.
Bill Holden: Right. Okay.
Greg Gordon: Okay. That's clear guys.
Curt Morgan: And Greg ...
Greg Gordon: Thank you for - yes.
Curt Morgan: One other thing just to tell you, we've sort of purposely held some open here in 2020, because I think, you've got in front pick that up from what I was saying is that. We think there is room to move, pretty significant room to move in 2020, we don't see, it's hard to see that much new build coming on and between now and 2020 and we also don't think that the market has fully absorbed the ORDC effect, but we do think there is some movement and so that we have - we're kind of sitting a little bit on 2020. If the curves move, you should expect us and they move up, you should expect us probably to take some more off. If they don't, then we're going to be patient.
Greg Gordon: Great. One more quick question for you, it might be a curve ball, because I don't know, you probably didn't see it, but NRG in their release this morning talked about how they are reducing their net debt to EBITDA target of between 2.5 and 2.75. So, they're coming down to sort of where you guys already are in terms of your net debt to EBITDA aspirations and they're explicitly targeting eventually getting to an investment grade credit rating. So, can you just reiterate, because it seems like in terms - people had been pushing you in the past to sort of - why don't you go towards NRG and go to three times and buy back more stock. But now it seems like NRG has figured out that they need to come in your direction. So, can you just reiterate, what your aspirations are in terms of capital allocation, credit metrics, and do you aspire also to ultimately get to IG?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, look, the first thing I'd say is limitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So, but more importantly, and to the point. We've been pretty steadfast, and we did move, and you know this, we did move being to 2.5 times out a year because we felt like just where our stock was trading, that it made sense to reallocate capital in 2019. And, so we did do that. But we are absolutely committed to get 2.5 times and we believe, I think it's going to take time and I think the first step is actually to get an upgrade from where we are today. I think we - that squarely in our sides. I think we executed that will happen and that will then lead us to the position where we can get investment grade. We do want to get to investment grade. The credit spread at least today probably don't say that that's something that's a big deal. But it's not about that, I think it would be good for the equity. And it also would open up opportunities on our commercial, industrial retail business where at times we have to sleep, or we may not even get to see the business. So, there is a business proposition in here. And I think the reason and one of the reasons I believe we have such a high free cash flow yield is the risk premium in our business. I think that has been driven in the past overtime, because we carry too much leverage and there was the risk of financial distress in these stocks. And I think we want to put that completely in our rearview mirror. And I think 2.5 times is a right place to get to have that discussion with the agencies and then we'll see what we do from there. But we feel like given the metrics at that at 2.5 times and just the absolute level of debt it feels to us like that's the right place to be in order to have a serious discussion about investment grade.
Greg Gordon: Right. And then that drives a lower free cash flow yield on a higher share price. So that's sort of the magic potion of...
Curt Morgan: Yes, exactly right.
Greg Gordon: Okay. I've taken way too much time, guys. I'll hop off. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: All right, thanks Greg.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Abe, your line is open.
Abe Azar: Good morning. Congratulations on a successful year.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, Abe.
Abe Azar: Any thoughts on timing of refinancing the rest of the high cost's legacy Dynegy debt or any key dates to focus on or some of that that becomes callable?
Bill Holden: Yes. So I think in terms of just refinancing the two new bond issues that we did have covered most of the amounts that we would need to refinance with new money at lower costs, so the remaining amount of the debt reduction or the lion share of it will be done with redemptions from cash, I think you can look at when the redemption premium steps down, I think a large number of some of those are in November each year. We would do the math when we're planning getting close to redemption days about whether it makes sense to do it earlier or wait till this to step down in the redemption premium. But I think, we we've laid out in the cash payable at the end of the presentation that we planning to do about $800 million this year and then the balance of to get to the 2.5 times we would do in 2020.
Abe Azar: Got it and then can you provide an update on the status of the Moss Landing battery. One was spending supposed to ramp up and is there something you're waiting for before putting capital to work there?
Curt Morgan: Yeah, so good question. As you know that's a bit of a fluid situation, and with the NextEra sort of throwing the seams in our and bankruptcies in our sector, there's an obligatory federal versus state fight that always seems to go on. FERC versus the state. That's kind of blow some things down and it's created what I'd say just, a little more hair on how PG&E wants to proceed. But what I can say Abe, because we're in constant contact with these guys, is one the state one of this project number two, the CPC approved it, number three, it doesn't suffer from what others have, which is it's not wildly out of the matter in fact, it was it was by far the lowest, cost deal because of the Moss Landing site. So, there's no mark to market gain by rejecting the contract. And so, what we're hearing from PG&E is, full steam ahead. What the real question is when they are going to assume these types of contracts. And there is a little concern, I believe in how they're going to handle that given this jurisdictional issue with FERC, and the battle that's going on there. So, we're moving forward, and we've talked to them, they want to move forward in the contract. We still have a valid contract, it's not been rejected. The question is, when will it be assumed, and we're hopeful that sooner rather than later. I think what we have to remember is that we do have a contractual commitment here. And then we have to weigh the odds of whether it whatever be rejected. And at this point in time, we feel like it's an extremely low probability that it would be rejected, given the discussions that we've had directly with PG&E
Abe Azar: Got it. Thanks guys.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful, your line is open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much. Hi guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey Praful.
Praful Mehta: Hi, Curt. I got so just following up on Moss Landing, it doesn't sound like the decision to reject or a zoom is going to be taken anytime soon. Because they probably have to figure out what the exit looks like. It could take time. Let's just put it that way. So, if it does take time, is the assumption that you would continue on the current course assuming that it will at some point get resumed? Or do you have to hold and wait for the decision which could slow down the entire process?
Curt Morgan: Yeah, so I because we're an active discussion with PG&E I don't feel like, it would be fair for me to have that discussion, but I think your observations are correct. That's what I was trying to convey. And I'll be just very direct about it. The assumption of contracts could be pushed out. And we have a contract right now. The only thing that would change that as if it was rejected. I think the likelihood of that is very, very low. And so, we'll work with our board and we'll work with PG&E when we get to the point, which is going to be in the April to May, late April, sort of May timeframe where we would have to actually sign, the big contract for the equipment. And we'll make our decision then what we have to do. There is a number of different things we could do either in front of the bankruptcy court or working with PG&E in order to make sure that we move forward. We're committed to the project, I just, I can't tell you right now what that ultimate decision will be if we have to make a decision come may to sign an EPC contract or equipment contract. And we'll have to - we'll have to see what that is. And I'm going to do it when consultation with our - we have bankruptcy attorneys on board because we have to understand, the process. And so, we'll have to consult with them. And then ultimately, I'll have to go to the board. But most importantly, I think it's the active dialogue that we have with PG&E and working with them on certain things that will give us the comfort that, we're going to continue on with this project and have no issues or no risk of rejection. All that is still playing out, but we intend, and we're moving forward with the intent of completing that project.
Praful Mehta: Understood. Thanks. And then maybe on Slide 28, you have these realized estimated - prices, and it seems to be now - a $6 forecasted premium that you've kind of estimated for 2020. I know this number is moved around quite a bit. Could you just give us some perspective on what that $6 now reflects? And there's obviously something for the ISO New England as well so some color on the confidence around that number would be helpful.
Curt Morgan: Yeah. So, I just want to make sure, because this - it's even confusing for me, by the way. We always struggle with what's the best way to show you guys this kind of information. So, part of this part of that number is, what I call sort of realized actual realized premium relative to, where the market came in. And as it relates now, most of it in 2020 obviously, all of it is, is really projected. There is a significant amount of option value or intrinsic value that is, in the market and we model what that value is, relative and you lose that value. That value decays overtime. And then ultimately, as you go from real time, I mean from day ahead to real time, you don't have that anymore you don't have that flexibility. Part of it is the value of being able to back down unit in times and optimize by buying from the market. There's a number of different options that you can go after that we have historically proven that we're able to do it. It's also our ability to hedge at the periods of time, where there's just higher pricing that where our spot prices come in. And that's why it's so important as a company that we have a point of view and that we had when prices are at or above that point of view and have a very good modeling capability so that we feel comfortable that we are hedging at prices above spot. And we've also had a very good track record of being able to do that. So, it's a combination of things, Steve Muscato is here with me. Steve, is there anything you would add to that?
Stephen Muscato: Yeah, it's basically I think you captured it. It's the ability to an essence capture different points along the forward curve that we call extrinsic value selling into strength or anytime the price moves up. And also, as we take the portfolio into the day ahead and real time market, being able to optimize around whatever price signals were given. And so, it's a combination of existing hedges we have on and the combination of hedges we hope to put on in the future.
Curt Morgan: And you know, - probably you're it's a good observation - So that value does, it does move around. I think we've been able to demonstrate I hope I believe we have is that, we've been able to capture a lot of that along the way as we hedge. And so, in 19, we've locked a lot of that that that volatility. The reality of situation is in an increasing price environment, that premium will shrink as you would expect. Because we're managing risk as much as we are absolute price. We're trying to create a state stable setting earnings and steady earnings stream. And we're not looking for the highs of the highs. So, you may see that premium will shrink, but once the market patois out and it hits the sort of highs of the market, then it's much easier than to create that that premium. And then in the years past when prices were actually declining, then that we were able to hedge ahead of some of the declines because again our fundamental view showed that the market was actually on a decline. And we went out as fast as we could and tried to hedge as much as we could in the forward market. And then that actually proved out to work out for us in a big way. So that's kind of how we think about it approaching it
Stephen Muscato: And I think you asked about New England as an example. We've all seen a material drop off and gas volatility in New England. And so that's really the component that's impacting the New England pricing going into the winter there was a lot of discussion on what's going to happen and all Conklin. And obviously our Conklin volatility wasn't necessarily didn't materialize, and that's reflected also in the forward market at this point in time.
Praful Mehta: Got you. That's super helpful. And clearly your track record helps confirm or at least get comfort around those numbers. I guess just one final thing around the shareholder base, it was very helpful to hear the change in shareholder base. Given you have dry powder right now to buyback more shares. Is there any expectation of any kind of block deal or any broader deal with some of these shareholders and looking to exit? Are they still looking to exit any color or perspective on that?
Curt Morgan: So, look, I think we - I think the big thing is, you guys probably saw this. I mean, when the 13 after they came out, we've seen a dramatic change in our shareholder base, obviously, since we came our bankruptcy, but even recently. We've got to that are - to the largest shareholders we had number 2 and number 3 shareholders that are now down to 6%. And I think one of them is probably below that at this point in time. And then we've got Vanguard and Fidelity, who have now come up to number 2 and number 3. And then when we look at our shareholder base and we couldn't say this coming out bankruptcy. I think it was about what 16, I think out of the 20 now or 15, sorry, 15 out of the 20 or what we would consider long-term investors, people who are coming in because they desire to own the stock and a long run, they believe in the strategy and they liked the price point they're able to get in on. And the other thing I like about is as many of those folks came in at lower levels and have actually increased in a significant way their holdings. Now we're not done, and this is why we're going to be in Boston and New York next week, we're going to Europe. We wouldn't even have been able to go to Europe had we not had a dividend. So that opened up doors in Europe, we're going to go there and hopefully you'll get people interested long investors, you guys know this, and we went up to Canada. Canada or more long-term oriented investors. And we're hitting about is every long-oriented investor that we can hit. And I'm doing it personally, because I think, it's important to hear the story directly from us. It's the only way in my mind that you get this rotation and you get it without having your stock price suffer is you got to create demand for the stock. We can do buybacks. We can do all those things. But in the end of the day, we've got to create demand and the only way, we create demand is get out and tell the story. And I think we've had really good success on that and I'm willing to do whatever it takes, and I know Bill is as well and Molly will get out on the road if we have to and we'll talk to anybody that is interested in our stock. I think it's the only way we know how to do it.
Praful Mehta: Super helpful, guys. Thanks so much.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Angie, your line is open.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. Good morning. So, two questions. The 813 million less for buyback, is there any timeline attached to it? Is it still the end of 2019?
Curt Morgan: Well, this will depend right on just where our stock price is. But, it's probably - it could - it could leak into the first quarter of 2020 just and this is all dependent Angie and I'm not trying to avoid the questions it just depends on where our price is, because as you probably know we have different volumes of buyback at different price points. And so, as you might expect, our stocks moved up some and so we're buying less at that point in time. But I think our projection is it could leak over a little bit into the first quarter of 2020.
Stephen Muscato: Yes, that's right and Angie that's consistent with what we said last quarter we said we thought the program be completed either Q4 of this year likely Q1 of next year and somewhere in that time frame depending on where the stocks trading.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. Number two is back in December when we met you guys talked about 2020 EBITDA being above 2019. I know that there's upside - potential upside to ERCOT power curves. But as they look right now, do you still think that 2020 would be above midpoint of your current 2019 guidance?
Bill Holden: Yes, so good question. I want to be clear about this. So, we're - I'm going to talk about this not including Crius. But we see sort of flattish over now - over 2019 and 2020. And you know this I think Angie, but you know, for us that's a big deal, because, Dynegy had a huge cliff because of PJM capacity clear and we've been able to bridge that gap and create a more stable earnings profile. As driven by our value levers from the Dynegy merger to some extent as driven by curves and our ability to hedge some of that. So, we - and that's where we are today. I would say that depending on where the curves come, and you heard that long winded - answer I gave to Greg. But I do think there could be some upside in the curve. I think that is more of a 20 upside. And so, we could see some of that in 20. At this point in time though, where we are as we think that you were sort of flattish, because part of that when we mark that - when we didn't give you that comment and we have marked that particular plan, it was including some of the uplift that had already occurred from the ORDC. So, part of what's getting us to that flattish nature is the higher curves. And part of that, I believe, is some of the expectation of the ORDC, but there could be some upside. We're going to wait obviously through 2019, when we see the 20 curves move more significantly to leave that out. And of course, we'll wait all the way to October, November timeframe, before we give guidance on 2020.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And my last question just a quick one, I know we talk - you talk about the battery project the PG&E. But how do you think about the fact that the project returns most likely you were planning to add some project level dead. I would assume that the cost of that, that is not going to go up and the offtakes credits have plunged. So, I mean, do you still think, it's an attractive return taking that into account?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, first of all, we're not going to do project level debt. We made the decision not to project level finances. I mean, I've been in this industry too long and I remember when everybody was doing project level debts and it got confusing and we don't want to capital structure is confusing and we like to return. I think we said this, when we came out, these are on a non-levered basis, these are returns that are in the mid-teens that's very attractive to us. And so, it'll be on balance, we still believe in those returns. I think it's important to know that the absolute - so we do benefit from the price or, excuse me, from revenues from power. So, we get it we get a resource adequacy payment as part. And then we also can optimize using the battery in the energy market the key on that is, it doesn't - it's not about absolute power price. It's about the volatility and power price and our ability, when prices in the day or low because there's all this solar generation and other generation. And then the solar generation comes off because the sun's going down and goes down and then prices go up if that arbitrage that occurs in there that we get. So, prices theoretically could be zero during the day, and then, $10 or $20 during the night. And that's where we capture that, that value. So, we feel very comfortable about the value in the returns on this. And so, nothing's changed in our mind in terms of the value of this. And in fact, we know that California needs more of this type of investment, which actually is an opportunity for us as well. But that just gives you a sense of just what the demand is. And if there's a higher demand for battery, that means that pricing when you go from the heavy solar period to where the sun goes down, that means that pricing is going to be high until they get all that new capacity on it.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from a line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien, your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?
Curt Morgan: Yes. Hey Julien, how you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good. Thank you. So, a couple quick ones. I'll make it snappy here. So firstly, just go back to the hedges, just want to understand the change New England, the price it just on the '19 just wanted to understand a little bit more detail on that. And then also the expected Jen moved around a good bit. I get that power curves moving that shift things around. And even to mention, given that it was around it was across all the regions but ERCOT especially the Northeast?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, on the - I think on New England, a lot of what you saw there was really the when Steve was describing earlier that the extrinsic value was come down because of lower volatilities. And so that's just had the effect of reducing the realized price without having a corresponding benefit from hedges because the extrinsic values not fully hedge. Now look at the Steve on the and whether if there is anything of loads in the volumes.
Stephen Muscato: What we're seeing in volumes is as we do, as we continue to go through our operational improvements; we are seeing some changes in how the fleet runs at night. Whether they are start based or run based or hours-based machines and so that's causing some volume changes that you'll see. It's not having material gross margin impact at this point, because it's really just whether they run through night or cycle on and off. And one thing I'll add in New England it's really associates with, if you look at Conklin pricing, it was pretty contained this winter compared what you've seen historically during cold snaps, like if you look at 2014 as an example and that decline in volatility is participating through market. And the big reason for it there was some L&G tankers brought in at the gateway terminal upside of Boston. So, it's something that we have to monitor from year-to-year how L&G impacts that market and perception on how it's going to impact the market.
Bill Holden: And the only thing I just add onto what Steve said is, some of those price increases for - hours which is the sect of the dispatch and to the extend we dispatch more on the off peak and its lower the average realized price because we're earning margin but we're running more at lower price hour.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, alright excellent. And then lastly just really quickly on the - situation, obviously somewhat dynamic in - here, given the MPS and the process of legislation and your own process on, examining the portfolio. Can you give us a little bit of a more of a sense on timeline and then what the potential common combinations here are? Legislation is just, is probably at some point during the session this year MPS is, at the some point this year question mark, but just help us understand that your decision if you will.
Curt Morgan: So, big question, I think you guys know that there is a new administration in Illinois, Governor Pritchard [ph] he has a fairly aggressive green agenda for the state. They signed onto the Paris Accord. He made a big announcement on that. And the governor has asked us, at least that's our understanding through the Illinois EPA that have further discussions with the EPA about the multi-pollutant standard that the Illinois pollution control board had set forward for hearing. We agreed to that. I think whenever a governor asks you to do something for state you typically do it and that has not slowed anything down yet. And we've said that, we gave them 45 days that's March 15th coming up. I think the discussions have been very good and so, we are working toward what we hope is, and I feel, I'd say cautiously optimistic a compromised with everybody involved including environmental groups and the AGs office on something that allows us to move forward. So, I would tell you that we are still on the timeline that we would be making decisions around our portfolio in sort of the mid-year timeframe. And I think things will become in some ways, could even become clear to people what we're doing even sooner than that. But I think action would probably be taken more in the middle of the year. I have been very open about the fact that we've got an older, an aging fleet there and the capacity market design is horrid. And it's just not a very good market and we've got to challenge the assets. So, we're trying to build something where we can have a sustainable business. And I think part of that is making some hard decisions like we did in Texas to retire plants. We'll see about that but that's on the horizon for 2019 and I've been very clear with everybody involved at Illinois that this company is going to take action one way or another, because we're not going to continue to bleed cash and bleed EBITDA. We're going to clean up this portfolio and we're going to move with our business. It takes a tremendous amount of time relative to the EBITDA that improvised to the company. And that can't, that's not sustainable and it won't be. So, and that's about of what I can say at this point in time on that drilling.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Thank you all very much.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: This conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Hello once again, thank you for your time this morning and we appreciate you being on our call and we look forward to the next time we have the opportunity talk about our company. So, thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Lisa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy Third Quarter 2018 Results Webcast and Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy’s investor webcast discussing third quarter 2018 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today’s investor presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data, included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. Before we dive into results for the quarter, I would like to kickoff today’s call announcing the outcome of Vistra’s capital allocation planning process. As you can see on Slide 6, I am excited to announce today that the Vistra Energy Board of Directors has approved both a $1.25 billion increase to our repurchase program bringing our authorized total for share repurchases up to $1.75 billion as well as the initiation of a recurring dividend program. In addition, we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. The core of our capital allocation policy is based on three key pillars: opportunistically repurchasing our shares when our stock price reflects an attractive valuation as we believe it does today; returning capital to shareholders through a recurring dividend that is both predictable and grows periodically; and maintaining the lowest leverage in the industry. We believe our capital allocation plan will attract new long-term investors and provide our shareholders with an attractive total shareholder return over the years. Now, let’s spend some time on the details of the capital allocation plan. First, the Board has approved a $1.25 billion increase to our existing $500 million share repurchase program bringing our authorized total up to $1.75 billion. We believe our equity which has been trading at a free cash flow yield in the mid to high-teens is meaningfully undervalued. As a result, allocating incremental capital towards share repurchases is one of the most attractive investments we can make at this present time. Our own analysis suggests the intrinsic value of the Vistra equity is significantly above current valuations. We plan to execute share repurchases under the additional authorization on an opportunistic basis beginning in 2018 as we have already completed the initial 500 million of share repurchases the board authorized in June of this year. In addition, if we are able to opportunistically repurchase shares from large emergence-related selling stockholders, we might explore allocating a portion of the $1.25 billion authorization toward block trades of this nature. Possibly with other interested investors any such block trades will be purely opportunistic in nature. We expect the majority of our share repurchase authorization will be executed in the open market over the next 12 months to 18 months. Next, the dividend program approved by the Board this week is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2019 with the payment of annual dividend of approximately $0.50 per share payable quarterly. As is customary, we expect the Board will evaluate declaration of the dividend on a quarterly basis beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Our expectation is that approximately $0.50 per share annual dividend will reflect the yield currently about 2% which is higher than the S&P 500 average of dividend paying equities. Management further expects we will grow the dividend at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8% per share. The payment of the dividend of this size is more than manageable for Vistra given the substantial free cash flow generated by our business. It represents less than 15% of forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from the consolidated business. And less than 35% of forecast 2019 free cash flow before growth from our stable retail operations. Even with the payment of this recurrent dividend we would still expect to have just under $1.8 billion of capital be allocated to other uses. We are also confident the targeted 6% to 8% share growth rate for the dividend can be comfortably supported by our projected free cash flow including annual EBITDA growth initiatives which I will discuss in more detail momentarily. And last, Vistra remains committed to achieving its long-term leverage target of 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. While we remain firmly committed to achieving this leverage target, Vistra management and our Board of Directors do recognize that the valuation of our equity is such a compelling investment opportunity at this time that we believe repurchasing our shares is the single most attractive investment we can make. In addition, it will allow us to accelerate the rotation of our shareholder base. We realize this delays achievement of our leverage target, but we view this as a sensible near-term decision. We remain committed to getting to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA by year end 2020. Further, we believe the rating agencies will require us to demonstrate consistent financial results for a couple of years prior to considering an upgrade of our ratings to investment grade. Accordingly, we do not believe that reallocating a portion of our cash available for allocation through year end 2019 to an enhanced share repurchase program will meaningfully delay the timing of this to achieving investment grade credit ratings. Moreover, with the sizable free cash flow, we are projected to generate on an annual basis, we still have line on sight to achieving our long-term leverage target of 2.5x net debt to EBITDA by year end 2020. It is important to note that even with the reallocation of capital we are announcing here today, Vistra is still projecting it will achieve 2.9x net debt to EBITDA by year end 2019, which is the lowest leverage level of any company in the history of this sector. Balance sheet strength remains a core priority of Vistra. And we intend to manage our business and cash flows accordingly. Turning now to Slide 7, I thought it might be useful to summarize Vistra’s strong record on capital allocation over the past 2 years. Since our emergence from bankruptcy we have shown a commitment to returning capital to shareholders while also maximizing our EBITDA and free cash flow through disciplined investing in balance sheet and asset optimization. In particular, shortly after emergence from bankruptcy Vistra paid $1 million special dividend in December of 2016. And we are now announcing the initiation of a meaningful recurring dividend program expected to begin in the first quarter of 2019. Next, we recently completed execution of $500 million of share repurchases and today we announced authorization of an incremental $1.25 billion of share repurchases. We have also prioritized liability management, electing to repay approximately $1.5 billion of debt and executing on other opportunistic refinancing transactions since the announcement of the merger reducing our annual interest by approximately $185 million on a pretax basis. We are now forecasting we will further reduce our debt balances in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion over the next 2 years and we will continue to look for opportunities to refinance high cost Dynegy legacy debt to further reduce our annual interest expense. Finally, we optimized our ERCOT generation portfolio in 2017 and 2018 retiring approximately 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal assets while investing in an attractive solar project with a 10 megawatt battery and a low cost, low heat rate combined cycle plant, both of which exceeded our investment threshold of 500 to 600 basis points above our cost to capital. In fact, Vistra’s acquisition multiple on its three recently acquired CCGT assets is in the range of 2x to 4x based on the respective 2019 forecast EBITDA exhibiting Vistra’s investment discipline, while our solar and battery investment in Upton 2 comfortably exceeded our investment threshold with high-teens returns. We also closed on the Dynegy acquisition further diversifying our operations and creating approximately $6.8 billion in equity value from the synergies alone and after netting the full purchase price, which assumes no value for the underlying business. However, we believe the purchase price for Dynegy was below intrinsic value, particularly given the increase power curves in capacity clearance since the date of the merger. We are continuing this focus on disciplined investing and EBITDA and free cash flow optimization as we close out 2018 and move into 2019. Examples of opportunities we have to enhance our EBITDA and free cash flow in the near-term include executing on an organic retail expansion in the Midwest and Northeast markets, realizing a full year of benefits from the Upton 2 solar and battery project, optimizing our California portfolio through battery storage investments at our Moss Landing site and potentially at our Oakland site in the future, optimizing our MISO portfolio and pursuing incremental value from our operations performance initiative and from further debt optimization. In addition, as we described at our Analyst Day in June, we expect we will generate approximately $1.8 billion to $2 billion or more in ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow on an annual basis. In fact, we are forecasting we will generate more than $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow before growth from our ongoing operations in 2019, with a similar projection in 2020. As a result, Vistra expects it will easily be able to continue its trend of returning capital to shareholders in future years as well as investing in accretive growth projects. As we have mentioned previously, on average, we believe an estimate of annual growth capital of approximately $500 million seems appropriate for a company of our size. Given our return criteria, we would expect this investment to generate approximately $100 million per year in EBITDA, which will further support management’s intention to grow its dividend at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8%. We believe our track record, business position, scale and capability should afford us the opportunity to invest in our business, but it is important to note that if we do not find attractive investment opportunities in any given year, we would return capital to shareholders. Turning now to Slide 8, I would like to cover our third quarter and year-to-date 2018 financial results. Vistra finished the third quarter of 2018 delivering $1.153 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Strong results for the quarter despite below average August weather in Texas, which limited the margin we were able to capture from our approximately 1,200 megawatts of generation we intentionally keep open in the summer months for risk mitigation purposes. Year-to-date, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations is $2.069 billion. Excluding the cumulative impact to adjusted EBITDA of the partial buybacks of the Odessa power plant earn-out executed in February and May, Vistra’s year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would have been 2.089. As a reminder, when we executed the Odessa earn-out buybacks, which we view as an investment, the economic benefit net of the premium paid was approximately $25 million, which we largely locked in around the time of the execution. As you might recall, Vistra’s results through June 30 were tracking ahead of internal expectations. As a result, despite the disappointing August weather in Texas, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to 2.75 to 2.85 billion, while maintaining our prior midpoint of 2.8 billion. Similarly, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth to 1.45 to 1.55 billion, maintaining our prior mid-point of 1.5 billion. Our reaffirmation of the 2018 guidance mid points with the higher forward curves utilized to develop our May guidance is a testament to the strength of our integrated model, which continues perform well, supporting our confidence and the stability of our EBITDA profile. In fact, utilizing October 2017 curves, which we used in our original merger guidance and are similar to the curves others likely use for 2018 guidance, we would be tracking more than $150 million above the implied midpoint on a comparable May 2018 guidance basis. Today we're also narrowing our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.22 billion to $3.42 billion and our 2019 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. As a result, Vistra is expecting to convert more than 65% of its ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in 2019. This free cash flow conversion ratio is significantly higher than that of other commodity-based capital-intensive energy industries and as a result, we believe over time this unique financial characteristic will lead to a full valuation for Vistra. In the meantime, we will be focused on executing our business plan and continuing to deliver on our commitments as we prove to the market that our new business model is one that can create relatively stable EBITDA and significant cash flow conversion even in challenging wholesale power price environments. Before we leave the discussion on financial performance for the quarter though we are not providing 2020 guidance today, I would like to highlight that the reason uplifted 2020 forward curves across all markets has provided Vistra with opportunities to incrementally hedge in order to lock in a more stable EBITDA profile. In addition, we expect the strong fundamentals in ERCOT to continue at least in the 2020 resulting in continued increasing forwards and an opportunity to lock in value. We also believe the Texas PUC may act on a market rule changes by the summer of 2019 most notably the operating reserve demand curves, which could also positively impact forwards in 2019 and beyond. As you may recall, Dynegy was forecasting declining EBITDA in 2020 and 2021 due principally to lower capacity revenues in PJM. However, through curve improvements and merger value levers, we are now forecasting Vistra’s ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth in 2020 to be relatively flat with our 2019 expectations with increasing confidence beyond 2020. In fact, turning to Slide 9, you can see that as of September 30, Vistra has hit at least 75% of its generation length for 2019 in all markets other than MISO and CAISO. In addition, also as of September 30, Vistra has hedged generally 20% to 30% of its generation length in all markets for 2020. It is this practice of hedging into the volatility in the forward curves combined with our stable retail operations and exposure to capacity markets that allows Vistra to create what we expect will be a stable $3 billion plus adjusted EBITDA profile in varying wholesale power market environments without investments in growth. As you may recall from my analyst day presentation, an important and unique feature of Vistra is the efficiency of our assets and they are significant in the money nature, which facilitates our hedging strategy. In the near-term our sectors going through a much-needed transformation with cost savings, operational efficiencies, in some cases, divestitures. However, when it is all said and done, it will be the quality of the assets in the businesses remaining that will matter. We believe that having significant and diverse streams in revenue will be critical to long-term success. And we absolutely believe deepen the money generation is of high value especially when coupled with a strong balance sheet and an adaptability to optimize and hedge our assets. I also would like to point out as you will see on the chart that we are meaningfully less hedged in ERCOT on a heat rate basis as compared to a natural gas equivalent basis in both 2019 and 2020. This hedging discrepancy is intentional as we continue to remain bullish on ERCOT 2019 and 2020 heat rates as mentioned earlier. If you turn to Slide 10, you will see a graph depicting historical forward North Hub Summer 5x16 ERCOT heat rates for 2019, 2020 and 2021. As the chart depicts, Summer 2020 and 2021 forward curves have moved up significantly, but are still trailing lower than 2019 forward curves even though reserve margins are projected to decline during that period. However, as the applicable summer gets closer in time, we tend to see forward curves move up in response to anticipated tight supply-demand conditions. For example, summer 2019 forwards moved up considerably in April to June 2018 timeframe. This dynamic of the volatility in the ERCOT summer curves is generally favorable to Vistra. The steep backwardation in the forward curve should continue to deter new thermal investment in ERCOT as along as financial players and strategics act rationally. However, the near-term volatility in the curve is reflecting near-term tightness in the market allows Vistra to hedge at least 12 months to 24 months out and create a stable EBITDA profile. Given that load in ERCOT is forecasted to grow at approximately 2% per year combined with the fact that it takes anywhere from 20 months to 24 months to construct a new combined cycle gas asset, we continue to believe 2019 and 2020 will experience increasingly tight market conditions in ERCOT. We similarly expect that forward curves will continue to improve as we get closer to the prompt summer, providing Vistra with an even further opportunity to hedge its remaining open length in the out years. I think it is important to note that while tight markets are generally good for Vistra, we are entering a period where reliability in ERCOT could be at risk. It is incumbent on all other participants including generators, gas pipelines, railroads, PDUs and retailers to work together and operate reliably and responsibly. Summer 2018 was a very good start. As I have mentioned during previous earnings calls our own analysis suggest that investment in thermal generation at ERCOT remains uneconomic and likely will continue to be uneconomic even with any reasonable market changes under review of the Texas PUC. We believe investment in merchant solar is approaching the point where it may be economic, but not without risk as the ERCOT supply demand balance is highly volatile as are the resulting prices. Moving on now to our merger value lever targets I am excited to announce today that we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA value lever targets by $65 million, bringing our new total of expected adjusted EBITDA benefits from the merger up to $565 million. Of this $65 million increase, $15 million reflects enhanced value identified from our exercise to capture traditional merger synergies and $50 million reflects enhanced value we expect to realize from our ongoing operations performance initiative. As you can see on Slide 11, we expect we will be at full run rate of the $565 million of EBITDA value levers by year end 2020. Last, given our continued work to reduce our overall cost of debt through our balance sheet optimization activities, we have increased our anticipated annual after tax free cash flow benefits to approximately $295 million from the approximately $260 million we forecasted in May. As I have mentioned previously, we only announce additional synergies and OP value when we are highly certain of capture and we still believe there could be upside to the $275 million OP target we are announcing today. However, it will take us well into 2019 to prove this out. So please stay tuned for the further updates on this stuff. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to comment on some of Vistra’s third quarter business highlights. Importantly, our retail team continues to focus on execution and I am pleased to mention that Vistra residential retail customer counts are up 1.4% year-to-date in ERCOT solely as a result of organic growth. Our strong brand differentiated products and focus on the customer underlie our position as the largest single brand residential retail electric provider in ERCOT. And our scalable platform and capabilities should provide a solid base to support our retail operations in Illinois and Ohio and our organic retail growth strategy in other markets we choose to competed in outside of ERCOT. We plan to invest approximately $20 million in 2019 on our organic retail growth initiatives. We estimate we will be able to grow our retail portfolio organically through cumulative investment in the range of 1x EBITDA, a much more attractive investment in our view as compared to paying approximately 3x to 4x EBITDA net of synergies for retail portfolios that have been available for acquisition. In addition to being more cost effective and organic growth strategy allows us to choose the markets we enter and build the kind of business we are comfortable operating. We plan to launch our organic retail growth strategy in PJM and we look forward to sharing a result of that effort with you in the future. Next, many of you are probably aware that the Illinois Pollution Control Board recommended two modifications to the Illinois EPA’s proposed amendments to the state’s multi-pollutant standards. On balance, we believe the recommended modifications to the MPS rule are fair and while it take a bit more time to get to a final amendment than we had originally hoped, the modifications as proposed should give us the flexibility we need to build an EBITDA and free cash flow positive business in Illinois under one fleet-wide, mass-based tonnage GAAP. We should be in a position to discuss actions we expect to take regarding our MISO fleet by mid 2019. And last, Vistra’s two battery projects remain on track for commercial operations. The Moss Landing 300 megawatt battery storage project is on the California Public Utility Commission agenda for approval on November 8, 2018. I am sure you are aware that approval by the CPUC of our project as well as others was delayed from October 25. As a procedural matter, these projects are under one docket and therefore are linked for approval. We remain cautiously optimistic the Moss Landing project will be approved. And if approved, the COD of the project is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2020. Vistra’s 10 megawatt Upton 2 battery storage project is on track for COD in December of 2018. These battery storage projects are relatively low risk and they are examples of how Vistra is continuing to diversify its generation portfolio to adopt new technologies at what we forecast to be attractive returns exceeding our internal investment threshold. The significant EBITDA from our integrated business model, combined with our commitment to achieving the lowest leverage in the industry and Vistra’s modern, low maintenance cost generation fleet, should continue to support our strong free cash flow conversion profile more than 60%. This results in ample firepower to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and invest in a disciplined fashion in accretive growth projects leading to a long-term shareholder value. We remain excited about the future of our company and the value proposition we bring to investors. I would now like to turn over the call to Bill Holden to discuss our financial results and guidance in more detail.
Bill Holden: Thanks, Curt. Turning now to Slide 14, as Curt mentioned, Vistra concluded the third quarter of 2018 delivering $1.153 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. While below average temperatures in ERCOT resulted in lower realized power prices on our remaining open positions, negatively impacting our ERCOT generation segment, our retail operations and generation segments outside of Texas performed well. In particular, generation performance in both PJM and California exceeded expectations as a result of favorable prices, higher generation volumes and lower SG&A expenses. Both segment results for the quarter can be found on Slide 21 in the appendix. So today, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations is $2.069 billion, which reflects 9 months of results from the legacy Vistra operations and results from the legacy Dynegy operations from the period from April 9, 2018 through September 30, 2018. Excluding the negative $20 million impact of the partial buybacks of the Odessa earn-outs that we executed in February and May, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations would have been $2.089 billion for the period. We expect these partial buybacks to have a positive impact net of the premium paid over the period from 2018 through 2020. Finally, I am pleased to announce today that we have completed the $500 million share repurchase program, our Board authorized in June of this year. Under the program, we purchased approximately 21.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $23.36 per share. Given that we continue to view our current share prices meaningfully undervalued, we expect to begin executing share repurchases in 2018 under our newly authorized 1.25 billion share repurchase program. Turning now to Slide 15, you will see that Vistra is narrowing its 2018 ongoing operations guidance while reaffirming both the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth midpoints. Following the below average August temperatures in Texas, Vistra’s ability to reaffirm its guidance midpoint that was marked against relatively high ERCOT forward curves as of March 29, 2018 is a true testament to the strength and stability of Vistra’s integrated operations. And one final reminder, Vistra’s 2018 guidance reflects Vistra’s results on the standalone basis for the period prior to April 9, 2018, an anticipated result of the combined company for the period from April 9 through December 31, 2018. Turning to Slide 16, Vistra is also narrowing and updating its 2019 guidance. Forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3.22 billion to $3.42 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations of $2.1 billion to 2.3 billion. As a result, Vistra is forecasting that in 2019 it will convert more than 65% of its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations. This impressive free cash flow conversion is what will enable Vistra to execute on the diverse capital allocation plan we announced today. Slide 17 provides the walk forward showing the variances from the 2019 guidance we initiated in May to the guidance update we are providing today. As many of you know 2019 power price curves are up meaningfully in the markets where we operate. As a result, you might have been expecting an increase in Vistra’s 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance today. All else equal you would have been correct, as the first callout box on Slide 17 states Vistra’s 2019 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been up by approximately $185 million based on price movement alone. However, this uplift in the forward curve is offset by $80 million of incremental 2019 hedges added between March 30 and September 30 of this year. $30 million of lower MISO capacity revenue due to lower price and volume assumptions for the planning year ‘19-‘20 as well as updates to the MISO plant power base’s expectation. $55 million of lower forecast generation margin due to the impacts of outage timing and increased fuel supply costs. And the $30 million adjustment to the 2019 retail adjusted EBITDA expectations. Accounting for these changes Vistra’s 2019 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range would have been $3.24 million to $3.44 billion. However, we are also expecting to invest approximately $20 million in 2019 on our organic retail growth strategy which brings our 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for ongoing operations to $3.22 billion to $3.42 billion. Importantly, as Curt mentioned earlier on the call 2020 forward curves have improved recently and we are now forecasting that 2020 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth will be relatively flat in 2019 which bodes well for 2020 capital allocation. And finally let’s turn to Slide 18 for a brief capital structure update. As you can see in the table following our August bond issue and senior notes redemption that reduced our annual interest expense by $56 million on a pretax basis. Vistra has approximately $11.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2018. We forecast our net debt to EBITDA will be approximately 2.9x at the end of next year. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our total debt as we work towards achieving our long-term leverage target of 2.5x by year end 2020. In total, we expect we will have more than $3.8 billion of capital to allocate between now and year end 2020, some of which we have already earmarked for the payment of a recurring dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and for incremental share repurchases. We continue to believe the relatively stable EBITDA generated by our integrated operations combined with our industry leading balance sheet and diverse capital allocation policy will attract long-term investors that have historically shied away from the sector. As we focus on execution and continue to deliver on our commitments, we believe these efforts will translate into meaningful value creation for our investors. With that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
Curt Morgan: Hey, good morning.
Greg Gordon: Thanks for the update. So looking at the numbers everything looks fantastic in terms of your free cash flow outlook and I think your confidence in the stability of EBITDA and the free cash flow in ‘20 is great, your guidance is – the high end of your EBITDA guidance range is a little bit below consensus? Thank you for giving us this walk on Page 17. Are you telling us that you were hedging into the rising, part of the reason why you are a little bit lower is because you were sort of averaging into the – and hedging as the prices were rising and then the fuel supply part is that coal or is that gas?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So Greg we were hedging into it, I think we have said that we are not basically taking the risk of just waiting for the highs of the highs when we see things above fundamental view we will hedge, so we get hedge into it, the prices moved up. We still have open position as you can see that’s attractive for us in ‘19 as well as ‘20 now and ‘21. So yes, that is what you are saying is that we did hedge into that previously before the recent run-up. And then the transport is both. We have seen an increase and this is in ERCOT. We have seen an increase in gas transport costs and then we also saw around Coleto Creek an increase in rail cost. And this probably doesn’t surprise you, but people know that the power markets have increased revenue and the power markets have increased and people don’t miss the trick when they can, they try to get a piece of that. And these are tough businesses because they are largely monopoly, have the monopoly position, but they don’t always act like monopoly. So I guess they do act like monopoly I guess is what I am saying. But we were able to negotiate when we thought we are relative to market, pretty good rates on these things, but nevertheless there was a little bit of a chunk that was taken out of us. And that happened, you guys know this too that we came out with ‘19 guidance in May and that’s why we had $200 million range around it and we had just done the merger and some of this stuff in that on ‘17 that you see is refinement of some of the assumptions when we took Dynegy’s plan and we melded it together to give guidance in May. We have made refinement since then and maybe we are a little more conservative in certain areas like MISO capacity and some other and retail in – the Dynegy retail business which is contributing to some extent to the negative bars on the waterfall.
Greg Gordon: So it would make sense in rising wholesale price environment that there would be some retail offset to retail margin, right, I mean one of the benefits of retail is its countercyclical, but when prices rise that should happen, correct?
Curt Morgan: That’s right. And the good news is about 105 incremental benefit, in ERCOT when you net the $30 million reduction and then you look at what’s up in ERCOT of that wholesale price increase, the integrated model is working, so we have a higher increase on wholesale than we do in retail. Some of that 30, though I will tell you, it’s about a third – a third of it is bad debt expense. With higher bills you tend to see a trend with higher bad debt expense and so a little bit as our forecast that we may see higher bad debt expense. A third of that is power cost as well. And then the other third of it is we just reduced the expectation around the Dynegy retail business. We – I think we have appropriately costed out that business relative to what the way that Dynegy looked at it and we just feel like it’s going to be a little bit lower. But I think we feel like we can build it up and actually increase that over time, but that’s what that 30 is Greg is those different pieces.
Greg Gordon: Right. Just two more questions and I will beat to the queue. In terms of how you manage your length in Texas, I know that one of the reasons why August was challenging for you is that you tend to bring a lot of length into the market, into the day ahead in the spot market for the self insure and manage risk and August basically didn’t happen. Is there some level of conservatism built into this guidance because you know that you are going to sort of may self-insure and manage your risk that way going forward?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So that open position especially after this summer we are a little bit gun shot here, but that open position is marked at a lower level and it takes into account a lower – basically a lower probability of pricing. So, we do have – we have market that 1,200, roughly 1,200 megawatts. And the way we size that Greg is that, we look at our largest unit, which is a Comanche Peak unit, and if we were to lose one of our largest units, we want to have enough backup generation to cover that. And so that's how we size that for risk management purposes. But that 1,200 megawatts is marked at a lower level. So, we got into the summer and real-time prices were very strong, because we would release that 1,200 megawatts into the real-time market, you certainly can see a much higher earnings power from the company.
Greg Gordon: Right. So, you don't want to count on that because basically you don’t want to have a disappointing third quarter like you did last year versus whatever expectation you set. Is that a fair summary?
Curt Morgan: That’s right.
Greg Gordon: Alright. Last question, do you have the CapEx associated with the Moss Landing and other battery projects in California baked into your capital allocation numbers right now or would that come out in the numbers if those were approved?
Curt Morgan: Yes. It’s – it is included.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning.
Curt Morgan: Good morning, Julien. How are you?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good, good, good. Excellent. Can you perhaps comment a little bit on the 2020 commentary you just provided with respect to having a flattish outlook? Are you basically saying the range ‘19 versus ‘20 is effectively flat on an EBITDA and FCF basis?
Curt Morgan: Yes. We are saying, it – the outlook I mean, within a percentage point here or there, but right now it is essentially flat from both a – an EBITDA and free cash flow basis. I think you’ve seen that our free cash flow conversion has actually gone up some from roughly 60% up to about – actually I think it’s 66%, I think we see that continuing, that’s partly due to some good management around our CapEx. And so – but yes that’s – that we’re seeing that as flattish. We also believe that beyond that there is a good chance of that as well. I mean, our view around ERCOT is that this tightness could persist for a while, we’ll see, but we feel pretty – we feel pretty good about what that outlook in ERCOT is shaping up to look like and we also think it could extend into ‘21, ‘22.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then with respect to retail, just a multi-faceted question here. First, you’re bringing down 2019 expectations despite a higher customer count quarter-over-quarter, how exactly is – how are you thinking about that in terms of customers and composition? And then also can you comment a little bit more specifically around acquisition versus organic expansion, you made a couple of different comments in your prepared remarks with respect to both sides of that. I mean, as far as you see the expansion into the Northeast, is this principally organic at this point, I know you still have that strategic planning process underway?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, on the – simply on the retail that the reduction in retail EBITDA there’s a couple of things related to that. One is that we are going to invest $20 million to build out our organic retail business. And when we’re doing that, we’re not going to have an offset basically from the gross margin side, but we expect to start to get that offset meaningfully in 2020 and 2021. So, there is a bit of a drag there. And then this is just a reflection frankly of higher costs against the retail business, but we do believe longer-term adding those customers is going to benefit as we bring them in, we should see some. And there is some offset in there for higher customer counts, it’s just not enough to cover the higher cost of goods sold essentially for the retail business. But we’re picking up that – we’re picking more than that up on the wholesale side, which is what you would expect those two things to somewhat offset. Jim Burke is with me. Jim, do you have anything to add to that?
Jim Burke: Yes, Curt, I think you summarized it well. Julien the way we tend to think about this as little bit of a long-term proposition around how we serve customers. We faced a similar dynamic in 2014 and we were very disciplined about how we manage our margins and our customer acquisition channels and it paid off through reduced attrition in ‘15, ‘16, ‘17, and growth in ‘18. So, I think we’re just taking the long view on this and running the business in this integrated way for maximizing long-term value.
Curt Morgan: And then drilling on your other question about organic versus inorganic, I guess you’d call it M&A. We did do a false strategy went to the Board with it. We have a very detailed plan to grow out our business organically. The number of people we want to bring, the way we want to shape the organization, the market evolution, where we want to start and how we want to add to that. So, we’re going to embark on that. On the M&A side, we looked at everything that was out there. And frankly, given the evolution of our company right now, where we could spend our capital and the underlying value proposition at each of those businesses brought and the price that we would have to pay, we just did not feel comfortable that this was the right time for this company to spend somewhere between $0.5 billion to $1 billion into one of those businesses. We are concerned about high attrition rates. We’re concerned about effectively business practices and other things. I don't mean anything negative. I'm just saying the way that we conduct business and the way others do, it was just not necessarily a match that was comfortable for us. And I think it was a bit timing and we just didn't feel like this was the time that the Dynegy deal, we're in the middle of it, we’re I think we didn’t want to slip up on that. And as you can see that continues to provide very good benefits to us and we wanted to be able to integrate that to take on another acquisition at this point in time and the company just didn't make sense to it. We did not want to do something and then later regret it and that would have eroded the credibility of the company in terms of what we do at capital allocation. So what the reason we brought it up again though is that that does not mean that if we get into ‘20 and beyond that we would not consider doing an acquisition to help accelerate the organic retail strategy. So, we always keep that open. We look at everything. We have a dedicated team to do that and if we find something that we think is something we’re comfortable with that we can buy it at the right price and it’s a kind of business we like, we would certainly consider it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: So, let me just on the buybacks. The timing seems to highlight the program may go into 2020. Can you just elaborate a little bit, Curt and I don’t know you’re thinking about the timing i.e. should we assume sort of open market purchases occur in 2019 given obviously where the free cash yield, the stock is with any residual amounts being the crossing, block trades, private transactions whatever bleeding into 2020? And then just how are sort of conversations going with your ex-creditors, are we very preliminary right now?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, those are good questions. So, on the timing front we’re going to begin this $1.25 billion program in 2018. And so, we said 12 months to 18 months, I think that is just purely to give us more time if we need to from an opportunistic standpoint depending on where our stock price is. But we intend to just like you would expect, we’re going to be out in the open market with a grid and we’re going – if our – if the price of our stock is in certain particular ranges, we’re going to buy back our stock. We will manage it with our cash because this business has a bit of a cyclical cash. So, we always have to manage what we’re going to buy in any given quarter based on what cash is going to look like. I should mention though, I think it’s really important to mention is that, we have moved our target on leverage from 2.5 by the end of ‘19 to 2.9, and then 2.5 by ‘20. The new people will know that that this assumes that we’re going to take debt down between now and the end of ‘19 by another $1 billion. So, we’re going to also manage the timing of debt repayment and the timing of the share repurchases. I would not be surprised as – and Bill can add to this. I would not be surprised that this would end up possibly being a 12-month program, I think we can support a 12-month program. But I would hope it wasn't and I would hope we don't even spend all of it because I’m hoping that we would actually realize our full price. Having said that, we are prepared to move on this and do the full program in 12 months if that’s what economics dictate and we will do that. Yes. Bill anything…?
Bill Holden: The only thing I would add I guess I would agree with what Curt said. It – some of it will depend on where the stock is trading and will affect the pace of the open market program. And then just tactic to your question about potential block trade, I think we will hold some amount of cash so that we have dry powder to do block trades if we see opportunities that we find are attractive. But I think most of what we are going to do I would envision would be in open market purchases.
Curt Morgan: I am sure we have not.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect.
Curt Morgan: To be very honest about this, we have not engaged with anybody – any of the large sort of emergence related shareholders. We have not engaged directly with them. The one thing I think we would want to consider and we have heard some feedback on this front is we would actually like to engage with investors and see if we can get an interest from other investors to join with us so that we can do a much bigger block and to bring either new or existing shareholders that want to increase their position along with us. And so I think we are going to engage on that front first and then we would engage to the extent there is interest. We don’t even know that there is interest. But we believe there probably will be. But we are perfectly comfortable doing open market purchases, 100% of this, if that’s what the way it shapes up. If there is something that we can bring a bigger block together of investors and we can do it at a discount in market which I think we would probably insist on and reasonably we would insist on that is that we are bringing liquidity to a seller that they can’t get on their own. And so there is a we believe there should be some discount to do that. Now there is definitely certain criteria around that and there is I would say normal circumstances dictate what that discount is, so I think everybody, I am not talking that we are going to get 50% of the share price, but there generally is for that kind of liquidity that gets offered to the market there is generally some level of discount. So we are going to factor all those things and we will see where that takes us. And ultimately we will see how this plays out. But we are prepared to do open market purchases and we are not uncomfortable with that at all.
Shar Pourreza: That’s very good color. And then just real quick shifting to the capital allocation decision around the dividend, obviously the growth rate is much higher than many expected, what do you want ultimately kind of levelize that over the long-term right to similar to the utilities run 4% to 6% growth, do you have a specific yield in mind over the long-term or sort of just giving your cash flow conversion cycles, your pre-cash flow profile should we just assume 6% to 8% growth at least into the medium-term?
Curt Morgan: I think you should assume that 6% to 8% growth into medium-term. I mean the Board is going to – obviously management team will work with the Board on this. We will look at if we are 5 years, 6 years into this and we will see where we are, if we believe that we need to adjust that growth rate we will consider. But I believe that first of all the Board has to approve and declare dividends. And the Board is going to have to declare the growth rate. I think we have said this and we have said it for a reason is that management believes it will be 6% to 8%. We will recommend that to the Board. Certainly we talk to the Board about it, but the Board hasn’t necessarily committed to anything on that, but I think they are generally in line with us. What I would say is though that we consider that 6% to 8% I think a medium-term growth rate. I don’t think that any of us think that’s 1-year or 2-year deal, I think we are committed to it for a pretty good period of time and believe that we can reasonably afford it given our free cash flow. But also I think our ability to grow earnings I mean we have got things in place right now for the next 2 years to 3 years are going to grow earnings more than what it would more than fund 6% to 8% growth in the dividend. And then that’s not counting whether we would deploy some capital to long-term to growth which I think if you are $1.8 billion to $2 billion free cash flow you can probably expect. And then we say this all the time, but over time we are going to put some capital back into the business. We are going to find an opportunity to do something which would also grow EBITDA. So we think we can we can support that growth rate with line of sight growth in EBITDA that’s in front of us right now, and then longer term, we will likely deploy capital, and we would expect obviously to get EBITDA from that capital deployment.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly on the MISO assets, when do you expect to sort of make a decision here? I mean, obviously given the cash flow profile, you can see an improvement in your conversion cycles I guess, Curt, what are you waiting for around MISO?
Curt Morgan: So, we unfortunately, we’ve got to wait to see what the multipollutant standard what the final outcome of that is unfortunately, it didn’t happen in the fourth quarter of ‘18, but we did get what I think is a reasonable and fair outcome from the Illinois Pollution Control Board we will have to go through another hearing on that that’s okay we’re not uncomfortable with that but we’re thinking April/May timeframe to get a final kind of outcome because what happens, Shar, it goes from the Illinois Pollution Control Board, they recommended it to a committee of the legislature it’s called JCAR. And then JCAR actually votes on it doesn’t have to go to the full legislature; it just goes to JCAR and we believe that it will go through as it is today and if that happens, we should be prepared then to come to the market, but more importantly to begin to execute on what we are going to do and how we’re going to create our final I shouldn’t say final, but create the business that we believe will be profitable now, work is going on right now, and so I want to make sure that and everybody knows that we’re going to be in a position to execute immediately so, we know if the deal goes through exactly the way it is now, we know what we would do and so, it’s just a matter of timing but we also have been contingency planning so, if something else happened, then we would be prepared for that, as well and that would include engaging with MISO to make sure that they understand our plans, engaging with politicians, engaging with the Illinois Commerce Commission, to make sure that we have the pathway to shore this up and there is a reasonably significant we believe a reasonably significant improvement in EBITDA once we clean this portfolio up and that’s what we’re trying to get to unfortunately, we’re going to have a little bit of a drag in 2019 to get to the point where we get a final multipollutant standard.
Shar Pourreza: Got it congrats on this inflection point, guys, seriously.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, good morning just so I have the right bearings, what curve date are you now using for ‘19 and ‘20 guidance commentary?
Curt Morgan: That’s end of September.
Steve Fleishman: Okay and then, Curt or Bill, just when you look at the 2019 guide adjustments that you made, the different buckets, can we just maybe if you recharacterize them to adjustments made on the kind of Dynegy assumptions, because it seems like each bucket has some from that could you maybe do it that way? And also say do you feel like those are now totally done?
Curt Morgan: Yes, so and, Steve, I’ll look at 17 slide 17 maybe that’s the best way so, in MISO the MISO capacity but the way, both of those are Dynegy adjustments so, the one thing you may recall this, although it’s a while ago, Dynegy had a basis issue in, I think it was first quarter of 2018 and what happened is ultimately Stuart and Killen retired that created a basis issue in [indiscernible], and what happened is they had a bit of a hit on that, but it wasn’t reflected in their plan and so, we have basically made an adjustment around that basis I think it’s also Steve Muscato here was it also in Illinois, we had a basis adjustment, as well?
Steve Muscato: Yes, it was around several of the plants down in Southern Illinois, some mild basis adjustment.
Curt Morgan: And, Steve, this was just us getting in and doing our own modeling, because we do a precise transmission modeling and we determined that we felt like there was some basis cost that was missing in the plan and then on MISO capacity, this is just our view of what we think in MISO capacity is going to be and we do believe now we have it properly reflected I would actually say, over time, we may even be able to improve upon the basis situation and manage that better but the other thing is on MISO capacity, there’s some things we’re looking to do, both through shaping up our portfolio in MISO that could improve MISO capacity prices, but also some things that we might some actions we might take with FERC that might lead to an improvement in that we will see that’s proven to be talked in the past and then, on the outage front, I do want to make one comment just on outages is that we did move some outages into 2019 that weren’t there those are, as you know, sort of nonrecurring in nature that was a choice to move outages in and so, to me, that is there’s about 30 million of that effect, I believe, in here and so, if you take that 30 million that was a choice to move that’s right, it’s on the chart 30 million if you take that and you add it to where we, we’re kind of back to where we were when we had previous guidance and then on the regional front.
Steve Fleishman: And is the outage timing at is that at the Dynegy assets, the outage timing? Or a mix of?
Curt Morgan: Go ahead, Jim. Which one is this?
Jim Burke: Yes, Steve this is Jim Comanche Peak is a good portion of that, and then the other portion is PJM and MISO.
Curt Morgan: Yes, so it would be so, those obviously, we didn’t have assets in those margins, so those would be Dynegy and then on the retail front, we took it down I told you about 10 million of that, I believe, was we took down the retail business and that is, frankly we just got in, we looked at how they priced and the transfer pricing between those and what we thought the true pricing was of that retail business and we just felt like we needed to move that down for planning purposes of course, we’re going to be trying to push as hard as we can to get as much value as we can out of it, but we think this is the more realistic view of the business and that is strictly the Dynegy retail business.
Steve Fleishman: Okay but, I guess most importantly, do you feel these are now fully scrubbed and that these kind of function changes won’t happen anymore?
Curt Morgan: We do and by the way, Steve, can I mention one thing? But the other side of this coin is that the wholesale assets are up pretty significantly and we’ve been able to hedge those up, as well so, on balance, our EBITDA actually from the Dynegy and if you take the cost savings, which we could not have gotten on a stand-alone basis, the EBITDA from the deal itself is up substantially but these are clean-up items I just want to be clear about the net balance of all the things we looked at when we looked at the Dynegy acquisition.
Steve Fleishman: Great and then, just one last question on the comments about the 2020 guidance being flat so, just on the surface, you mentioned you have the capacity pressure in PJM and then you have the fact that the ERCOT curves are pretty backward dated downward, so could you just maybe quickly go through what are the positive offsets? I know you have your incremental cost cuts? What are the other positives?
Curt Morgan: Yes so, curves are a part of that, and they could be higher so, if we see the curves move like we expect them to as we get closer to 2020, we might even see that 2020 could potentially even be higher than ’19 we’re just marking that right now.
Steve Fleishman: But you’re not assuming that, though? You’re just yes?
Curt Morgan: What’s that?
Steve Fleishman: You’re not assuming that? You’re just marking? Yeah.
Curt Morgan: Yeah, we’re just marking and so, part of that improvement, Steve, is curves it’s also not just curves in ERCOT it’s also curves outside of we saw the curves move up in some of the other markets, which is why we’re hedging where we can in 2020 to some extent so, that’s part of it part of its exactly what you just said, which is we are also picking up value from OP and the synergies and then also, we’re getting a full year in ‘19 anyway, we’re getting a full year of Upton 2 but then beyond that, in ‘20, the timing yes, so we will not pick up I’m sorry I was going to say the California battery, but that doesn’t pick up until 2021 we have not assumed in these numbers that we have a pickup from MISO, so that is not in there, just to be clear about what are those things that are not we have not yet reflected in these numbers but it’s mainly curves, Steve, and it’s mainly the pickup from the value levers.
Steve Fleishman: Great, thank you. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: Alright, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much, guys and appreciate the detailed and fulsome update that you are giving. So, appreciate it.
Curt Morgan: Thank you. Go ahead, Praful.
Praful Mehta: Yes. So, my question firstly was on all these curves that we have talked about, especially in ERCOT, you see these curves clearly going up, but they are backwardated and we see that you lost some potential for EBITDA given your hedging policy in ‘19. So for example, when we look at Slide 9, clearly you are now keeping your heat rates more open, you are hedging gas, but not as much on power, but especially in ‘20. But wanted to understand how much flexibility do you have with this? As in, how much can you keep open given your belief that these forward curves are backwardated and you are going to see more volatility? Should we expect pretty low hedging on the heat rate side going forward?
Curt Morgan: So, this is always the dilemma when you are trying to manage obviously manage what your earnings is going to be in any given year. We tend to do some hedging and we try to go in kind of increments, but we try to do, for example, for now for ‘20, we are about 30% hedged. We talk about that and say that’s probably a good place to be in ‘20. But we might go higher, for example in PJM and ISO New England, because the curves have moved up. And if there is liquidity, we might want to take more of that opportunity. We don’t see a lot more upside in that, but I would expect us to be a little more sticky on the ERCOT front as we move out on the curve. The real thing that’s difficult to really predict is does somebody do something that doesn’t make economic sense and then affect the curves in the future. We keep very close tabs on development and we have a pretty good sense of what’s out there. This is why I think we are going to probably keep heat rate in ERCOT a little more open than what we might otherwise do, because I think our belief is, is that this relative tightness in the market may rollout for a years longer, because we really don’t see the kind of development out there that’s going to close the gap and get us back to a higher reserve margin level. So, it’s a balance. Would I like to not have $80 million of negative against $185 million? Yes, but we made a conscious choice not knowing exactly how the market was going to play out that we thought it was right to take some risk off the table and hedge and we don’t look backwards. Once you do it, you make that decision. What we really are trying to manage too to be honest with you guys is we are trying to manage to a $3 billion plus EBITDA. And we are sitting here now looking at numbers that are well over $3.3 billion in ‘19, we believe ‘20, and into ‘21. And so, we feel pretty comfortable at times to take risks off the table knowing that things can happen and do in markets that can upset things. I mean, we could go into a recession in the country. That’s something that we have to be aware of and that could have an impact on demand. So, we are all constantly trying to manage what’s available in the market, what is our fundamental view, where do we see the sentiment in the market and then we are taking risks off the table over time. But I think we are pretty comfortable leaving a fair amount of that heat rate open right now in ERCOT, but I think you will also see take some of it off the table in ‘20 and ‘21 as those become liquid markets and we might have a negative against what would have been a positive at a later date if you marked it, but we are comfortable doing that just to manage risk
Praful Mehta: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Curt. Thanks for that. And then maybe just stepping back, giving all the discussion on capital allocation, if you take between now and let’s say 2020, your buybacks, dividend, the debt pay-down and the CapEx, especially the growth CapEx, do you see that, how much excess capital, I guess, do you still have to allocate kind of if you allocate into these buckets the way you are seeing it right now? You clearly have a little bit left over or is that mostly utilized through 2020 at this point?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So, Bill, you can give good detail.
Bill Holden: Yes. Through 2020, we would be mostly – we will be using most of the capital available for the combination of things you listed: dividends, stock repurchases, and additional de-leveraging. But as Curt noted, the capital for the Moss Landing battery storage project is also included in the 2019 and ‘20.
Praful Mehta: Got it. So, the growth CapEx right now through ‘20 is about what, 150, 200 million number and when do you expect to kind of increase that growth CapEx profile going forward?
Curt Morgan: Well, I think as Bill said though given what our capital allocation program is, we are using most of our capital in ‘19 and ‘20 to either pay-down debt or repurchase shares and pay the dividend. We do have some available, but we are also doing as you now, probably, we are doing the Moss Landing, which is growth CapEx. So, that’s a fair amount of growth CapEx in ‘20. And then we have a few other things, some upgrades which we consider growth CapEx, some upgrades to some of our units. So, we are putting some money into growth that will increase EBITDA. But I think ‘21 and beyond is where we have a tremendous amount of cash flow coming in and so we will be looking at growth as being something plus some of these things we are doing, MISO, the batteries, those are going to add to EBITDA, so we look at that as increasing EBITDA. We’re probably going to want to turn our attention to growth beyond that period of time in ‘21 and looking for things to invest in to grow the business. And so, we would probably look at that starting in ‘21.
Praful Mehta: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Very helpful.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Well, thank you again everybody for your attention today and your interest in our company and we enjoy these discussions. We’ll be out – members of management will be out talking to investors and the sell side analysts over the next couple of months. It’s a pretty busy schedule for us. We are always available, Molly as I’ll put her out there – for phone calls to follow up if there are further questions. But we are excited about where we are going with the company and we feel like we had very good results so far in ‘18 and we think ‘19 and ‘20 are shaping up to be very strong years. So, thank you for your time.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tim and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy Second Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Molly Sorg, you may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy’s investor webcast, discussing second quarter 2018 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today’s investor presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Steve Muscato, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. We also have additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today’s call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data, included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. I’m going to turn to slide 6. I’d like to cover our second quarter highlights, starting with our quarter and year to date 2018 financial results. We had another very good quarter. This is even after initiating our combined company guidance in May, which reflects higher forward curves and increased retail expectations particularly in ERCOT. We concluded the quarter delivering 653 million in adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations, results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter, primarily as a result of higher realized prices, lower than forecast operations and maintenance expenses and ERCOT retail favorability that was offset by higher power costs than planned for our Ohio retail portfolio.  A meaningful, yet imperfect comparison we thought might be of interest is a comparison of second quarter 2017 versus second quarter 2018 results, using Dynegy’s and Vistra’s previously disclosed standalone quarterly results for 2017. This comparison indicates a more than 20% increase in 2018 over 2017, driven primarily by higher ERCOT retail and wholesale contribution margins and realized merger synergies. And similar to the first quarter of 2018, we once again executed a partial buyback of the Odessa power plant earn out in May, which reduced second quarter adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million. We expect the three year impact of the transaction, net of the premium paid, to be a positive $2 million. Excluding this second quarter negative impact, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations would have been 663 million. I would also like to highlight that in the second quarter, our retail team grew residential customer counts in ERCOT by more than 1% year-over-year, ending the quarter with 1.493 million customers. This is the highest ERCOT residential customer count we've had since 2015 and it demonstrates how the strength of our retail brands and volatility in wholesale power prices can present an opportunity to acquire and retain new customers.  Notably, during volatile wholesale price environments, our retail business has historically experienced growth, as customers switch providers due to higher bills. This is very important, not only in the short run, but we are generally able to retain the customer for the long run. Year to date, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations is $916 million.  Excluding the impact to adjusted EBITDA of negative 28 million resulting from the partial buyback of the Odessa power plant earnout in February and May, Vistra’s year-to-date adjusted EBITDA would have been $944 million. When we executed the Odessa earnout buybacks, the economic benefit, net of the premium paid, was approximately $25 million, which we largely locked in around the time of execution. In addition to Vistra’s results through June 30 tracking ahead of internal expectations, July is shaping up to be a strong month, as we saw high temperatures and strong demand in the second half of the month. ERCOT set multiple peak demand records in July with the highest peak demand being 73259 megawatts, meaningfully higher than ERCOT’s forecast summer peak of 72.8 gigawatts.  Given these high temperatures, day ahead hourly prices were regularly higher than $1000 per megawatt hour. Vistra was able to capture some of this favorability in the day had hourly prices and our integrated operations performed well to meet retail customer demand. It is important to note that the July real time prices set largely consistent with our expectations when taking into account normal actual wind and strong ERCOT wide plant performance. It appears the hype was overdone coming into the summer, just like the response recently on August 2018 forwards and 2019 and 2020 forwards to the downside. As Steve Muscato will discuss in more detail later on the call, we continue to believe 2019 and 2020 will experience increasingly tight market conditions and forward curves will offer us multiple opportunities to hedge above our point of view, especially as retail players look to hedge those periods. Despite the recent softening in the ERCOT 2018 August and 2019 forwards we first provided combined company guidance in May, we are confident today reaffirming both our 2018 and our 2019 ongoing operations guidance ranges, which are set forth on slide 6. It is worth mentioning again that we increased our guidance for both companies in May, when we initiated guidance for the combined company. If we were comparing performance today to our original guidance issued in November of last year, the beat would be significantly greater. I also want to point out that even though current forwards are below their year-to-date highs, Vistra was able to hedge some of its August 2018 and summer 2019 link in the spring, when the forward curve ran up and was higher than our fundamental point of view. As you know, it is this volatility in the forward curve that allows Vistra to construct a realized price curve that has historically been meaningfully higher than settled prices and above our point of view. Now you might be wondering why we are not updating our 2018 ongoing operations guidance ranges, given the year-to-date performance that has exceeded expectations, embedded in the May guidance. Well, first of all, we already increased guidance in May to reflect higher curves in ERCOT, and better expected retail results. In addition, it would be atypical for us to update our guidance prior to closing out the summer, as Vistra would typically expect to generate around 40% or more of its adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. August is a very important month for wholesale operations, especially in ERCOT and the first half of September is also important in ERCOT. As we have discussed on previous earnings calls, our ERCOT retail business performs well in the shoulder months, especially in October and December. We believe it is prudent at this point to reaffirm our guidance and wait until our third quarter call to consider an update to both the 2018 and 2019 guidance ranges. However, we feel very good about where we are at this point in time. Moving on to our merger value lever targets that are shown on slide 7, I am happy to report that we remain on track to deliver the $500 million of EBITDA value levers and the 260 million of additional after tax free cash flow benefits we previously announced to achieve by year end 2019. We also remain on track to capture the substantial tax and TRA savings and AMT credit refunds of approximately $1.7 billion. Specifically as we depict on slide 7, of the 275 million of traditional mergers synergies, we remain on track to realize 115 million in 2018 and 260 million in 2019. We expect to achieve the full run rate of 275 million by year end 2019, allowing us to realize the full amount in 2020. Similarly, of the 225 million of operations performance initiative EBITDA value lever targets, we remain on track to realize 50 million in 2018 and 160 million in 2019. We expect to achieve the full run rate of 225 million by year end 2019, resulting in realization of the full run rate amount in 2020. You may recall that we are already realizing 50 million on a run rate basis from previous OP work, completed on the Vistra ERCOT fossil fuel fleet. On the free cash flow side, of the 260 million of additional after tax free fish flow benefit, we expect to realize approximately 70 million of benefits in 2018 and 190 million of benefits in 2019. We expect to achieve the full run rate of 260 million by year end 2019, resulting in realization of the full run rate amount in 2020. As I have mentioned previously, we believe there could be more OP value to come, however, we take the balance of 2018 to prove this out, so please stay tuned for more updates on this topic. In addition, as our team continues to optimize the balance sheet to reduce Vistra’s overall cost of borrowing, we could continue to see improvements in our adjusted free cash flow forecast from further interest expense savings. We will keep you apprised of these potential future benefits as they are identified. Last, on taxes, Vistra is forecasting an approximately $25 million TRA payment in 2018 related to the 2017 tax year and is now forecasting it will pay just under $10 million in TRA payments from 2020 through 2022. Importantly, Vistra still expects to not be a federal cash tax payer from 2018 through 2022. We are also still forecasting to receive approximately 240 million an AMT credit refunds during the same period. Turning now to slide 8, we have a few updates as it relates to capital allocation. As you will likely recall from our June Analyst Day presentation, we are forecasting we will have approximately $1 billion of cash available for allocation through year end 2019. And this is after allocating approximately 3.6 billion of capital toward debt reduction over the same time period.  Allocating cash for debt reduction is Vistra’s highest priority for capital allocation in the near term, as Vistra is focused first and foremost on achieving its long term leverage target of approximately 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year end 2019. As we announced at our Analyst Day in June, Vistra’s board approved the allocation of up to $500 million for opportunities share repurchases through year end 2019. We believe our stock is currently meaningful undervalued and as a result we have been executing on our share repurchase program since its launch on June 13. As of July 31, we have repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $23.46 per share. As such, we have executed on approximately 30% of our current authorization, leaving approximately 350 million of capital remaining to be deployed under the program. We now expect to have approximately 550 million available for capital allocation through 2019 beyond the repurchase program. As we have discussed previously, we will be assessing a number of attractive opportunities to allocate this capital, including initiation of a dividend, investment to optimize the balance sheet and further incremental share repurchases. We will also allocate some of this capital to previously announced Moss landing battery storage projects. As you may recall, this project is still subject to the California Public Utility Commission approval and will have a twenty year resource -- adequacy contract with PG&E. Given the PG&E contract and the enormous need for flexible peaking assets in California due to substantial solar generation, we believe Moss landing will be a relatively low risk project and we forecast it will yield attractive returns, exceeding our 50 to 60 basis points above our cost of capital investment threshold. We have flexibility in how much we deploy to this project in 2019 and we are likely to fund it 100% on balance sheet, because we like the returns. The spreads are not that attractive and we want to keep our capital structure as straightforward and simple as possible. Of course, we always retain the flexibility to do a project financing. In the end, as we execute as expected in 2018 and 2019, we can move on a number of capital allocation fronts, including potentially initiating a dividend in 2019, which will likely be decided by year end 2018. I'm moving now to slide 9. As you can see, beginning in 2020, after we have paid off about $3.6 billion of debt and achieved our long term leverage target, Vistra is forecasting it will have more than $6 billion in capital available for allocation through year end 2022. As we expect, we will convert approximately 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow. This meaningful free cash flow generation should enable Vistra to pursue a wide variety of capital allocation and alternatives, including supporting and growing a recurring dividend, opportunistically executing on incremental share repurchases and investing in additional strategic growth opportunities. As always, we will be disciplined in the pursuit of growth, taking opportunities that we project will satisfy our return threshold. As you’ve heard me say many times before, the 60% free cash flow conversion ratio is significantly higher than that of other commodity based capital intensive energy industries and as a result, we believe over time this unique financial characteristic will lead to a full valuation for Vistra. It takes very little maintenance capital to support the EBITDA of the company, given the combination of highly efficient, low cost, in the money fleet in our top tier retail business, in addition to low cost of debt from a very strong balance sheet. We also have the commercial prowess and market liquidity to capitalize on volatility and lock in value on a two to three year forward basis, contributing to certainty, stability and visibility of our EBITDA and free cash flow. However, we do not believe our stock price reflects the favorable attributes of our business. While we would like to see our stock reflect its full value, we are focused on what we control, which is executing our business plan and continuing to deliver on our commitment as we prove to the market that our new business model and commitment to it can create strong stable earnings and significant cash flow conversion, even in a challenging wholesale power price environment. In fact I believe the recent volatility in our stock price, which has been highly correlated to recent volatility in ERCOT North Hub August 2018 power is a bit puzzling. As you know, Vistra is largely hedged for 2018, we took advantage of the previous run up in 2019 to lock in value significantly above our point of view. As Steve Muscato will discuss momentarily, we are confident we will have ample opportunity to hedge 2019 and 2020 at attractive prices above our point of view. However, what is interesting is the volatility and recognition of tight market conditions seems to be contained to about a year forward, leaving a longer term forward steeply backwardated and unsupportive of newbuild, especially thermal. It is our view that any thermal new build with the current forward curves would have to be underwrote on the balance sheet via strategic, as it seems project financing would be very difficult and we require a substantial equity infusion. We do not see any more strategic lining up to place that. Investment in new thermal asset in ERCOT would be a very risky proposition, especially for one-off project. In the end, if the forwards remain backwardated, the ERCOT market should remain high and attractive. Before I leave the new build subject, I would like to comment on a recent Platts Megawatt daily article that suggested ERCOT has3550 megawatts under construction that will help relieve the tight supply/demand dynamics Amex in the market. In the article, Platts Megawatt daily indicated that 848 megawatts of new gas beakers are under construction. In fact, our research suggests that all of those assets are either in commercial operations already or they're in testing mode ready to be released, they are abandoned or behind the fence. In short, to the best of our knowledge, there are no new or material plants under construction in ERCOT between now and summer 2019. Most of the balance of new build cited in the article is wind capacity, but the article is reporting nameplate capacity, ignoring the fact that the peak contribution of wind is generally only around 20% of nameplate capacity, thus meaningfully overstating supply that will be available to market, not to mention congestion issues in the panhandle where wind is at its best. It is also important to note that peak ERCOT load is forecast to grow by approximately 2% each year, which is about 1400 megawatts and with no plants under construction, we believe reserve margins will remain well below ERCOT’s target reserve margin of 13.75% for the foreseeable future. We remain excited about the future of our company and the value proposition we bring to investors. We believe our business model centered on low leverage integrated and low cost operations, disciplined growth and a commitment to return substantial capital to shareholders is a winning formula and will lead to long term shareholder value. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Muscato, our Chief Commercial Officer to give an update on the ERCOT wholesale power market. Steve?
Steve Muscato: Thanks, Curt. Turning now to slide 11, we wanted to spend a few minutes on the call today, discussing the state of the ERCOT market. As many of you know, Texas experienced extreme temperatures the last two weeks of July. During this period, ERCOT saw meaningful daily and intraday volatility, as it’s depicted on the two graph on the slide. During the two-week period, ERCOT North Hub on peak day ahead average prices were consistently above $100 per megawatt hour and even reached $401 per megawatt hour on July 23 with a single hour exceeding $2000 per megawatt hour.  These high day ahead prices provided Vistra the opportunity to sell unhedged length at attractive prices during the month of July. However, while day ahead prices during the month of July were strong, real time prices came in meaningfully lower during the month. Real time prices settled below the day ahead market because ERCOT had sufficient supply to meet the demand, despite the above average temperatures. Specifically, July 2018 wind production at the peak hour was right around the average wind production at the peak hour over the last three years in July.  Outages in July this year however were well below the July average over the last three years. As a result, generation supply in ERCOT was robust enough to meet the peak demand, as represented by real time prices. Importantly however, even though July prices did not reach the scarcity extremes that some might have expected during the July heat wave, average July on peak day ahead prices still averaged approximately $112 per megawatt hour. As a result, we are well positioned heading into August. Turning now to slide 12, you can see there has been meaningful volatility in the ERCOT 5x16 summer heat rates, particularly for 2018. It is this volatility that gives Vistra the chance to opportunistically hedge when forwards are fundamental point of view. In the spring of 2018, for example, ERCOT forwards traded above Vistra’s fundamental point of view and we took the opportunity to hedge some incremental open length in to this attractive forward pricing. Vistra’s hedging approach turns this price volatility into earnings stability. It is important to note that Vistra is net one generation, but when we talk about our hedging approach, it reflects locking in value against this net long position. Even though we have seen less volatility in the 2019 and 2020 forward curves, Vistra has still been able to hedge incrementally in those years, when volatility was present. In particular, as you will see in slide 26 in the appendix, Vistra is now approximately 91% hedged on a natural gas equivalent basis in 2019 and approximately 58% hedged on a heat rate basis in 2019. We continue to believe both the 2019 and 2020 forward curves will include from the current trading levels. Much like the 2018 forward curve did not move meaningfully higher until the early part of 2018, we believe 2019 and 2020 forward curves will continue to improve as we get closer to the prompt summer. Load in ERCOT is expected to grow at approximately 2% a year and ERCOT is not expected to see any meaningfully new thermal generation over the next two years. As a result, we believe the supply demand forecast will remain tight and forward hers will only improve in the months to come, as we depict on slide 13. In the chart on the left hand side of the slide, we have taken the ERCOT May CDR and backed out any new thermal generation, that is in the CDR forecast for 2019 and 2020. But that is not yet under construction on the premise that if you are not yet under construction today, you will not be on line by summer 2020. Making only this adjustment, ERCOT should see a declining reserve margin from 2018 through 2020, implying the tight supply and demand conditions are only going to persistent ERCOT in the coming years.  Despite these declining reserve margins, however, the current 7x16 North Hub spark spreads are meaningfully backwardated, as we depict on the right hand side of the slide. Given the tight reserve margins, we expect through at least summer 2020, we believe this backwardation will reverse at some point in the future.  Importantly and as Curt indicated earlier in the call, the backwardation in the curve makes the development and construction of the new CCGT and ERCOT uneconomic and highly unlikely, especially because ERCOT is energy only market, making it difficult to secure financing. As a result, financial players make rational decision, as it relates to new investment, it remains our view that the supply/demand dynamics in ERCOT will remain favorable, likely even beyond summer 2020. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Holden to discuss second quarter financial highlights.
Bill Holden: Thank you, Steve. Turning now to slide 15, as Curt mentioned, Vistra concluded the second quarter of 2018, delivering $653 million in adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operation, exceeding our expectations for the quarter that were embedded in our guidance. Excluding the negative $10 million impact of the partial buyback of the Odessa power plant earnout in May, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations would have been $663 million. We expect this partial buyback to have a three year impact, net of the premium paid of positive $2 million. Vistra’s second quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $653 million compares favorably to our expectations for the quarter, because of higher realized prices and strong unit performance in our key generation segment, lower operating costs and favorable results in ERCOT retail that were offset by higher power costs and a even higher retail market. Segment results for the quarter can be found on slide 20 in the appendix, where you will see that following the merger with Dynegy, Vistra is now reporting six segments. Nationwide retail, ERCOT wholesale, PJM Wholesale, New York/New England wholesale, MISO Wholesale and the asset closure segment. The corporate and other non-segment consists primarily of corporate expenses, interest and taxes and CAISO operations. Year-to-date, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations is $916 million, which reflects six months of results from the legacy Vistra operations and results from the legacy Dynegy operations for the period from April 9, 2018 through June 30, 2018. Excluding the negative $28 million impact of the partial buyback of the Odessa power plant earnout that we executed in February and May, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would have been $944 million for the period. We expect these partial buybacks to have a positive impact, net of the premium paid over the period from 2018 through 2020.  Turning now to slide 16, you will see that Vistra is reaffirming its 2018 and 2019 guidance for its ongoing operations. As a reminder, Vistra’s 2018 guidance reflects Vistra’s result on a standalone basis for the period prior to April 9, 2018 and anticipated results of the combined company for the period from April 9 through December 31, 2018. Vistra is reaffirming its 2018 guidance, forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion and adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Vistra is also reaffirming its 2019 guidance, forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion and adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations of $2.05 billion to $2.35 billion. You will see on slide 16 that we have updated our 2018 and 2019 forecast for the asset closure segment. As we continue to finalize purchase accounting and evaluate the asset closure obligations of the legacy Dynegy fleet, we expect to forecast for this segment could continue to shift in future quarters. I would note that we included our current 10-year forecast for the asset closure segment on slide 21 in the appendix to today’s investor presentation. Adjusted free cash flow for the asset closure segment is driven mostly by expenditures from mine reclamation work and planned retirement costs and also includes property taxes fees and allocated support costs. As you will see, we expect the cash spend for the asset closure segment to fall off significantly, beginning in year6. We expect the cash spend to decline even further beyond year 10. It is important to note that much of the spend in the next 10 years is included in the ARO reserve on our balance sheet. In addition, the current forecast does not reflect potential optimization opportunities, including potential sales of property. As always, Molly is available to answer any detailed questions you may have. Finally, turning to slide 17, as we discussed in our June Analyst Day, Vistra has already begun to reduce its leverage and optimize its capital structure. Most recently, repricing and refinancing approximately $5 billion of debt and consolidating the legacy Vistra and Dynegy and legacy Dynegy revolvers into a new $2.5 billion facility. As a result of the increase in revolver capacity from 2.3 billion to 2.5 billion, Vistra has reduced its minimum cash requirement from $500 million to $400 million dollars as is now reflected in the table on slide 17. Following the anticipated voluntary retirement of approximately $2.4 billion of senior notes through year end 2019, we expect to achieve our long term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and have approximately $550 million of capital available for allocation. This 550 million is in addition to the $500 million of capital that has already been allocated to opportunistic share repurchases. As we continue to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our total debt, Vistra also will continue to focus on minimizing our total borrowing costs, which could provide incremental opportunities to improve our free cash flow savings from the merger. As Curt mentioned previously, assuming we achieve our long term leverage target at year end 2019, Vistra’s capital available for allocation is forecast to increase materially. Vistra is forecasting it will have more than $6 billion of capital to return to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends or to invest in strategic growth investments from 2020 through 2022. This healthy cash flow forecast is a direct result of our ability to convert approximately 60% of our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to adjusted free cash flow, an operating characteristic that we believe sets us apart from other commodity expos, capital intensive industries and one that we expect will create meaningful shareholder value over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shar Pourreza: So Curt, if you're correct around the curves and you layer on incremental hedges post summer peak, you could actually end up with somewhat higher available capital than you currently project, right? So, how are you sort of thinking about the size of buybacks, especially given the recent weakness in the shares, I mean, the stock is trading at somewhere in the mid double digit free cash flow yields here. So has the size of the buybacks -- has that thought process even evolved since the Analyst Day or could it evolve?
Curt Morgan: Yes, it could evolve. I think the way we have discussed this with the board is that depending on where our share price is, it could just continue to be the best investment that we can make and I think it's a tradeoff frankly in ’18, ’19 because this is not an issue once you pay down debt in ’19, because then our cash flow is strong, but it's a real question of whether you continue to do share buybacks or whether you institute a dividend. And we're very focused, as you know, because you've been with us around, talking to investors, we're trying to get feedback as to what we think the right use of that capital would be in ’19 because that's really where the choice has to be made, because we're so focused on paying down debt and we're going to have some excess cash. Now look, if we have better cash picture than what we're talking about right now, then you can do both. And so we're going to look at that obviously and try to manage that, but right now, given where our stock is, we think it is a very good investment for the company to buy back our shares. We still have a significant amount left to do and we're going to be focused on it. And I will add too that, I think when we instituted the buyback program, we were at around $24 and we would have gone, I'd say, meaningfully above that and continue to buyback because we feel our share price is well north of even that. So I think you'll see us execute this 500 million. I think, the board – we’ll talk to the board near the end of this year about what we want to do, this is what we also want to see how we come out of the summer and what our cash position looks like and then I think by the end of this year, we're going to be able to come back out to the market, probably around the Q3 call and we'll be able to talk about what capital allocation might look like in ’19 and that will definitely include both share buybacks as well as a recurring dividend.
Shar Pourreza: And then just remind us the recurring dividend, when you – assuming the board approves it obviously, assuming when you can pay out your first?
Curt Morgan: So the timing is what you're asking?
Shar Pourreza: That's correct.
Curt Morgan: Yeah. I think, this is a question that we need to talk to the board about, it has to do with what our cash picture looks like. So look, I don't want to get out in front of the board on this one, but it would be some time, if we did so, it would be some time in ’19 and I would guess it would probably be more in the first half, but we need talk to the board about this, but it is in that kind of timeframe.
Shar Pourreza: And then just on the leverage, since you mentioned it, is there – how are sort of conversations if any going with the rating agencies as far as thinking about maybe an investment grade rating?
Curt Morgan: We have not had a conversation with the agencies yet, because we’re still meaningfully above where we want to get to. I feel like that's a ’19 issue that maybe late ’18, ’19 when we’ll engage with them. I think we also – they’re like everybody else about this sector. They want to see it first. So I think we have to execute and demonstrate to them, so we have not yet engaged, we've had some cursory discussions with the agencies, but we have not had a detailed discussion. I think what we will end up doing is going into them -- to see them with a detailed presentation of what our financial plan looks like and have direct discussions, but that's probably later this year, early ’19 before we engage in that.
Shar Pourreza: And then just lastly, on the synergy stuff, it's good to see you guys are achieving ahead of schedule and like there's upside. Just on the timing of the upside, as far as the adjusted EBITDA, free cash levers, so how are we -- is this the 2019 story as well? Are we going into 2020 as you think about incremental opportunities? And then just in general, taking some of your prepared remarks, you gave some color there, but where the incremental levers sort of coming from, is it sort of around further optimization, additional maybe one or two cold retirements, refis, just a little bit of color on sort of where are you seeing any incremental levers post deal closing?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So just the operations performance initiative, the OP process, that's probably more a ’19, later ’19 and probably into ’20, because it takes time to get through each of these plants, it’s very detail and there's, each plants is probably 100 different ideas that end up getting implemented. So that's all about getting through our process and that I would guess that's what that looks like. In terms of incremental interest, expense savings through the optimization of the balance sheet, that could be later ’19 into ’19. So there are things that we're looking at right now that could reduce interest expense and optimize the balance sheet and there may be a little bit on the synergy side, but that -- we probably wouldn't talk about that till the Q3 call, it's not a material amount. But I think those are the things that we still have available to us and I think the nice thing is, I think Q3 call, we will have a little bit to talk about there and I think extending into ’19, we’ll have a lot to talk about. If you think about it, we're going to have, I think, a good year this year, relative to any expectation.  And Shar, I don’t want to reemphasize the folks here that when we came out with guidance back in November, we used October curves. That's what everybody else was using. We then increased it to the, basically the end of March curves, which were substantially higher. So we already increased guidance already this year once and then we're beating relative to that, whereas the other guidance that you guys are hearing are probably back into the October of 2017 curves, which are meaningfully lower.  So we’re continuing to produce strong earnings, strong cash, we have catalysts coming forward as well around the OP effort and other balance sheet improvements and then we're going to talk to the market about whether we want to continue to buy back shares and/or do a recurring dividend. So we feel good about the catalyst coming forward in the next six months and we’ll have a lot to talk about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
Praful Mehta: So quickly on the EBITDA for this quarter, you mentioned that this was higher than what you had embedded in your guidance. Can you give us any sense for how much higher was the EBITDA and obviously you're going to look at full year guidance as well, but is there any color you can give us on where that is tracking broadly.
Bill Holden: So on the front ability, you want to -- I think, we can scale generally where -- how much ours was. I don’t know what, we can’t.
Curt Morgan: I mean basically, I would say, retail is roughly in line, the wholesale segment was higher and probably in the sort of $60 million to $70 million.
Bill Holden: Yeah. Right. And then on the full year basis, we're not ready to – remember, this is against the higher guidance that we gave in May. We're not ready to do anything with full year guidance and I think that’s because, August is playing out, weather has subsided a bit in early August, but you guys know this. I mean, in ERCOT, weather can change on a dime and so we want to, I think it's prudent for us not to do anything yet on full year guidance and we'll have a lot to talk at the Q3 call around that, and you will -- and so I think it's better for us to hold on at this point on full year guidance. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about where we are for 2018, especially given the fact that we had increased guidance to much higher curves than the back in the October ’17 curves that others are using.
Praful Mehta: And then this asset closure segment, just so we understand the NPV of almost 500 million here negative. You said there are funds on the balance sheet to kind of support most of it, can you just give us a sense of how much cash is sitting to kind of support this asset closure kind of investment over time.
Bill Holden: Yeah. And Praful, I think what we’re referring to is that every time an obligation for which the liability has already been booked for those expenditures and then if you look at it, the total at the end of Q2 for mining and plant retirement, retirement obligations was about 1.068 billion in total and roughly half of that would be attributable to the asset closure segment.
Curt Morgan: So Praful, another way to say this is, if you were looking at the asset retirement obligation on the balance sheet of both Vistra and Dynegy all along, which I assume you guys look at, right, because that is the MTV of what the future expected retirement obligations are of the company, that number has not changed much. So that total has been and it continues to be about the same and about half of that relates to the asset closure segment. There's another rather large obligation related to the nuclear plant, Comanche Peak. You probably know this that we -- there's a surcharge in the encore rates that actually go against that. We do have a large reserve against that particular obligation that grows over time, as that surcharge is collected and the obviously we invest in conservative securities to earn a return on what we have in the reserve to go against that.
Praful Mehta: And then finally, just quickly on ERCOT, there's ongoing debates on what's actually better for IPPs, whether it's the volatility like this and no enough price movement to attract new build or do you prefer to have the spikes and see some new build come in overtime, just to keep some kind of stability on the ERCOT market. Curt, where do you see your preference, I guess, what would you rather see in ERCOT and how should it play out.
Curt Morgan: I think somebody called it, I can’t remember which one of you guys called it, the building locks, just right and what's just right, look, I think for us in particular, we like summers in the kind of the 105, 106 range. It's a good sweet spot for us in the way that we're set up. But we can't be too concerned about what the new build situation is going to be. I think, we would prefer, actually, I would prefer to see stronger forwards out two or three years out, because I think it would reflect reality and that there's not new development.  Now would that bring on new development? I don't know. All I know is the previous time when this market came out and the forward curves did respond two to three years out, people built into it and they overbuilt the market and some people went -- there were bankruptcies. And so I would hope that investors would be mindful of that and because there's always that balance of wanting the forwards to reflect what reality is and that we can hedge into, but then the over exuberance of developers and to push projects and overbuild the market. It's really a delicate situation, it's hard for us because we don't control it. We have been very open about this. We run the economics on new build and we just don't see it on the thermal side in the forwards right now. And for us, the way that plays out is, as we roll into the prompt year, forwards keep popping up and then we hedge into that and we'll take advantage of it. What is I guess uncomfortable is that when investors look at it and you guys look at it, you don't see a higher forward curve and so it's hard for you to ascribe higher earnings power to the company because it's not reflected in the forward curve, but we do the fundamental analysis and when you do that, the supply/demand is not going to change, in fact, it gets more favorable for existing generation over the next couple of years. So a there is definitely a dilemma here when you look at the market and you say, okay, well the curves don't reflect it, yet, the fundamentals do.  All of we can do is take advantage of the volatility and hedge into it when it's above our point of view and that's what we're doing. So again, if you ask me what I would like to see, I'd rather see the forward curves come up and reflect reality in ’19 and ’20 and take the risk on the development side, because I think that people, it's not that long ago where people were going bankrupt and I also think there's no strategics right now who are out there willing to just punt down a billion plus dollars in ERCOT again. So I think it's going to be developers and then it's very, very difficult. I know this when I was at ECP, it’s extremely difficult to get financing on ERCOT based asset, even existing ones that we acquired when I was at ECP. So I prefer to see the forwards reflect reality. I just don't think it's doing that right now. That's our own -- that's our own fundamental view and that's what we would prefer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.
Steve Fleishman: Just on the asset closure segment. So the slide 21 reflects I think the costs per closure but could you just remind us of the EBITDA benefits, so we have kind of the full picture together.
Curt Morgan: And you’re talking about the benefit from shutting down, you're referring to the EBITDA benefit of shutting down the three ERCOT plants, Steve. Is that what you’re talking about?
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. My recollection is, you’ve already pulled out the -- part of your guidance is the savings from closure and then this is the cost, I just want to kind of have a full picture of both and maybe this is the net cost, including the EBITDA benefits.
Curt Morgan: So we don't have – I just want to make sure I understand the question. So, the EBITDA we are showing and the actual EBITDA effect and it’s on slide 16 from the asset closure segment and that's a drag as you can see on that -- if you see that Steve, that’s on 16. And then we have the actual cash expenditure, which is, just to be clear, in the first five years, it is largely the remediation of the mines. That's why you see that substantial decline and we expect it to further decline after the tenth year as well over time and frankly those have always been in our ARO. And it's just an acceleration of that because we decided to shut down plants, but I think Steve, if I get you right, you're asking, is there, I will tell you we have not pulled out the EBITDA, what you would recall, you could say that the drag is what the savings is, so we're not going to get the drag anymore, so that's, I think that's a way of thinking about, had we had those in there, that drag –
Steve Fleishman: And then just the 2019, the asset closure, if you go to slide 16, at EBITDA net free cash flow essentially getting rid of that drag, those would be roughly the ongoing impacts as well, so we’re trying to match the cost versus that benefit of avoiding this drag?
Curt Morgan: Yeah. And it actually declines a bit too over time. So we did not provide those, but that EBITDA declines as well, not on a proportional basis, but it does decline, I think into like the $40 million to $50 million range Steve over time. So you would see that also decline that benefit, if you will.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the – any way to give a sense of the MOSS landing investment size.
Curt Morgan: Yeah. I think what we've done -- we have some confidentiality issues, which is what we've been dealing with. So we're trying to be as -- I don't want you guys think, we're being difficult here and I think we used, I think, it was $300 of KWH range, I think the math is, if you take that, what was it against 12 -- against 1200. So I want to be as clear as I want to get on that, but that, I hate to be that way, we get some issues around just what we can disclose directly.
Steve Fleishman: And are you -- is it like a 50-50 investment or you’re going to own the whole thing?
Curt Morgan: Well, we’re thinking about basically doing it on balance sheet, we like the returns and the spreads are just not compelling. So and a little bit about what's going on with PG&E, but they are still investment grade, but the spreads just aren't that compelling. So at this point in time, our view is, is that we would do this 100% on balance sheet.
Steve Fleishman: And you own the whole project?
Curt Morgan: Yeah. And the other thing is, Steve, you know that I’ve got enough battle scars on me, going back into the late-90s, early-2000s where everybody was project financing and trying to have mezzanine financing, all kinds of things, our view is that it's a lot better to simplify our capital structure and to the extent we like the returns and the spreads aren’t great, we’d prefer to keep our capital structure simple and so we are likely to do this 100%. Now look we could project finance it at any time, but we believe it's better to be on balance sheet.
Steve Fleishman: And then just one last quick one on the – just your quick take on the FERC order on subsidized generation and capacity and potential alternative FRR.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So at PJM?
Steve Fleishman: Yeah.
Curt Morgan: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think FERC and I’ve said this at the Analyst Day, I'll say it again. I think FERC has largely been constructive over the years. I mean I can remember LICAP and ICAP and PJM, but LICAP and ISO-New England, [indiscernible] zero. We've actually seen much higher capacity clears, but I also will say equally that states are getting more and more proactive in what they're doing and – but I believe that PJM and FERC are going to come up with a solution that will be either net neutral. I just can't imagine them agreeing to something that when you model it out would be negative to where we are today. I think it will be at least net neutral.  I think FRR has the potential to -- and by the way the devil's in the details on what -- how FRR is implemented, because the details around that, how much load do you take out, how much do you credit against a single resource, which is a block resource against the shape, demand curve, how much do you actually cut out, I don't want to get too into the weeds here, but depending on how that plays out, FRR could actually be slightly positive to neutral. We actually have an idea, which I don't want to front run right now because we're trying to work this with a group of people that we think is – I won’t say it’s a better idea, I think it is, let’s put this way, with the way that FERC is constructed right now with Commissioner Paulsen leaving, you've got to cobble together three votes inside of FERC.  We believe that there's a path where we believe there's three votes and I think that's important too, Steve, is to get those three votes and be able to actually put something in place because the status quo today is not good, where they're able to offer into the market, where there is no -- there's no -- there are no restrictions on renewables coming into the market. There's basically three exemptions right now in the market, but we do think there's a couple of ideas that we're going to go forward with, we're trying to work as I said with a number of different parties to try to get people signed off. I think it’s strength is in numbers when you go to FERC and we think we're trying to – or we think we may have a coalition, but I think it could be net neutral to positive.  I think FRR is probably the weakest in our view for what it would be for us, but that -- the devil again is in the details on that. There are a couple of other structures that we like. I don't believe that you'll get through a straight move for X with complete exemptions that shuts out the states. I think if votes are holding out for that, I believe that has a extremely low chance of success, because I do believe FERC, I believe that part of their role is to try to work with states and some of the things that states are trying to accomplish. The good news is, there are probably some things in between that are good for the capacity market, not perfect, but good and would be good for our company and that's what we're trying to work on as a coalition to get something done that would be net-net positive, but that FERC could live with from a states' rights standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just wanted to follow-up, maybe to complete the last slide here on capital available. You talked about MOSS landing CapEx being in a zip code of say 400 million, my words, not yours, how do you think about the timing of that spread between ’19 and ’20, relative to the 550 of remaining available for allocation. Should we basically think about that as 200 and 200, so take 550 and take out the couple of hundred million for MOSS?
Bill Holden: It could be. The good news is, so there's a couple of things we could do. If we wanted to manage cash and for ’19, because it's really just a ’19 issue at the end of the day. We can do a construction financing and then – or we can work with our suppliers in terms of timing of payments. There is all kinds of things we can do around, how we end up paying the cash out the door for that project and so, I think, for modeling purposes, I think if you said 200 and 200, that’s probably a fair enough or you split half and half, but I think we can optimize around that and I think that will really depend on what the opportunities are from a capital allocation standpoint, whether that be additional share repurchases or whether that would be a recurring dividend and the timing of that recurring dividend, there could be other sources of cash that may come in as well that we may use against that as well. So I think we have -- the good news is, it's a ’19 issue. I think, it's a good issue to have, we can manage it and we could actually push more into 20 if we wanted to.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then just turning to slide 25 real quickly in the commercial ops, maybe the Steve question, just can you elaborate a little bit versus 1Q, versus 2Q, you have had some changes in estimated generation, if you multiply, relative to the estimated ‘19 realized price, doesn't seem like too much of a change, but can you elaborate a little bit on some of the puts and takes going on there, might be slightly lower across all the regions.
Steve Muscato: I can start Steve with at least one thing. If you’re talking about ERCOT, which I think is probably where most of that shows up, as we've incorporated the Dynegy assets, we put their combined cycle plants on the our dispatched protocols and essentially we’re showing less generation during the lower cost shoulder hours that what would have been in the Dynegy forecast.
Bill Holden: Yeah. Basically, it’s cycling the combined cycles a little bit more in our model than it did in the Dynegy models previously.
Curt Morgan: Hey Julien, I’ll add something. We did a study before, I think this is helpful when you think about combined cycle plants and given their ability to cycle on and off, that movement about 80% of the run time for combined cycles is in the money. The other sort of 20% of that is generally at sort of a breakeven type pricing and so if volumes move within that band, it really doesn't move margin at all. And we’ve modeled that and not only modeled that, we then have back tested it with reality and so there's just not a lot of margin in those hours.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So hence, at the end of the day, ’19 expectations aren’t really moving around all that much, especially practically speaking, given this is always your expectation of combined cycle outlook on the margin.
Curt Morgan: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank.
Abe Azar: Can you talk about the hedging strategy, why you hedge natural gas more aggressively than heat rate in the second quarter?
Steve Muscato: When we look at the production growth associated with -- associated gas coming out of places like the Permian, with strong oil prices, that continues to grow pretty rapidly. In addition, the Freeport LNG was delayed. So when we look at the combination of those two events, we just thought there was more probability of downside in gas than upside. So we wanted to kind of take that risk out, which is why we increased our hedge percentage pretty dramatically up to around 91% in the 2019 period.
Curt Morgan: And I’ll add -- we're pretty bearish at a point with gas in the next couple of years. I mean, there's just a ton of gas that keeps coming. And the one thing is I can't get into any of the details, but we have ways of doing this too where we basically stop out the down side and we do that on almost costless basis. And we give up some of the upside on gas and because our skew was more of the downside on gas, we're willing to give that upside away and we're able to hit our 3 billion plus EBITDA target. So while you're giving a little bit of upside away, you're preserving a band of upside in the way that we do this and -- but the key is, you're really protecting your downside, which is where we see the greater probability of occurrence.
Abe Azar: Follow-up is, what have you learned about supply and demand balance in Texas from the summer of future tightness. Is there anything in the way the supply stack performed that makes it kind of different than your assumptions going into the summer.
Curt Morgan: Well, I’ll add some and then Steve, if you want to add there, you can. The fleet, meaning the entire ERCOT fleet of assets has outperformed this summer, meaning in the last, relative to the last three years, outages have been I’d say materially below. And so you can argue, that's a good thing for keeping the lights on, right, but I think it has -- I think people got prepared, they saw it coming, they did, they did the investments they needed for the summer and so far they have performed. The real question is if you get another heat wave or two, what happens here is that you get the fatigue of some of the plants and we’ll see what happens. But so far, I think, that has outperformed in the market from what we've seen. I think it was largely within expectations. We did see a little bit of supply come in imported that we were not expecting to come in and I think you came in, Steve, you want to just mention that?
Steve Muscato: Sure. Up in the Panhandle, the only real issue I would say that there is -- units up in the Panhandle that are in SPP, that can switch back and forth. And so they switched into ERCOT and were able to flow over the Panhandle lines because the Panhandle, that's really the only I guess material issue that we have to watch.
Curt Morgan: And that's not that huge of a surprised although we haven't seen it recently, but that's because prices have been dipped. And so to have that swing in, I think it wasn't a huge surprise to us but it did happen and that because we had strong pricing. So I think, it largely has come in the way that we saw it come in and I think we were prepared for. The good news is to our integrated model worked. I mean, our generation generated value in our -- in some cases, our retail business had higher cost for the incremental volume, but those two -- the generation was more than offsetting. So at the end of the day, I think it worked out pretty darn well for us.
Abe Azar: And then shifting gears a bit, is there an opportunity to sell the assets from the asset closure segment such that you don't have an ongoing liability, similar to the way some companies have divested the nuclear plants recently?
Curt Morgan: Yes. The short answer to that is yes. We have not baked that in. That's an optimization opportunity. We're actually in the process of running an RFP for a number of these to scrap -- sort of scrap metal guys and others as appropriate and I would -- I expect us to manage that liability down, but we’re being conservative and we have not put that against it, but I think [indiscernible] you saw that and that was a significant reduction of what they would have had paying on that and you can expect that we will be looking to do the same. I think, one thing I do want to make a point about though is that on the remediation, as it relates to mines, we have to do that work.  I think, we could offload it to somebody else if they wanted that land and there is interest in it, but we -- the point being is, with the dismantlement and recovery of a site with a power plant, you have some time to do that. There's nothing that’s compelling you that you have to do, so you can wait for scrap metal to be -- the market to be better. As it relates to the remediation of mines, you have to do that pretty much immediately after you shut those down. And then ash ponds, you have a timeframe, but it's relatively near term. We have a little bit of flexibility around it, but that's why we're out right now trying to run some of these RFPs because we want to get out in front of this, so we could see a meaningful change in this liability if we can do that, but we don't know that and so don’t want to bet on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein: Steve, maybe you can talk a little bit about, you mentioned out puzzling tightness doesn’t extend beyond one year. In your conversations with other market participants in ERCOT, what's the driving factor that you see behind the reason why people aren’t willing to buy, I guess, beyond one year at this point?
Steve Muscato: I think it's driven by two things. One is the contract period for retailers, they don't typically buy three to five years, right. There's a lot of buying typically on the front, so that's just what we call it, supply demand dynamic. I think the other thing is just, this is kind of a show me market, we've historically seen either strategics like other companies come in like Exxon previously building combined cycles on balance sheet. And prior to that, we saw [indiscernible] come in and finance, I mean. So I think people are kind of waiting and seeing to see if there's any type of irrational build, but I think it’s a combination of those two factors.
Michael Weinstein: Also just generally speaking, the 60% cash flow conversion rate from EBITDA. Is that a kind of a – you look at that as a fixed number going forward or is that something that trends in an upward direction over time, just curious?
Steve Muscato: I’m sorry –
Michael Weinstein: Yeah. More for Bill. The 60% cash flow conversion rate. Just wondering if that's something that is sort of – you view that as a kind of a consistent constant over time or is that something that trends in one direction or another?
Bill Holden: Yeah. I think, in general, it’s on average 60% over time. Now, Curt did mention that we have the potential to do some things going forward, like additional transactions to reduce interest expense, those types of things to become a net pickup for the balance of the forecast in the free cash flow conversion ratio.
Michael Weinstein: And the extra 50 million that’s -- seems to be available for the second half, the capital allocation program, is that -- that's driven mostly by the results so far this year. Is that safe to say?
Bill Holden: Yeah. I mean I think the biggest changes, when we completed all the secured debt financing transactions that we closed in mid-June, we were able to get a revolving credit facility that was $2.5 billion. The combined company -- the sum of the new revolvers that we had before that were a little bit less than that. So we've got – essentially, we were able to reduce our minimum cash requirement by about $100 million and that’s fled through into the cash.
Michael Weinstein: And then one other thing, I think, Curt, you mentioned, you may have just misspoke or maybe this was just kind of an off the record comment, but I think you said you would definitely be including more buybacks in 2019. Obviously, that's going to be pending a board decision, but is that something that you see as at least part of the capital allocation, be part of it, would almost definitely certainly be additional buybacks, in addition to everything else?
Curt Morgan: No. I think it’s a function of where our stock trades relative to what see as the value. So, what I was driving to make a point is that I think we've got a couple of good allocation opportunities. One is our shares if they're attractive, but two is a recurring dividend and I think other than paying down debt, those would likely be the things that we would look at doing. Bill mentioned that we may do some things what I would refer to as an investment in our balance sheet that may use a little bit of cash, but overall, I think our focus is pretty clear. It’s pay down debt and then have some allocation opportunities that would return capital to shareholders and then there's of course other things that we may end up doing that might shore up the cash picture of the company, we might rationalize the portfolio a little bit, we may consider that. Clearly looking at the Illinois fleet and rationalizing that, if that's what the answer becomes, all can be helpful in the cash picture of the company. But I think those are real focus for us over the next six months.
Michael Weinstein: Just one last question on that same point, asset rationalization, in the past, you talked about California and, as you just mentioned, Illinois and possibly the one asset you have in New York. When do you think those decisions could be made? Is that more of a 2019 issue as well?
Curt Morgan: Well, I think the MISO strategy is going to play out over multiple periods. I’d say as early as maybe later this year and in to ’19, we have some decisions to make and I think the sooner the better on that, right. If we're losing money, we have to make some choices and you would expect us to do that. Independent’s plan is a very good plan. We're actually looking at how our Independents could play in terms of the other markets that are adjacent to New York and whether there's other opportunities. So we have made any decisions around independents and we don't feel compelled to do that.  It would have to be a pretty strong value proposition and it would have to be accretive to us to do that transaction. In California, we're building a nice little business with 300 megawatt battery installation. We've got a good combined cycle plant that we think will be useful over the next several years. The site at Moss Landing has additional opportunity for batteries to be put in there and we know that California is going to continue to grow their RPS and so there's going to be a need for more batteries and we can work with PG&E around that and then Oakland even though it's a smaller site will have, we think is a perfect place to put a battery installation.  They need to do something because they're going to shut the current, we're going to basically retire the current plant, because the RMR contract is going to go away and they need that site, it's a perfect site for battery installation. So I think we could develop a nice little business in California, so that's what we're thinking about now is in California, but I think MISO is where you would probably see more near term action, because we can't sit here and wait for legislators or FERC or others to save us. We got to save yourself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski: Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but you made a comment about growing your retail customer count. Given what has happened so far this summer in Texas and you’re past the missions to maybe grow the business through acquisitions, does it change your perspective, do you think that this summer is going to be make it more difficult to actually acquire large retail books in Texas and then in the absence of that, do you think that there is a way to grow this business organically?
Curt Morgan: So, a couple of things. One, I think, the volatility in higher prices actually make it more favorable to buy books in ERCOT and that increase in customer count that we've experienced, in fact, I’ll remind to everybody that we're now growing customers, our net attrition was down to 0.5%. We're growing customers this year. I think it’s a direct result of that phenomenon is that people -- whether people actively go because they want to be with somebody that's a stronger, bigger entity or whether that entity raises their prices in response to spikes in prices and then that activates them to come to somebody like us.  We've seen it happen and we think we're going to continue to pick that up. And if we continue see tightness in this market, I think our ERCOT book is only going to benefit from that. I think what’s more important than anything, picking up the customer is one thing, but typically because of the way we work with customers, we can keep those customers for a number of years and that's really powerful for us to be able to get customer number one and then retain the customer and we've been able to do that. We saw this before in ERCOT where we were able to pick up customers and we retained them for a while. So this is really an advantage situation for us and this is purely organic really. With regard to growth, we’ve looked at a lot of books and we just have found something that we feel comfortable with and there's a number of reasons why, but whether it's value or whether it's a combination of that and we just -- we don't like the business model, whatever it might be, maybe you can call us picky, but that's precisely what we are when it comes to buying something in retail, because you've got to make sure it's real and we worry about that. So what we are doing because we've picked up a nice footprint out of Dynegy is that we are going to put an effort together and we are already embarking on it to grow our retail business organically outside of ERCOT.  And we will do that prudent, we will do it methodically. We're not going to get out over our skis and put a ton of money into it, but we're going to basically have a prudent effort to grow our retail business on an organic basis. We've done the work and anybody who's grown this business on a organic basis, you shouldn’t expect it to be 200 million like NRG came out with, it's not going to be that. And NRG hasn't performed that kind of number. If you're going to grow at 200 million or something like that, we think you have to buy something.  Could we find something at some point in time to acquire? Maybe. But I just -- I don't see it right now in the near term and we wouldn’t be interested, if there was a retailer that had an ERCOT position, because we can get larger ERCOT, we would be interested in buying selective books, if somebody was struggling and we saw a value proposition, we would do that, we would step in and do it. We have looked at one and maybe others. I don't know, but I do know that we would be open to that. We think this is a time of opportunity for us for retail in ERCOT in particular.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Well, thanks again for joining us on our Q2 2018 earnings call. And I’m sure we’ll be talking to you soon. Thank you very much for your interest in Vistra.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Vistra Energy First Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Molly Sorg, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy’s investor conference call discussing first quarter 2018 results, which is being broadcast live via webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today’s investor call presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Sara Graziano, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. We also have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today’s call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on Slides 1 and 2 in the investor presentation on our website, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in our company. I want to apologize upfront for relatively lengthy call, but we have a lot to talk about today. You may want to grab a snickers for. Turning now to Slide 6, we have a lot of exciting news to cover today as our merger with Dynegy closed just under a month ago on April 9. Following the merger, we are now more than a $20 billion enterprise value integrated power company competing in the key U.S. markets with expected annual adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion or more on an annual basis and projected conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow of more than 60%.
Operator: This increase in our merger value lever targets, combined with power price improvement, particularly in the ERCOT markets have resulted in significantly higher EBITDA and free cash flow estimates for the combined company, as compared to our October 2017 forecast, and we’ll get into that in detail on this call. Speaking of ERCOT market, as many of you know, we were able to close the merger without a requirement to the best of any assets in ERCOT, which positions us well for the anticipated peak summer demand with tight reserve margins, at least, for the next few years. We have retained length even under the most severe, and it is important to note this, even under the most severe weather conditions, like the 2011 event, as a precaution to make sure we meet our customers’ demands under any scenario. So the very important thing about this, we’re carrying very good length into the summer and that’s important to know. Interestingly, forward curves in ERCOT are steeply backward dated beyond 2019, likely due to uncertainty regarding the potential development of longer-term generation resources. Ironically, in our view, the current forward curves do not support new investment, especially in the energy-only ERCOT market. Remember, these are 30-year to 40-year assets and the market is not supportive for even one year to forward hedge either by the liquidity or the pricing to support new development. We like our net long position in ERCOT and believe this will be able to generate approximately $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis in nearly any wholesale market environment. The factors that contribute to the stability are that we – approximately 45% of our gross margin is derived from relatively stable capacity payments in retail operations. We own a young, predominantly gas-filled, low heat rate generation fleet that as a result is regularly in the money generating meaningful energy revenues. And our commercial operations team has proven experience in the industry and has consistently been able to construct a realized price curve for our fleet that is significantly higher than settled around-the-clock prices. With this business mix and operational expertise, supported by our strong balance sheet that is poised to achieve our 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA target by year-end 2019, we are confident in our ability to deliver relatively stable earnings with the opportunity to capitalize on upside, while converting approximately 60% of our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to free cash flow. This free cash flow conversion ratio is significantly higher than that of other commodity exposed capital-intensive energy industries. And as a result, we believe, over time, this will lead to a full valuation for Vistra. However, I must note, we’re not there yet. We understand this is about execution and delivering on our commitments and putting the historical performance of this sector in the rearview mirror with a very different strategy one that centers on low leverage, integrated and low-cost operations, disciplined growth and return of capital to shareholders. We believe we have been true to our word thus far, including a substantial restructuring of our support organization fully completed three weeks after emerging from bankruptcy, completion of an operations performance initiative and returning $1 billion to our investors at the end of 2016. We have several updates related to the combined company to share this morning, including increasing our merger value lever targets, providing a glimpse in the earnings power of Vistra and initiate 2018 and 2019 guidance. Now these updates will be the focus of today’s call. We’re going to start the discussion with Bill Holden, who will cover Vistra’s standalone first quarter 2018 results. We finished the quarter delivering $263 million in adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations, exceeding our expectations for the quarter and even stronger results when you take into account the $21 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA for accounting purposes, resulting from our partial buyback of the Odessa Power Plant earnout in February. Though the impact of the partial buyback was negative in the first quarter, we expect the full-year 2018 impact of that transaction net of the premium paid to be a positive $3 million, with a projected three-year net benefit of $23 million in the aggregate, nearly all of which we have already locked in. Excluding this first quarter negative impact, Vistra’s adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations would have been $284 million, in line with first quarter 2017 results and ahead of our expectations embedded in our standalone full-year guidance. Bill is now going to walk us through the first quarter results in more detail. And then I will cover our synergy and operational performance initiative of OPI update, as well as earnings expectation for the combined entity. We will conclude today’s call with a brief preview of our June 12 Analyst Day. Bill?
William Holden: Thanks, Curt. As we depict on Slide 8 and as Curt just mentioned, Vistra’s standalone first quarter adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $263 million. Excluding the negative $21 million impact from our partial buyback of Vistra earnout in February, first quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA would have been $284 million, in line with first quarter 2017 results, and as Curt mentioned, above our expectations relative to our standalone full-year earnings guidance. For the quarter, the retail segments adjusted EBITDA was $194 million, which was $17 million higher than first quarter 2017, primarily due to favorable weather and lower SG&A expenses quarter-over-quarter. Retail also grew residential customer count by approximately 4,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the wholesale segment was $70 million for the first quarter, which was $35 million lower as compared to the first quarter of 2017. $21 million of the decrease was related to the negative impact of our partial buyback of the Odessa earnout in February. So as Curt just mentioned, we expect the full-year benefit net of the premium paid in this transaction of $3 million and in the aggregate a three-year net benefit of $23 million. O&M expenses also increased quarter-over-quarter. In total, first quarter results exceeded our expectations on a standalone basis, setting up the combined company well to execute on this new 2018 guidance, which I’ll describe later on the call. Curt, so let’s get to the merger update. Curt?
Curtis Morgan: Great. Thanks, Bill. I’ll be moving us to Slide 10 now. As you can see today, we’re announcing an improved outlook for our merger value lever targets compared to what we initially announced upon merger signing in October of last year. After six months of diligence and detailed transition and integration planning, we’re increasing our adjusted EBITDA value lever target to $500 million versus the $350 million announced in October, a robust 40% increase. Sara Graziano and Jim Burke will go into more detail about these merger synergy and operational improvement opportunities later on the call. On the synergy front, we expect to capture the bulk of the value by year-end 2018, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to achieving this result. As you have heard me say before, this is my fifth time leading an OP effort with McKinsey. With assist from Bob Flexon and the Dynegy team prior to the merger closing, we’re progressing ahead of schedule with the Dynegy fleet and we’re nearing completion on the OP effort on the Luminant fleet, which we began shortly after a merger and through bankruptcy in the fall of 2016. As Jim will further discuss, we expect to realize a material amount from OP in 2018, reaching a significant run rate on OP by the year-end 2018 and capture a 100% of these amounts waived of OP by year-end 2019. We believe there could be more OP value to come. However, we’ll take the balance of 2018 to prove this out. We’re also increasing our recurring after-tax adjusted free cash flow target by $170 million to $235 million, of which nearly 70% is expected to be achieved by year-end 2018 and a 100% is expected to be achieved by year-end 2019. The increased target reflect interest and savings from debt repricings and other transactions already completed between October 2017 and today, as well as incremental interest savings projected once we achieve our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. So we’re very confident, these cash flow savings will be achieved. We believe there are even further recurring cash flow enhancements through continued optimization of our balance sheet and we expect we’ll be in a position to discuss those later this year. Last, we’re pleased to announce today that the tax reform has materially improved our projected cash, tax and TRA payment outlook. As we now expect, we will not have to pay any federal cash taxes or TRA payments in 2019 through 2022. This improved forecast is primarily a result of the reduced federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% together with our ability to utilize a higher portion of Dynegy’s net operating losses in the first five years following the merger. In addition, we project we’ll receive $223 million in alternative minimum tax credit refunds over the next five years, which further increases our projected adjusted free cash flow. In fact, we estimate that these factors combined will improve our five-year federal cash tax and TRA payment outlook by more than $1.7 billion versus our October 2017 estimates. We believe it is most important to value Vistra off of a free cash flow yield metric of approximately 10% or less. When you consider our stable earnings power and substantial conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow when compared to other commodity exposed capital-intensive industries. When we apply this 10% free cash flow yield, where discount rate were applicable to the increased merger value lever targets and the impact of tax reform, we calculated projected equity value creation of approximately $7.5 billion, or approximately $14 per share, significantly higher than the $4 billion of equity value creation we projected at the time of the merger announcement. This improved earnings and cash flow outlook, combined with the recent improvement in forward curves in most markets, but particularly in ERCOT, result in what we project will be significant earnings power for the combined company. As demonstrated in the pro forma 2018 illustrative guidance on Slide 10, assuming the merger would have closed on January 1 of this year rather than April 9. We forecast the combined company’s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would have been $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion versus the approximately $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion consolidated forecast at the time of the merger announcement. In addition, assuming a January 1 merger close, we estimate adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations would have been approximately $1.675 billion to $1.875 billion in 2018, again, a mark improvement from approximately $1.415 billion to $1.665 billion in consolidated adjusted free cash flow projected last October. Similarly, as demonstrated in the 2019 illustrative guidance on Slide 10, assuming the full run rate of synergies and operational improvement benefits are realized in 2019, we estimate Vistra’s 2019 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations would be $3.275 billion to $3.575 billion, and our adjusted free cash flow from our ongoing operations would be $2.15 billion to $2.45 billion, which would represent an estimated conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow of more than 60% from ongoing operations. Over the long-term, we expect Vistra will be able to deliver $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations annually even in the challenging wholesale market environments, with an approximately 60% conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow from ongoing operations, including during the periods, where capacity prices declined such as the decline in PJM capacity prices from 2019 to 2020. We believe we’ll be able to bridge those declines to the merger value enhancements, commercial optimization of our assets, cost management and balance sheet optimization. At the end of the day, this means that we expect we’ll have significant capital available for allocation. I know that’s of interest to many of you. As we described on the right-hand side of the Slide 10, our primary capital allocation priorities will be to first to maximize our adjusted free cash flow by ensuring we achieve or exceed our value lever targets as quickly as possible, while also reducing our debt balances to achieve our long-term target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2019. Given our improved adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow expectations for 2018 and 2019, which Bill will discuss momentarily, we estimate we will have approximately $1 billion in aggregate of capital available for allocation in 2018 and 2019, while still achieving our leverage target. We have been working with our Board in anticipation of the merger close to evaluate various capital allocation alternatives. Our projected significant cash flow above debt reduction requirements should report us the opportunity to potentially accelerate certain capital allocation alternatives. As we have mentioned in prior earnings call – calls, our capital allocation priority is in addition to retire debt or to purchase out stock if we believe it is trading in a significant discount to our view of value, evaluate a recurring dividend with a meaningful yield and with the ability to grow it and pursue growth of our business with a focus on retail renewables and batteries. To be very clear, as we have previously mentioned, we will be disciplined in the pursuit of growth, seeking opportunities that we project will earn at least 500 to 600 basis points more than our cost of capital. As I will mention again later, capital allocation will be an important agenda item for our June 12 Analyst Day. We continue to believe that an incremental investments in traditional generation are unlikely at this stage, absent compelling value creation. In fact, rationalization of our generation portfolio is more probable, which could provide incremental capital for allocation. We have been open about the components of our portfolio where we will explore rationalization. They include New York, California and the MISO market. We expect to complete our OP initiative on assets in these areas an explore potential opportunities to enhance value prior to making final discussions on rationalization. We believe these efforts could take the balance of 2018 to conclude. Now I’m going to turn to Slide 11. Following the merger with Dynegy, Vistra now expects, it will generate approximately 45% of its gross margin from stable revenue sources of retail and capacity payments. In addition, we are projecting at approximately 60% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from the attractive ERCOT market, while more than half of our generation is projected to be come from natural gas asset, which reduces our overall exposure to natural gas pricing. It is also important to note that we expect a significant contribution to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow from energy margin in nearly any market environment given our relatively new and efficient generation fleet that is often in the money, especially in the summer and winter peak seasons. This improved diversification of our operations and earnings together with the significant value levers we expect to realize as a result of merger support our belief that Vistra will be able to generate approximately $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA with an approximately 60% conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow from operations in any market environment. Now I’m going to turn to Slide 12. As I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, Vistra is increasing its merger related adjusted EBITDA value lever targets from $350 million to $500 million, $50 million of this increase relates to merger synergies we have identified to our pre-merger integration work which Sara will discuss here in a second. The remaining $100 million of the increase relates to our operation performance improvement initiative that is underway at both Vistra and Dynegy fleet. We now believe we’ll be able to deliver $225 million of the recurring adjusted EBITDA benefits from this program with the opportunity for potential upside to that estimate in the future. Jim is going to provide more detail regarding the OP process later on during the call. It is important for me to note that true to how we have handled communication of OP value opportunities previously, we have a very high confidence level in our ability to achieve the $225 million in EBITDA value levers, we are announcing today. When we prove those incremental value in the future, we will communicate it at that time. In sum, we expect we will realize approximately $165 million of adjusted EBITDA value levers in 2018 with 72% of the value levers achieved by year-end, we expect we will have achieved the full run rate of adjusted EBITDA value levers by year-end 2019 with $420 million of benefit realized during the year. Our entire management team us incentivized to ensure that we do in fact achieve all the targeted merger value levers by year-end 2019. As the Board recently approved a significant grant of long-term options that have a four and five-year clip there. The options are 100% contingent on our collective achievement of hitting the targeted value levers in retention of key people necessary to achieve those targets. I’m also pleased to announce on this call today that the Vistra Board and I have a recent agreement on a four year extensive of my employment contract from May 2018 until May 2023 I think, isn’t it, 2022 to 2023. In my, sorry, in my 35 – I don’t even know I’m on contract, in my 35 year career I have never been more excited about an opportunity than the one before me here at Vistra and I am completely committed for getting the value for the Dynegy merger and achieving the full valuation of Vistra. I’m now going to turn to Slide 13. In addition to the adjusted EBITDA value lever targets, we also have an improved outlook for incremental adjusted free cash flow synergies and tax synergies related to the merger. As you can see, we now expect we will be able to achieve $235 million of run rate additional after tax free cash flow benefits by year-end 2019, a $100 million of which have already been identified or achieved, $20 million of the project benefits relate to expected capital expenditure synergy we have identified and $8 million reflect interest savings we have already achieved from the repayment of the legacy Dynegy notes due in 2019, as well as repricing and other transactions that have occurred between the announcement of the merger in today’s date, thereby reducing our interest expense. The incremental $135 million of projected after-tax free cash flow benefits reflect interest savings we expect we will see once we reach our net leverage of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We believe there remains further opportunity for upside, which is not reflected in this presentation, if we are also able to take advantage of favorable market conditions to further reduce our borrowing costs. In total, we expect we will have achieved, at least, $235 million of additional after-tax free cash flow benefits by year-end 2019. We have also materially improved our federal cash tax and TRA payment forecast for the combined company as a result of tax reform. The combination of lower federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, coupled with our expected ability to utilize more than Dynegy’s net operating losses in the first five years following the merger have resulted in an expectation that we will only pay approximately $24 million in federal taxes or TRA payments through 2022. That – but – and it’s important to note that the $24 million that we forecast to pay – to be paid to TRA rightholders in 2018 that stems from 2017 tax year. We calculate the NPV of the use of Dynegy’s net operating losses, as well as the anticipated receipt of alternative minimum tax refunds to be $750 million to $850 million versus our original estimate of $500 million to $600 million. While it might be counterintuitive that the net – or the net present value of the NOLs has gone up even though the federal tax rate has gone down, our expectation for the ability to utilize significantly more of the Dynegy NOLs in the first five years following the merger closing more than offset the impact from the lower tax rate. As I’ve said before, and as I hope today’s update demonstrates, I continue to believe this merger will bring significant value to Vistra shareholders. We understand our credibility is at stake regarding hitting our value creation targets described above – or described earlier. We have a line item detail for every action required to achieve our targets, sophisticated tracking systems in place and a Steering Committee-based governance process, which I’m a part of that meets frequently to review progress. This is why we are confident in the value capture and why we are excited for the future of our company. We look forward to executing on the value lever target I just described. I would like to now turn the call over to Sara Graziano to describe the merger synergies we have identified in a little more detail. Sara?
Sara Graziano: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 15, as Curt mentioned, during the period, the three merger announcement in closing, the management team of both Vistra and Dynegy undertook a robust integration process. Through that process, we have identified $275 million of projected adjusted EBITDA synergies related to the merger. $115 million of these synergies were achieved on day one, following the merger close and primarily reflect headcount and executive team reductions, as well as certain other insurance, shareholder and employee expense reductions. The bulk of the remaining synergies are projected to come from procurement and information technology cost reductions, reflecting the improved purchasing power afforded by Vistra’s largest scale, as well as the ability to streamline and simplify applications and infrastructure for the combined company. We also expect to achieve synergies from facilities consolidation and reductions in corporate support, retail, commercial and plant operations overhead. We are forecasting $115 million of these synergies will be realized in 2018, with 89% of that estimated to be achieved by year-end. We project $260 million of the synergies will be realized in 2019, with the full run rate achieved heading into 2020. We have specifically identified each line items that comprises our $275 million merger synergy target. And as Curt mentioned, we have a sophisticated tracking system in place and a robust governance process that includes periodic reporting. As a result, we have full confidence in our ability to deliver on these targets. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our operations performance improvement process in more detail.
Jim Burke: Thank you, Sara. As you know, our OP process is well underway at both the legacy Dynegy and Luminant fleets. At this stage in the process, we are confident we can achieve $225 million of projected EBITDA enhancements. I would summarize these in the three main areas: the Texas-based limited assets, procurement, and the legacy Dynegy fleet. The Luminant opportunities are in addition to the $50 million value for 2018 that we reported on last fall from our OP efforts. This value has already reflected in our standalone guidance. First, for Luminant, Martin Lake continues to find cost and revenue opportunities as an early participant in the OP process. Our nuclear site, Comanche Peak, embarked on its efforts late in 2017. They have identified and are implementing actions worth nearly $30 million on a run rate basis. The levers are across the Board, including working with major alliance partners to rationalize scope, prioritizing O&M projects, and reducing site labor and support functions. Comanche Peak is already one of the lowest nuclear sites in the country. But the team continues to look for ways to compete in a challenging wholesale market, reducing its costs, while maintaining a focus on reliability and nuclear safety. Our combined cycle sites, Forney, Lamar and Odessa have been working through their OP efforts and are implementing ideas worth approximately $10 million. These ideas include improving heat rate through reducing compressor air inlet temperatures, improving cooling tower efficiency and better monitoring and repair of cycle isolation valves throughout the steam cycle. Another example, planned outage timelines have been optimized through kaizen exercises to shave over 20% of the total time, resulting in lower cost and more gross margin. Importantly, these three teams did their OP efforts together, which materially enhance the value they are achieving. Moving on to procurement, another big lever for our combined fleet. Sara mentioned procurement synergies have been identified as part of the $275 million. We have identified additional procurement opportunities as part of the OP process in the $225 million target. Combined these procurement opportunities represent a 6% to 8% reduction of the fast loan and spin-based of approximately $1.7 billion, excluding fuel costs, such as coal and natural gas. We expect to realize these savings through the ongoing evaluation of procurement specifications, strategic sourcing and demand management. For example, the team has identified opportunities in ammonia and bulk chemicals of $10 million to $12 million, averaging 20% reductions. Maintenance, repair and operating supplies with our larger scale is yielding more than 15% through our initial rates. Now turning to the Dynegy combined cycle fleet, we are leveraging our learnings from our combined cycle fleets here in Texas to see the OP effort across the additional 19 sites. Kendall was the first Dynegy combined cycle to pursue their OP effort and they are executing on more than $5 million of value. Given our collective efforts to date, we’re going to organize the OP roll out across the rest of the gas fleet in a coordinated manner, focusing by major value drives, such as heat rate, outage reduction, min-max load, offload and deep dives into O&M. We anticipate that the legacy Dynegy combined cycle fleet will realize a run rate value of, at least, $55 million through these efforts. Finally, the legacy Dynegy coal fleet has 13 sites with about half of these underway with their OP efforts. We have a head start on some of these sites as Dynegy kicked off these efforts prior to the closing of the transaction. Many of the levers are similar to actions implemented on the Luminant Texas coal fleet we reported on earlier. Reductions in min load, improvements in max load, as well as faster ramps up and down all create more flexibility and value. For example, Zimmer is executing on reducing its min load from 650 megawatts to 450 megawatts, yielding nearly $1 million a year in recurring value. Ramp rates for the majority of the MISO and PJM coal fleet are currently in the 3 to 5 megawatts a minute range and for sites has completed OP, we’re executing our ramp rates that are nearly three times faster. With respect to improved generation, reduction on auxiliary loads can drive value across the spectrum from full load down to minimum loads. As minimum loads value is created by identifying equipment that isn’t needed to support a lower level of generation, including cooling water pumps, circulating pumps, air compressors and other house loads to improve the bottom line. The average reduction both in terms of more effective planned outages, as well as more timely response to unplanned outages is a source of opportunity. [indiscernible] typically a challenge for coal plants and effective preventive maintenance and standard playbooks to recover from them is critical. Many of the MISO and PJM sites experienced unplanned or forced outages in excess of 13%, and being able to reduce this by, at least, 50% is consistent with our experience, as well as reducing the turnaround time from 72 hours to 48 hours or less in times of an unplanned outage. Heat rate focus through implementation of onsite data and analytics, coupled with real-time advanced monitoring and diagnostics from our POC or Power Optimization Center is a significant source of value. Operators can use this information to adjust operating parameters to resolve issues related to combustion and cycle efficiency losses. Baldwin and Zimmer have identified over 4 million of annual heat rate improvement through their OP efforts. Overall, we’re currently projecting we’ll realize $50 million of the OP benefits in 2018 and $160 million in 2019. On a run rate basis, we will have achieved roughly $115 million of our $225 million OP target by the end of 2018 and 100% by the end of 2019. It’s important to emphasize, there were literally thousands of action items required to capture the OP value across the fleet. This requires attention in detail and strong accountability in governance assisted by online tracking and reporting tools that reinforce the ongoing performance mindset. The value capture is important, but sustaining the OP process is critical to long-term success and key to identifying even more opportunities down the road. As a result, while we believe there could be opportunities for further upside to this $225 million target, we will not know a confidence until we get further down the road. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Holden to discuss a few financial highlights of the combined company.
William Holden: Great. Thanks, Jim. Turning now to Slide 18, where we have provided four sets of financial projections. Two sets of which represent our actual guidance for 2018 and 2019, and two sets of which represent illustrative guidance for the same period and are being presented for illustrative purposes to indicate the earnings power of our company. I’d like to note that we provided the 2019 guidance along with 2018, because the 2019 guidance reflects the partial year of combined – our results, given the timing and the close of the merger. As Curt mentioned and I will discuss the illustrative 2018 shows that on a combined company basis, including Dynegy’s actual first quarter results, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow for full-year 2018 are projected to be higher than we anticipated when we announced the transaction. We thought it would also be beneficial to provide you an early look at 2019 on a combined company basis. On the right-side of the page, you will see the illustrative cases. The 2018 illustrative case provides a projection of the earnings and cash flow generating power of the combined company, as the merger closed on January 1, including actual first quarter results for both companies. Assuming the merger had closed at the beginning of the year, we forecast the combined enterprise could earn between $3.15 billion and $3.35 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and between $1.65 billion and $1.875 billion in adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations. With the exception of the introduction of the Asset Closure segment, this illustrative presentation is on a comparable basis to the pro forma 2018 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow projection we provided when the merger was announced. As Curt mentioned, assuming the January 1 merger closing, we had previously estimated the combined company could earn between $2.875 billion and $3.125 billion of adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The improvement of approximately $250 million, when comparing midpoints versus our 2018 illustrative case reflects four primary drivers. First, an increase of $5.85 million related to the increase in merger value lever targets, we now expect to realize within the first 12 months following the merger close. Second, an adjustment of approximately $85 million to reflect the exclusion of the Asset Closure segment from the 2018 illustrative case we’re presenting today and an increase of approximately $155 million reflecting improved power prices, primarily in ERCOT. These positive variances were partially offset by Dynegy’s first quarter 2018 results, which were approximately $75 million lower than Dynegy management expectations at the time the merger was announced. I would also note that we – had we compared our current 2018 forecast for April 9 through December 31 only for the same time period from our October 2017 forecast, our positive variance would have been even higher as the results for those periods does not include Dynegy’s first quarter underperformance. Because the merger actually closed on April 9th Vistra’s 2018 financial results will only include Vistra’s results on a standalone basis for the period prior to April 9th 2018 and results of the combined company for the period from April 9th through December 31, 2018. As a result, our 2018 guidance which can be found in the first column in the table on Slide 18 reflects earnings and cash flow expectations for 2018 on this basis. Vistra is projecting 2018 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations will be $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion with adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Guidance reflects power price curves as of March 30th, 2018 in all markets. Because our 2018 guidance does not reflect earnings and cash flow expectations for the combined company for a full year, we are also providing 2019 guidance today. In 2019 we expect adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion and adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations of $2.05 billion to $2.35 billion, which represents a projected adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 64% from our ongoing operations, highlighting the significant cash flow generation we expect from our diversified and integrated operations. The last case we present on Slide 18 is in the far right-hand column and it reflects, as Curt mentioned earlier this morning, the earnings potential of the combined enterprise once we realize the full run rate of projected EBITDA value lever targets. In that instance we would expect Vistra could earn approximately $3.275 billion to $3.575 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and approximately $2.15 billion to $2.45 billion in adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations. Turing to Slide 19, we provide a look forward from our 2018 and 2019 guidance, the illustrative cases we show on Slides 10 and 18. The 2018 illustrative case reflects 2018 guidance and has increased for actual and forecasted Dynegy results for January 1st to April 8th, the period prior to the merger close and an incremental quarter of realized EBITDA value levers. The 2019 illustrative case reflects 2019 guidance and has increased by $80 million to reflect the full run rate of adjusted EBITDA value levers, versus the $420 million we expect to realize in 2019. In any case we believe the projected earnings power of the combined enterprise is impressive and it supports our view that Vistra should be able to earn upwards of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis, while converting approximately 60% of its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to free cash flow. Turning now to Slide 20, we have updated our capital structure slide pro forma for the merger close. As we can see, pro forma for the merger closing and for the retirement of the $850 million of Dynegy 6.75% senior notes due in 2019 which occurred on May 1st, we had net debt of the combined company of approximately $10.5 billion as of March 31st, 2018. We project our net debt to adjusted EBITDA will be 2.9 times as of year-end 2018 and approximately 2.2 times at year-end 2019. As a result we project we will have approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation over the next 18 months, while still achieving our 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA target by year-end 2019. We plan to provide more specificity regarding our initial capital allocation plan at our upcoming Analyst Day on June 12th. We also plan to discuss our thoughts of optimizing our capital structure at the Analyst Day. We have approximately $3.7 billion of senior notes that are callable later in 2018 and in 2019, streamlining our capital structure and minimizing our borrowing cost will be an important focus for us in the coming months. To the extend the capital markets remain favorable, we would pursue repricing or refinancing opportunities in the future as has been Vistra’s historical practice. Our balance sheet remains strong and we’re committed to achieving our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2019 as we continue to believe maintaining a strong balance sheet is critical to success in this industry. I’ll now turn the call back over to Curt for a brief wrap up before we get to Q&A.
Curtis Morgan: Thanks Bill. I know we’ve covered a lot here today, but at the end here it might be useful to quickly highlight again why we’re optimistic about the future of our company and the ability to create superior shareholder value for investors. As I said before, we believe our overall strategy of low leverage, low cost integrated business operations and disciplined capital allocation is the winning formula for companies like ours and will lead to long-term shareholder value. We continue to believe that the Dynegy merger is consistent with these strategic imperatives and represents the single largest opportunity to enhance shareholder value relative to a host of other strategic alternatives we evaluated, we now must execute. If you just take a look at Slide 22 briefly, the closing of the Dynegy merger provides what we believe will be significant value creation for shareholders, as well as diversification, scale and a platform to expand our integrated operations. On the value creation side, as I highlighted it earlier, we now project the merger together with the impact of tax reform will create approximately $500 million in adjusted EBITDA value levers, $235 million in additional after-tax free cash flow benefits and more than a $1 billion, $1.7 billion in federal cash tax and TRA savings, plus anticipated alternative minimum tax credit refunds. The combination of these benefits we believe should create approximately $7.5 billion in equity value, as a combined company we expect we’ll be able to drop approximately 60% of our EBITDA from ongoing operations down to adjusted free cash flow. A free cash conversion ratio that is significantly higher than that of other commodity based capital intensive business stream. As an organization, we project to earn approximately $3 billion or more per year in adjusted EBITDA, that should translate to approximately $9 billion or more in adjusted free cash flow from ongoing operations from 2018 through 2022. We are absolutely committed to achieving our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2019 and expect we will have significant capital to pursue a diverse set of capital allocation alternatives, including returning capital to our shareholders. In fact, we estimate we’ll have approximately $1 billion, as we discussed previously, $1 billion in capital allocate in 2018 to 2019 while still achieving our leverage target. The ability to achieve these financial metrics is a direct reflection of our earnings, geographic and field diversification, as well as the quality of our assets and operations following the closing of the merger. We are the leading retail platform, we’re a market leader in Texas in addition – and the addition of Dynegy’s generation fleet provides a platform for us to leverage Dynegy’s existing retail presence, while applying best practices from our TXU Energy brand to expand further in these regions. Further, even before any retail growth, we projected approximately 50% of our adjusted EBITDA over time will come from a combination of retail and capacity payments, as well as from the attractive ERCOT market. Our operations are estimated to be the lowest cost among competitor generators as we project all-in wholesale cost of approximately $9 per megawatt hour and retail cost of approximately $45 per residential customer equivalent, which gives you the sense of the type of scale benefits that we receive. With the addition of the Dynegy legacy CCGT as we believe we now have the youngest most efficient fleet in the key U.S. markets, more than 60% of which is gas field. We own a very attractive low cost assets that are in the money [ph] most of the time and contribute to our ability to produce consistent earnings and free cash flow in a variety of market environments, while lowering our organizational risk and reducing our exposure to natural gas. We look forward to going into more detail regarding our new operating profile at our Analyst Day on June 12. So as we conclude today Slide 23 provides a highlight or a high-level preview of our Analyst Day which will be held at our corporate offices here in Irving on June 12 beginning at 8:30 AM central time and concluding approximately 1:30 PM central. The topics we expect to cover includes capital allocation which I know is probably high on everybody’s list in the priorities thereof. Our five-year free cash flow outlook, capital structure optimization opportunities, operational update included retail, commercial operations and generation with an OP update we also plan to provide our view yet it’s a preliminary one, as you might guess on the impact and the opportunities for batteries. I know that’s something of interest and we had a lot of chatter about what’s long-term impact from batteries, we obviously are very interested in that and we’re beginning to invest in it. We hope many of you will be able to join us in Texas and we look forward to that day and for those of you unable to join us in person, the event will be broadcast out via a webcast on our website. With that operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey good morning guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey Shah.
Shahriar Pourreza: So on the synergies, nice surprise on the incremental $50 million for the corporate combo. As we’re thinking about additional opportunities, have you tapped this out, and more importantly, as we’re thinking about the operational synergies, obviously past comments even to Dynegy’s own internal studies seem to point to multiples higher on the operational side. So again, can you review sort of what you need to play out to up this number to more emulate what the past comments have been? And when do you think you can update us since you already have pretty good start?
Jim Burke: Well, look I think included [ph] what we have done and look I have to say talking about it to one thing, doing it to another, so I really don’t – I know there were some numbers sitting around out there, but Shah here is how it works, because these are plant by plant you’ve got to get in and you got to do the assessments and it takes to go into each plan, and I’ll just – I should emphasize you guys, there are literally thousands of line item items that comprise getting to that 225, and there will be another thousand or so to get another incremental on that. And so what we’ve done with our OPI effort is try to bring those out and community those to you guys, when – once we get into the plant and do that early-on assessment. What we do is we do an early on assessment, it’s very detailed and then we put target out there for the plants to go after and then we prove it up. And so that’s why I say any increment to the 225 is likely to come more at the end of this year so that we can get through the plant assessment. And then so that we could feel comfortable, the one thing that we are very focused on is putting numbers out there that we know we can achieve that you can take to the bank and that don’t erode our credibility because we get out in front of ourselves. So I think that’s what we’re trying to do here and I do think there is probably I think Jim, I think there is another incremental here, and it’s just we want to prove it out and then communicate it, I think you probably shouldn’t expect anything on that until the end of this year and then we’ll communicate what that increment looks like. As far as synergies go, I think we hit the top end of that. I mean, that was our top end of our range and we hit it, and I don’t – I would not expect a lot more rallies looking for cost savings, but I would consider it anything more material. It’s the OP area where I see incremental and there is a good chance that we’ll have some reasonable amount there, but we’ve got to prove it up before we communicate it.
Shahriar Pourreza: That’s helpful, well understood Jim. And then just not to jump ahead of the Analyst Day, but $1 billion of cash available after delevering in the near-term which you’ll obviously likely be materially higher post your delivering targets, you are looking at shutting down some additional assets with Dynegy, you’ve got a mark in Texas this summer and then you got stable cash flows right from retail. So how and when should we begin to think about a dividend? Is 3% to 4% yield "meaningful". And then as you sort of think about a Board approval of the dividend policy, when you think about growth, are you sort of thinking about looking to emulate regulated peers?
Jim Burke: Yes, so, I don’t think – well, let me just step back, on the dividend I think what we are thinking about there and we’re inching toward this, but we just bought the company, we are integrating it, we feel pretty confident about it, we got a summer ahead of us, and I don’t think that you are going to hear from us that we have a definitive day to begin a dividend at the June 12th. I mean we are still working with our Board, but I doubt, but I do think Shah that when we get through this summer and we work with our Board, we have a Board meeting over this summer. We’re going to take a hard look at that and we’ve been pretty open. And that is something that’s squarely on our – in our site. But we’re also just trying to be mindful that we’ve got a lot of wood to chop elsewhere and we want to make sure how we’re doing through this summer before we make a final decision on it. We do still think this 3% to 4% yield range is important. But we also think, it’s incredibly important to be able to grow that dividend. I think, you – it’s hard to – it’s hard for us not to admit that when you look at the cash generation of this business and it’s because we have low leverage, so we have low interest expense, and it’s because our CapEx to maintain our business is substantially lower than the CapEx at other energy commodity-based capital intensive business have to plow back in their business just to generate the same level of EBITDA like E&P and MLPs, that we are going to have a multitude of opportunities around capital allocation. And we’ve been very open about the fact that dividend is one that’s squarely on the table. We’re just – we’re not ready to pull the trigger on that, but I think we’ll make some final decisions as the year progresses. I think, you should expect to hear from us much more definitive sense on this in 2018, I believe that we will have that discussion. But we are going to talk about some other things around capital allocation and in particular, we’ll talk a little bit about our stock where it’s trading and share repurchases. I also – at the June 12th meeting, I think, there’ll be more meat on the bone on that one.
Shahriar Pourreza: Terrific. And then just one last question, if I may. As you think about retail deals sort of the Northeast, what’s sort of the read-through to your plan as presented today, i.e., any potential delays you see as far as you’re delevering targets with a retail deal or the deal that you’re sort of looking at shouldn’t sway your balance sheet targets more than a couple of months?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. No, I think, it’s limited, if any. So I think we can do retail type transactions if we decide to do that. And I should emphasize that, our retail strategy is going to be – it’s going to be a dual strategy and it will be looking at M&A. But I will tell you that, we have to feel very confident of what we’re getting and we have to feel confident that we are getting a good value proposition, and that’s not easy to do looking at the retail companies that are out there. We have a way to do business and we have certain standards. And we’re going to make sure that what we’re giving is real at the end of the day. I think, what you probably are going to see the way you will see is a pretty aggressive out of ERCOT organic growth strategy that will put the lever down. And we think that’s probably – it’s like the more cost-effective approach to growing our business. When I look at it this way, Shahriar, we’ve got people out there that have grown businesses to $100 million of EBITDA and 1 million customers over sort of a three-year to seven-year period. And I look at that, I look at the problems that we have in our company why can’t we do that and why can’t we build the kind of business we like rather than acquiring something, paying a premium and getting something that we’re not even certain is a real solid business model. So we’re going to take a hard look at that, Jim. As Scott Hudson is here with us too, who runs our retail business, they’re working on with Sara Graziano, working on our retail strategy. We’re taking that to our Board in our July Board meeting. And I think, you guys will hear more about that strategy as well, and we’re going to talk about that too at our June 12th meeting.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And Curt, congrats on the contract extension. Now you stuck with us for four more years. See you guys.
Curtis Morgan: Well, now that you put it that way. I’m looking forward to you. Thank you, Shahriar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Thank you, guys.
Curtis Morgan: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Congratulations.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Julien, how are you?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good. Thank you very much. Happy Friday. I suppose to start it off here with the Asset Closure. So we talk about that in terms of the composition of EBITDA attribution and/or just timeline to actually getting these things closed out, I’m thinking specifically MISO in California?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So a couple of things on that, and then Bill, you might want to get in some more details. But the one area, I’d say, we’re still working on is the Dynegy sort of ARO-related expenditures over the next few years. And so, look, I think we’re talking about by the 12, Julien. We want to provide kind of a 10-year look at our cash expenditures, and we’re – and the reason we’re not doing that right now is that, we’re still working on it. And – but we know we need. If we’re going to separate this thing out, we know we need to provide detailed information and we’ll also give you an EBITDA outlook as well. So the EBITDA and – yes – and so, I guess, what you guys know on the Asset Closure segment that I’m going to – on that particular thing, we’re going to give you guys more detail. On asset rationalization in terms of what we’re going to do with our assets, I think, we’ve been clear on this. We’ve got to figure out what kind of a business we have in MISO. And I know that everybody would like to see the capacity market get passed from the Illinois legislature. This is probably not a commonly known fact, but I grew up in the Illinois and I know a little bit about Illinois politics and that stage right out of Chicago and we have downstate Illinois coal plants and there are a lot of people in the Illinois that don’t like coal plants. I think, it is a really low probability that we get that passed, I love it, we’ll work on it, but we can’t do a business around a hope. We’ve got to build a business around reality. And if reality is that we have the same capacity clears that we just saw in MISO, we got to do some things with our business. I think, the most important thing for our company is the work with the Illinois EPA and legislature to get the multi-pollutant standard changed, and that’s good for everybody, because it basically allows the assets to sort of fend for themselves and we have a higher probability of keeping more assets in that market with that adjusted than if we keep them in a bubble state that they’re in now. So our highest priority has been to work through the MPS process and try to get that through. We’ll continue to work on the capacity market, but I just don’t have a lot of hope for that. What’s that mean at the end the day, that we’re – and we’re going through the OP process too, that’s the other prong. But once we get through all that like we did in Texas, we’re going to make decisions and we’re losing money on assets, we’re not going to run. And so I would expect balance of this year, you guys are going to hear a lot more from us about what we’re going to do with our MISO generation. I do think though at the end, when we get all that done, the retail business and what’s left of the assets, we could have a little – nice little business in MISO that we can make money on, and that’s the real goal on this. And so that’s what I think, you’ll see us probably a smaller, more focused business in MISO at the end of the day. In California, we have some opportunities there that I don’t know that I can really – yes, I can’t really talk about right now, Julien, but I like to. But we have some opportunities around our asset sites there that are pretty intriguing and could be very valuable. And so our view on that is, we got to play that out and then we’ll decide what we do with it. Right now, our position in California is not our strategic position, and we’re not looking to grow for additional generation at all in California. So if that’s what we’re left with, you can expect we’re going to start to do something with that position. So I think, that’s about as straight as I can be on those assets right now. And unfortunately, we don’t have anything to announce on it, but we’re working through it. And what we’re trying to do is simplify our business and focus on those areas where we make money. And I think it’s ERCOT, PJM, EISA New England is really the core. And then around that, we’ve got a tremendous retail business and we’re continuing actually to grow our other retail brands in Texas. We can do an acquisition of something in Texas and expand a little bit further on the retail side. And then with our asset base, we’re looking for retail channels to basically sell our long asset position – generation position in PJM. And we’re focused on Illinois, Ohio, where we already have position there. We’re looking at Pennsylvania. We think Pennsylvania is a very good state for retail, as you can expect us to be pretty aggressive there. We’ll look at Massachusetts, Connecticut, those types of markets on the retail side. So that if you think about what are we going to do, we’re going to look at the retail side of the things to grow that out in addition to the asset rationalization. And then, of course, I’ll talk about this renewable as it relates to our retail business, are important to us. And then we have began to, what I call, into the battery world. We think batteries are real. We think there are some opportunities in ERCOT around batteries, and so we have opportunities may present themselves. And so you’ll see us actually probably put a little bit – I won’t scare anybody, we’re not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here. But we have some small opportunities that allow us to get in that business and to understand batteries and understand their application in markets like ours.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. A quick follow-ups, if I can. What’s the curve date for the adjusted EBITDA that you post today just to understand where the mark-to-market is?
William Holden: Yes, it’s March 30.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, it’s very, very recent. And then separately, what’s the retail allocation of synergies just when you look at the numbers that you put out there just if you were to kind of slice up that 500?
Curtis Morgan: It’s like $10 million.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. [Multiple Speakers]
Curtis Morgan: So I should tell you, Julien, I think I spent like $17 million in total. And so we got over half of that as synergies, but there weren’t a lot of meat on that bone. And our – as you know, even prior to this deal, our costs, we were at – we were one of the lowest cost on a residential customer equivalent basis as it was, just TXU Energies. And so when you combine what they had, almost 1 million customers with $17 million of spend, that’s why we saw such a precipitous reduction in that particular metric on the $45. We were – I think we were around $90 previous and we dropped it in half, because we picked up all these assets, because the way that they go to market, right? They do mainly muni ag type stuff and broker-related. And so their overhead structure was less, because they’re not doing like we do a lot of door-to-door and direct marketing type stuff.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you all very much.
Curtis Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Hey, good morning. Can you guys hear me?
Curtis Morgan: Hey, morning. Good morning, Greg. How are you?
Greg Gordon: Yes, good morning. So – I’m great. So a lot of my questions have been answered. When you talk about your confidence that you can be $3 billion run rate EBITDA company even under stressed market conditions. I mean, I guess, I’m looking at the page 19, you’re the $3,275 to 3,575 illustrate of EBITDA forecasts, you’ve indicated that you think you can nudge that a little bit higher perhaps with further OPI – OP initiatives. But when you run your simulations and get comfortable with that, you’re sustainably sort of even in a down cycle of $3 billion EBITDA run rate business. Can you just give us a sense of how you stress tested that? Are you counting on countercyclicality in the retail versus the wholesale business, or what factors drive you to the conclusion that you think you can convince investors that this is fundamentally a pretty stable through the cycle cash flow business?
Curtis Morgan: Yes. So – look, I will say that, we do have the combined company, Greg, we ran models on this is – has reduced its exposure to gas fairly significantly one with the retail channels, but also because of – in PJMs a significant combined cycle fleet and the small effect there – that we’ve added into us. And so we have reduced it. But I want to be clear, we still have exposure to both gas and we have exposure to heat rate. And that’s how we look at our combined power position to break it between gas and heat rate. The reason I feel comfortable and we feel comfortable, because there is exposure outside the bands of what we provide. But it’s our ability to access liquid, commodity markets, and to be able to hedge and to take that tail risk out. And some – we’re doing something now on ERCOT to attempt and I think we’re doing a good job of it in terms of how we hedge the summer to try to reduce the risk of that – something could happen in ERCOT that where we would go below the bottom-end of the range. I don’t want to miss – mislead anybody. I mean, this is a presentation where we’re talking about our company and what we think we can do, but through execution. But we still have risk in our business. But the way we manage our business and we think about, we don’t wait and swing for the fences, we find opportunities relative to our fundamental view in each of the markets, where the forward curves are above that and we take that risk exposure off the table. And by doing that, in fact, we really like the PJM market, because it actually has more liquidity further out into the market that we can manage that risk to an EBITDA outcome and we talk about that with Steve Muscato, who runs our commercial group will say, okay, Steve, this where we want to be. This is the EBITDA we want to hit. And then Steve comes up with strategies on how we can hedge, and how we can we can basically hit those numbers. So Greg, it is my confidence in our ability to commercialize our assets and use liquid forward curves to be able to manage the risk that we have inherent in our business. But I also would say it’s also, because we have, on the energy side, we have very low heat rate in the money assets, so that’s helpful to we have capacity payments as well as retail business. And when I combine all those and we stress, we stress our outcomes, we feel comfortable that we can hit the $3 billion plus and we can convert roughly 60% of that into cash.
Greg Gordon: That’s great. When you talk about batteries, not to try to gun jump you on the Analyst Day, but that’s my job. You talked about ERCOT, but you’ve also mentioned California. And I know back in March, I think it was back in March. They had a ramp in the duck curve one or two days that was basically so substantial. It was like three to four years. They hadn’t projected a ramp in the duck curve as steep as they saw for another three four years out from when it happened. And so they seem like they are kind of in a bind there to figure out how they’re going to deal with the – how much renewables they have there, so is it battery storage opportunity what you’re infer – you are implying or inferring you could be looking at at those sites in California, as well as perhaps dabbling in retail focused batteries in ERCOT?
Curtis Morgan: Yes so this is what I could say that we have two of the best sites in PG&E’s territory for batteries and so we are certainly considering that. And if you thought, Greg, you hit it around the head. If we thought we were going to have a business in California, it wouldn’t be a traditional generation business, that’s not gone. We had an opportunity to get into alternative energy sources like a battery and we could do it through potentially contractual arrangements and work with the utilities there that’s a business that we could get our head around. And that might even lead potentially to even considering God forbid our retail business. But the bottom line is, the business we have there now is not a sustainable business, but what we could do with those sites could actually create a business in California. So that’s it. And I would also tell you Greg that we should have called our battery section – session on the 12th to Greg Gordon battery session, because you’re the one that has pushed us on that issue about what does the long-term – and I’m being serious, what does the long-term outlook of these markets look like with a realistic penetration of batteries and renewables. And it’s a serious issue for us and we’re studying it and we’re going to share with you guys what we know. We won’t – well, nobody has the answer, but at least we can share with you guys our thoughts around it.
Greg Gordon: No, that you are too kind, I appreciate that. Have a great morning.
Curtis Morgan: All right, Greg.
Operator: The next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much. Hi guys.
Curtis Morgan: Hey, Praful. How are you?
Praful Mehta: Good, good thanks for the fulsome update. A couple of quick questions, I know you’ve gone through a long session already. But quickly on Texas, firstly, in 2019 how long a position do you have right now and how do you see that market evolving 2019? You’ve talked about backwardation as well. So a little bit on Texas and how you are positioned to any sensitivities to movements up or down on the curve. How would you see that play out?
Curtis Morgan: So I’m going to – you can go ahead and get the numbers, I want to talk about [Multiple Speakers].
William Holden: Yes, I’ll just quickly give you a summary of our positions and the sensitivity. We’ve got those in the appendix by the way, so you can refer to them later, but you’ll see on natural gas, this is at March 30, we were about 23% hedged and then on for 2019 and then on heat rate for 2019 in March 30 we were about 42% hedged. But I guess the sensitivities, that – the changes that are also greater. So for natural gas sensitivity, at March 30th, it was sort of $0.50 change in gas, if $235 million of the gas price changes up to $225 million down as the gas price was down. And again, that sensitivity of heat rates are held constant and then the market heat rate sensitivity for a one turn in heat rate is about $160 million up and $150 million down.
Curtis Morgan: Yes, that’s good. So to talk maybe slightly more qualitative than that. But just directionally in 2018 and 2019 when we look at just the fundamentals for the market and since we live here we see this, the tremendous amount of growth that’s going on in Texas, load growth seems extremely strong. And when you look at what the new resources are likely to come on between 2018 and 2019, there are some, but it’s limited. We actually felt that 2018 or that 2019 would trade over 2018. Now what I’d say is, there’s a physiology to all these markets and I think people got caught in 2018 in a little bit and so that played out in kind of behavior and physiology and 2019 hasn’t quite gotten to that further yet. But we certainly have seen 2019 come up as we’ve gotten further into 2018 and I believe it will come up even further as we see the physiology of the market turn from 2018 to 2019 and realize that there really isn’t a lot of resource coming on and there’s still load growth coming. So we’ve always felt like 2019 was going to be a little tighter, we’ll see, but it’s certainly seems that way to us was. The question for me and we’ve talked about this a lot is, what happens beyond that, but even 2020 it’s hard to see how there’s enough resources that are on. There’s no big chunky gas combined cycle play, first as I’ve said earlier when you look at the forward curves they don’t justify a plant like that. So we do believe that there’s going to be renewables to come in when and solar, but it’s just not enough over that period of time. So we still think that 2020 is going to look pretty attractive over time and that should pop up as well. And then some of that backwardation should come out in the market. Now backwardation I think is a function of uncertainty and it’s a function of illiquidity. And as you move close to those markets, we would expect those curves to move up. So it’s going to be interesting to see there’s no – I don’t think there is any more – there’s any deep pocketed strategic who are going to make a poor decision to build 2000 megawatts when it’s not needed in this market. I don’t see that happening, this is going to have to be merchant players and in an energy only market with backwardated curves and which is already difficult to get – to raise debt against. And then the illiquidity in the market because of the uncertainty that trading – traders have in it, it will be very difficult to go out and do a long-term hedge to support a newbuild. So that bodes well, on my view that bodes well for some sustainable relatively strong ERCOT market over the next few years.
Praful Mehta: Got you, super helpful. And then just quickly on taxes, it sounds like a meaningful improvement on the NOL utilization and the fact that you’re really not paying any cash taxes for a number of years. Just wanted to confirm, is there any uncertainty or do you require any tax approval or private letter ruling or anything else for this change or is this already okay in terms of the NOL utilization of Dynegy?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, our assumptions are based on existing law at the date of the merger, so we’re pretty confident in the outcome.
Praful Mehta: All right. Well, thanks so much, guys.
Curtis Morgan: Thanks.
Operator: Your next caller comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your line is open.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So I wanted to actually go back to this sensitivity that you guys are showing to changes in natural gas prices in Texas especially, because power prices in Texas have seemingly decoupled from natural gas, which could be a good thing given what’s happening with the Permian gas. And so how do you see it evolving, yes, we have obviously scarcity for being priced in Texas and that might continue for the next year or two. But you’re also seeing this incredible growth in the gas, associated gas in Permian that with some estimates suggesting that from next summer Permian gas could be basically trading at zero. And so how should I think about that and your exposure of your earnings to that the gas, regional gas phenomenon?
Curtis Morgan: Yes, so a good question, let me try to attack it in a couple of ways. First of all, we sort of recognized the gas exposure. And I think I’ve mentioned this previously that we break our power position to a gas equipped position and a heat rate position. And without – I don’t want to give up our positioning, but what I will tell you is that we are mindful of where gas is and we are protecting ourselves on gas in both 2018 and 2019 to the downside. And we have effectively done that and I think that was important for us and we left ourselves some position for the upside. So I can’t really, Angie, I just don’t think it’s right for me to say much more details than that, because Steve Muscato is staring at me and I don’t want to give away our position. But we recognized exactly what you said. Now, we actually though, we actually have a net benefit in our fleet in particular the Luminant fleet, but our gas is doing quite well, I mean with the kind of gas prices. And one thing we are going to have Steve go through at the Analyst Day is pricing in ERCOT because I think there maybe some misconception about it. But in general, gas generators that Houston Ship Channel gas, which trades at a premium to Mid-Continent gas, Texas gas, and Waha. They set the price investors congestion from West Texas. What that means is, because Houston Ship Channel gas is higher, there are plans to source off a Midcon and off of Texas and off of Permian actually have a advantage relative to those that price off a Houston Ship Channel or Henry Hub. So we have a pretty good position, now we’re working on the Dynegy plans to get them better positioned on the gas over time, but even they are better positioned than some, but the bottom line is, our assets, Forney, Lamar and Odessa are really good gas positions. So for us we’re in a pretty good position. The thing we’re worried about and it’s a fair question is the downside on the gas and we have positioned our self to guard against the downside, because we think that in the next year or two, we think it’s downside risks. What I would also tell you though is that, the markets are telling us that they believe, it could even build pipelines in Texas so I want to be clear. This is not the same kind of situation that you have in the Marcellus and you have the Utica and other parts of country where there’s Nimby about or just anti-pipelines. You can build pipelines in Texas, so anybody who thinks they could come in and try to build on the backs of low gas, try to build a combined cycle plant that’s going to vanish in about two years, because there’s going to be gas, there’s going to be pipeline to get that gas out and try to get it to LNG facilities and get it to rest of the country and also to try to get it to Mexico. So that differential is going to dissipate over time.
Angie Storozynski: That’s all I have. Thank you.
Operator: This will bring us to the end of the Q&A portion, as we have ran out of our time limit. I turn the call back over to the speakers for a closing remarks.
Curtis Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much. And thank you all for taking the time to join us. As I stated at the beginning of the call. We do appreciate your interest in Vistra. And we look forward to continue our conversations. Thank you. Operator?
Operator: Thank you everyone. This will conclude today’s conference. You many now disconnect.

Executives: Curt Morgan - President and CEO Jim Burke - EVP and COO Bill Holden - EVP and CFO Sara Graziano - SVP, Corporate Development Molly Sorg - VP, IR
Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research Abe Azar - Deutsche Bank Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good morning. My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy 2017 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin the conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's 2017 results investor conference call, which is being broadcast live via web cast from the Investor Relations section of our web site at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our web site are a copy of today's investor call presentation, our 10-K and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Sara Graziano, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. We also have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call, as necessary. Before we began our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on slides 1 and 2, which explain the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe can be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to lead our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. I would like to begin our discussion today on slide 5 of the presentation that we provided, with a brief highlight of our 2017 financial results. For the full year 2017, I am pleased to announce that Vistra Energy delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.455 billion. This in the top quartile of our narrowed guidance range, reflecting very strong business performance by our operations teams, and tenacious cost containment across the organization in the face of significant headwinds during the year, including persistent mild weather and a two month unplanned outage at Comanche Peak Unit 2 during the summer. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year was $831 million, which was roughly a conversion ratio from EBITDA to cash flow of almost 60%, and we are right in the middle of our narrowed guidance range, demonstrating the stability and significant dropdown of cash from EBITDA delivered by our low leverage, low cost integrated model. In fact, our business model converts substantially more EBITDA to free cash flow, than other commodity based energy businesses, reflecting relatively lower capital required to sustain our business and our focus on lower leverage. We believe this is a key differentiator for Vistra, and one that investors and analysts will begin to recognize and focus on. For Vistra Energy to deliver these strong financial results in the face of such significant headwind throughout the year, demonstrates the resilience of our business and the dogged focus of our company on maximizing shareholder value. I would like to point out a few key highlights in 2017. We identified run rate EBITDA enhancements of more than $50 million through our fossil fuel operations performance initiative, what we call OP. It's impressive, given that these results were achieved on the remaining generation fleet, as the retirement of three large coal plants where improvements were of paramount focus and importance. As you know, similar OP processes currently underway at Comanche Peak, and we plan to capture the benefit from that process as part of our merger synergies, and our OP process going forward. In total, this Vistra realized approximately $28 million out of the $50 million run rate EBITDA uplift in 2017 from these operational improvements, which helped us to achieve our strong 2017 financial results. Somewhat forgotten in all of our business activities, since the emergence from bankruptcy is the implementation of our support organization restructuring, which occurred largely in 2017. This restructuring enabled us to take more than $340 million of costs out of the system, an increase of more than $40 million of our initial target, without disrupting service levels or compromising business operations, most notably, safety. We believe this is significant and real evidence that we know how to restructure organizations and follow through to not only capture our targeted savings, but to go beyond those targets. In our view, this should bode well for our ability to carry through in our targeted value enhancements from the merger with Dynegy. It is easy to talk about taking costs out of the system, it's another thing to execute on it, and we believe we know how to execute. On a cash basis, we reduced borrowing costs on our credit facility by approximately $66 million on an annualized basis, through various repricing transactions executed from February 2017 through February 2018. We made several capital allocation decisions in 2017, as we continue to modernize our generation fleet to the acquisition of Upton 2, one of the largest solar projects in Texas, which remains on track to be synchronized to the grid sometime next month, and achieve commercial operations in the summer, and I will note that the Upton 2 project has very attractive integrated economics and will support our retail offerings in the future. We also had the acquisition of the roughly 1,000 megawatt combined cycle plant in Odessa, with access to deeply discounted gas supply in West Texas, in which we fully integrated within 30 days of signing and almost immediately upon close. Also on the generation side, in October of 2017, we made the difficult decision to retire nearly 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal plants. Unfortunately, the economics of these plants and their related mines did not support continued investment and operations, in what was an unprecedented low power price environment. All three of these plants, Monticello, Sandow and Big Brown will retire as scheduled. Going forward, we will report all the financial results related to the reclamation of decommissioning these sites in our new asset closure segment, which I will disclose in more detail momentarily. And finally, on October 30, 2017, we announced the execution of a merger agreement with Dynegy, creating what we believe will be the leading integrated power company in the United States, focusing on the key tenets of success; low leverage, integrated operations, with an emphasis on the regional customer, business execution, cost management, and disciplined capital allocation. We believe we demonstrated these key tenets during the transformational and successful 2017, which should lay a strong foundation for 2018 and beyond. Turning now to expectations for 2018; while we have strong tailwinds for Vistra, on both a standalone and combined basis with Dynegy following the closing of the merger, we will not be updating our 2018 standalone adjusted EBITDA guidance range this early in the year. As you may recall, we announced an initial standalone guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.45 billion and a standalone adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $750 million. I would like to highlight that our adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2018 includes approximately $70 million of non-recurring Comanche Peak generator capital expenditures to replace the Unit 2 generator, and create a spare generator for the site for the future. Excluding this non-recurring item, our adjusted free cash flow guidance range for the year would be $670 million to $820 million. And as I just mentioned, in 2018, we are also introducing a new reporting segment called the asset closure segment, which will track and measure the performance of our operations teams tasked with the job of efficiently decommissioning and reclaiming the plants and mines at our now retired sites. While this segment will incur various retirement and reclamation costs for the next several years, those costs are expected to significantly decline over time, and eventually, would be wound down, when these activities are complete. As a result, both the Vistra Management and Board of Directors have found it informative to view the asset closure segment as separate and distinct from Vistra's ongoing operations. We also believe that it is important to provide this incremental detail to you, our investors, to give you visibility in the performance and earnings potential of our ongoing operations. While creating this new segment is very important to provide a better view of the ongoing earnings of Vistra and the wind down of our reclamation activities, frankly more important to me, is the organizational focus we have created to maintain proper attention on our ongoing business operations, and to separate out and to bring distinct focus to winding down our retired facilities and properties, which includes, generating a revenue stream from scrapping and monetizing of the retired sites. We expect this to be a profit and loss segment, and obviously, we are going to try to minimize the cost, and hopefully reduce that as much as we can, through scrapping and monetizing the sites. It's also something we want to build a core capability around, given the fact that when we closed the Dynegy transaction, they also have sites that are closing, and we are likely to have sites that will close in the future, and we need to be good at minimizing the costs related to exiting these sites. As Bill will explain in more detail later on the call, Vistra expects its ongoing operations will deliver adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion to $1.49 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $690 million to $820 million in 2018, excluding the asset closure segment. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range increases to $760 million to $890 million, when excluding the non-recurring Comanche Peak generator CapEx. Under any of the views that you take around this, the free cash flow conversion of our company is over 50% and on the high end, it's almost 60%. When valuing our business, we believe it is most appropriate to apply an EBITDA multiple or free cash flow yield to the guidance range of our ongoing operations, as the asset segment exists merely to wind down the operations of our retired sites. We expect to provide more information on the cost to wind down the retired assets, coincident with the reporting of the asset closure segment, starting with the first quarter 2018 results. We expect the call will likely be in early May. And last as you know, forward curve, especially in ERCOT have improved in recent months, and no potential benefit from that has been included from the curve uplift, and is not reflected in our 2018 guidance ranges that we announced in the fall. We plan to initiate guidance for the combined company following the close of the merger, and we expect to include that guidance initiation to update for forward curves, synergies and our OP effort. We are hopeful that this will coincide with our first quarter earnings call, as we are cautiously optimistic the merger with Dynegy will be closed by then. Moving to slide 6 and 7, as the charts on 6 and 7 depict, whilst historical forward price curves as well as historical spark spreads has improved in recent months in nearly all the key competitive power markets in the U.S., ERCOT curves have continued to rise and remain materially above historical 2017 level. The same trends exist for 2019 historical forward price curves and spark spreads, as we depict on slide 7. While we are not yet providing guidance for Vistra pro forma for the anticipated merger, as I mentioned earlier, we believe the recent upward movement in the various forward price curves could provide tailwinds for the pro forma entity in 2018 and 2019. Specifically, utilizing December 29, 2017 curves, we estimate there could be upside for the combined Vistra and Dynegy businesses of approximately $100 million to $150 million in 2018 relative to the full year estimates included in our merger announcement presentation, and potential upside of approximately $100 million to $200 million in 2019 relative to Vistra Management's adjusted EBITDA estimates for the combined company disclosed in the merger registration statement. As of early February, forward curves in most markets outside of ERCOT have since come off their December and January highs. However, we still believe there could be tailwinds to 2018 and 2019 financial performance as a result of recent power price and spark spread improvement, in particular, the continued and significant increase in ERCOT curves through February. Perhaps more important, the forward curves continue to exhibit significant volatility. It is this volatility that enables Vistra to create realized price curves, that has historically been materially above settled prices. Following the closing of the merger with Dynegy, we will be able to execute this hedging strategy on a larger fleet with tremendous liquidity at both the PJM and EISA New England markets, and so long as the curves continue to exhibit volatility which we expect and as they have done in recent months, Vistra will be well positioned to create incremental value for shareholders. As you all know, gas prices have reflected softness in recent months, due to associated gas and shale oil formations and we continue to expect that gas prices will remain range [indiscernible] between 2.50 and 3.50 an MMBtu for the foreseeable future.  Despite this somewhat static gas forecast, we have recently seen material improvement in summer heat rates in ERCOT, as a result of the forecasted single digit summer reserve margins, which are well below ERCOT's target reserve margin of 13.75%. It is this improvement in summer heat range that is driving the improved outlook on the summer on the on-peak summer forwards in ERCOT. While 2019 power prices and sparks rates have not improved as much as 2018, we believe the summer of 2019 in ERCOT could be even tighter than 2018, and curves will likely reflect it, as we get closer to 2019. It is important for us to note, that following the merger, Vistra will be even less sensitive to gas prices than it is on a standalone basis. This is due to the addition of Dynegy sizeable combined cycle fleet, coupled with the significant contribution of capacity revenues to the pro forma enterprise, which will better insulate Vistra from low gas prices as compared to standalone Vistra's predominantly coal and nuclear fleet located in the energy-only ERCOT markets. We estimate the merger with Dynegy will reduce our sensitivity to natural gas by about 12% to 15%. This reduced sensitivity of natural gas is just one of the many benefits we foresee from the merger with Dynegy, which I know, is a topic of much interest to you all. On slide 8, we will move to the Dynegy merger update. So let's go ahead and turn to slide 8, where we have set forth a few key merger updates. First in early February, we received HSR clearance to proceed with the merger and last week, we received approval via consent agenda from the New York Public Service Commission, leaving only the shareholder vote, which I believe is on March the 2nd, taking the FERC approval and the Public Utility Commission of Texas approval. As you know, both the Dynegy and Vistra shareholder votes are scheduled to come up, as I just said, on Friday, March 2nd, and we are cautiously obviously optimistic around that vote. The balance of our regulatory approval processes are progressing as expected, and at this point, we believe we remain on track to close the merger during the second quarter of this year. Those of you who have been tracking the various dockets, have likely observed that the latest developments in the FERC and PUCT approval processes. FERC did request some additional analysis related to Dynegy's MISO assets, and we provided the requested information on February 5th. We have requested FERC approval of the merger by March 15, and at this time, we have no reason to believe that FERC approval process would extend beyond the second quarter of 2018. In fact, there are similarities between our application and the recently approved ECP-Calpine transaction, which took approximately five months to receive FERC approval. While we cannot predict with certainty, a five month approval process will place our merger approval with FERC in the mid-April timeframe. Similarly, in the PUC of Texas, approval process from PUC -- PUCT's staff has filed its recommendation regarding the Commission's approval of the merger, and Vistra has filed its response. All in accordance with the administrative law judge previously filed administrative schedule. Importantly, no party has requested a hearing, meaning that the Commission would likely be able to act on the merger approval at one of the upcoming open meetings in late March or mid-April. It is important to remember, that in this instance, the PUCT's approval is based solely on whether the combined company is at or above the 20% market share at the time that the merger closes. We do have a robust sales process, as most of you know. It's in place for the potential sale of three gas steam units, Trinidad, Graham and Stryker. Should the Commission ultimately sign with staff on the issues of grandfathering of Lake Hubbard or our proposed DC, a tie stipulation, we are fully prepared to divest off these assets, in order to fall below the 20% cap, which is a commitment we made in our merger application. We forecasted divestiture of these assets, without any material impact on EBITDA in 2018. At this time, we remain confident we will be able to close the merger with Dynegy in the second quarter of 2018, as I had mentioned, and as we previously forecasted. My view is, its most likely in the mid-April to mid-May timeframe. On the financial side, we remain optimistic about the combined earnings power of the pro forma entity, and we continue to believe there could be upside to both our previously announced EBITDA synergy targets, as well as to our operational performance improvement targets. We have a robust integration process underway. That process put us in a position, where we would be in a position to integrate, close the deal and take over as of March 1. So we are well on our way, even though we think that the approval will be beyond that, that we wanted to be ready as soon as possible. And you guys all remember, that through that process, we believe we had $225 million of projected EBITDA synergies that we announced in October. We believe that there is upside to that, and that upside, we have already targeted and identified. Similarly, our OP process is well underway, and at this stage of the process, we continue to believe we will be able to exceed the $125 million of projected EBITDA enhancements we previously announced. As I indicated earlier, I expect we will be able to provide the market with our updated synergy and OP targets, shortly after we close the merger. When we provide an update on the merger synergies and OP targets, we want you to know that we believe that you can take them to the bank. We want to put the time and the effort and the nail holes down, so that you can be comfortable that we can execute against them. I continue to believe, this merger will bring significant value to shareholders of both companies to the value levers we have identified. Moreover, the geographic [indiscernible] and earnings diversification of the combined enterprise should improve stability of earnings and cash flow going forward and also derisk the enterprise as well, especially from a natural gas exposure standpoint, as I discussed previously. We are prepared to quickly and efficiently integrate our operations following the merger closing, and as always, we will keep you informed of the relevant updates along the way. Before I turn the call over to Jim Burke, I would like to touch briefly on capital allocation, as I know this is a topic of much interest to the financial community, given our expected significant EBITDA conversion to free cash flow. First and foremost, as we noted when we announced the merger transaction in late October, our priorities following the closing of the merger, will be to seamlessly integrate our operations, achieve and exceed our synergy and OP targets and execute the combined business operations. We do believe these efforts will result in significant cash flow generation for the combined company. For the first 12 to 24 months going forward [ph], our focus will be on paying down our debt to achieve our net debt-to-EBITDA target in the range of 2.5 times as we discussed before. We will of course, evaluate growth opportunities during this period, predominantly on the retail side, and we will be flexible on allocating capital to these tuck-in opportunities, as we do not control when accretive transactions might present themselves. Longer term, we are going to have to turn our focus to some sort of return of capital. We will always plan to maintain some capacity to buy back our shares, particularly when we believe our shares are significantly undervalued, like we believe, they are today. We would also entertain paying a recurring dividend, as we believe a more systematic dividend would be more attractive to investors, and therefore accretive to our stock price, as opposed to paying uncertain special dividends, which are hard for investors to predict, and therefore difficult to value. We of course have not made any decisions related to future capital allocation, as we are firmly focused on closing the Dynegy deal and wringing out the value that we have promised to the market. We will be working with our board in the months, following the merger to evaluate capital allocation alternatives. I can say however, that if we did make a decision to pay a reoccurring dividend, it would need to be meaningful, likely in the 3% to 4% dividend yield range, and we would need to have confidence we could grow the dividend over time. This would be the only way to ensure the market will give us credit for reoccurring dividend, if one were implemented. If we execute and achieve the expected free cash flow projections, we should be able to comfortably handle a reoccurring dividend with the attributes I just described. I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to cover 2017's operational highlights. Jim?
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. Let's turn now to slide 9 to briefly discuss the 2017 commercial highlights. Consistent with our Fossil Fleet performance in the first three quarters of the year, we have once again delivered high levels of commercial availability in the fourth quarter, finishing the year at 96%. As we have noted in the past, it is critical for operations teams to ensure units are available when market prices are most attractive. This will be even more important in 2019, given the tighter reserve margins expected in ERCOT, increasing the probability of scarcity events. In addition, strong commercial availability supports Vistra's ability to opportunistically hedge our assets; which as you know, is critical to our ability to deliver a more stable and higher earnings profile in volatile power price environments. For the full year of 2017, Luminant's commercial operations team realized prices that were nearly 44% higher than settled prices. It is this active asset management approach we take to our hedging and dispatching our generation fleet, that has allowed Vistra to realize prices that are materially higher than settled prices in periods of sustained low wholesale market prices. You will see however that Vistra is forecasting a much smaller hedge premium in 2018, which is exactly what you would expect in an up market. Vistra opportunistically hedges its assets, in order to mitigate risk, from dramatic changes in power prices, particularly to the downside. Over the past several years, as power prices have been falling, Vistra has been able to realize prices materially above settled prices, as a result of its opportunistic hedging approach. We are always willing to take the risk of higher settled prices, as Vistra is generally net long and can capitalize on scarcity pricing events, should they occur. In fact, as power prices rise, our net length actually increases, and with that incremental length, we are able to capture upside from the positive movement in power prices. Even if our hedged positions are negative in those circumstances, the entire fleet is better off by the upward movement in power prices. Importantly, by hedging into the volatility we observe, we are minimizing the risk of the down market. In fact, Vistra plans to take advantage of the recent upper momentum in the forward curves, to opportunistically hedge in the outyears, in order to minimize the risk that prices could decline in the future, in the face of a rational newbuild for example. So as long as we continue to see reasonable levels of volatility in the forward curves, we will continue to opportunistically hedge our wholesale length in future periods, which should continue to create more stability in our earnings profile. Before I leave this slide, I'd like to recognize and express our appreciation for the hard work of our generation works at the three retired coal sites. The dedication of these teams resulted in safe and highly reliable operations for many decades in a very competitive market. This is a truly remarkable achievement, and we are grateful for their efforts. Turning to slide 10, the consistent performance of our retail operations also contribute to the relative stability of our earnings. You can see that our residential net attrition rate continues to decline, falling to 0.4% in 2017 down from 0.7% in 2015 and 2016. The stabilization of our residential customer couch reflects both the maturity in the ERCOT market, as well as our retail team's diligent focus on delivering innovative products and a superior customer experience. Maintaining solid accounts in 2017, in addition to strong margin and cost management, proves to be an important driver for our retail segment to overcome the negative impact of mild weather in 2017. As the chart on the bottom left quadrant on the slide 10 shows, our energy degree days in North Texas in 2017 came in below the 10 year average in most months. But the mild weather was particularly pronounced in the first quarter of the year. While it might be counterintuitive, in normal weather years, the retail business earns the majority of its EBITDA in the first, second and fourth quarters of the year. This is because the cost of for retail electric providers in ERCOT is materially higher in the summer months, as we depict in the graph in the bottom right quadrant of the slide. This is another benefit of Vistra's integrated operations, as we have a wholesale business that is dependent on the summer months, paired with a retail business that makes more money in the remaining periods. Given this phenomenon, the fact that energy degree days were so far off than the 10 year average in the first quarter of 2017, and even outside of the 10 year average band in the month of February, created a bit of a challenge for the retail business to overcome in 2017. Through disciplined cost management, strong margin management and impressive customer acquisition retention efforts, our retail team finished the year right in the middle of the 2017 guidance range. I might anticipate a potential question, given that wholesale prices are rapidly rising in ERCOT. Some have commented us, the concern that our regional market share and EBITDA maybe under pressure, in this type of rising power price environment. However, our retail business has been resilient, through both high and low, as well as volatile wholesale price environments. As evidenced, by an exceptional EBITDA year for our retail business in 2011, which was a highly volatile year, and the business earned more than $850 million. We are able to achieve these results due to our customer mix, our hedging practices, and our product suite, relative to other retail electric providers. I am proud of our team's execution in 2017, as we continue to be a leading retail electric provider in the state of Texas. We are excited to expand our unique retail capabilities into the northeast market, following the closing of the merger with Dynegy. In fact, our retail teams are already evaluating various growth strategies, to further enhance our integrated presence in those markets after the merger closes. We are excited about our growth opportunities in 2018 and beyond. I will now turn the conversation over to Sara Graziano to discuss ERCOT market fundamentals.
Sara Graziano: Thank you, Jim. Turning now to slide 12, we wanted to spend a few minutes discussing the latest ERCOT CDR report, as well as our view of the potential for a new [indiscernible] in ERCOT. As many of you know, ERCOT issued its latest EDR report in summer of last year, reflecting material changes from this prior version published in May of 2017. Of note, ERCOT's 2018 summer reserve margin is now projected to be 9.3%, down from 18.9% in its prior forecast. The primary difference between December and May estimates, is the inclusion of more than 5,000 megawatts of recently announced retirements, which include Vistra's three coal plants retirement, totaling approximately 4,200 megawatts. It is our view, that these recent retirements indicate, that market forces are working as designed in ERCOT, as uneconomic assets have now exited the market, following a period of sustained low wholesale power prices. With the now tighter supply demand dynamics in ERCOT, forward prices have improved, and the probability for future scarcity events has increased. Despite the recent uptick in forward curve, it remains our view that new thermal resources are uneconomic to develop in ERCOT, and we continue to believe developers will struggle to attract debt and equity capital. It can be very difficult to finance these developments in ERCOT's energy only markets, which lacks any type of capacity [indiscernible] to support the debt service [ph]. This is particularly true of peaking assets, that rely heavily on scarcity events to capture revenue stream. On the equity side, we calculate unlevered returns, both CCGP and gas peaking assets, to be in the 5% to 7% range in the current pricing environment. As a result, while it might be easy for developers to obtain necessary permits and secure EPC contracts for newbuild projects, we continue to believe new thermal developments is irrational from an economic standpoint. I could only hope, financial market players will bring discipline to their investment decisions going forward. The fact of the matter is, we have a [indiscernible] development model in place, where a developer can earn huge fees through sites, permit and construct new thermal resources. Those developers find third parties to ultimately finance the asset, and then they exit the project before the asset is ever turned on. It is the third party investor that end up losing money, while the developers earn 100% of their fees on the front end. It is a terrible model, and can only be carried as financial players [indiscernible] good money after bad investments. As Curt has mentioned time and time again, since the restructuring of power markets began in the late 1990, we are hard pressed to find more than one merchant power plant investment, where the original equity owner received an adequate return, and many suffered financial distress. Recently, a couple of relatively new projects in ERCOT have also experienced financial distress. Hopefully, this reality will start to sink in with the financial community, so debt and equity investors stop making irrational investments. On assuming we do the discipline by the financial community, we anticipate the pace of new thermal development in ERCOT will lag the current CDR projections, given their current economics. Rather, we expect the next margin of new resource to be developed in ERCOT will be solar or wind. That being said, geographic and transmission constraints in ERCOT will continue to limit the ability for developers to sight new renewable resources. For example, let's go ahead and turn to slide 13, which includes an irradiance map of the state of Texas. Irradiance is a major driver of return on solar development, as small changes in irradiance can cause a material impact on the return of a project. As you can see on this map, irradiance is the strongest in West Texas, which is where returns for solar developers will be most attractive. However, despite this attractive irradiance in the west, new development will be limited by the availability of unencumbered land with access to unconducted transition, which is challenging to identify in West Texas. Similarly, solar development returns remain very sensitive to tax appetite. Without the ability to fully utilize the investment tax credit, returns declined to the single digits. We expect tax reform will negatively impact the appetite for tax equity investments in new solar developments, which should [indiscernible] peak of new construction. New wind developments, which we project to be slightly less economic than new solar development, will face similar sighting and transmission constraints in ERCOT. As a result, while we do forecast that incremental solar will be developed in ERCOT, we do not expect any such developments to overwhelm the market in the near term. I will now turn the call over to Bill to discuss our 2017 financial performance in more detail.
Bill Holden: Thanks Sara. I will start with the financial results on slide 15. As Curt highlighted at the beginning of the call, adjusted EBITDA for the consolidated business was $1.455 billion for the full year, and adjusted free cash flow in 2017 was $831 million. Full year adjusted EBITDA was in the top quartile of Vistra's narrowed guidance range of $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion, and adjusted free cash flow is right in the middle of Vistra's narrowed guidance range of $770 million to $900 million. For the full year, the retail segment's adjusted EBITDA was $779 million. In the middle of the guidance range of $760 million to $810 million. This result reflects solid performance by our operations teams, following a difficult start to the year, as a result of the unprecedented mild weather in the first quarter. In fact, February 2017 was the warmest February on record in North Texas, with an average temperature of 60 degrees and nine days at or above 80 degrees. Through disciplined margin and cost management, and superior customer acquisition and retention efforts, our retail team largely overcame the negative impact of this mild weather, delivering solid financial results for the full year. Now turning to our wholesale segment, full year adjusted EBITDA was $696 million, above Vistra's guided range of $630 million to $680 million. Strong commercial performance and expense discipline throughout the year drove these results, which were partially offset by Comanche Peak Unit 2, the unplanned summer outage. As Curt mentioned, all of our operating teams displayed a true dedication to achieving maximum results for the business in 2017, and their disciplined execution enabled Vistra to achieve financial results at the top end of our guidance range, despite some fairly significant headwinds. We are now taking the same disciplined approach, as we work towards exceeding our synergies and OPI targets, and preparing for a seamless integration with Dynegy, following the closing of the merger. Turning to slide 16, you can see that we are not changing our standalone 2018 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow guidance ranges at this time. As Curt noted, starting in 2018, we are also introducing a new segment, called the asset closure segment, which will track and report all of the expenses and cash flows relate to decommissioning and reclaiming our Monticello, Sandow and Big Brown plants and their related mines. We will report this segment separately in both our financial reporting and earnings materials, until we no longer have any expenditures associated with the retired assets. We are introducing the asset closure segment to more closely align financial reporting with how both our management and board will be evaluating Vistra's business operations going forward. In addition, we believe providing visibility into the expected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow contributions from Vistra's ongoing operations will be helpful to investors, as they value our business. Given that the asset closure segment relates solely to the winding down of retired operations, we believe it is more appropriate to apply EBITDA multiples and free cash flow yields to the earnings expectations of Vistra's ongoing operations. In 2018, we are forecasting adjusted EBITDA from the asset closure segment will be negative $50 million to negative $40 million, and that adjusted free cash flow from the asset closure segment will be negative $90 million to negative $70 million. Expenses that were newly reported in the asset closure segment, include adjustments to the asset reclamation obligation liability related to the sites. Site property taxes, railcar related expenses, labor and third party expenses that are ineligible to be included in the liability for the asset retirement obligations, such as on-site security and allocated costs, other facility related expenses and miscellaneous regulatory fees payable by the retirement sites. The expenses and any related revenue opportunities associated with the decommissioning and reclamation of these plants and mines will be managed by Vistra operations teams, attached solely to minimize the expenses and maximize any revenue opportunities associated with this segment. Excluding these expenses and cash obligations, Vistra is forecasting adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations will be $1.35 billion to $1.49 billion and that adjusted free cash flow from the ongoing operations will be $690 million to $820 million. If you also exclude the 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures related to the generator capital at Comanche Peak, our adjusted free cash flow guidance range from the ongoing operations will be even higher at $760 million to $890 million. We hope you find this additional detail helpful, as you analyze the performance of our operations going forward. Turning now to slide 17, we have updated our hedge profile and related sensitivity as of December 29, 2017. We have also included in our 2019 hedge profile information. As you can see, as of December 29, we were materially hedged for 2018, which will somewhat limit our ability to capitalize on the recent uptick in forward price curves in this year. However, we do see meaningful opportunity to capture upside in 2019, as we were approximately 22% hedged on a natural gas equivalent basis, and approximately 42% hedged on a heat rate basis for the year, as of December 29, 2017. We will continue to opportunistically hedge in to 2019 and beyond, to the extent forward price curves are at or above our fundamental view. Last, turning to slide 18, our capital structure has been modified slightly since September 30, 2017. In December of last year, and in connection with the repricing amendment, this will reduce its term loan capability from $650 million to $500 million. Also, as a result of this December 2017 repricing amendment, together with a repricing transaction favoring August of 2017 and February of this year, this trade has now reduced its annualized interest expense by approximately $66 million. We will continue to be opportunistic to take advantage of the occasion to reduce our borrowing costs from time to time, as the market permits. As for our 2017 leverage metrics, we concluded 2017 with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.7 times, and that metric is forecasted to continue to decline in 2018 on a standalone basis. We expect Vistra's leverage profile to remain strong, following the closing of the Dynegy merger, with net debt-to-EBITDA forecasted to be just over three times at year end 2018. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and bringing our net debt-to-EBITDA to approximately 2.5 times or lower as quickly as possible, following the merger, will be a capital allocation priority for Vistra. We believe a strong balance sheet is critical to our success, as we transition from being an ERCOT only player to the leading integrated power company in the U.S. With that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on a solid, solid year.
Curt Morgan: Thanks Greg.
Greg Gordon: Just to go back and level set, when I look at the Vistra-Dynegy pro forma that you gave when you announced the deal, you were looking at a 2018 annualized range of $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion, is that right? I am looking at page 16 of the investor presentation?
Bill Holden: Yeah, that's right.
Greg Gordon: And you're saying that -- you are not updating guidance at this point, but you think that the OPI is going to likely be better -- overall level of synergies is likely to be better? And independent of all that, just increases in the forward outlook in both PJM and ERCOT, would reset the natural form as well. So sort of three different drivers we have to contemplate, when we think about the update you will give us when you close the deal?
Curt Morgan: That's right. That's exactly right. Those are the three drivers.
Greg Gordon: Fantastic. I do have a question on a totally separate tangent; I appreciate actually the conversation that you guys are engaging in on renewable resource development in Texas. I am increasingly getting questions on battery storage, as this pertains to being bid in collocation with wind and solar, in different regions, and at what point that might become a threat to volatility, via the ability to sort of shift peak? Do you have an ability to talk about that at all on this call? If not, we can follow-up. But I think that's something people are increasingly worried about? Although it doesn't seem like the market structure in Texas would support the viability of that in the near future, from my perspective?
Curt Morgan: Yeah. So Greg, I will tell you that we have immersed ourselves into the battery world, and just to give you a little bit of insight. There could be some opportunities for us, seeing around some of the sites that Dynegy has in California. That's probably the best place to experiment with batteries, given the support they have. It is tougher in ERCOT. But what I will tell you, we are looking at in ERCOT too, around Upton 2, and what we found is that, you got to get in this, and you got to understand, and you got to be an investor to really get under the hood. But I think I have said this before, we believe that batteries are real and that they are going to play a role in our business; and you know you have got two options, when you are a traditional generator, you can stick your head in the sand, or you can participate, we view it as an opportunity. The solar investment for us in Upton 2 was a way for us to get into that business, and we did it in an economic way. There could potentially be something around batteries, where we could offer product to our retail customers that is battery related, which I think there some people who tend to be green oriented, that might like a product that's a solar battery combination, and we are working through that. I will just say that, we are aware that batteries are going to play their role and we are trying to participate, and we are just looking for the best places to do it; because as you guys know, you can't really participate in these new fledgling technologies and lose a bunch of money. Investors are just not going to put up with that. So we have to find a way to participate in a way that we can make money. And the one nice thing about us is that, our integrated business does allow us to do that, and you should expect to hear more from us around that in the future.
Greg Gordon: Okay. But you don't see the economics of batteries as being in a position in the near term or medium term in Texas, where they could become a meaningful load shift at a return that would be viable for a large new entrant?
Curt Morgan: We do not see that, even with the enhanced forward curves. One thing about the forwards is that people probably -- we didn't really articulate, but it is important. Forwards really kind of popped up in the 18, 19, a little bit into 20. But then they come off, and I guess the market is expecting something to happen, like newbuild. It would be tough. By the time you would do something, put it in place, I mean, I just don't think that the forwards are where they are right now, and the backwardation in those curves would support the battery investments. It's really tough to make it happen. It's just purely a merchant battery investment that, would be difficult. But I think that we may be able to do that, supported by a retail offering, that had significant margin to it. We don't know yet whether that's something that our customers are interested in. But we are working through that.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thank you very much.
Curt Morgan: Thank you. Thanks Greg.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning guys. 
Curt Morgan: Hey Shar.
Shar Pourreza: So just on a consolidated entity, appreciate waiting for deal closure. But maybe we could chat directionally. If you think about sort of north of $1.5 billion in free cash flows post merger with upside from additional synergies, the curves, price formation, maybe another one to two more coal retirements outside of ERCOT for Dynegy. I mean, Curt, you sort of talked about the dividend and buybacks in your prepared remarks. But how are your thoughts sort of evolving around the ultimate balance sheet leverage targets you currently guide? So sort of the way I am thinking about is for a company that has so much excess cash, post the dividend and buybacks, is 2.5 to 3 times net of gross debt really appropriate, or you are thinking something tighter over the long term, similar to other cyclical energies industries [ph]?
Curt Morgan: Yeah. So that is a very good question. I think we have a target to get to a 2.5 net. I think when we get there though, and where NFPs where we pay down debt and we have excess cash. I think -- and that the investment community as well as the rating agencies have gotten more comfortable with our integrated business and the resilience of it and the stability of the earnings, I think we may want to turn our attention to a discussion about whether we can get a investment grade integrated power company again. And to do that, we think we would have to carry less leverage than the 2.5 times net, but that could be advantageous to our company to take that next step. And so I think for us, we would want to sort of walk before we run here, we want to get -- prove to the market we could get these synergies and the OP savings, generate the cash flow, pay down the debt, look for some tuck-in asset types things around our retail business. And if we could do that and hit the numbers, it'd be consistent. I think we are going to want to turn our attention to what's the next phase for the company in terms of leverage, and in terms of return of capital to shareholders. Clearly, that is a board discussion and will happen in 2019, and we were talking about that, we just had a board meeting last week, and we had this conversation. But I think in point to a very interesting concept is the 2.5 we are already in, or do you go somewhere from there; I think that is really dependent on whether there is value to go into that next level of reducing debt, and that puts is in a better position to execute our strategy at that point in time. So it clearly will be on the table as a discussion point.
Shar Pourreza: That's helpful. That's good. And then just Curt, just on a standalone EBITDA guidance range on -- just for Vistra, obviously, we have seen the move in sparks, I mean you clearly highlighted it in your slide decks. As you sort of think about Vistra, and if you back out the asset closure segments and sort of the non-recurring items, are you -- if you were to mark, are you sort of guiding to the top end of that 2018 range, or are you sort of thinking, it’s a brand new higher range?
Curt Morgan: Yeah, I think what we would say is that there is that opportunity to move in that direction. Remember we are very heavily hedged in 2018, and we did that from a risk management standpoint, not knowing if we were going to shut down the units and whether we could get there or not, and obviously that's history now. We have done some things to reposition our portfolio, that we think will be good for us in 2018. I will tell you that, the bigger upside for us is in 2019, and we believe that as we roll through 2018, especially when we see the summer, the 2019 curves are going to move up. That's why you haven't seen us take a bunch of this off the table for 2019, because we believe it will move up in the range of where 2018 is right now. So I think that's the bigger play, but there is still some room to move, and I think you are -- directionally, you are probably not too far off from what we see, this kind of curve dues left in it for 2018.
Shar Pourreza: Okay, great. So the summer of 2018 is likely the inflection point for your forward hedges? Excellent. Thanks guys. Have a good morning.
Curt Morgan: All right, Shar. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Congratulations.
Curt Morgan: Hey Julien, thanks a lot.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Well wanted to just focus on tax reform a little bit here. Obviously, you have got projected pretty minimal cash taxes in 2018, but how are you thinking about that over the sort of longer term here? What normalized you would be? And how do you think about optimizing Dynegy's NOL position into 2019 and onwards? Is there any way to think about tax reform and the cash tax rate, either on a percentage term or nominal term? How are you thinking about it, in the exposure and mitigating strategies?
Bill Holden: Yeah hey Julien, this is Bill. I think our current view is still based on what we showed in the 8-K that we issued in January, where you will see we are a nominal taxpayer, very small amount in 2019. We did pay cash taxes on the margin -- sorry in 2018. But we did pay cash taxes on the margin on 2019 and beyond. The one thing I would add, I think Dynegy mentioned in their earnings release, that they have AMT credit refunds coming. Vistra will succeed to those AMT credits and the related refunds or at least any that haven't already been received by or filed by Dynegy prior to the merger close. We are still calculating the amount and timing of the benefit to the combined company, but I think certainly we think that those -- those AMT credits will be an incremental benefit to the cash tax schedule that we showed in the 8-K.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And that shouldn't be too material?
Bill Holden: I think the numbers in the Dynegy 8-K actually were pretty significant, and I think -- we think there is going to be real benefit to the combined company as well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. Excellent. And just to clarify there, your other comment on dividend? You had alluded to a 3% to 4% yield, how do you think about like a payout ratio if you will, against the core business and growth of the company? I mean, is this predicated on growth of the retail company or growth of the overall company? And would you be paying conceptually a dividend against one side of the business or the other overall?
Bill Holden: Well I think the dividend would be, when you think about it overall, I do think that the one thing we have looked at though and we know this, but you know the conversion from EBITDA to cash flow over our retail business is substantial, right? It's almost -- its in the 90%. If you think about -- it's in the worst place that you could be, where your wholesale operations cover your costs essentially other than the retail business, and you just have the retail business generating cash, in the $700 million or $750 million range, and then a 3% or 4% yearly dividend, we will easily be able to cover that. And that, just from a pure risk management standpoint, we feel pretty comfortable, given the conversion and the total conversion for the company is in the 50% to 60% range that we predict, and that's obviously been improved, that conversion -- given the tax situation that we expect to have, when we close the Dynegy deal. So I think at the end of the day, we feel pretty comfortable with that kind of range. in terms of the trade-off, I think it sounds simple, but it's not. I mean, at the end of the day, we don't control the opportunities that come our way to grow our business. So we have to be somewhat opportunistic, and I think we will be that way. But I think we are going to be a lot steady here about investments in the generation side of our business, outside of maybe renewables that support -- and batteries and other things that support our retail business, and I think our bigger focus is going to be more around our retail business. You know this, but we are significantly long in PJM and EISA New England markets, and we would like to be shorter than that. So we are embarking on developing a strategy this year in 2018. We are already in the middle of it on our retail business that's outside of Texas. And it's focused on [indiscernible], not rocket science, we are going to try to grow organically, and then we will look for opportunities for acquisitions that we think have a compelling value proposition. We bring a lot to the table on that, one on expertise in retail, but secondly, we can wipe out a lot of costs that a company would bring, given just the scale of our business. So that would be the more focus on the growth side of it. The dividend I think would end up being sort of -- I think we can do both. So you almost can say that we are a value play to some extent, but we will have growth opportunities and we think we can pay dividends with both, and this is after we pay down the debt. In terms of how do we look at, where do we put money in a growth alternative or something else, including a buyback, whether we do a special dividend down the road, I think that's just purely economics, and where we think the better opportunity is, and we think our stock is so depressed, that we think that's a better investment than putting money in some growth initiatives will do that, and I think that will be the signal to the market, that that's how we have analyzed it. Well, I am not sure, if I have gotten directly to what you were asking about, but that's how we think about it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I think you already got it. Thank you.
Bill Holden: All right Julien. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fleishman: Yeah hi. Good morning guys. Just on the asset closure segment, is there any way to get a sense of the -- how long this might last and that the ultimate size? Just if you want to pull out the EBITDA going forward, it would be good to know, kind of what range of the total cost would be?
Bill Holden: Yeah. So we are going to provide that Steve for the Q1 call. We are working on that and there is a couple of things we want to do. We just want to draw your attention to the costs associated with that segment, so that you know exactly what it is, and we are also going to give you a run-off off that. So that's coming, but we definitely understand, in order to really do this right, we have to provide you with those cash expenditures, so that you guys can value it as cash, right? I mean, that's the only way to do it. We are discussing, whether we want to provide a separate ARO for that segment relative to the rest of the company, because right now, you could argue that our ARO is somewhat of an estimate for that, but we have been discussing whether we want to separate those, because we are going to have an ARO for Oak Grove and when we closed with Dynegy for those plants. But I think what we probably need to do is show you that, and that probably is good of NPV look at the cost of those expenditures that we have. In fact, it's pretty darn good the way we do it, it's a pretty good estimate.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. So maybe the AROs --
Bill Holden: Yeah, go ahead Steve.
Steven Fleishman: The AROs that you have on the books at yearend, might be at least the starting point for that?
Bill Holden: Just remember, it has got -- our gas plants in Oak Grove and Martin Lake in it. But yes, that's a reasonable starting point on that, and then we will have to provide you with the specific information. And we really plan to do that.
Steven Fleishman: Great. And then just -- I want to just make sure, because it's great you have talked about upsides to the merger guide and just on costs and synergies and the forwards. Just to round that out though, is there anything that has gone against you since you gave that guidance, or is everything else kind of okay, and these are all just pure upsides?
Bill Holden: Yeah. I would say the one thing that -- I don't know that it went against us, because it was within our range, but it was in the lower end of our range. The EISA New England capacity clear was disappointing. And I think, it's interesting Steve, that I think it kind of indicates the flawed market, right? On one hand, EISA New England's [indiscernible], we are going to run out of generation. On the other hand, your market clears 463. Those seem to be inconsistent. The good news is, as I think they understand that, and they are trying to fix it to some extent, which I think is actually a reasonable step forward with the dual clear that they are -- I think people are calling it CASPER [ph], I think that has a chance of providing an exit for plants that really want to get out, and it's really hard to do that right now in that market. But that was a disappointing -- we were hopeful they would be more in the range of where it could come out to previous year at the 530 range, it came in at 463. The effect of that though is, relatively immaterial, and clearly, we think the upside is greater than the negative on that. But I have to be honest with you, we would have liked to see a better clear, and we are hopeful that these capacity market reforms will move things in a better direction.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then just last clarification, tax gains at Dynegy that you mentioned that they disclosed, those are all incremental to the tax disclosure that you put out at the beginning of the year, for tax reform. So if you put that out again, your tax payments would be further reduced?
Bill Holden: That's correct.
Curt Morgan: That's right.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: All right. Thanks Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Abe Azar: Good afternoon, I guess. Following up on the ERCOT fundamental discussion, at what price level do you think newbuild gas projects can get financed in Texas? And relatedly, given the constraints on land and transmission, where do you see peak renewable penetration?
Curt Morgan: So on the combined -- I think you are thinking of combined simple cycle. So we have some that -- I have a guess on that, but I hate throwing out guesses.
Sara Graziano: Yeah. It's not necessarily [indiscernible] to translate it into a power price change, because it depends on really what happens in the summer, with this less of more peak pricing.
Curt Morgan: I thought we had one time, steam we had done -- steam [indiscernible]. I will tell you what, because I think we have done this work before, and we could give you kind of what we think an on-peak five by 16 the summer would have to be, to kind of support the economics of the combined cycle plant. So give us an opportunity here to do that and then maybe we can provide it. I just don't have it at my fingertips right now.
Abe Azar: Makes sense. And on the renewable front, do you have some sort of penetration rate, where you think the system doesn't expand beyond that, just because of land and transmission constraints?
Curt Morgan: Well we have roughly -- I think, we show there is roughly 2,000 megawatts of solar penetration, and what do we have there -- we have about almost 6,000 megawatts of wind coming in, and I think we would argue that that's stressing the system at that level. But we do believe, that that will come in, so you can add those things together. But it's probably in the 8,000 megawatts of wind and solar, that will put you up against congestion. We are also seeing, I think we have talked about this, I don't see a big appetite here in Texas, after spending roughly $6 billion on credits, to really actually help additional renewables get to the market. In fact, many of the politicians here now question what they have done, because obviously, they shut down 4,200 megawatts of coal and associated with that, I think with the mines and the coal plants, with upwards almost 1,000 people that were let go, those are voters, and they had to think about that a little bit. And then when you do obviously renewables, the amount of people you need to run those is very small. So I don't see an appetite to really expand that, but I think we believe that you could put in 8,000, 9,000 megawatts of wind and solar, and probably the system may get stressed at times, but you can probably find a way to make that work with the current system, maybe with a few smaller investments to make it work.
Jim Burke: As we said, the best economics are actually in the panhandle, but that should become saturated from a transmission perspective probably around the end of 2019. So that will have to shift investment, predominantly to West Texas, that has lower overall capture rates really.
Abe Azar: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Lapides: Hey guys, easy question. As you look at the combined portfolios, are there any regions of the country, where you would like to have a bigger or a different type of presence? And are there any regions of the country, where you may have a presence, but you kind of look at that region as a bit non-core or the portfolio you have in that region is non-core?
Curt Morgan: That's a good question. So look, I think the way that we think about it is, the regions that we feel the most comfortable with, and really where the local value was with PJM and EISA New England. I am not sure that one asset in New York is a strategy, and so we will have to make a decision. It's a good asset. Not saying anything against the asset. Also not sure about the long term market in New York. I have been in that market for many years, and we will have to take a hard look at that. MISO, I think is -- that has got multilevels of work to do. We have got a good retail business there, but we have some challenges around that asset base there, both in terms of performance, but also just economics and I know that Dynegy and Bob are working on that. I mean, they are working on the multi-pollutant standard to basically create flexibility to make decisions about what assets we are in, what assets we are out. They also were trying to do capacity market reform, which I think has been tough sledding to get done. MISO tried to take something and pushed it back on them, although seems like there maybe another tip of that cap. But at the end of the day, I think that's going to be tough to get, and just in that zone, it's going to be tough just to get a reform there. And so at some point, when you don't get the reform, and you are successful at doing what you need to do around the multi-pollutant standard and freeing up the assets, we have got a portfolio optimization exercised to do no different than what we did in Texas, and I think that may result in maybe a shrinking our size of our generation, whether that means we try to sell assets or what, I don't know yet. And then, I think Bob would tell you this, because he tried to sell the assets in California. It's not clear to us, that that's a strategy either, with those assets there. Actually, they have had decent financial performance as of late, but that's a tough market to bet on in the long run. But we do like -- there is a couple of sites, or sites there for potentially, as I said earlier, maybe batteries or something else. We will have to decide whether we do it, or whether we sell it and develop it and sell it to somebody, we just don't know yet. But I think the core markets are PJM, EISA New England, and of course, the way I think about it is, we shut down 4,200 megawatts in Texas of challenged assets. We may have to sell 1,200, 1,400 megawatts of older, very old stem units in Texas, but we are getting about 4,000 megawatts of combined cycle plants, mainly combined cycle plants in Texas. And we are getting Coleto Creek, which is in the south zone, which sees better pricing, are like that trade basically, that's swapped off what we had to what we would get, and we think that creates a more stronger fleet in Texas. So remember, when we started all this, when we came out of bankruptcy, we thought we'd like to get somewhere 2,000 to 4,000 megawatts of combined cycle plants, that was with the anticipation we may have to get out of the market. And we did that, and we just did a little bit -- so through this route, we get it to Odessa, which is an advantage, obviously gas price plant, and then we also did it through the Dynegy transaction, where we are picking up roughly 3,000 megawatts of very good combined cycle plants. So those are really the key ones. I hope that answers your question?
Michael Lapides: No that's perfect. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
Curt Morgan: All right. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A session for the conference. I'd now like to turn it back to Mr. Curt Morgan for closing remarks.
Curt Morgan: Well once again, we appreciate everybody on the call. Sorry, we went a little bit long here. We got a lot to talk about obviously, and we look forward to continuing our dialog about our company. Lot of good stuff going to happen in 2018, that we are going to need to stay both [ph] with you and communicate as we go through it. We are incredibly excited about it. We can't wait to get the deal closed and be able to come out and talk to you about the upside around this thing. We just -- in order of return, we feel like we got some really strong wins at our back and we want to communicate it, and we will do so, once we close the transaction. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Emily and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vistra Energy Second Quarter 2017 Webcast and Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Molly Sorg, Vice President, Investor Relations, please go ahead.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, Emily, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's second quarter 2017 investor conference call, which has been broadcast live via webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor call presentation, our 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Sara Graziano, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. We also have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we began our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on Slide 1 and 2, which explain the risks of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s call will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be true only as of today’s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to lead our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. I would like to begin our discussion today on Slide 5 with a brief highlight of our second quarter financial results. Vistra Energy finished the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $345 million and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $621 million, strong performance in what proved to be a challenging quarter driven by a mild start to the Texas summer and the beginning of an unplanned outage at Comanche Peak’s Unit 2 that I know many folks have been waiting for us to talk about which I will do right now. The Comanche Peak outage began when our plant operators observed increasing temperatures inside the Unit 2 steam turbine generator, that’s a Siemens manufactured generator. I want to be very clear that our steam turbine generator, as many of you probably know is a standard power generation equipment and is wholly unrelated to the nuclear power reactor side of the plant, there were no any ancillary effects at all. In fact, we were able to bring the unit down and the generator down without any issues at all. The unit was brought into an unplanned outage on June 5 to investigate the rising temperatures further. Our operations team determined the primary damage was to the unit’s stator , which is the stationary component of a generator. Following extensive evaluation with several experts including the manufacturer as I mentioned same as we determined the stator was repairable. The team worked for the balance of June and the month of July to repair the damage and perform tests to validate the effectiveness of the repairs. While the repair was quite detailed and tedious work, I will say that this disassembly and reassembly of the equipment is really what takes a lot of time. You have to be very precise in putting back together a generator to make sure that everything is ready to run again. We presently expect the unit will return to service late next week, in time to capture part of the important Texas summer season. We just need to hope that the weather performs well for us in the remainder of the summer and we all have our fingers crossed on that one. In total, we expect the full year EBITDA impact from the outage to be approximately $75 million, of which approximately $20 million relates to the incremental O&M expenses incurred during the outage and approximately $55 million relates to the lost gross margin for the two month duration of the outage. We have filed an insurance claim related to the outage and we are also evaluating whether we might have any indemnification claims against certain third parties. At this time, we do expect to recover in full all of our out-of-pocket costs and expenses that are related to repairing the unit and then exceed our $5 million deductible. It is likely, however, that the receipt of any insurance proceeds will not incur till 2018. We do not expect any recovery, however, for the impact of the lost gross margin realized for the duration of the outage as our accidental outage insurance policy, which would cover such loss profits does not kick in until the unit has been out of service for more than 12-weeks. As we expect the unit to return to service next week, we do not expect to be eligible to make a claim under this policy, which frankly is a good thing as we would rather have Comanche Peak Unit 2 up and running. I should also add that our commercial team proactively and successfully took steps to mitigate any potential negative impacts from the outage on our retail operations or on our hedge positions. As a result, our hedge portfolio and retail operations were effectively insulated from any negative impacts related to the outage. I would be remiss not to acknowledge that the timing of the outage leading right into this Texas summer was disappointing and especially in our first full year coming out of bankruptcy. However, our team has worked tirelessly to return the unit to service as quickly as possible while carefully observing all safety and quality control protocols and we do expect the unit to return to full load in time to benefit for more than half of the fourth and third quarter of ERCOT demand. Last, I think it’s important to reinforce that we believe this outage was a result of an incident isolated to Unit 2. Nevertheless, we intend to take additional steps to give us the ability to install or replace this generator in the future should a similar event occur. We have a spare rotor on site at Comanche Peak and it is likely we will have a spare stator manufactured . We believe this is prudent given the importance of Comanche Peak to our overall operations. Moreover, even though we presently estimate the full year impact of Comanche Peak Unit 2 outage will be approximately $75 million, we remain confident in our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range both because we were tracking toward the higher end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range following the first quarter and also as a result of known offsets, which Bill and I will discuss later on the call. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance ranges for 2017. Moving on to capital allocation, I'm excited to announce that we did close on the acquisition of the approximately 1 gigawatt Odessa plant on October 1. Thanks to quick efforts of our integrated team working on the transition and integration, this asset is now part of our portfolio as we enter the month of August in Texas, which is great timing for our generation business and a helpful offset in 2017 to the negative impact of the Comanche Peak Unit 2 outage. The addition of this flexible gas-fired generation asset to our portfolio is an important example of our commitment to opportunistically acquire high quality gas-fired assets in ERCOT. We believe the Odessa plant will be a valuable addition to our generation fleet in part given its ideal location to capture the current natural gas price advantage in the Permian Basin, which Sara Graziano, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, will describe further in a few minutes. Sara's team also led the acquisition of the 180-megawatt Upton 2 solar development project, which remains on schedule to be online for the summer of 2018. As we have previously mentioned, the Upton 2 project is a great addition to our fleet and is instrumental in our future retail product offerings. Going forward, we remain opportunistic on both the potential to acquire additional gas-fired generation assets in ERCOT, to do further renewable projects and on any potential ex-ERCOT growth. As we have stated previously, we do not feel compelled to diversify outside of ERCOT to mitigate weather or market risk given the strength of our integrated portfolio.  We have commented on a number of occasions that any large-scale M&A transaction diversified Vistra outside of ERCOT would have to stand up to a number of Company self-imposed criteria, such as customary control premiums, relative ownership sharing of synergies, and economic resilience under numerous market scenarios. I will say though that there are economies of scale in this sector, and they are important and things that we look at in trying to drive down cost in our business. We remain disciplined with our capital allocation approach, and this discipline applies to maintaining the health of our balance sheet, which we believe is a key attribute for sustainable success in this business. Vistra, we believe, is in an enviable position in today's market. We've done our dirty work. Our cost rationalization is complete, and we have a very strong balance sheet with industry-leading conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow.  We intend to remain vigilant with respect to capital allocation, seeking meaningful returns for our shareholders as we make future investment decisions and to maintain a leadership role in the industry. To the extent we do not find investment opportunities in the market that we believe will create value for our shareholders, we could return capital to our shareholders in the form of potential share buybacks or potential dividends. Regarding share repurchases, we recently received what we believe to be a favorable ruling from the IRS, paving the way for potential share buybacks ahead of the 24-month restricted period contemplated in the EFH bankruptcy tax matters agreement. We are working through the mechanics of how we can execute on such share repurchases should we determine to implement a plan in the future. So we now believe we have a path forward. I'm now going to turn to Slide 6. We're providing today an interim update on our operations performance initiative or as we call it, OP. We have included a Hot Topic section to our presentation today, of which OP will be one of the topics that Jim Burke will cover. While OP is not yet complete, we are already capturing savings opportunities this year, which are helpful offsets to the negative impact of Comanche Peak Unit 2 outage this summer.  As a result, we thought it would be helpful to provide you an interim update on the process. Through the OP process completed in the first part of this year, we have identified approximately $28 million of EBITDA enhancement we expect to achieve in 2017, which would translate to approximately $45 million to $50 million on a full run-rate basis. The EBITDA enhancements we have identified are primarily driven by cost-savings opportunities, efficiencies in field handling and logistics as well as heat rate improvements, as Jim Burke will describe in more detail. This is a process I have personally led at four different companies, and the results are verifiable and create meaningful recurring value.  We plan to report further results of OP on our third quarter earnings call. Similarly, as we have communicated a number of times previously, any decisions related to the optimization of Luminant's generation fleet, will likely be made in the fourth quarter. As a final note on OP, we've been working through the process in implementing several ideas. However, given the nature of these types of improvements, it is prudent to see the results before you count the value and communicate it externally. By communicating the preliminary results today, we are indicating our high level of confidence in capturing the value described. Now I am going to move to Slide 7. Vistra once again realized solid performance from the commercial and operations teams in the second quarter. Consistent with our fossil fleet first quarter performance, commercial availability was 96% for the quarter. The importance of high commercial availability from our fossil fleet was highlighted in June with the unplanned outage at Comanche Peak. Making sure our units are available when market prices reflect attractive economics continues to be a core priority for our operations, and it is critical to our success as an organization. Similarly, contributions from our opportunistic hedging and asset optimization activities once again delivered meaningful value to the enterprise. Year-to-date, Luminant's commercial operations team realized prices that were nearly 46% higher than settled prices during the same period. Also on Slide 7, I would like to highlight a new hedged disclosure we are providing for the first time and will update on a quarterly basis going forward. The table on the far right side of the slide now provides you with the hedged premiums and generation we expect to achieve for the balance of 2017. The hedged premium includes all contract revenues for the balance of 2017 are mark-to-market hedge impact as of June 30, 2017, as well as the shape and asset optimization impact we are anticipating over the same time period. If around-the-clock settled prices for the year come in lower than current estimates, the value derived from our hedges will be even greater. As we have said before, so long as we continue to see reasonable levels of volatility in the forward curves, which we currently expect will be the case, we'll continue to have occasion opportunistically hedge our wholesale range in future periods. Slide 8 is an example of this volatility. As is depicted in the graph on the slide, in the last several months, ERCOT summer heat rates have increased materially for the years 2019 through 2021. Luminant's commercial operations team took advantage of this volatility to hedge some of our legs in the summer periods at what we believe are attractive levels. While the hedge levels for 2019 through 2021 are modest relative to our total open wholesale position in those years, it is an example of how our commercial team opportunistically takes advantage of liquidity in the market to build a hedge book that year after year materially exceeds settled prices. Our commercial team looks for opportunities afforded them given the multitude of liquid forward curves available to hedge wholesale risk acquired to real-time settle. We look to hedge our wholesale risk at levels above our guidance and our point of view in the market for any given future point in time. Using this opportunistic hedging strategy year after year, Vistra's commercial team has been able to realize power prices materially in excess of annual settled prices as is depicted on Slide 19 in the appendix to today's presentation. We believe the second quarter of 2017, despite the disappointing weather and the Comanche Peak Unit 2 outage, provides a clear indication that we are executing on the fundamental key factors for success in our business and delivering shareholder value. In our view, these factors are strong cost management, especially in our wholesale and support organizations; commercial optimization of our wholesale commodity and retail customer business positions; improved management of our balance sheet and capital allocation.  We believe there is a model for this sector, where companies can sustain a long-term value proposition based on strategy, execution and proper governance, and ultimately attract long-term investors. We will now discuss Q2 hot topics. The first one is OP that Jim Burke will take over the mic here. And then the next one will be Odessa that Sara Graziano will talk about. Jim?
Jim Burke: Thank you, Curt. As Curt mentioned, late in 2016, we kicked off of a process called the operations performance initiative, or OP, to ensure our plants and mines were running as competitively as possible in this challenging market environment. We had just completed our support cost-reduction efforts in October of 2016, so we then turned our attention to our field operations. As we describe on Slide 10, our focus with this effort was much broader than cost. We are actively working ideas that could create additional value in revenue or margin as well as cost and capital efficiencies. The OP process combines external and internal expertise from a diverse set of disciplines, experience base and technological prowess. The process engages approximately 90% of each size workforce and our third-party business partners and workshop has generated over 5,000 ideas, of which over 1,500 are in some form of further analysis and action. Each idea was analyzed and evaluated for technical feasibility, economic value, ease of implementation and investment requirements, just to name a few. A rationalization process occurs and once we complete a review and are ready to fully implement. We use an open tracking platform with regular reporting of results to ensure accountability and ultimately, success. Our initial focus was on our three largest coal sites in terms of generation and mining activity, that being Martin Lake, Oak Grove and Sandow. However, our efforts are continuing at other sites, and we expect to have these wrapped up by the end of the third quarter. To provide some insight in the approximately $28 million of results we expect to capture in 2017, we wanted to break the EBITDA enhancements down to describe the items that are expense reductions, which we will classify as O&M savings versus the items that enhance gross margin, which relate to generation output and fuel expense. So far this year, given the activities that are already underway, we anticipate a reduction in 2017 O&M expense of approximately $22 million and improve gross margin of approximately $6 million. These EBITDA impacts are not full year impacts as ideas were implemented at various times throughout the year. In fact, largely on the basis of the partial year impact, we would anticipate a full year run rate view of the activities already underway would yield closer to $45 million to $50 million on a recurring basis. To provide more color, I'd like to just share a few examples of our OP savings opportunities with you so you have a sense for the types of initiatives the teams are implementing. On the O&M expense reduction side, the utilization of consumables has provided a sizable savings opportunity for us at multiple sites, including Oak Grove, Sandow and Martin Lake. In light of the effectiveness of our scrubbers, we're able to tune our utilization of activated carbons and mercury control, realizing significant savings while meeting or exceeding environmental compliance targets. Similarly, by optimizing our scrubbing strategy at Martin Lake, we've been reduced utilization of excess limestone and at the same time, reduce auxiliary load by 30,000-megawatt hours, creating more value from the plant output. When evaluating our maintenance strategy, we conducted a comprehensive review of our preventive maintenance programs to better align it with the current economic and operational environment. As a result of this review, we're budgeting and tracking our contractor hours more aggressively, adopting a broader utilization of non-original equipment manufacturer parts and benefiting from the best practices of existing contractors to save time and money. For example, at Sandow, our business partner Forney introduced us to a new scaffolding technology and contractor that saves us time and money while streamlining the number of contractors we have performing this function. On the generation and mining side, we're able to add incremental generation at some of our facilities due to efficiencies from steam cycle improvement to better valve monitoring, repair and in some cases, replacements. At Oak Grove, replacing items such as leaking turbine drains, main steamline drains and boiler feed pump recirculation valves that help to improve plant heat rate by over 100 BTU per kilowatt hour. Our teams have better focus on ensuring that our units are capturing the energy throughout the steam cycle and generating megawatt hours. This is assisted by monitoring the thermocouple throughout the steam cycle, both on-site and by our performance optimization center in Dallas, which closely monitors our sites. Finally, our operators have better awareness of heat rate and the tools to manage performance real-time, which has provided additional volume and margin as evidenced by our 96% commercial availability performance in the second quarter for our fossil fleet. In addition, both Martin Lake and Oak Grove, we've been able to lower our minimum sustained output known as low sustained limit, or LSL, in low price environments while also enabling our units to ramp up more quickly when called upon in response to improving market conditions. And on the mining side, our team was able to implement a number of techniques to improve productivity. A key one has been a faster diagnosis and repair for our conveyor belt at Three Oaks mine, which serves Sandow, which will reduce downtime and additional hauling requirements thereby lowering our overall cost per ton for lignite. We are already realizing several million dollars in lower hauling expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. In summary, these efforts are already underway with more to come, and it would not be possible without the buying and ownership by the entire Luminant team. We understand that this is how we compete, by continuing to find ways to create value in a dynamic and challenging market. We look forward to sharing more information about the complete effort on our third quarter earnings call. With that, I would like to turn it over to Sara Graziano, who led our efforts on our successful Odessa acquisition.
Sara Graziano: Thank you, Jim. We wanted to take a few minutes on today's earnings call to provide a little bit more color around our acquisition of the Odessa power plant in West Texas. As we mentioned in our July 6 press release, the Odessa plant is ideally situated in West Texas to capture the current natural gas price advantage in the Permian basin. Oil drilling activity in the Permian Basin have caused sharp increase in associated gas production, with an increase of approximately 5.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2016 to approximately 6.6 as of July 2017 and is projected to further increase to approximately 11.5 Bcf per day in 2020, this increase in production has overwhelmed available takeaway capacity and create a deep discounts in Permian gas pricing in today's market. Slide 11 depicts the location of the Odessa plant, which has direct access to both the El Paso and One Oak pipeline through which multiple producers are connected. Very few plants are situated to be able to collect gas from deep within the Permian Basin adding even deeper discount than what is seen at the Waha Hub. Moreover, Odessa has an option to reconnect to the Enterprise Pipeline in the future should market conditions warrant. Since the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Odessa plant, we have been in discussions with various producers for potential long-term gas supply contracts. We have seen a great deal of interest from the producers and as a result, we believe we will be able to lock in an attractive gas supply for the asset for several years into the future. While we do believe that ultimately additional pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Permian will be built, we intend to take advantage of the dislocations in the market to secure advantaged supply. However, I do want to caution that while the natural gas price advantage is material to our economic, it is in no way sufficient to incentivize new build to mine cycle generation as is evidenced by our purchase price, which is now at approximately 60% discount to new build construction cost. As we had previously reported, the purchase price of the asset was $350 million, plus spark spread-based earn-out payable only as market conditions meaningfully improve. The spark spread-based earn-out is structured as 60-month spark spread option tied to Odessa power price and gas costs, with monthly strike price set at a premium to market. The earn-out will only payout if spark spread exceeds the pre-negotiated threshold. The recent closing of the acquisition on August 1, we are very excited to now have a high quality and flexible gas-fired asset in our generation portfolio. I will now turn the call over to Bill to discuss the financial highlights from the second quarter.
Bill Holden: Thanks, Sara. I'll start with the financial results on Slide 13. As Curt highlighted at the beginning of the call, adjusted EBITDA for Vistra Energy was $345 million for the second quarter and $621 million for the year-to-date. For the quarter, TXU Energy delivered $219 million of adjusted EBITDA, very solid performance for what was a mild weather spring. To get a better sense of the second quarter weather in archive, we included a chart on the right side of Slide 23 in the appendix showing the 10-year average for combined heating and cooling degree days in the North Central Texas load bucket. You can see that energy degree days in each of April, May and June were lower than the 10-year average, negatively impacting TXU Energy's volumes for the period. Despite headwinds from these mild weather conditions, TXU Energy delivered solid adjusted EBITDA in the quarter as a result of strong margins and cost management. Moreover, Vistra Energy's net residential attrition in the quarter of only 1.15%, represents our best second quarter performance of organic customer acquisition and retention since 2008. The retail team continues to focus on the customer experience and overall customer satisfaction levels to drive residential net attrition rate to near zero. This relentless focus on the customer experience as evidenced by TXU Energy's customer satisfaction scores for the quarter, which were at or near all-time record highs across all major reporting categories. Once again our commitment to customer service, product innovation and margin and cost management have led to solid financial results by our retail segment in the quarter. Now turning to our wholesale segment. Luminant's EBITDA contribution for the quarter was $134 million, impressive results given that $26 million negative impact of the Comanche Peak Unit 2 outage in June. The negative impact of this unplanned outage was offset by favorable fuel and O&M expense, including those realized from completed OP reviews and also by increased generation from our legacy coal plants during the period. Following the solid second quarter performance by our integrated portfolio, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion for adjusted EBITDA and in the range of $745 million to $925 million for adjusted free cash flow. Now turning to Slide 14. We've updated our hedge profile and related sensitivity as of June 30, 2017. As you can see, we remain nearly fully hedged for 2017, materially mitigating the effects of potential natural gas and rate movements on our financial results for the balance of the year. We are also now 66% hedged on a natural gas equivalent basis and 51% hedged on a heat rate basis in 2018, further narrowing the potential volatility of our future earnings profile. Our commercial operations team has added these incremental hedges on an opportunistic basis as is our normal practice. Last, turning to Slide 15. Our capital structure remains unchanged from our prior earnings call. Our pro forma 2017 net leverage remains the low two times adjusted EBITDA, even after accounting for the cash outflows related to the closing of the Odessa transaction on August 1 and the construction of the Upton 2 solar facility, which for simplicity, we have conservatively assume does not include any project financing. As always, we will remain mindful of our total leverage, striving to maintain a healthy balance sheet that will afford financial flexibility in the years to come. With that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
Neel Mitra: Hi, good morning.
Curt Morgan: Hi, Neel.
Neel Mitra: Your peers to the South launched a pretty aggressive margin enhancement program at the retail level. I was wondering if you guys have done the work on that as well and if you see opportunities through analytics in various other capacities to enhance the TXU margins going forward.
Curt Morgan: Yes. So we've done - I think we've done a modest amount of work on it. Obviously, we can speak to the Texas market. I'm not - they've got a broader retail business, so I don't know how much of what they've talked about is outside of ERCOT. What I would tell you inside of ERCOT is, first and foremost, this is a competitive market. So just saying you're going to increase prices will have a competitive effect to it, and if it's not coupled with some value-enhancing product and service offering that customers value, it's purely announcing that you're going to increase prices to customers. We wouldn't do that, Neel. We're not going to do it, and we don't follow our competitors just as they do that. No, I'm not saying anything about what they're doing, because I don't know, there's not a lot of detail, not a lot of meat on the bone on this as to what they're going to do. What I will tell you is that we've had a leadership role at TXU Energy and constantly be on the front in offering new products and services, and that has enabled us to basically have an industry-leading margin position in the market. We are in the middle of several initiatives that we work on, and we just announced one recently with the solar days and free nights. That was another step forward. I'll tell you this, too, Neel, that this is hard work. You kick in, it takes time. And we would never come out and announce the stuff ahead of time because you have to come up with product development based on what you think customer needs are. You have to test it. And before I would ever come out and tell you anything about it, I would need to see it. We would need to see it. We would put it in place and make sure that it's just working before we would talk about it. That's a long way, I guess, of saying to you that you're not going to hear anything about $200 million margin enhancement from us. What we can tell you is we constantly work to improve our product offering, and we've actually, saw in 2016, you saw this, we actually had improved margins. We continually look to improve our margins. And so we’d be interested to see, though, there are smart people over there at NRG, we're constantly mining information from others. We don't mind being a fast follower if there’s an idea we're missing. So we're anxious to see that. We want them to be successful, but that's just not what we would do. And we're not so - if anybody's waiting for some kind of announcement around that, it's not going to happen. 
Neel Mitra: Okay. Great. And my second question is around the Odessa acquisition. So you guys outlined the discounted gas that you get in the West market relative to the Waha Hub. Is that discount that you're getting wider than what other plants in ERCOT West are getting or are you bullish on ERCOT West pricing? I'm just trying to figure out the competitive advantage that you have given that Waha price sets the price of power in the West market for ERCOT.
Curt Morgan: Well, first of all, so there are various locations where gas is accessed by gas fuel generators. Obviously, the Houston ship channel, which trades at just -- it's almost at parity with Henry Hub, which is, I think, right now probably - I think the Permian is around $0.40, $0.45, and then I think Waha is around $0.34, $0.35, and so Permian has got about $0.10, I think, somewhat in that range differential. But I think we’ve said this before that what’s really important is what units set price and what gas do they source from. In Houston ship channel, from a gas perspective, it is where price is set in ERCOT. And given that’s the higher cost, that gives you the relative advantage if you’re accessing gas from the Permian or Waha. I’d also tell you that a lot of our plants are accessing from Mid-Continent, which is - it’s not quite at Waha, but it’s fairly close at a discount. So we have an advantage for our assets , and there may be others who have that, too. I’m only speaking to what we have. We have an advantaged fuel position in the Permian for our assets, and we expect that to continue for some time.
Neel Mitra: I guess, my question would be are you viewing ERCOT as one entire market or are you assuming that ERCOT West pricing converges with Houston pricing, which sources off the ship channel? Because it would seem like if you’re basing it off of West pricing that a lot of guys would get Waha pricing, right? Or am I looking at it wrong?
Sara Graziano: Yes. This is Sara Graziano again. If there’s no congestion on the system, then there’s a single marginal generator for all of ERCOT, and that generator cost’s looks at price. And so we’re saying that we believe in absence of congestion, that unit typically is earning ship channel gas. And so as you’re aware, there is sometimes congestion getting into seasons or getting out the areas - with a lot of renewable generation, we model the system on a normal basis. They keep track of that very closely. Right now, we’re seeing congestion in Houston sometimes, which we think will be alleviated by the Houston Import Project next year. Does that help?
Neel Mitra: Yes. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Curt Morgan: Thanks, Neel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Ali.
Ali Agha: Hey Curt, I wanted to check with you on this. I believe in the past you talked about as you’re looking at M&A and growing the fleet that if you were to ever look outside of Texas, the most logical way to do that would be through a corporate M&A deal with lots of synergies and other benefits as opposed to buying an asset or even a portfolio of assets. Is that fair? Is that still how you think about the market?
Curt Morgan: It is, Ali. I think the reason I’ve said this in the past is - and I think it still exists although I will tell you there is a plethora of people wanting to sell assets right now in the marketplace, and that’s both individual assets and then portfolios of assets. But typically, the single asset, smaller asset portfolios have guard more people at auction, and they’ve been sold through auctions and you’ve seen this. The private equity firms have actually been very much involved in that process, and so the relative pricing has been higher. And then when you look at that relative to where the public companies in our sector are trading, there is clearly a discount. Now it all has to do then with what premium do you pay and do you somehow pay a way that discount why we’ve always said we want to be disciplined in that regard. And we would be fair and disciplined around that. But the other thing, I think, that’s very important is that the synergies that I think exist and we think exist in a larger scale deal is there are scale economies especially around corporate center and support costs, those could be quite substantial. And that’s why we also look - had looked at larger sort of publicly traded companies because there really is a big value proposition on the synergy side.
Ali Agha: Okay. And I guess, kind of related question to that. One of the other issues we’ve heard, one of the parent companies in the public space talked about that one of the advantages also of that sort of a transaction is more liquidity to the stock and less volatility given the lack of public float that sort of thing. Is that a factor in you’re thinking? Or how important do you think that is?
Curt Morgan: I do - yes, it is a factor in our thinking. I do think that the relative size of the company is important. But I think it has to be coupled also though with a performance. So if you’re big and you’re poor performer, that won’t necessarily help. But I do believe that size, in this instance, matters. I think it matters also not just liquidity, but from economies of scale standpoint. So it is a function there. I’d also say that we have been pretty clear about the fact that we don’t feel compelled to diversify outside of ERCOT to the retail position. But I will tell you that there are benefits to diversification even for a company like ours. And I think you see this a little bit right now where weather patterns are different. And when you’re a single-state company, we kind of roll with Texas weather. And that can be different, obviously, in PJM or ISO New England in any given year and that’s helpful. So we can see some benefits. I think the other thing is a benefit, and it really kind of struck me a little bit when we dissected the energy transformation plant is the downside protection that capacity markets offer is pretty formidable. You can have a low-performing, low-capacity factor set of assets and you can still have pretty good margin and revenue stream from them because of the capacity market. And so that is something you that we factor into this as well. So we take a lot of factors in, but those are - some of the other ones that we would look out and that’s all from the diversification. A lot of people use that word, but there are some real reasons why diversifying and then I’ll throw the last one is just pure market. This market will risk and then you’ve got political and regulatory risk. That when we don’t feel strong - as strongly about we think we’re in the best market from a political and regulatory standpoint in the country. But the other ones, I think, are pretty important.
Ali Agha: And last question. You talked about now having the flexibility for share repurchases if you so choose. Can you just update in terms of you’re thinking of priority in terms of - growth and acquisitions that are they more important. Your benefits very strong obviously where would share buybacks kind of fit in that, if at all? How are you thinking about your prioritization of capital use right now?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So I don’t think it’s a mutually exclusive thing, so - but I would say is that and I said this before as well that I think if you’re going to be an acquisitive company, you’re going to try to grow, you need to grow at the bottom of the cycle. I think we have hit who knows whether it’s the true bottom or not, but we’re pretty down close to it in ERCOT now the Exelon 2,000 megawatts have come online. And so we believe this would be the best time to rotate our supply base into more flexible gas assets for a variety of reasons. So I think from a growth perspective in ERCOT, this is the time is now for us. And of course, we’ve got some other decisions to make around our portfolio, so we are focused on that. But that doesn’t mean given our strong cash flow and our strong liquidity position right now, that doesn’t mean we could not come out also while we were pursuing that growth and do some sort of a share buybacks. Now that we are working on and we think we have a path to be able to do that, I expect us to continually evaluate a share repurchase program and be ready to do that and talk to the board about it. If we decide, it's the right thing to do. I think I've also said that just a multitude of share repurchases is not a strategy. I think if you do it because you think that you want to support the value of your stock, then you also have to support it in other ways and you've got to be able to grow and also to perform to show that you believe that your stock price should be higher. So we would use it as a tool, a combination with everything else. We're not going to do five of them in the next 1.5 years, but we do believe that it is something that we should take a look at and we'll continue to evaluate.
Ali Agha: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning, guys.
Curt Morgan: Hey, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: So most of my questions were answered, but let me touch on just one topic from a strategy standpoint. And obviously, in the prepared remarks, you clearly highlighted that you're not compelled to diversified sort of ERCOT. And then also -- but there is some benefits of diversification. But then ERCOT has obviously above regulatory treatment there, so you kind of like the regulatory environment. So when you think about growing outside of ERCOT, I'm kind of curious on how some of these nuclear subsidies like Zacks and Zens and potentially stuff that's popping out of Pennsylvania and New Jersey is sort of impacting your viewpoints on whether you even want to grow outside of ERCOT in the near term while these sort of stuff plays itself out.
Curt Morgan: I think that’s an excellent question, and it does play into our thinking. We -- I also said in my prepared remarks today and I've said this before that for us to do something, we would have to stress the performance of any potential target -- we have to look at those markets under a number of scenarios. And they would have to be resilient, even in our mind, even in the downside scenarios. Now look, the size of the synergies can solve a lot of that, and that's why that's so important. But I will say that market risk and where markets are in the cycle, and it's not just that a worry a little bit about the continued, what we believe to be uneconomic build of combined cycles in PJM. I think ISO New England is in a better position than PJM right now, and I'll explain that. But what I'll say around the Zacks, and I'll speak predominantly around PJM because it's where they're really front and center. I have very high confidence that there will be a mitigation measure will be put in place something like PJM has put out on the capacity market, which will exclude effectively the nuclear assets and also remove the - sort of the commensurate amount of load. Now that in and of itself is not a great outcome, but it is at least a reasonable outcome. I believe the work, though, that PJM is doing on their energy market in terms of making sure that energy price formation takes into account resources that are used to support the market, but that currently do not get into setting price in the market is, in my mind, the single most important thing that PJM can and should do. In fact, we're going to talk about it here in ERCOT. We think that's something that ERCOT look at as well. I think it's a highly important change. I think that PJM will get that through. And so the solution around Zacks, while I understand why it was through courts, that the court battle is, frankly, I think the courts were effectively saying this isn't really our deal. I think that while PJM and FERC will put in measures to counter it and I don't like it. I don't like anything out in a market, but I do believe that they're going to do some good things. I spent time with the CEO of PJM, and I feel very confident that FERC will support what they want to do there. And ISO New England, I would tell you that I think what they're doing around their capacity market, I believe, it’s quite good. And I hope that they're successful in putting that in place as well. In fact, I think the ISO New England methodology is probably on point more capacity marked improvement than the PJM one. And I'll leave it at that. But we are all over this because if we're ever going to do anything, we should know. And I should remind you guys, you guys know this, but I spent most of my career working in the PJM New York and ISO New England markets. So I still have some knowledge of that.
Shar Pourreza: Very helpful. Thanks, again.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Abe Azar: Good morning and congratulations on nice quarter.
Curt Morgan: Hey, great. How you doing?
Abe Azar: Good. So, we view Phase 1 of the OPI as completing optimization efforts at the fossil plants and Phase 2 more focused on the nuclear plants? Or is there more to come on the fossil side as well?
Curt Morgan: Yes, there's more to come on the fossil side. So I'll just say to give the great job on this, but this is sort of what we go back and idea of you've got to see it to believe it before you say it and you go out externally and you toot your horn. We needed to make sure that we were getting the stuff inside the plant. It's not like reducing heads. When you say you're going to get a heat rate reduction in something, you want to see it -- you better run for a while.  So we're just giving you guys now what we know is real and obtainable, and then we're working through the remainder. So there could still be some that come out of Martin Lake, in Oak Grove and Sandow that we haven't put out there. Of course, we've got other plants too, that we're working on, including gas field plants. And then of course, we - we made Sandow stuff at Comanche at some point too. But there's more to come here and we expect that we'll be able to tell you on our third quarter call. We'll tell you more of it. If we did the Sandow stuff at Comanche, we won't have that obviously at Q3. But we still got more work to do.
Abe Azar: Great. And then on Slide 6, you said the retirement decisions would come in Q4. Is that likely to be after the Q3 call on a separate announcement?
Curt Morgan: That's a good question. I don't know that we pinpointed it. You may be part of that call. So I think it very well could be. So we haven't really had a strong discussion around that, but I'm guessing it could be commensurate with that call.
Abe Azar: Okay. And you mentioned you're hedging some of the summer out in 2019, 2020. Is there any insight you can provide on how hedged you are for those years in terms of margin?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So hang on just a minute, we're just looking for the numbers. Let me -- can I make one other -- oh, there they are. So let me make one comment, though, just because I think it's important and we got this discussion all time internally. I'm not sure how much we talk about it externally. But when we wake up every day, we're sort of volumetrically -- not sort of we're pretty volumetrically hedged for about 60% of our long position from our wholesale business because of our retail position. The thing we haven't settled for that is what the price is going to be between wholesale and retail, and that's a function of when we decide to actually walk in on retail.  We’ll then hit come in and hedge behind that to make sure that we have a solid transfer price mechanism in place. So there, I think it’s important for people to think about because we do have a strong volumetric hedge already. And the economics of which just aren’t settled, but it all stays within the family. And I think that’s important. To get your exact question, we are about 32% - I think we’re 32% hedged in 2019, about 14% in 2020 and about 5% in 2021. What we did is we did about 10% incremental hedging to get to those numbers in 2019, about 7% in 2020 and about 2% 2021. And when we did, though, I just want to be clear on this is we just took advantage of the liquidity. There’s not a ton of liquidity in ERCOT out in those years. But when the summers popped up, there were some players out there that wanted to transact, and we thought the prices were pretty darn attractive relative to our long-term point of view. And as we do and again, we look at our - when we’re hedging, we look at a series of forward curves, but it’s five years out or two years out and we look at that opportunity to pick from those forward curves, and we thought this was a good time to incrementally add hedges on to those years. What we thought were attractive price.
Bill Holden: And just to be clear, the numbers Curt pointed were heat rates hedges, and that’s really where we saw the movement in the back years.
Abe Azar: Right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hey, good morning, Curt. Just a couple of quick detail questions. How much is Odessa contributing to the 2017 guidance?
Curt Morgan: I think it’s - hang on just a second Steve, I want to make sure - its $15 million Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And do you have a sense of like a full year run rate?
Curt Morgan: Yes. I think we’re looking at $45 million to $50 million.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And just for the full year, I know you reaffirmed your range. Is the segment - at the beginning you gave like segment guidance for each one are those still roughly the same ranges as well for wholesale and retail?
Curt Morgan: Yes. They roughly are, yes they roughly are.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And then it seems like your volumes this year are up pretty meaningfully. Is that just and even with Comanche, is that just the coal plants running a lot more than last year?
Curt Morgan: Yes. You probably don’t remember this. And I don’t know how much we really talked about it. But right at the end of the 2016, gas prices popped up, and our commercial team was able to go out and hedge. And we did not go into seasonal ops for the legacy plants. And so we were able to hedge positive EBITDA contribution. And so that’s why you’re seeing that because we didn’t go into seasonal ops for the legacy coal plants we’ve been running them. And we expect to run them pretty much through the year.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then one last question on Odessa. So I get the ability to get really cheap gas in that region. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about kind of how - where you can bring the power from that plant, i.e., is the plant able to get access to places where power is more set based on higher-priced gas than in the Permian region?
Curt Morgan: We are, yes. Some of that’s - the build out, but yes. And I think that Steve you touched on a point that I think we’re just open about is what we’ll really be interesting to see is longer-term. And I’m talking three, four, or maybe even six years out, how much renewable build out occurs and what might happen to congestion getting from West to East. But I think we’ve seen that ERCOT has been willing to make that kind of modest investments. We’re not going to talk about credits too here; I’m talking about kind of modest investments to make sure that plants like Odessa can get to the rest of the state. And so we expect to be able to have freedom to move that power around to the higher-price market. And that’s what’s happening now, and we believe will continue to happen.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Curt Morgan: All right, thanks Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Still trying to come up with heat a little bit here, one easy question for you. You talked a little bit about this at the beginning of the call. How much in the off-peak hours can a generator like you guys ramp down your coal plants when power prices are weak given the amount of wind generation that hits? I mean, are you able to ramp them down all the way or down to a 10% or 20% utilization? Or I’m just trying to think physically how much will the machine actually let you ramp down.
Curt Morgan: So Jim can step in here. But one of the things Jim talked about in our OP effort is it’s called with an acronym its LSL. But it’s basically the lowest point where a coal plant can go down to and sort of physically. And one of the keys in coal plants to try to keep them to survive, especially in Texas, is to get that LSL as low as you possibly can. And that’s what we’re working on. And so just - you cannot come down to zero. There’s always some threshold for a coal plant. And again, the lowest will be the best. If you really want to be at zero, you got to come off and that’s an issue and you trying not to do that with coal plants too much because that’s kind of coming off and coming back on can have an issue with the equipment and the asset. So Jim, you want to add anything?
Jim Burke: Yes. It does differ by plant, and I think one of the key successes of the OP effort has been continuing the sort of creative thinking on what would it take to actually get the LSL even lower. And so all the plants have seen some level of improvements. Some of the unit as an example, Martin Lake, they used to be at about 50% level, now they’re actually closer to a 25% level of max, which is a huge improvement on LSL. And you have to be stable not only through the steam cycle, but you have to be stable through the entire environmental controls process as well. So you have to - you do have to look at it end to end. I’d say 25% to 50% range of peak is - captures about where the units are.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And then I have one question on the retail business, which is we’ve seen lots of the other IPP’s, I mean, outside of you guys in NRG. We’ve seen a lot of the other guys talk about wanting to beef up their retail business. But we haven’t really seen much of an impact of that in Texas in terms of the gross margins that the former and incumbent retailers earn. Why do you think that is? What’s driving that there? What’s enabling that margin stickiness for you, for NRG, for some of the other incumbents?
Curt Morgan: Well, that’s a Jim want to I can see his [indiscernible] this is business jumble, so - but I don’t care, I still like to talk about it. Look, I think it’s complicated, but I think in some ways it’s really not at the end of the day. First of all, customer segmentation in broad strokes because it’s far more segmented than what I am going to really tell you. But I think you can take this a bit to the bank is there’s kind of a segmentation around those who like named, stable product offerings, people they’re comfortable with. This is, as Jim describes it, sort of a low-involvement category product. And so people really don’t want to make - get into the sausage making. And I’ll just go to the power choose, and it will spin your head how you make that decision. But people really, they’re happy with the brand.  But I'll tell you, you can't just do that because your name. You have to do it because you have a product offering that people are comfortable with. And we've gone to great lengths to provide people with stable pricing and a stable product offering, and then we’ve also given them products that meet their need and we proactively go to them, if we see that, there are on product that they shouldn't be on - and they may be they use a lot of power lignite or something. We'll proactively try to get them on free nights or something. So I think there's a lot to it, and it's not because just advertising. This is pure data mining. This is very analytical business, understanding your customers, understanding their needs and proactively coming up of products they need. There's no smoke in there and this is a real retail marketing business. We've just been very good at that and we spinout in front on it. And so that's really been good for us. Now we have entered into, what I'll call the other segment which is - since had a greater not - because the variation of this segment too by the way, but our more inclined to switch and more inclined to look, and we've got a brand out there. We've have a lot of that great success, what is we call for change, we've got another brand out there called Energy Express. And those go after, culture it and find a switch, but also just made think they might want - they don't want reason to involve with anybody, right? They just want to see something online and make it easy. And so in the near more price-conscious, and that's about 35% of the market and about 65% of the market is more of the brand name customers that we have. So that's a lot of meat, but let me Jim, I think you'd be good if you want to add, if anything there.
Jim Burke: Sure. Curt, I think you summarized it well. I would first start out by saying that it is actually very easy to enter the retail space. But it's very hard to be successful at it, because there’s very low barriers to get started. And we sometimes talk about that we need a laptop computer and a couple of people and you can launch a retailer. But to actually operator, we talked about on the last call, scale those matter in this business, it matters because you do need to make significant investments in your service platform, your billing systems, your risk management systems and in your product innovation and your service offering, the kind of products that we launched. For instance, after solar development that Sara had talked about, this solar days and free nights is not something that you can just a billboard up. You got to be able to operationalize that product, market it effectively, and innovate. And that is a better than average margin product. So I think the key to this business at the end of the day is very similar to every other competitive market where there is a will in buyer, will in seller, where a supplier has to get through the clutter and compel a customer to choose them. So there's a lot of people that are entering, and the space is getting more and more crowded, which means that having a differentiated proposition in our brand is even more important. So the fact that it more entering is not necessary mean higher success rates. In fact, I would say it challenges it, because the field at the end of the day has ample - ample choice and the next guy coming into the fold has to really do something special to standout. And so kudos to the actually of 100 and 100 and 100s of people that supports TXU Energy, both internal employee that is our workforce, but also our vendor and sort of business partner network. You can't stand one of those up overnight. And so I really do want to commend the team for building it. What I believe is a very sustainable business in a very low cost platform. And so we welcome the competition, it's just part of what growing to do and actually frankly love. But it is a good business to be in and we're happy to have the balanced model that we have between the generation and the retail.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
Jim Burke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, guys.
Jim Burke: Hi, Michael.
Michael Weinstein: Question on - I’m wondering, if you can clarify your comments that future renewables buildout, which contribute to congestion and eventually to more transmission. Until that the transmission is built, how does that affect economics of Odessa and other power plants in the region?
Curt Morgan: Well. What I was saying is that we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know how much is going to happen. I mean, we model and we model our economics, I mean look at several scenarios, but we model continue to build up solar and wind. And so the economics behind what we have today has that in. Not my only point is depending on what that looks like and how much it might be, you could draw into a constraint situation. Our modeling, which you think is reasonable, does not have that. And so any sort of constrain, we just - we don't see there. I just want to be - for abandoned precaution that is also to be open about it. That could happen because you bring a lot from the West part of the state trying to get it over to the East depending on what that build that would look like, it could have an impact. And that was the issue. Sara, go ahead.
Sara Graziano: I will just going to add that, as I'm sure, as gas turbine combined cycle Odessa has very flexible asset. And so we can ramp down, we can turn-off completely at night and I can start up again in about an hour and 15 minutes. We can get that, up and running again in the morning. And so we actually believe that Odessa is going to be a critical asset for ERCOT to balanced - we end in an increasing solar penetration.
Michael Weinstein: Okay. That's a good point.
Curt Morgan: Thank you.
Michael Weinstein: Hey, another quick question. On Slide 15, the capital structure. I've noticed that the cash and cash equivalents forecasted for the year are $1.2 billion. It used to be $1.8 billion in the first quarter presentation. I was expecting some reduction there for the Odessa purchase, but that's - I think that's a little bit higher than what I was expecting. What else is contributing to the decline there?
Bill Holden: A couple of things. We also have the expenditures for Upton 2, which as I mentioned, we're assuming we're not arranging any project financing. The total Upton 2 expenditures are around $200 million, just a little longer maybe.
Michael Weinstein: But I know that would account for it. Okay, thank you very much.
Curt Morgan: Yes. Thanks.
Operator: Due to time, our last question will come from the line of Amer Tiwana from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Amer Tiwana: Thank you. My questions have been answered. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And there no further question… I’m sorry.
Curt Morgan: No, go ahead.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’ll now turn the call back over to Curt Morgan, CEO.
Curt Morgan: Thank you for taking the time to join us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in our company. As I stated, beginning of the call, we do appreciate the interest in Vistra Energy and the support. And we're looking forward to continuing the conversation about our company and until next time. I hope everybody is well. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-19 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Molly Sorg - VP, IR Curt Morgan - President & CEO Jim Burke - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Operating Officer Bill Holden - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Mike Weinstein - Credit Suisse Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Michael Sullivan - Wolfe Research Ali Agha - SunTrust Mitchell Moss - Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC
Operator: Good morning my name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome to the Vistra Energy First Quarter 2017 webcast and conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Molly Sorg, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Molly Sorg: Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Welcome to Vistra Energy's first quarter 2017 investor conference call which has been broadcast live via webcast from the investor relation section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor call presentation or 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and a few additional senior executives available to address questions in the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we began our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on slide one and two which explain the risk of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be true only as of today’s date so which are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendices in the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to lead our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. Before we jump into the slides I would like to make a few opening remarks. In addition to Bill Holden you Jim Burke will be joining us. We would like to begin what we expect to be a series of discussions during our earnings calls on topical matters relevant to Vistra and the overall power industry. On this call Jim Burke our Chief Operating Officer will cover our retail business, a topic of much interest from current and perspective investors and equity analysts. It is our hope that you will enjoy these periodic topical discussions and of course we hope these discussions will assist the market in understanding the value proposition for Vistra Energy. It is our view that our retail business is the cornerstone of Vistra today and in the future. Our retail operations combined with our high performance integrated power generation fleet and commercial team and our very strong balance sheet and industry leading conversion EBITDA to free cash flow as compared to our peers leads to what we believe is a unique and attractive investment opportunity in Vistra. With that we will begin our discussion today on Slide five of the deck that we have sent out with a brief highlight of our first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 276 million, a strong quarter despite headwinds from a mild Texas winter. Even though first quarter results came in marginally lower than we would have expected in a normal weather year we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow guidance ranges for 2017. We are comfortable with our previous guidance ranges for the full year 2017 with our highest EBITDA and free cash flow period ahead. Our newly introduced retail initiatives and our operational improvement program which we've talked about previously which is expected to be completed by the end of Q3 and those are just to name a few items that we have that we give us the confidence to reaffirm at this point in time. Moving on from earnings, I'm sure you're aware that Vistra Energy began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10th, already we are seeing materially improved liquidity in our stock which has seen an average daily trading volume of more than 1.5 million shares in our first six days listed on the New York Stock Exchange. If you follow this previously on the OTC you know that that average was somewhere around a 0.5 million shares, so we've seen a pretty big tick up here since we listed. Having our shares listed on our major exchange was a key priority for Vistra after emerging bankruptcy and we're very pleased to keep the up listing in line with the timeline we previously communicated. I will also mention that on May 24th, we will be doing the opening bell ringing at the New York Stock Exchange something we're excited about and I do believe that we may get a few of the financial news networks where we can discuss our story to a broader audience. In addition to the up listing we executed on a couple of initiatives in May. You probably saw our press release about acquiring a 180 megawatt solar development project in West Texas. This acquisition will support our enhanced renewable offering for our retail organization and will further augment Vistra Energy's integrated portfolio. We continue to see interest for renewable energy products from our large and commercial industrial customers the public sector institutions, small businesses and residential customers many of which are looking for a contract -- enter into a contract for the solar products directly with someone who actually owns the project rather than through every retail energy provider that has a PPA. The acquisition of the Upton County two solar projects that will enable us to better serve the continuously changing preferences of our retail customers, the integrated nature of our business provides the platform to achieve what we believe will be attractive economics and EBITDA contributions once the project is commercially operational which we expect to be in-line in the summer. A couple other points on this is that the economics on this would not be achievable with just a wholesale product. In fact we don't see any merchant solar products out there, they are achieved by the integrated nature and the fact that we have a channel and multiple channels to market it in our retail business with the additional margin that comes with that. I also want to point out that the Upton 2 project build out multiples expected to be around six times which is an attractive multiple. On the broader subject of growth and capital allocation which we have discussed previously, we continue to emphasize in all of the above approach, our focus is designed as we've mentioned is to look for opportunities that support our core business both retail and wholelsale especially in ERCOT and as you know there are a number of opportunities that may be out there given the low pricing in ERCOT we see them to be plentiful with potential for strong economics. Outside of ERCOT we're more conscious and that is predominately because these markets have completing influences and outsource external influences in their market that make us a bit more cautious and we don't have near the seat of the table that we have in Texas and I would also mention that the regulatory political environment in Texas is quite favourable for business. We could look at most larger M&A as we've discussed and we've been predominantly focused on public market valuations, private market transactions have been bit up quite a bit in the marketplace because that's where the private equity firms have played predominantly. What I will say is that with the [indiscernible] throwing themselves into the mix and in play we've seen that private equity firms have now entered the mix. We don't really know what that's going to look like and where that goes beyond [indiscernible] but what I can tell you is this we will be very disciplined, we are not going to enter a very highly competitive process and we're not going to overpay just to be in other markets. We do not have to diversify outside of ERCOT, we see a plethora of as I said earlier of opportunities in ERCOT and if need be we will stay there. Any deal that we would do on a large M&A scale would have to have compelling value proposition. If we do not find that compelling investment opportunity we will revisit return of capital alternatives including stock repurchases and dividends. Turning to slide 6, you will see that also in May TXU launched the new product free nights and solar day which combines TXU Energy's most probable right time pricing plan with solar energy for retail customers. At TXU Energy we're continuously advancing our product offerings to remain on the leading edge of changing customer needs and through our research we expect our roof product combining two of the elements customers most want, flexibility and control over their usage combined with renewable power to gain momentum in the marketplace. TXU Energy's product innovation and relentless focus on customer experience continue to prove successful in the marketplace as it was evident by Vistra's Energy performance regarding residential customer counts in the first quarter of 2017 quite an achievement, we grew customers, we are excited about that in the first quarter 2017. Competing well in the highly competitive ERCOT residential market is a testament to a truly sophisticated retail marketing, they are sophisticated retail marketing capabilities of our retail team. In the first quarter of 2017 TXU Energy also launched a new residential my account mobile first experience which extends txu.com's clean design to mobile devices reaching over 800,000 users and growing. Our users experience is now consistent across all devices with streamlined access to features reflecting TXU Energy's commitment to being at the forefront of capturing the mobile mindset. We spend a lot of time at the senior level and throughout the company, we are focused on understanding how customers interact with us and interact in their home and what devices they use and we're constantly looking for ways to make their life easier. In essence we don't want our customers ever to have a reason to think about leaving us and we've been very good and proactive about that. TXU Energy's innovation always begins with our customers. We listen to what they need and how their lifestyle has translated into energy usage and we're then able to create products designed to help them understand and manage their consumption and save on their record build. Frankly this the core of our success and the reason our customers are loyal, because of our tailored innovative products based on customer needs, our customer service in our broad product and service offerings, in the end we believe our commitment to customer service, product innovation and product transparency will continue make TXU Energy the market leader in ERCOT which has been demonstrative of our long history of acquiring, retaining high quality customers. Turning to slide 7, Luminant once again delivered strong commercial performance during the quarter, commercial availability for our fossil fleet which is a measure of our fossil fleets ability to capture gross margin from the market when the assets are in the money was 95% for the quarter. I can tell you with our many years of our experience in this business this is a very good performance especially for a fleet such as ours with over coal plants. Making sure our units are available in the marketplace when prices reflect attractive economics is a core priority for our operations team achieving results in the mid-90s demonstrates our excellence at generation and asset optimization with a focus on making our plants available in the period when we need them which is a critical to our integrated model and overall success as an organization. High commercial availability also supports Vistra Energy's ability to opportunistically hedge our assets. Contributions from our opportunistic hedging and asset optimization activities that once again delivered great value to the enterprise. In the first quarter of 2017 Luminant's commercial operations team realized prices that were nearly 55% higher than settled prices. On the lower right hand graph you can also see that we have consistently delivered higher than settled prices in both increasing and decrease price environments. So long as we continue to see reasonable levels of volatility in the forward curves which we currently expect will be the case, we will continue to have the occasion to opportunistically hedge our wholesale length in future periods which should deliver meaningful value to the bottom line. It is the combination of the contributions from our commercial operations teams, the reliable operations of our generation assets and the stable earnings from our retail operations that drive Vistra's relatively stable earnings growth profile particularly as compared to our competition. The lower right hand graph on slide 7 also demonstrates the stability of Vistra Energy's historical earnings and bearing wholesale power price environment. Because Vistra Energy maintains that link in the market is able to capture upside when the wholesale prices temporarily spike similar to what can occur in 2014. This opportunity for Luminant to capture volatility in the market provides a nice counterbalance to any temporary retail margin compression that might be driven by short term wholesale power price spike. And last as it relates to our generation portfolio, our operational performance initiative remains on target to be complete by the end of third quarter. We also plan to finalize our coal portfolio review by the end of the year and I want to be very clear on this point that we have not yet made any decisions regarding the long term viability of our coal, our older coal assets. We owe it to the many constituents that we have including our shareholders, and our employees to determine if these assets are economically viable in the long term. We are presently working diligently on the analysis so we can be confident we'll make the right decision for all who are concerned. Turning to slide 8, we have once again included in our materials the projected market supply, demand and reserve margin forecast from the latest ERCOT CDR report published in May of this year. The May CDR report reflects a few modest updates from the prior December version, though the CDR generally assumes reserve margins will remain above 18% through 20, 21. As you may ERCOT makes no attempt to assess the economic viability of additions to the market. Any project with an interconnection agreement and air permit and proofs of adequate water supply is included in the ERCOT CDR. The gold line in the graph represents Vistra Energy's point of view on the forward reserve margins which takes into account economic viability of forecasted assets and assumes fewer new thermal and renewable resource additions through 2022 versus the ERCOT point of view as a result of the historically low wholesale power price environmental. The Vistra Energy point of view assumes no asset retirements other than those that have already been announced. As we expressed on the March 30 earnings call any new thermal resource development is inexplicable in our view. Recent new builds in ERCOT have filed for bankruptcy in the last several months further focusing [ph] our view that the new build economic are not justified in the current market environment. ERCOT as an energy [indiscernible] market has proven to be challenging for single asset owners who do not benefit from the strength and stability offered by an integrated portfolio such as Vistra's. We continue to believe some of this irrational new investment will not be completed in which case we should start to see tightening the ERCOT market in future years. While on the subject of ERCOT market conditions I want to highlight a few points on the Waha gas basis differential subject which has been a topic of much discussion recently. First we view the present basis differential that is evident in the marketplace is temporary primarily due to the ease of pipelines build out from the region. There are at least three five pipeline projects moving forward to transport gas east and south out of the region, in a couple days ago I think [indiscernible] gas daily both in Chronicle in an article about the Permian might be of interest if you haven't read that. In addition some of the basis differential is being driven by increased hydro-activity in the West which is a short term effect. Moreover as only 2400 megawatt of generation capacity can source gas to Waha hub pricing, Waha prices do not typically set power prices in ERCOT. Perhaps more important our interpretation of the overall power pricing environment at ERCOT is that low power prices are being driven by lower rates as opposed to a gas basis differential. Simply put we have an oversupply power market in ERCOT. Looking at the market heat rates both Waha and Houston ship channel heat rates are depressed compared to historical averages. As a result we have concluded the market dynamics are reflecting to press heat rate likely due to wind, North to Houston congestion and a lack of clear scarcity in the market due to the ample reserve margins as opposed to a gas basis differential. Increased prices in the south are being driven by the North of Houston congestion which has been increasing in prices in Houston since the beginning of the year. This congestion as a result of the Houston import project construction which will once it's up and running at about I think 3000 megawatts transmission capability in 2018 reducing the congestion and the magnitude of the recent price disparity. In addition a new CCGT [ph] will be coming online in Houston area this summer which will further alleviate congestion in the region. For Vistra Energy specifically while the local heat rates are a bit of a drag in the near term, we also have an offset to this drag with [indiscernible] who are well-positioned to source attractively priced gas coming out of the mid-continent. In short we view any Waha gas basis is differential to be a temporary and immaterial impact on the results of our operation. Finally on this topic some are expressing their view that the Permian gas situation is akin to the Marcellus, Utica, CCGT new build proliferation. We see this as the case to several factors. Even with the advantage, CCGTs are still well over $10 a megawatt hour out of the money.  We also as I mentioned earlier the temporary nature of the advantage is likely to dissipate with a number of pipeline and we all know that Texas is a friendly state in terms of building our energy infrastructure. We have an oversupply market and building into an oversupply market is always a dangerous and dangerous case and as I've mentioned many times before we are hard pressed to find especially in ERCOT any new CCGTs at the original equity owners actually got a return on their investment. And also in ERCOT the energy only market makes it much harder to finance and with the bankruptcies that have occurred recently and what we believe will end up being a recovery that is significant less than the debt itself ERCOT chilling effect on this. So there are so many things that go into this that are different than what's going on in PGM that we believe that this is not the next Marcellus Utica CCGT build out. I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke, our Chief Operating Officer who along with his team built our retail operations and Jim is going to give you a little more -- a little bit more information about our retail organization and how it drives value for Vistra. Jim?
Jim Burke : Thank you, Curt Morgan. Let's start with some fundamentals on the ERCOT retail market and specifically why we believe it is the most attractive market in U.S. Now turning to slide 10, ERCOT was a large and growing electricity market, it represents about 31% of the competitive served load in the U.S., about 250 kw hours and the consumption per residential customers 32% higher in ERCOT in the rest of the country. Moreover its projected to continue to grow, it's been growing at 1% to 2% annually and we expect that to continue with the strong economy. Many other markets are actually shrinking. One thing to note about other markets that is a positive for them they actually have competition in many markets in electric and gas. ERCOT is honestly focused on the electric competition. Nevertheless the electricity market structure and ERCOT is in our view the most constructive for retail competition particularly those with a strong set of capabilities. For example in ERCOT the retail electric provider has full ownership of the customer relationship including performing the billing function in customer service with the exception of outages which is handled by the wireless company. This ownership gives up the direct customer relationship that allows TXU Energy to proactively manage the customer experience for example. We just launched the free night and solar days plan that Curt mentioned. We have the systems to handle the time of use build, manage the 15 minute interval data, display that usage on mobile devices and gauge the customer on usage patterns. In other markets these plans would be challenging to manage if you could even launch them given the interface for billing and services is largely through the regulated wireless company. In addition these regulated companies offer a default to provider of last resort rate, some others have municipal aggregation that effectively limits the amount of competition and with the constraints around product design and billing that not foster the innovation that exists in an open marketplace such ERCOT where willing buyers and sellers transact freely from their large commercial industrial level all the way down to residential that makes this market very unique. Finally the regulatory legislative environment for retail and ERCOT has been stable as a result of the level of competition in the market. Customers in Texas have choice, for years now they have had over 300 offers available in everything zipcode where choices permitted. Customers can switch in as little as five minutes, their switch can be effective same day. This is the marketplace we compete in, this is the market we've been competing in and I think what gives the regulators and the law makers comfort is that it's working. Nearly every household has exercised their right to choose as evidenced by the public utility commissions 2016 study, determining that over 92% of customers in ERCOT have exercised their right to choose a retail electric provider at least once since the market opened to competition 15 years ago. No other market has seen this level of competition develop and a lot of it have to do with the retail market design. Any assumption of TXU Energy's customer base reflects only legacy customers who've never taken advantage of the competitive offerings would be incorrect. TXU Energy's customers have chosen TXU because they value the overall proposition. A proposition based on trust, innovator products and our commitment to putting the customer first which takes me to slide 11. To have a strong retail business you need a couple of things just on the retail side, you need a strong brand and a strong business model both are critical. We stand behind our brand and I think it's pretty obvious TXU energy connects with Texas, it's inherent in our name. Our proposition is based on trust, innovation and ease of doing business for example if we were to change a customer's price we would first notify them of an impending price change and it would take effect prospectively. Many time customers would react, call us and see if there is alternative plans that we can find as a better fit. Many other providers will change prices on customers retroactively without notice after the electricity has been consumed and they learn about it when they receive their bill. This is just one difference of how we provide the stability and peace of mind that most customers seek in this category. We also operate a scale business with multichannel marketing and sales strong systems and a data driven approach to leverage its analytics for how we manage marketing, services, the whole customer lifecycle as well as of energy supply and risk management. This is a very data intensive business to run well not unlike credit cards, insurance or other financial services. TXU Energy's approach is to use this data to reduce the effort of the customer and to be trustworthy. As Curt said we don’t want to give the customer reason to consider any other provider. In fact in every category where choice exists and especially because choice exists brands matter, there's a lot of clutter out there and electricity is no different than every other category in that respect. Furthermore it's not easy to enter the space today. We have to build awareness, trust, and preference and there's over 50 competitors already out there competing for mind share every day. The strong business model is further enhanced by integration with Luminant, the largest generator in ERCOT. The integration of retail and wholesale allows Vistra Energy to avoid certain collateral and transaction cost leakage. For example an non-integrator retailer or wholesaler will have to transact in the open market. We typically find itself on the wrong side of the big spread and would also typically to post collateral transactions all of which comes at a cost. Vistra Energy keeps this collateral and transaction cost leakage inside the system driving value to the bottom and all also to Vistra shareholders. More over Luminant's assets in the market allows TXU Energy to procure these types of risk management products that are necessary to lever the volatility inherent in electricity consumption. Owning generation is a necessity for a retail electricity provider of our size and it's the barriers to compete at our level. Luminant's assets also create an opportunity for Vistra energy to capture any potential scarcity provided pricing in the market as a result of our overall net rank [ph] creating an opportunity for upside while cotherwise is stable earnings enterprise as compared to our non-integrated peers. So in terms of the result, what does the brand, the business model and the integration deliver? Well let's turn to slide 12 and you will see that on the upper left we still command the full position as ERCOT a position we've had since market open serving more residential customers than anybody else. In fact if you look at the residential market here in ERCOT across the players to the right of the chart all of them have been at it at least 10 years. There's been a lot of new entry and they will always likely will be and many of those would extend off to the far right hand side of the page if we included them all. But having a strong brand and a strong business model and able to introduce market share leadership to be maintained through time. As our capabilities, innovations and insights that grown our customer count performance has improved and our annual sales volume have been consistent. Competition causes all of us to raise our game, certainly we're no exception to that. Furthermore we have a leading cost structure, this has helped us focus our resources on what matters most to customers, service innovation and peace of mind. We recognize that all of our customers have a choice but so do all of the customer served by our competitors. Our retail teams thrive on serving customers and competing every day. This approach has led to a very consistent earnings profile. In fact since 2009 TXU Energy averages a little lower 800 million in EBITDA per year. There is very little CapEx required to support this business, less than $25 million per year. Equally important is that there are some natural cycles between the wholesale and retail segment that create a more stable earnings picture for us as compared to our non-integrated peers as what was depicted on what occurred on earlier slides. As Curt mentioned we believe it's important to elaborate on some of these topics from time to time. We appreciate the interest of physically in the retail segment as we think it's a differentiator relative to our peers and given the prominence of retail our overall value proposition we thought this discussion would be a good first topic and hope it will help you as you evaluate our company and its relative attractiveness. I will now turn the conversation over to Bill Holden to discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail.
Bill Holden: Thanks, Jim. Good morning to everyone. Since we allocated the portion of the call today to the retail discussion I'll be brief with our financial comments. Turning to slide 14, Vistra Energy delivered adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 as $276 million of which Luminant contributed 96 million and TXU Energy contributed a 177 million. As Curt highlighted in his remarks the mild first quarter weather had minor impact on Luminant as we were largely hedged for the quarter and operated with high commercial availability. TXU Energy's result were affected by lower volumes that resulted from the mild weather in the quarter but the impact of the lower volumes was partially offset by TXU Energy's strong margin management and the customer account performance. We remain comfortable with our 2017 guidance ranges and still expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of 1.35 billion to 1.5 billion and adjusted free cash flow in the range of 745 million to 925 million. Turning to slide 15, we have updated our hedged profile and related sensitivity as of April 21, 2017. As you can see we're nearly fully hedged for this year materially mitigating the impact of natural gas and heat break movements to our financial results. And finally as you can see on slide 16 we have had no changes to our capital structure since our March 30 earnings call and our leverage remains the lowest among our peers in the industry. We're always mindful of our total leverage and we'll continue to be diligent and are now at the growth opportunities to ensure that we are transacting at the right value while maintaining a healthy balance sheet that will provide flexibility to allow us to stay on the right side of market cycle in the years to come. With that Operator we're now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Ian Zaffino from Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Mark on for Ian. So I guess I'll follow on the acquisition of Upton Solar asset, are there any specific asset types that you guys are looking more deeper into for additional solar or are you guys still open to I guess like what the market is offering or maybe CCGT assets given the heat environment environmental currently.
Curt Morgan: So I'll start with the last part of that first. We're and I think we have expressed this pretty clearly in ERCOT that we're interested in additional combined cycle plants and I'll just say that we're actively looking at opportunities in ERCOT. We think this would be a good time to acquire and so we'll see if that proves out but we're going to try to remain as I've said we're going to remain disciplined around this, it's not something we have to do but something we certainly would like to do and we think we're matching up with a good time in the cycle they will do it. As far as additional total projects I want to be very clear that this was largely driven out of demand from our retail side of our business that we see and so we started this project around that. We would not have built this on a merchant basis wholesale business and so I think what we're going to wait and see is if the demand is actually even greater than what we think it is and what we know now could we do another project, yes, but it's not the beginning at this point in time is you know a Vistra Energy build-out in Texas of merchant solar projects. We wanted to dovetail with our integrated business and the integrated economics are quite compelling.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just a little bit on the private equity activity, are there I guess any specific assets that they are looking at or is it, they are kind of going forward anything that attracted to them as well? Thank you.
Curt Morgan: So broadly speaking what we have seen previously is some of the smaller single asset may be some of the sale of assets that, coal plants, CCGTs coming out of some of the utilities. We did notice the private equity firms were heavily involved in those, they were more bike sized, probably more to their liking and we also know the private market valuations transactions were significantly higher than where the public market values were and are and so I think for a couple reasons we would not choose necessarily to buy individual assets, one we think the valuations are too high and we've got a tough way to sort of build out the kind of scale you want to be able to compete in markets like PJM and [indiscernible] and have been in those markets for a long time. You need to have a seat at the table if you're just one of many -- one asset in large markets you really don't have a lot of opportunities to influence things and I think that's very important. What we've seen recently though I think was a bit of a departure. I'm not sure how it all happened whether [indiscernible] was approached by a private equity firm or whether they approached it private equity, I don't know that really matters but we have now seen the private equity firms at least we see the same rivers everybody else does that there is a process going on Calpine is in it and they have thrown themselves into that put themselves in play and that they're taking a look at whether they sell the company, that's their decision, their boards decision but what I think you did change potentially is that the herd tends to move together and would that mean that other publicly traded IPP's might also look at that and be involved in that. What I said earlier and I will say it is -- we're not going to get caught up on some furore of a competitive process and overpay just to go outside of ERCOT, we're pretty comfortable with our position if there's a compelling value opportunity for us, we will absolutely look at that and we'll see where that goes but I think that's really where we are on that issue.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse.
Mike Weinstein: I wanted to ask about net attrition in the retail business, if most customers are sticking or have 92% have already chosen the suppliers, so they're choosing you by choice even in your own territory. If most customers are sticky how does the negative attrition rate flatten over time and I see it is flattening but how does it eventually go away without people switching as much as they used to?
Jim Burke: Well it's a good question Mike. I would say there's a couple things underneath really any of the retail businesses in Texas .First of all, Texas is a very active marketplace so I think one of sort of mysteries around Texas is are people going to wake up to choice. People have been choosing for the 15 years and market cycle, people come in with new offers and they make a splash and some people might be interested in it but the market had a fundamental churn rate underneath it because there are 7 million meters about six of those are residential we obviously have a very intense focus on the residential segment, it's not the easiest to serve but it’s a segment we do well but there's nearly 3 million moves and switches every year in ERCOT really regardless of how much activity we TXU Energy might be generating. So we have to be active, you have to have a ground game, you've to have an air waves game, you have to have a digital game and you have to sort of meet the customer at their moment of choice. So people are constantly moving to Texas, they're moving from apartments to homes, they are moving between cities. That's really the most frequent move activity. So when you think about churn it isn’t about people sitting at home deciding today is a good day to switch my provider. There's usually a life of it, and when a life event happened it's a chance for people to reconsider all their choices not just electricity. So I don't know if churn will ever go to zero, I can tell our goal as a company is to be as flat as we can and also grow, but when you are the market share leader and one of the most profitable retailer in Texas it is hard to be a share leader, a profit leader and grow. So we look at maintaining sort of our shares in this market as a really good position to be and we're going to look for growth opportunities more tactically.
Curt Morgan: Yes, so Jim I will add something to this. One when we think about capital allocation and growth we also are looking at the retail side and I think in our segment the sort of brand loyal type segment I think the way that we would have to grow that I think we think the economically is wait for the right time of the cycle do an acquisition. However the other thing we've done is we've entered the market in different light with different brands that actually -- so those brands are getting at the different needs of the different customer segments and so we had this -- I think you guys know we had four change, we just announced Energy Express and we'll look at that -- we'll continue to look at brands and how we fill out the needs of customers and we do believe over time as we fill that out we will ultimately grow a customer base on an overall basis but I think when you're talking about the TXU Energy brand, the only way to really I think to grow that is to buy somebody who is in that segment of the market and then over time rebrand TXU Energy, we're open to that. We don’t think this is the right time to buy retail because of where wholesale prices are and there is not a lot of fear in the market but when we see another price spike which I know that everybody -- don't hold your breath when we do which I believe will happen in Texas that will shake the tree a little bit as it always does in Texas and that's when the right time to look at retail acquisitions.
Mike Weinstein: So if I hear you right I mean it would be wrong to maybe focus too much on customer counts when you're more focused on margin per customer?
Curt Morgan: Yes exactly, right. You see that on Jim's slide, slide 12, while we have had a decline net attrition our EBITDA has been really been stable and interestingly in the last two years we've been over $800 million a year and yet we've been and this is what I think the unique side of it is with our innovation and product offerings was actually gotten that net attrition out to 1%. So we think that are probably what we can see in the future out of this business but I think growing customer count overall will probably come by positioning different brands along sort of the chain and we're doing at by introducing new brands and we will probably will do another one either through an acquisition or will start up an organic brand to try to compete with different segments in the market. 
Mike Weinstein: On the other side of the business, can you talk about how the cost of scrubbers environmental controls has been changing over the past few years where it sits now, like how is that affecting your analysis and without revealing how the analysis is actually turning out I understand that’s one of the process, but how is it affecting the analysis of plant retirements?
Curt Morgan: Well a couple of things on that, we really haven't seen much of a change but we actually haven’t been actively out there trying to hire somebody to put scrubbers on to this. I can just assure you that they're probably $100 million plus a pop. We're not putting scrubbers on some of the older plants, if that were to rear its head in the near term I think that would make a decision pretty easy of what we do with these coal plants. I think this kind of cool off a little bit in the EPA process, but they are still as you guys I mean as you guys -- you always do is read our financials and we will go in the legal section. I mean there is still a bunch of tax on our coal business and we're going to have to play those out. But I think we would generally say there's less pressure and probably the time to implement anything out of having EPA has moved out in time but that's not really the driver, the driver for the challenge in our business [indiscernible] one is an overbuilt market and so depressed heat rates and gas prices have been I guess you could say historically low and so when you combine those two things that combined for a really tough market and that's what's putting pressure on our coal fleet and as they age just the pure maintenance and outage CapEx is high. We have been trying to manage that as best we can but you've got to put money in the power plant you can't starve them or you will start having very significant forced outages but more important to me is you can start to create safety issues. So this is why it's really important when you decide whether you are going to stay at a plant, if you're going to do you also have to then agree that you're going to put money into it and that’s the challenge for us right now in this current heat rate and gas price environment some of these coal plants are challenged.
Mike Weinstein: And if these plants are I assume are less efficient than new plants, so if they retire the average heat rate for the region should actually go down right, would that be harmful situation to margins overall or?
Curt Morgan: No I don't think that -- I don’t believe that’s the case, they are run predominantly in the summer and so what it does is it takes capacity out. They're coming in and they're actually coming at a lower heat rate. So when you have higher demand you've got 12, 14 heat rate peaking plants and gas steamers that are coming on and selling the price, this takes out the wedge and you get quicker into that part of the stack which means your selling price at a higher heat rate. So it actually has exact opposite of what you were saying.
Mike Weinstein: I see, it pushes the whole curve steeper is that what you're saying really.
Curt Morgan: Yes, it does. It gets into the higher heat rate or [indiscernible].
Operator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: First quick question, I noticed the CapEx reductions, can you elaborate a little bit more of the source of those and then also try to tie it to the extent to which you can tie those back into the ongoing O&M reductions that we've been talking about. To what extent is this kind of a sneak peek or does -- is this really kind of separate and distinct from your other efforts here?
Curt Morgan: Yes, you're talking about the operational performance? Bill?
Bill Holden: Yes, I think just to the last part of I think it is separate. And just to put this in context you know the total reduction in CapEx that we're forecasting for 2017 is 48 million. There's two components of that, one is in the non- recurring capital expenditures which is lower by 15 million that’s principally related to the cost associated with the consolidation of our corporate headquarters. The other 33 is related to CapEx that the legacy plants, those dollars essentially are being re-classed from capital expenditures to O&M, as you may recall that is part of the fresh start reporting valuations of those plants came in essentially at zero value. So they're now recorded at zero book value on the balance sheet. So the result of that is what would have previously been CapEx of those plants is now being classified as O&M. So if you look forward I think if you assume no changes to the composition of the fleet then I think you would expect this change would carry over in the form of lower CapEx but wouldn't necessarily be a change in cash to the extent the spend continues as most dollars would show up and O&M instead. The one other point I would add is just given the work that Curt mentioned that we're doing around the plants to make sure we can get to the right conclusion on their future. You should expect in the short and intermediate term we are managing very tightly the expenditures on those plants and make sure that they pay back given the uncertainty around the futures.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. But just to understand reaffirmed your EBITDA range to the extent to which that the CapEx was reclassified into O&M, is that kind of an implicit improvement in your EBITDA guidance given that you're now reflecting higher O&M in that guidance range? Or is that again within the noise?
Bill Holden: I think it is generally within the noise and we were moving -- CapEx is now going to be O&M but Curt mentioned other things that we have in process and I think those things sort of balance each other out.
Curt Morgan: Also make sure Julien what you said its actually that we will be pushing us you would think all things being equal to lowering EBITDA--
Bill Holden: Having that the expense is classified.
Curt Morgan: Yes, the expense is classified and O&M. But we're confident even with the first quarter be a little bit below where we would like to come in and with that we're still confident that we are in the range and we're still confident that we're still think that this point is a good place for us.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. My point rather was that the guidance being reaffirmed at that level was an offset that was giving you that confidence but I'll leave that aside. Coming back to the solar project, I just want to clarify the 180 megawatts is this separate and distinct from the 116 you talked about a couple of years ago with Sun Edison, also Upton category is this the very same project and related to that how do you think about the economics and the return profile and or EBITDA contribution from this investment?
Curt Morgan: Yes. So the Sun Edison project, I wasn’t here, so if you remember this.
Jim Burke: Yes, Julien this is Jim we did have that project, if you remember just a PPA type structure and that project we effectively terminated and so this initiative came about as part of the effectively the same opportunity but with a new partner and obviously we're taking an ownership position and it's actually bigger as you noted. So economics are improved for us because the solar economics have continued to improve overall to see the net PPA was originally structured.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. What about return profiles, how should we think about like total size of investment and EBITDA contribution or something like that?
Bill Holden: Julien I just want to make sure I have my numbers right, so the investment is about $240 million. We expect to project, finance the deal so we will be I think around $130 million equity investment we think that's the kind of the leverage there. And I think was there anything else in that? And then on the returns we typically will go out tell people what our returns are but I will tell you that on an unlevered and levered basis we typically look at significant headroom between our cost of capital and our hurdle rate, on an unlevered basis somewhere in the 500 to 800 basis points higher and then on a levered basis about sort of 1000 basis points higher than our cost of capital and so I can tell you the mat was exceeded that return criteria. I'm not going to give what our cost of capital is that most people can probably you know [indiscernible] going back into what it is but the bottom line is very attractive returns. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research.
Michael Sullivan: So just maybe firstly on the capital allocation plan and some of these opportunities that you guys are looking at maybe on the asset level basis, just wanted to get a sense is there any predetermined or idea of a time horizon there and if you don't see a compelling opportunity when you could potentially start to look at a dividend or share repurchase program?
Curt Morgan: I think the ideal for is near term and when I say near term I think we are you know looking between you know sort of now and the end of the year that we will hopefully find some opportunities. There's a number of reasons for that but you know I think that’s the sweet spot in our mind of when we believe we will be able to find opportunities and be able to transact and so I think that's where we are. So then you could -- we're constantly thinking about -- so I should say we always think about whether we should buy back or stock, the one thing that prohibits us at this point in time from buying back our stock is part of the tax matters agreement when we exited bankruptcy with AFH is that typically when you do the busted three--
Jim Burke: Right and then the tax we spin off that was affected as part of the--
Curt Morgan: Yes for the number but when you step up the bases to be try to be simple because this is esoteric stuff but that there is about a two year grace period typically before you can buy-back your stock and it gets in all kinds of reasons, why that is the case but let's just it's sufficed to say that is the case, everybody knew what was going in. However there are pass where you can work with EFH or with IRS to try to find a path forward where you can do it sooner than that, we believe the best approach on this right now because part of it -- if we deal with AFH we thought we could part of the oncore transaction that clearly is uncertain and so we decided to now go to the to the IRS but it's going to take six months to come up with the answer. We believe we have a very good chance of being able to buy back our stock. We started this a little bit ago and so we hope to be able to be in a position to at least repurchase stock after that six month period which actually is not a bad time frame with what I talked about in terms of acquiring assets in ERCOT. And then just a dividend policy you know I think that will happen you know that's probably 2018 fodder, but we'll see how quickly things move. I also believe we can do, I don’t want to make this completely mutually exclusive. So I think we're really trying to just make sure that we understand the opportunity set from a growth standpoint but I think once we've kind of work through what we think is a good time in the cycle I think we believe ultimately that we'll be able to potentially do both and we will look to do that and our cash flow conversion from EBITDA to free cash flow is quite good and with unlevered balance sheet by anybody's opinion. I think we will be able to potentially do that but that's something the board will have to talk about it and will have to figure out how we do that.
Michael Sullivan : And then secondly just and this may be both kind of tied to really the seasonality of the business but just want to check just on the free cash flow first that the negative 48 million for the Q1 that's kind of typical for Q1 for you guys and then secondly you showed this realized versus settled prices in prior years for the whole year you guys have averaged about 80% and then in Q1 its only about 50% higher. So just on kind of both of those topics just want to get a feel for how much of that is driven by seasonality and if there's any other kind of external factors involved?
Bill Holden: I'll take the one on the free cash flow and then on the realized prices I will turn it to Jim, but I think you had it right. Most of the adjusted free cash flow for us would typically be realized and the second through fourth quarter as opposed to Q1. But there are a couple of items also that tend to occur every year in Q1 that are large uses of cash because they're paid in Q1 and that would be property taxes for example we paid 96 million of property taxes at the beginning of the year and those are only paid generally once a year, so they just happen to show us in Q1 and then consistent with the way most companies handle incentive compensation, all of the annual incentive payments are paid during Q1 as well and so that was a little over $80 million of cash. So I think those are probably the two largest items in addition to just the seasonal profile of the business.
Jim Burke: Michael you asked the question about realized prices, there are different opportunity set if you will for realizing prices greater than settled prices typically more in the summer months than the first quarter but I would also have to just say that generally speaking you know this '17 and '18 with new build is coming on has been what I will call has been less volatility and overall lower wholesale prices so you can't ignore that back. So I would expect this to come in with what I think is 55% plus realized prices for '17 above settled, I don't know that we will hit 80% but we'll still be above that but I wouldn’t be surprised to see something lower than 80 just because of the overall volatility and the overall just lower heat rate and price environment. So I think that’s the big driver. Higher volatility obviously is our friend and we take advantage of it, we've just seen this has been a more lower volatility period of time.
Operator: The next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Ali Agha: I understand the points you made being very disciplined in terms of allocating capital, looking for acquisition opportunities but from a strategic perspective when you think about either A, expanding into taxes or B, diversifying out of taxes strategically what is more important to you right now?
Curt Morgan: We have emphasized ERCOT over-looking outside of Texas for a number of reasons from -- I believe one that with the integrated nature of our business you know the margins we can get from the wholesale group to the retail group are higher. We also obviously know this market as well as anybody and so we think that we have good visibility into where the market is going to go and we're major player in where it goes ultimately. But I think probably more importantly is the market is cycling and when you have bankruptcies and strategic players wanting to get out and you see the market beginning to turn not a lot of investments being announced and we wouldn't expect any in the future frankly zero on the combined cycle, plant side of things that you see that the market has finally reached a point where there is a capitulation and that's usually a good sign that we're going to go into a phase where there is disciplined investment in the market because people are seeing what happens when you're undisciplined and invest in the market and so I think that is a key element and so that goes hand in hand with we think attractive pricing in the marketplace which is why we've been more, we just think the better opportunities are here. We also I know PGM, I have competed in it, ISO New England quite well, all those markets. I would say that if you just take those markets separately number one PGM unfortunately there are still -- developers are still successfully selling the story of a long term basis differential advantage and each technology turbines are continue to be put-in in the Marcellus and Utica area sort of at a record pace, all with the idea again the backdrop that no one's really made any money, put in a new combined cycle through the beginning of time but they seem to continue to do that looking for that opportunity.  That doesn't make it for a very good market and by the way most of the states in the PGM market are low growth states to no growth states, so implicit in a new investment is that you have to shove somebody else out of the market for you actually to compete and that's tough to do when you've got players who have some cost investments and they're looking to try to reduce costs. We've proven just like on the upstream sector to be able to find ways to compete and so I just think it's a bit [indiscernible] when you do that until somebody actually capitulates. Our own personal view that once the gas market equilibrates and the loans are paid off, amortized on some of these investments and they've got to go up compete on an even playing field that you may see some capitulation but that's two, three maybe four years away in PJM and so that is not a market that's cycling in our opinion and I think that's borne out by the fact that you have had some very low capacity price clears. So it's just not as attractive so therefore you have to be laser beam focused on getting a good upfront investment if you're going to be successful in that market. There's no slop around it, you're not going to get bailed out by a market getting recovered and so when you do that you've to mind on it and stay focused. Iceland and New England is a little bit different than that, it's just a smaller market so any kind of addition to it can move there but more importantly I believe that what they did to the capacity market in terms of effectively putting a claw back mechanism if people try to permanently delist and they have multiple assets to put a call back mechanism on the capacity market and they've actually decoupled the dynamic delist price which is the price at which anybody can exit without any influence by the market monitor and they put big decoupled there by pushing that price down at the same time the penalties for their version of pay-for-performance in the capacity market is going up, the penalties are going up but the price at which you can exit is going down, it just makes it for just a less attractive market and there's risk in that. So I those are the reasons why we need to be very cautious when we enter those markets and make sure we are getting at the right entry point. I'm not saying you can't make money, I've done it but you better be sure that you're getting in and then you better make srue if you're doing it in a big deal that there are really sustainable synergies that you can go after. I mean those are the kind of -- those are the things that you know you can get done, you completely control it but you've to have those things, good price that you're getting in at, and that there is big synergies that you can go after.
Ali Agha: And one other question I had and you alluded to that, its an interesting time for you to be fully listed here at a time when your closest peers are sort of floundering and perhaps looking at the private market. When you look at those valuation differentials you talked about as well. Longer term do you think that public market is the right forum for an IPP business?
Curt Morgan: That’s a excellent question one that I have pondered. I mean you probably know that I came out of private equity Energy Capital Partners and I like that that because you had access to capital when no one else did and you were on the right side of the cycles and when markets got tough if you had -- and you had debt you had a cure, you know you could access capital instantly where as you guys know, if you're under a financial stress you're in distress you can't access equity markets in the public market. But I will go back to say this, I think we did this to ourselves and we created that situation. I still think you can be successful as a public market company, but I think you can't carry the kind of leverage that these companies have been carrying. I think that is the one thing I would say has been the reason -- the reason that we put ourselves in that place and when you get into a vicious cycle because when you're over levered and the cycle is good you then think you can put more leverage on because your stock price is up, your equity value is up and you think you debt capacity and so you finance acquisitions and growth at the height of the market because the stock prices are correlated heavily with commodity prices and you're out there buying at the absolute wrong time to be buying it's when prices are at the highs and then when the market the bottom falls out you've got too much leverage and then you're faced with the prospect of actually having to sell some of your core assets, that’s a business cycle and not the one, and when I was in private equity we were on the other side of that cycle. We were buying when they were selling and so -- but I don't think that’s a product of private equity or public I think that is a product of the fact that we have been over levered and that has created an environment where the only time you really feel like you can do something is at the top of the cycle but that's not the time to be doing which is why we were so focused to try to keep our leverage down for our business and so that we can be opportunistic that we can do that. So I think you can be successful as a public company here if you do it right.
Operator: The next question is from Mitchell Moss from Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC.
Mitchell Moss: Just wanted to discuss which one of the Waha gas basis, lot of us familiar with some of the pipelines that are going to be build, do you see some of the gas going into sort of the North Texas Houston area or is most of the take away going further west?
Curt Morgan: Well right now or do you mean?
Mitchell Moss: Once the pipeline is built I guess.
Curt Morgan: Yes, the pipelines are really trying to find their way to Mexico in a big way and they're also trying to find their way east and south potentially to Gulf Coast, LNG export but that’s where they are trying to find their way to and not so much west.
Mitchell Moss: Okay. So I guess there could be -- are you saying there could be some pressure then on Houston ship channel prices as well as that gas moves in?
Curt Morgan: Not really because so you guys know this -- I mean if you go down in the Houston area it's like spaghetti city and what's going -- in regard again we're talking about the benchmark still Henry Hub, what is likely to happen is that thing will equilibrate rather quickly in that part of the world because it can move north, south, east and west. What might, if there were some -- if somehow gas trapped in the Houston ship channel which we cannot come up with that scenario, we just don't see it. You might see something like that but that scenario just really doesn't exist that we can see with all of the pipeline down there and the way things are done typically work it will find a way to equilibrate across Texas and up into Henry Hub over into Louisiana and it just will and so there is enough pipe that it can happen naturally, you don't really need a lot of build out once the gas gets down.
Mitchell Moss: Okay. Just on modelling, looking at slide 20, I'm pretty familiar with the Forney and Lamar assets from before Vistra acquired them and I'm trying to understand the 6600 heat rate because I know that part of the capacity for both the plants is sort of peaking in dock [ph] firing. So can you just give us a sense on what megawatts or how we should think about the heat rate numbers for the full plant specially also because 6600 seems to be you know sort of a new build-ish number and these plants are also I think 12 or 13 years old.
Curt Morgan: When we purchased together and you're always trying to figure to figure out what benchmark is the most relevant one to use, this is the heat rate without the debt firings so below -- but we also want to assure the full capacity we want to get the chart too busy. So that heat rate its most efficient use without the [indiscernible] that heat rate would degrade it. I think the heat rate on Forney is around 8500 and about 8000 at Lamar, I don’t know if you knew that but that’s what it is. These are [indiscernible] so they fire at higher temperatures which allows for a lower heat rate and we've got a good success on the heat rate side of thing, so that was next step before they went in the age of technology to really bring down the heat rate. I think the all-in heat rate if you're doing the CT peak firing the supplemental duct firing [ph] you'll get into the 7100, 7200 overall for the whole unit and as maybe more in line with what you were thinking about max capacity.
Mitchell Moss: Okay. And when I think about how many megawatts is the duct firing or how many megawatts is sort of the base configuration something you know just to figure out how much is actually at the 6600 heat rate?
Curt Morgan: I don’t remember, do you guys?
Mitchell Moss: I can follow-up offline if that’s--
Jim Burke: We can get around 340, its around 55 to 60 at Lamar.
Operator: The next question is from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Just in-line with the questions about leverage, what do you think is the ideal leverage that you would like to target?
Curt Morgan: I think we have said before I think we still stick by it and Bill if you want to jump in too but I think what we've said is this is our gross basis and we will talk a little bit about that but on a gross basis we have said we'd like to be in the three to four times and so we will pick the midpoint of that, we think that 3.5 on an ongoing basis. Now that all depends on whether we buy something to get to the 3.5 that we feel good about and creates value, we have also said that we would be willing to go above slightly above the full range for a compelling transaction with the idea though given our cash flow that we have that within a year we'd be down on gross basis in the low 3s. Generally speaking we've got about a turn I guess or so roughly from gross to net that could vary over time but let's just say that, but that's not how we feel about and the reason we feel strongly about what I've just went through the whole [indiscernible] why we think lower leverage is important in our sector but we also believe it leaves us the ability from a dry powder standpoint to be opportunistic and look for opportunities to grow our business. We don't want to be casted out and then be faced with the prospect of even having to divesting. I think we feel like that on an ongoing basis that’s kind of three to four range well just say 3.5 feeling very comfortable on a gross basis.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Curt Morgan: Well thanks for your time and we look forward to seeing you somewhere along the way until our next earnings call for Q2. As we said before we appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to the future. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-03-30 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Curt Morgan - President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Holden - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Burke - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Analysts: Ian Zaffino - Oppenheimer Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS
Operator: Good morning my name is Scott and I will be your conference operator today at this time I would like to welcome to the Vistra Energy 2016 webcast and conference call [audio gap] investor call presentation, our 2016 annual report and the related earnings release. Joining me for today’s call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Holden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and a few additional senior executives available to address questions in the second part of today’s call as necessary. Before we began our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor Statements included on slide one and two which explain the risk of forward-looking statement in the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be true as of today’s date. Slide one highlights certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and in the appendices to Vistra Energy’s various investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to lead our discussion.
Curt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vistra Energy. Before I begin the discussion regarding 2016 performance, I do want to avail timing of this earnings call in our related financial report. We recognize we are reporting our 2016 results later than what is typical for an organization of our size. This time it was driven by recent emergence from bankruptcy and the requirement to implement fresh-start accounting for the emerged entities which some of you may know is very time consuming and detail process. We expect to report results on a more customary cadence in the future. I will try to move you to the appropriate slide as we go through this. However, I do not intend to cover everything on each of the slides and if there’s something that I don’t cover, you can ask us in the Q&A if you’re wondering about it. But I’ll move this along, and right now I’d like to move this page five. Okay. We’ll begin our discussion with 2016. It was a transformational year for us and frankly a good test for our integrated retail and wholesale model. As you may know and I’m sure do Vistra Energy predecessor emerged from bankruptcy on October 3rd of 2016 as a publicly traded entity and we are happy that we have lowest leverage position in the industry finishing 2016 with just under two times net debt to EBITDA and only 2.5 times gross debt to EBITDA. We view these low average level as a tremendous asset to our organization as we continue to evaluate various capital allocation alternatives which I’ll address it in more detail in a bit. In addition, we believe our debt levels are departure from a chronically overleveraged sector that has exacerbated its commodity price risk exposure with financial distress risk. Bill, a little bit later is also going to address our very strong full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion for 2016 which in our view is testimony to the value of the integrated model. We also had very strong cash flow depicting the company's ability to drop a significant percent of EBITDA on the cash after CapEx and servicing debt. Also in October of 2016 we implemented a support organization restructuring rightsizing our corporate overhead cost structure and eliminated more than $300 million of cost from the system. These reductions included $225 million of annual expenses delivering values directly to the organization's bottom line. Now look, it’s not lost on us as there has been a lot of discussion lately on the topic of cost-cutting and we've already implemented the preponderance of our support cost program. Following the support organization restructuring I described, we benchmark Vistra Energy’s fully burdened [ph] wholesale operations relative to peers and we believe Vistra has one of the loan if not the lowest SG&A support cost of the industry as measured on a dollar per megawatt hour basis. Similarly, we believe TXU Energy has among the lowest if not the lowest overall cost structures for retailers and we measure that on a dollar per residential customer equivalent basis. We believe the support organization restructuring is now largely complete, though we do plan to reduce our IT expenditures by another $20 million in total in 2017 and 2018 and that will be the total of $20 million not 20 per year, and we will continually look for ways to find time to fine-tune our cost structure through the use of technology and through process improvement. It is extremely important in a business that is exposed to significant commodity price risk to have very low cost and we will continue to stay very focused on that and report any changes in our cost structure over time. Outside of the support organization restructuring in the fall of 2016 we also kicked off an operational performance initiative in an effort to reduce overall plant operation expense and improve plant performance while increasing efficiency and productivity of the unit. We expect to complete this initiative in mid-2017 and will now any additional cost savings and plant improvement at that time. Moving to page six, for full year performance our retail organization, TXU Energy executed impressively in 2016 delivering $839 million in adjusted EBITDA, its highest adjusted EBITDA contribution, two contributions since 2012. TXU Energy’s performance in 2016 greatly exceeded expectations relative to the prior year results primarily due to the retail outstanding performance in attracting and retaining higher-margin customers. TXU Energy’s 2016 results reflect success of our multi-channel approach to the retail market, our innovative product offering and our sophisticated marketing approach. I’ve talked to many of you on this call before and I reiterated when I came to this company, the primary reason to be quite honest with you was because of the strong retail business that Jim Burke and others and their company have built and it continues to show its resilience and we hope we can use that platform to expand that and grow that over time. Our constant focused on improving the customer experience in the skill with which our retail operations manage hundreds of thousands customers transactions that are occurring here have resulted in an industry leading brand. Residential retail net attrition levels have fallen below 1% in the last two years as shown on slide six despite low wholesale power prices and a deeply competitive ERCOT retail electric market. Also shown on slide six is the TXU Energy EBITDA dating back to 2012. As you can see the EBITDA contribution from our retail business has been both consistent and strong during very different commodity price environment especially given the precipitous decline in wholesale prices over the period. The low point on the graph in 2014 was reflective of increased wholesale power prices in that year and TXU Energy stable pricing approach to our brand promise that maintain stable prices to our customer base. We feel that was very important during that period of time to do that to maintain that strong customer base. In fact we were able to do that. I think the more important point is during the same period with that lower retail contribution Luminant had a very strong year in 2014 and overall company generated just under $1.7 billion in EBITDA showcasing the resilience of our integrated model. Move to page seven, for 2016 Luminant finished the year delivering $764 million in adjusted EBITDA, solid performance and will continue to be a challenging wholesale market price environment, results were driven primarily by high commercial availability, both from our generation portfolio. We used commercial availability because it rates availability by the margin potential, which is what you really want. You want to know if you are available during the high margin period. We cover that with continued strong performance by our commodity risk management team. As it is shown in the chart on slide 7 Luminant’s realized prices in 2016 were nearly 80% higher than settled market prices. Contributions from our opportunistic hedging activities have driven material values to the organization year-after-year as you could see on the slide and we will continue to be important in the forecast and low wholesale market price environments in '17 and '18. Well, our wholesale power price are expected to be low over the next couple of years we continue to see reasonable levels of volatility, especially in natural gas giving us the opportunity to opportunistically hedge our wholesale length [ph] over that same time period. We actually took advantage of that already in late '16 with a run up on gas, we were able to go out and hedge using gas that allowed us to keep many of our legacy coal plant units out of seasonal ops and capture additional margin potential which was just another example of how our commercial team is able to capture value. On slide 8, we have included projected market supply demand and reserve margin forecast from the latest ERCOT’s CDR report published in December. Despite forecast the demand grows to nearly 5.5% and ERCOT was 20-21. ERCOT is estimating that the reserve margin will grow to 20% in '18 and that will stay above 19% to 20-21, primarily driven by projected supply additions over that same time period. These forecast and supply additions have same growth in both thermal and renewable resources. On the renewable front we do believe capacity from utility-scale solar projects in West Texas, together with some additional wind capacity Panhandle [ph] will come online over the next two to four years. However, we also believe increased reliance on renewable and ERCOT will be somewhat limited in near-term for a couple of reasons. First, the initial credit lines that came at a real hefty price to the State of Texas and were completed in 2014 are nearing capacity. In the Panhandle where wind conditions are the most attractive, will soon become congested if new build [ph] is not curtailed or new transmission investment is not authorized. It’s our deal and we are on the ground quite a bit in Austin and have a pretty good perspective on this that the political and regulatory climate in Texas do not currently favour investment in the second credit like [ph] infrastructure project. Second, and probably the most important is just a pure economics of renewable development will be challenged in the current low wholesale power price environment, especially if tax investor appetite begins to wane as a result of the uncertainty around potential tax reform, or if we see reduced subsidization of renewables by municipalities. We've been really active right now in this renewable side mainly to support our retail offering where we do have customers that are interested in renewables and their products and our view is without PPA's at our market price and we do not see merchant renewables being dealt. And we've seen just about every renewable project out there recently. In addition, we believe the increased renewable penetration ERCOT will heighten the value of base more players and in particular flexible natural gas fuel generation and given the need to supplement the intermittent nature of renewable generation. Outside of renewables, ERCOT continues to see announcements for the development of new natural gas fuel generation project in 2017 and beyond. Any decision to build a new thermal generation asset at ERCOT is inexplicable in our view, as any such asset will be uneconomic developed in the current market price environment. The equity of recent new builds in ERCOT is completely out of the money and for certain assets, even the debt investments are challenged. So long, its financial market players are not willing to bring discipline to their investment decisions, ERCOT could remain in an overbuild situation. Since restructuring of power markets begin in the late 1990s, I would back and try to find one of these but we are hard pressed to find a single merchant plan investment where the original equity investment owner received an adequate return and many suffered catastrophic financial distress. And in particular, if you think about in energy-only market like ERCOT, just a difficulty in being able to get an initial return on that equity investment is quite difficult. It seems to us that the primary beneficiaries of the new power plant investment that's occurred over that time period has been the equipment manufactures and developers with a quad model obtained developers on the front end and not forcing them to earn their value overtime just like equity investors. We think there needs to be a change in that model in our sector to make sure that we have a disciplined sector over time. Assuming that the irrational behavior that we just discussed in new investment doesn't continue, we should start to see tightening of the ERCOT market, particularly as older more challenged assets begin to retire in the coming years. We believe there is up to at least 9-gigawatts of coal fuel generation that might not be able to survive in this market environment, potentially including Luminant's legacy coal plants, Big Brown, Martin Lake, and Monticello. The forward reserve margins shown on the slide 8 of our investor presentation do not account for the impact of potential unit retirements. Moving to slide 9. One of our primary areas of focus in 2017 will be to address what I just talked about and we will complete our operational performance initiative and to potentially make difficult decisions around the future operations of our three coal legacy coal plants. I can't sit here and talk about the irrational behavior of investors and that also address the fact that we need to be rational as owners of power plants and we will not continue to operate assets that we believe are out of the mind, merely in the whole step we might see a market recovery and we're not going to wait for somebody else to be the first mover. If we cannot find a way to keep plants running in an economic fashion, we will make the right decisions. Another key priority for our management team aboard in 2017 is to implement our capital allocation strategy which I know is the top into much interest to you all in the broader investment community. As we think about capital allocation, there are several potential uses of cash we can evaluate, including the return of capital to our stock holders in the form of share repurchases and our dividend investments in our business in ERCOT and potential investments in the US markets including transformational transaction. Our capital allocation strategy will always include a disciplined all of the above approach. In particular, we will monitor the trading level of our stock and if we find it attractive, we will implement a stock repurchase program especially once we list on a more liquid exchange. We do not believe at this point in time a recurring dividend policy is appropriate for the company. Our evaluation says yes that our recurring dividend must be meaningful in a 3% to 4% yield level and we must be able to grow it to get recognition in the company's valuation. We are not ready to commit to that and a recurring dividend policy program right now, especially given where the current power wholesale and retail markets are in the US, and the potential opportunities available to invest at attractive valuations and enhance the value of the company. However, I would like to make it very clear, that we are looking for compelling value opportunities and we are quite comfortable returning value to our shareholders rather than squandering our balance sheet and destroying value if compelling value opportunities do not materialize. Moreover, any significant growth transaction would need to be financially similar with that and equity. We think there is a certain discipline in that, it would need to drive further efficiency through synergies and they need to be meaningful. And management would need to have a clear line of sight to return our gross debt to EBITDA to three to four time level within 12 to 18 months of any such transaction. In the very near term, we continue to work diligently toward an uplifting on the New York Stock Exchange which we hope to complete prior to mid-May and need the cause in these -- that this is subject to SEC approval, so the timing of that is a bit fluid and we don’t control it. We anticipate conducting a non-billed roadshow and advancing of the uplifting. So, please stay tuned for further calendar announcement on this front. I will now turn the conversation over to Bill Holden, our CFO to instruct our 2016 financial performance and further detail and also address 2017 guidance. Thank you.
Bill Holden: Thanks, Curt. And before turning to this financial side, I want to begin with just a brief discussion regarding the presentation of our 2016 GAAP results. As Curt mentioned at the beginning of the call, the company emerged from bankruptcy on October 3rd, 2016, and on that day Vistra Energy became a new energy for financial reporting purposes. Kind of Morgan's investor reported all of the effects of the plant and reorganization and also adopt the press style report, pursuant to which the company revalue all of the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. As a result, the financial segments of the company for the period on and after October 3rd of last year which we refer to as the successor period are not comparable to the financial segments of the predecessor prior to that date. And given that Vistra's post emergent results are not comparable with the prior period result of the predecessor, today's discussion and our quarterly earnings discussions and releases during 2017 will not include year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter comparisons. However, we do expect to include a comparison of full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA versus 2016 adjusted EBITDA when we report year-end results on next for '17 next year. Now, turning to slide 11. Vistra Energy delivered adjusted EBITDA in 2016 at 1.6 billion, reducing the year and the top quartile of the 2016 guidance range that we provided in December. An impressive result given the mild Texas weather that we saw in November and December last year. In addition, as we saw on slide 11, we've updated the presentation of our adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2016 to exclude the impacts of margin deposits and working capital which tend to be timing in nature. After adjusting for these timing items, Vistra Energy's 2016 adjusted free cash flow guidance range is reflected as $815 million to $880 million. The full-year 2016 adjusted free cash flow was 886 million, just above the high-end of the newly presented guidance range. The primary drivers for the improved performance or adjusted EBITDA results at the high-end of the guidance range, coupled with lower total capital expenditures in 2016. Looking forward to 2017, we also reaffirming our 2017 guidance, projecting full-year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion and adjusted free cash flow in the range of $745 million to $925 million. I would note that our December 2016 adjusted free cash flow guidance reflected our capital structure at November 30th of last year, which was prior to the $1 billion incremental term loan that was issued in December. The interest rate swap transactions that we executed in December and also the reprising of the just rolled exit facilities, which we completed in February of this year. We think that net impact of these capital structure modifications combined with other potential offsets are not material and that’s the required update to our initial guidance range. Moreover, we would be remiss [ph] not to acknowledge that winter was noticeably absent from Texas this year, but despite there’s lack of winter weather and the other items I just discussed we remain confident that Vistra Energy will achieve results consistent with our full-year 2017 guidance projection. Turning to slide 12, we have provided updated hedge [ph] disclosures, together with natural gas and heat rate margin sensitivities for 2017 and 2018. We recognize that one of the more difficult aspects for modelling the potential performance of our business relates to calculating the impact of movements in natural gas prices and heat rates. As a result we are providing margin sensitivities for the effect of changes in both natural gas price and heat rates, which include an offset related to our retail business. These sensitivities are shown in the charts on the bottom half of slide 12. We issued caveat there are sensitivity charts will not prove to be a perfect proxy for actual results, as the sensitivities will assume a fixed relationship between natural gas and heat rates, which really happens in real-time. In addition, the margin sensitivities assume other items that affect our results remain constant; for example, weather and unit performance. Despite these assumptions we do believe that sensitivities we provided are meaningful and useful tool and it evaluates the sensitivity of our earnings through movements in commodity market pricing. As you will expect the sensitivity ranges for 2017 are relatively narrow, reflecting the fact that we are largely head for natural gas and heat rates for the balance of this year. And last, before we open the calls for questions I would like to quickly highlight the details of our recent debt activity. As I mentioned just a minute ago in February 2017 we repriced $3.5 billion of our initial term loans B and C, the LIBOR plus 275 basis points with a 75 basis points LIBOR floor, that repricing will generate about $44 million of annualized interest rates. In addition, in the fourth quarter of last year we entered into $3 billion of interest rates swaps reducing our floating rate exposure to interest rates. As a result of these activities we expect our pro forma 2017 interest expense to be approximately $221 million. I would add to the extent the capital markets remained favourable this summer and in June we would likely look to reprice the $1 billion of incremental term loans that we received in December of last year. And with that, operator, I would now ready to open the lines up for questions.
Q - Ian Zaffino: Hi, great. Thank you very much. Good quarter. I know you guys had referred to similar cost cuts and that wasn’t clear about this. You mentioned the IT but is your other areas that you continue to cut costs or is that really the last frontier? Is there anything on the O&M side that we can look at or help us understand that a little bit? Thanks.
Bill Holden: Yeah. Good question asked and if I would know that relatively [ph] we are using lot of words here, but two things. One, I think on the – what I call support cost side of thing, which is SG&A and then we have some support O&M and is really largely the support for the generation business. We are pretty much where we need to be on that, but I do want to stress again and this is just in my nature and I think our company’s nature that we are going to continually look for ways. Technology is advancing so quickly and frankly we cut really quickly, within a month of when we emerged from bankruptcy, we cut very quickly and so we are now just following up with our underlying process improvements that go along with restructuring the organization. We might find [ph] through process improvements, but it’s not going to be large reduction. There could be some incremental improvement. With regard to the plans we are working on an what we call an operational performance improvement initiative and we are coming to conclusion on that on Oak Grove and Sandow and we also are doing some work around some of the other plants in the fleet. We do expect to have cost savings around that, but also what I would call sort of revenue net deal [ph] enhancements around improvement and plant performance, and so stay tuned on that. We are not ready to detail that yet, but we in terms of the size of that, but you should expect us to come out with some incremental improvements later in 2017.
Ian Zaffino: Okay, thanks. And then just following up also on the comment about your legacy coal facilities – can you maybe walk us through how you think about whether do you want to keep some of them open, whether you close some, what would be kind of the metrics you reduced to side, and then also what would be the timeline to do something like that.
Curt Morgan: Yeah. Another [ph] question. So, first and foremost I want to stress that any analysis we do is on the plant by plant basis and it is solely focused on the profitability on an individual plant basis and what we look at is obviously EBITDA contribution and we also look at basically cash flow from those facility. ERCOT being in energy only market with $9,000 per megawatt hour price gas sort of the – you can be lured into the idea that we will just wait around within one summer will make a bunch of money on a lot of capacity by having some plants around. And so, our analysis really is around where we think the frequency of that might be, but more important is we look at our excess link in ERCOT that is only in the money and largely in the summer months. We look at those as options. And then what we look is can we get the strike price of those options effectively the fixed costs of those plants down to a level where we feel comfortable, keeping them in the portfolio during the trough [ph] and that we can then get disproportionate returns in the energy only market during the tightening in the marketplace. And so, when we take that into accounts just what are current year now cash flows and EBITDA contribution combined with how low can we get the cost structure down to get the strike price if you will of the ongoing fixed cost nature of that to the lowest it can be. Does it have a reasonable chance given what we think that probability that we would see tightening in the market that we have a reasonable chance of making money, and I will just tell you that I think in this market right now that’s a very difficult proposition for some of our coal plants, but we are in the middle we are trying to get that strike price down as low as we can before we make that final decision, and we will probably be wrapped up on that in the middle – probably more toward the end of the summer and you should expect that we will have some decisions around our legacy coal plants that we will communicate with the market in 2017.
Ian Zaffino: Okay. Thanks. And then just one final question and I’ll let someone else hop on. When you think about – I know reaffirm 2017 guidance where you hedges locked in. As you look into 2018 I guess you probably have significant proportion locked up now on the hedging side, is there a time when you’ll give us 2018 outlook or is that really going to wait until sort of the end of 2017 to maybe get a revision in while you had in your previous presentation index. Thanks.
Bill Holden: Yeah. It will be later in the year and there is a number of reasons for that. We would like to see how the markets shake out. We would like to see how the summer comes in, because that’s going to affect. One thing that happens in ERCOT is depending on what the summer does and if you do get fortunate to see scarcity pricing it will show up in the forwards for the following summer and so we just want to – before we come out we want to see a little bit more how 2017 coming out and its impact on 2018. We also think that as we just discussed there maybe some other market activity that might change just what 2018 looks like. So, you should expect as more I would guess in the fourth quarter timeframe to come out with definitive guidance for 2018. I will just say this that if we – there is some stuff out there probably available and if we thought we were materially off on that, one way or the other we would probably feel compel [ph] especially if it was lower until compel to say something and we are not compelled to say something. So, I think we’d just leave it at that and you’ll hear more from us on 2018 as we roll through 2017.
Ian Zaffino: Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.
Bill Holden: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning.
Bill Holden: Hey, Julien! How are you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good. Thank you very much. Congratulation! I supposed first quick question on balance sheet deployment. I heard a lot of your comments about practice and also higher markets and investing in Brownfield versus Greenfield. How are you thinking now about future capital balance sheet deployment and specifically back in the wholesale power space rather than investing in say midstream or renewable or some other asset class entirely?
Bill Holden: Yeah, I think we have a slight preference where we see the markets today to invest in our sweet spot and that means in the power sector, whether that would be wholesale assets or retail. Julien, we talked before on this and I talk to many folks on this before when we were going through a period of time and kind of assessing and we still continue to think about either energy infrastructure as if relates to supports our current business, but I think if you are thinking about any kind of transformational transaction or something like that or significant move somewhere outside ERCOT, I think we would probably be leading more from power sector standpoint than we would in some other type of infrastructure. So, I think that’s kind of where our head and that’s just because where evaluations in the sector have gone, both for assets and for companies and we are just going to take a look at that and be opportunistic. I will reiterate and we said this over and over again and words are cheap, but we are going to have to find what we think are very compelling opportunities with significant value to proposition for us to really expose our balance sheet and this is tough sector, especially if you step outside our comfort zone of ERCOT. I have been in these other markets and that is good thing and also though a little bit of an overhang for us, because I have a pretty good memory of what it takes and you guys know this. I mean, just think about what’s going in these other markets with [Indiscernible]. A lot of people have their fingers in the pie in this particular sector. So, it’s a tough one. So, if you are going to win in it you got to be able to buy something that you think is a compelling value proposition and feel confident [ph]. You have control over how you get that value proposition and so that’s where we are kind of where we are thinking about things as we speak.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And what about retail – you kind of alluded to it there. I mean, what about retail outside of your core physical footprint as it stands. Does that something that would be [Indiscernible]? I know you guys have been historically very focused on that Texas market with TXU Energy brand, but you branch out with new brands into the northeast for instance?
Bill Holden: Yeah. I think it is unlikely to see us – I should say any kind of transformational deal as we can get anything and we talk about it a lot, but we would want it to be in integrated fashion. We want two things. One, existing retail and two, we want to know that we could use it as a platform to expand our integrated model. It is highly unlikely that we are going to go buy a couple of generation assets to standalone and then look to build organically a retail business outside our ERCOT or buy a retail business. It’s also equally unlikely that we are going to go out and buy a lead with the retail business and fill again [ph] with generation. Those are just unlikely things when you think about how we see the world. We still think that we could actually add to our business here and we know that well, we’ve got scale economies in our retail business and certainly a very good approach to the market. We just don’t know that this is the right time to do that, but we were constantly in this market. I would tell you that the deal flow that goes on in ERCOT we are just front and centre [ph] on this. Everybody knows what our balance sheet looks like. Everybody knows kind of what we are interested in, so there is very little going on in ERCOT that we don’t get a look at and so I would say, we are going to do retail right now on the standalone only basis. You could put pretty much bet on it would be in ERCOT deal.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent! Thank you gentlemen!
Curt Morgan: Hey, thanks John.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Curt Morgan: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for your interest in our company and we look forward to many future calls going forward. As I said at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra and we look forward to talking to you in the weeks and months ahead and we are going to stay tune for what we call non-deal road show coming up and our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. We are excited about it and as always if you have any further questions, you know how to get hold of Molly. So, thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.
