Matthew Pine: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The team got off to a strong start to the year, and Q1 exceeded expectations building on our prior momentum. Demand was resilient and our book to bill remained above one. Revenue grew across all segments, and we delivered a 20 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion, driving double-digit EPS growth. I'm proud of the team for staying focused on helping customers despite various challenges in the business environment. We're better positioned than most to address the water needs of communities and businesses because the portfolio we built is differentiated in every part of the water cycle. On top of that, our structural exposure in the sector is disproportionately aligned with customer OpEx, which historically has been remarkably stable in the face of broader volatility. We're also confident in the agility we built into the business by doing what we said we would do at our Investor Day last May. We are leaning into our high-impact culture, simplifying our processes and systems, and reorienting our structure to improve customer focus. As a result, we're in a better position now to respond with speed and agility in any business environment. While we'd welcome less uncertainty around tariffs, we have pricing and supply chain programs in place designed to offset the majority of the impacts from the current tariff scheme. We have a strong line of sight to Q2 and execution momentum reflected in our first quarter results. So based on where we stand today and in current tariff levels, we are reaffirming our full year 2025 guidance on both revenue and earnings per share. In a moment, I'll offer some comments updating where we stand twelve months into executing on the plans laid out at our Investor Day last year. But first, I'm gonna turn the call over to Bill to provide more detail on our outstanding Q1 results and on the assumptions underpinning our guide.
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. As Matthew mentioned, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year. The team stayed focused despite the volatility and delivered results exceeding our expectations. Demand remains solid, with our ending backlog at $5.1 billion and our book to bill for the quarter above one. Orders were down slightly versus last year, but against challenging comps, in WSS and 3% in the quarter driven by an outperformance in MCS. The team's operational discipline pushed quarterly EBITDA margin to 20.4%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was driven by productivity, impacts from our simplification efforts, and price more than offsetting inflation and mix. The strong commercial and operational performance helped us realize quarterly EPS of $1.30 surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 and delivering a 14% increase over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.5 times. Year-to-date free cash flow decreased by $53 million from the prior year and was driven by outsourced water projects and payables partly offset by higher net income. Now let's turn to slide six. In Measurement and Control Solutions, we continue to convert the backlog with the total for MCS coming down slightly from the prior quarter to $1.8 billion. Orders were down 8%, driven by difficult comps in smart metering, partially offset by growth in analytics. Bidding and funnel activity remains healthy overall and has increased year on year, with some key wins with AMI projects that will fill in the second half. Revenue grew more than expected for the quarter, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by energy growth, and offset by water delivery calibration. EBITDA margin of 21% was up sequentially versus the fourth quarter but 170 basis points lower than prior year, driven primarily by the energy water mix challenges we highlighted previously which will impact margins for the first half of the year. In water infrastructure, orders were up 1% in the quarter, led by strong demand and treatment offsetting double-digit declines in China due to ongoing economic challenges. Revenue increased 5% driven by strong treatment and transport demand across most regions with the exception of China. EBITDA margin for water infrastructure was up an outstanding 290 points. Productivity and price more than offset inflation and mix, and the OWI team continues to get significant traction with our 80/20 efforts. In applied water, orders were up 3%, growing for the fifth straight quarter. Orders were driven by strength in building solutions and book to bill was well above one. Revenues were up 1% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strength in building solutions, partially offset by 80/20 walkaway impacts. Segment EBITDA margin improvement of 300 basis points year over year was a company best for the quarter. Productivity, price, and mix more than offset higher inflation and lower volumes. AW simplification efforts are really starting to take hold. Finally, water solutions and services saw robust demand with book to bill well over one. Orders decreased by 5%, though, lapping a difficult comp due to a large order in the prior year. Revenue grew 1% with strength in services offset by weather impacts in the Southeastern part of the US. Segment EBITDA margins were down 60 basis points versus the prior year at 21.7%, driven primarily by mix and lower volume, partially offset by productivity and positive price cost. Now let's turn to slide seven to discuss our current views on tariffs. Before I go through our overall guidance, I want to highlight that our reaffirmation of our full year guidance is based on the assumption that the current tariff scheme remains in place for the balance of the year. At this time, we expect to offset the cost of the additional tariffs.
Matthew Pine: Incremental pricing and supply chain actions, and any softening demand should be buffered by our strong start to the year in FX tailwinds. We're providing a summary of the imports from our largest regions and the estimated impact tariffs will have. At current levels. The large rate increase on China imports from our last earnings call has changed the math and made this our 80. But we should note that our imports from China are down significantly from where they were just a few years ago. And we continue to reduce our exposure with dual sourcing of most of what comes out of China now. On Mexico, fortunately, 75% of goods imported are covered through the USMCA exempt we continue to work to increase that number. At this time, we have a net increased cost from tariffs on of just $30 million. From the EU, we are primarily seeing impacts on our imports of water infrastructure products and are exploring a few alternatives outside of implemented pricing actions to help mitigate the impact. I think everyone realizes that this is a very dynamic situation with multiple potential tariff rate changes in the future. But our newly implemented operating model makes the organization more nimble, which gives us confidence in our ability to manage the evolving situation. Now let's turn to slide eight for our Q2 and full year guidance. The organic outlook is unchanged versus what we provided at the start of the year, but there are several changes to our reported figures and initial assumptions. Full year reported revenue is now expected to be $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion, up from our prior guide of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion which delivers revenue growth of 1% to 2% while organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains unchanged versus prior guidance. FX has shifted and is no longer a material headwind, while the divestiture impact we've noted is roughly 1% of sales. We're holding back the impact of our enacted tariff pricing in our guide until we get better visibility into any softening demand that may result from evolving trade dynamics. EBITDA margin is expected to remain at 21.3% to 21.8%. This represents 70 to 120 basis points of expansion versus the prior year. Driven by productivity and price more than offsetting inflation as well as investments in the business. Benefits from our simplification efforts will help mitigate mix pressure from MCS. This yields an unchanged EPS range of $4.50 to $4.70. Despite a challenging start, we remain committed to the 9% to 10% free cash flow margin. Again, cash flow will be impacted in 2025 primarily by our recently announced restructuring actions. Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate revenue growth will be in the 1% to 2% range on a reported basis and 2% to 3% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 21% to 21.5% which is flat to up 50 basis points. Driven by price realization and productivity gains and higher volumes as well as impacts from our simplification efforts. Second quarter MCS EBITDA margin will be down significantly year over year driven again by the energy and water mix. Will be the low mark for the year. But we will we expect it to improve sequentially from there and return to expansion in the second half. This yields second quarter EPS of $1.12 to $1.16. We started the year with momentum and in a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position, the durability of our portfolio, and benefits from our simplification efforts. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions, and volatility, including potential new or additional tariffs, inflation, and fluctuations in currency and interest rates. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on our strong momentum. With that, please turn to slide nine, and I'll turn the call back over to Matt for closing comments.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Our solid Q1 performance is another proof point that we're delivering on the plan we laid out at our Investor Day last May. It's been almost a year since then, so as a reminder, we outlined our intention to create value from our operating model, integrating Evoqua, and optimizing our portfolio with disciplined capital deployment. On our operating model, as I mentioned a few moments ago, that work has already begun to make us more agile. And that's a great benefit. But the real reason to simplify our operating model is to position us for long-term growth. And we're doing that by implementing our high-impact culture, driving 80/20, which is progressing nicely across the business. And simplifying our organizational structure, is tracking to the timing we laid out on our last earnings call. We can already see the spike in productivity from those actions which is reflected in our margin expansion over the last five quarters. But just as important, simplification has unleashed a new energy across the enterprise. Our teams told us that very clearly in our most recent employee survey. And our global leaders report an increase in the speed of our responsiveness to customers alongside less wasted time and effort. In the integration of Evoqua, we've delivered the cost synergies faster than planned, and now we've got great momentum on the revenue synergies. And finally, on capital deployment, we've built considerable momentum in the last twelve months. We have an attractive and robust M&A pipeline focused on capabilities that complement our core especially in advanced treatment intelligent solutions, and in services. So we're confident about delivering a consistent flow of opportunities with the right level of discipline. In the recent weeks, as an example, we closed on Baycom, a leading technology company with proprietary breakthrough solutions and zero liquid discharge. As an addition to our treatment portfolio, the technology offers a compelling value proposition in attractive industrial verticals like microelectronics and energy. Alongside M&A, we're actively optimizing our portfolio with specific actions in place to further focus on our strategic priorities. So the team has gotten a lot done since last May, and the benefits are reflected in our results. At the same time, we've remained fully committed to sustainability leadership. Our annual sustainability report will be out tomorrow, April 30. When you read it, you'll get a strong impression of the impact the team is having on the customers and communities we serve. In fact, we've exceeded all four of our 2025 customer sustainability goals ahead of schedule. And we've raised the bar with our 2030 goals. We outlined those at Investor Day last year you'll be able to find further detail on them in the report which will be on our website tomorrow. Before we get to your questions, I wanna highlight our team once more because this is a team sport. I'm proud of the team for delivering such a tremendous start to the year. And for leaning in to the transformation of Xylem with so much determination and positive energy. And for putting us in such a privileged position to execute on our purpose which is to empower our customers and communities to build a more water secure world. With that, operator, I'll turn the call over to you for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. And to withdraw your question, please press star then 2. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey. Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. Just really appreciate all the tariff detail, mitigation plan and so forth. And page seven is a big help. And kind of interesting is you all in terms of China as a percent of COGS, are pretty similar to a number of the multi companies that we cover. So no surprises there. And so first question is a more of a just a reflection of this past quarter. Did you benefit in any way from customers prepositioning inventory? They pull forward and then similarly, did you all preposition any inventory ahead of some of the tariff issues, supply chain issues, and so forth?
Matthew Pine: Yeah, Deane, I'll start us out. In terms of kind of front loading orders, ahead of tariffs, we didn't see any increase in Q1. To get ahead of tariffs. We pulse the teams actually in our business reviews in April, and we did see a small impacted area in applied water in our commercial business. But in general, we really haven't seen anybody do any pull-ins to get ahead of the tariffs.
Deane Dray: Got it. And anything for yourself? Or Xylem in terms of positioning? Okay. And then second question would be just give me clarify. The point about the price increases that you're putting through? You're not assuming any fall in demand. I'm not sure that that's the your typical place price elasticity, but just what is the underlying assumption there? And maybe it's kind of the timing in or when you could see some overall falloff in demand because of these price mitigation issues.
Matthew Pine: Yeah. I think for sure, we do anticipate some demand falling off in the second half of the year. Know, we don't have a really good line of sight to that. That's probably the biggest, you know, puzzle that's piece of the puzzle that's missing. But, you know, as we've done sensitivity analysis, if we look at tariffs, we look at price, we look at demand, we feel really comfortable with our, you know, having beat Q1 and our first quarter beat. Now we've got tailwinds from FX in our right in the right direction. We feel very comfortable that you know, any sizable amount of demand, impact in the second half, we can manage. But know, we've run different sensitivity, and we feel confident that we can manage, any any movement in demand. But, we do anticipate it. It's just to what extent that we feel we've got it covered.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. I mean, Deane, the comment in the prepared remarks was we've gone out with extensive pricing across the portfolio. So we didn't raise our organic growth guide would reflect that because we're gonna offset it with any potential decline that Matthew just highlighted. That's yet to be determined.
Deane Dray: Got it. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.
Bill Grogan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Morning. Good morning.
Mike Halloran: So just kinda wanna walk through a couple things here. First, the tariff side of things. How are you expecting to manage the pricing piece of this on a forward basis? You know, surcharges versus formal price increases, are these layering in over the next two months? Have they already put been put in place? You know, would you roll some of those back? Because if tariffs come down, leverage if there are even more tariffs? Just kind walk through the moving pieces there to help understand the timing. And and and related does this matter for the second quarter particularly much based on order levels, inventory, timing, etcetera? Is this kind of like a back half of the quarter impact, or is it more 3Q?
Matthew Pine: Yes. I'll start with where you finish. It's more back half half loaded to the quarter and then obviously the second half of the year. But Mike, we've got a mix of surcharge and price increases. I would say it's probably two-thirds price increase, about a third surcharge. This different parts of our business needed to handle it in different ways. But those actions you know, look. I think a lot of the work we've done on our operating model structure have enabled us to move more swiftly. We took pricing actions in Q1. We took those again in early in April Q2. And, those are in the market and in play right now. So you know, there's parts of our backlog that we can reprice, and we're doing that. And there's parts that we can't. We we've done an assessment. We understand that, and that's kinda baked into our full year guide. But know, we're pretty nimble and moving quickly, in a evolving situation. As things change, we'll reevaluate and we'll readjust, but I think we're in a good position right now.
Mike Halloran: Well, thanks for that. And then the follow-up is if at all, how much does this change your approach the simplification side of things? Is this not opportunity to lean lean in even further? Is it creating any challenges? I mean, obviously, you're pretty comfortable in in in in what you're doing in internally. Otherwise, you wouldn't tell the guide. And all the offset points. But I'm just curious if it changes that dynamic at all. And just if you don't mind also adding where you are right now in the process and what the main focal point is on the simplification side.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. Maybe I would start. I think fundamentally, no change to our methodology or approach. I think if anything, as we look for areas to accelerate, businesses that are more challenged from the tariffs, we we look for other actions to expedite some of the simplification efforts to help offset know, the the weight of the tariffs. I think overall on the restructuring plan, we're on track. Think our Q1 performance was slightly ahead of schedule. I think we're starting to see it, as Matthew highlighted, though, as the business is come together, a resegmentation and divisional structure we've created. We've got dedicated leaders that have P&L ownership that nimbleness and them to have full control and line of sight to the action that they need to take to drive business results, I think is hugely beneficial in this environment. So I think it was, you know, obviously, a much needed activity and then perfect timing to face a really challenging macroeconomic environment.
Mike Halloran: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: The next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.
Matthew Pine: Morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Seems doesn't seem like, this tariff stuff is creating as much drama for you guys as perhaps maybe some others out there. But so I'll I'll ask questions in a different way, maybe more traditional, and that would be balance sheet still really under levered and you've had a, you know, you've had a lot of market disruptions. Is this an environment that you know, we've heard mixed things. You know? Some folks say M&A is stalled out and some have some have said it it hasn't. So what have you guys seen, and and and what do you expect as far as to some capital to work this year?
Matthew Pine: Yeah. We may look like a duck, but the feet are moving pretty quickly under the water. Scott, as we laid out on our Investor Day, our priorities are first investing in the core. M&A is really important to us to get to the mid-teens EPS guide that we put out for LRP, so we're very active there. We have a lot of targets in the funnel. You know, obviously, we talk about, you know, we wanna continue dividends, and then we'll be opportunistic on share buybacks. I think it's a little bit from a valuation perspective. Maybe I'll talk about that. I think it's a little bit too early to kinda see maybe any impacts to valuations. You know, private valuations tend to lag public markets. We haven't really seen a lot of movement there. However, you know, high-quality companies usually come at a premium. And, you know, the one thing that, you know, we continue to do is optimize our portfolio. We're very you know, direct about that at Investor Day last year. We did one deal in Q1 or '1 divestiture in Q1. We've got a few other things in the portfolio that we're looking to divest. That, either were no longer fit or just are not accretive to the business. You know, we're gonna continue to look at assets that fit our strategy and and make decision based on strategic fit and financial hurdles and you know, I I know that we built a lot of muscle to to to do a lot of M&A. So we're built know, a lot of capability, and we're gonna be active you know, out with M&A over the course of this year and through our LRP.
Scott Davis: Okay. Sounds encouraging. Edge, total switch gears, and sorry I missed the first seven minutes of your call. The water solutions and service segment, is that is that a little bit too lumpy for us to start picking on quarters. What should we expect in kind of this new segmentation? Just trying to get used to it. 1% growth seemed a little light. For versus kinda what we were thinking. But, again, if if it's just lumpy and it it kinda hard to call the quarters, and maybe we shouldn't make a big deal out of that stuff.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. No. I I would I would definitely agree with that. It is our lumpiest segment. Just right, we were at double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Double-digit growth in the second quarter. So you're going to see as some of these larger capital projects hit, you know, a little bit less consistency as you'll see in the in the balance of the portfolio. I think, overall, they've got, you know, outside of the the tough comp. I mean, last year, just to remind everyone, we had you know, about a $150 million outsourced water project that we booked. So excluding that, orders would have been extremely strong in the quarter. We we we built significant backlog. I think backlog year over year is up 6% or 7% for that business. So think the fundamentals are still there. And, yeah, I'd look at a rolling twelve-month organic rate versus a quarter to quarter to really get the true health of WSS. But relative to expectations, they were they were right in line and think they have a really strong year ahead of them.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's what we thought. That's helpful. Thanks, Bill. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it, guys. Best of luck this year.
Operator: The next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Hey, I guess my question on tariffs, are there parts of the portfolio where tariffs leave you either better or worse off relative to competitors? So are are there different in the competitive impact or your competitive position that you see coming from tariffs? And does that, you know, make price increases easier to get in places, harder to get in others, and how do you deal with that?
Matthew Pine: Yeah. A good question. I I I would just start maybe at a high level that, you know, roughly about we're 4% of our COGS. In terms of tariffs. And you know, I think we're in a very competitive position based on what I've been able to, you know, glean over the past couple of weeks. And I think we're in a really good space. You know, I think I would just like I I said in the opening remarks that our diversification of our portfolio and the end markets help us you know, really have a stable business in the face of economic downturns you know, like the potential one where you know, looking at. And also the critical nature of our products and solutions are really important. So know, if I harken back to COVID, you know, we we obviously had a kind of a peak to trough of down six, but you know, I think normal pullbacks, we have been pretty resilient across the markets driven by our muni exposure and then high growth verticals in our industrial business, especially as we brought on legacy Evoqua into the portfolio. So you know, I think we're feeling really good about our competitive position, and you know, we'll take it one day at a time.
Nathan Jones: Thanks for that. I guess, the other question I wanted to ask about or have you guys comment on was about the the organizational realignment that that you guys have gone through over the last few quarters. And then I think you know, pretty much going live into into place now. So can you talk about how you've changed the internal organization of the company at and what impact you're looking for that to have on the business. Thanks.
Matthew Pine: Yeah. I think, like I said last call, just I'll start out with just reiterating that these actions, however necessary for the business, mean that we're have 2,000 colleagues that either have or will be leaving the business over the course, you know, through the summer. Know, we don't take that lightly. We we do wanna make sure that everyone's, know, treated fairly and that, with the utmost respect. So I'll start there. First and foremost. You know, Nate, we're tracking to the timeline that we laid out on the last earnings call. I think Bill just alluded to that as well. With the majority of our actions wrapping up this summer, especially in Europe where we were working with workers councils there. Know, I would say I've been traveling quite a bit around the globe spending time with colleagues and customers, and I can already see the impact know, the teams are much more focused. They're making decisions more quickly, and we're already seeing the the impact on customer focus. And prior to that, we were highly matricized as you know. Now we're singular focused on a segment. And now we have 16 division GMs. That have end to end accountability for the P&L statement. And so you know, that's enabling the speed and focus and accountability, and it's gonna make us much better. I'm already starting to see that in my travels. Maybe the another thing I would I would mention is we've set up an enterprise solutions organization. You know, before, we were focused on the 20, not the 80. In terms of customers that wanted to buy our our total portfolio. And I am personally, you know, calling on C-suite executives and helping that team for customers that wanna buy our our total solution. So that's making a lot of great progress. And I said this in our prepared remarks, but I'll just reiterate it. You know, we do pull surveys three times a year. We just wrapped up our poll survey. We've seen really marked improvements. And the two questions we asked we ask, you know, different questions, but the two that really reflect the, the transformation are, are we making it easier to serve our customers? And are we making it easier for you as a colleague to do to do your job? We've seen, you know, especially marked improvement with our top one fifty, our global leaders. As you think about the fusion of a structure and culture down, it should start there. And we've seen the broader organization improve in that those two questions as well. So off to a good start. And, you know, there's a lot more to go, but we're off to a good start.
Nathan Jones: Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Bill Grogan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Sara Borodinski with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sara Borodinski: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe just on MNCS, you know, orders have been choppy recently. So just any color on how you're thinking about orders versus high single growth expected for the full year? And then maybe any additional color on the margins that are included in that backlog. And do you expect to have this energy mix issue going forward? Thank you.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. I I would say, you know, we we we said just MCS orders, as they go through the re phasing of of their projects that book to bill, we will be positive in the back half of the year. I mean, general bid activity remains strong. Our win rate has maintained. So the fundamentals of that business as we get through some of this rephasing, I think returns more normal cadence, and you'll see that water business back to the high single-digit growth rate. Yeah. We highlighted the energy part of of smart metering is doing significantly well. You know, growth with 40 plus percent growth rates this year. So and we have line of sight to to how some of those projects are gonna lay in the back half. As we see an acceleration of of growth as we go through. The balance of the year. From a margin perspective, I think we're very solid on the water side. We've talked about, you know, we've got a specific project or two in the energy space that's putting some pressure on overall margin. It's less margin than the water portfolio on balance, but we got some specific issues that we're cycling through our backlog, and it'll be at a more normal level, going into 2026. I think the MCS team overall from a margin perspective continues to work on, core productivity to to help try to offset that. But the mix impact is significant. Couple hundred basis basis points here in the first quarter and and and we'll ramp here, in the second quarter. Like we said in the prepared remarks, I think Q2 is the bottom, and then we'll start to see a sequential improvement from there and then, back to year over year expansion.
Sara Borodinski: I appreciate all the color. And then last quarter, I believe you talked about seeing some impact on orders from 80/20, I think, in water infrastructure. Just to update us on any impact you saw this quarter, from 80/20 on overall orders? And then do recent tariff actions change this strategy in any way given maybe the higher cost base for some products? Thank you.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. No, I think we highlighted, we had built into our guide a little over 1% of headwind from an 80/20 perspective. And maybe a little bit heavier in applied water and water infrastructure as they have been they've implemented a tool set, you know, the the longest within the portfolio we looked at. Kind of the, mid build up of their product and customer portfolio. There was the largest opportunity there. So I think the teams are continuing to make those decisions to to reduce the free up the the team's time to help at the end of the day, longer term, you know, grow and innovate with our largest customers. So I don't think there's a material change to to that strategy now with, tariffs in place. You know, overall, obviously, the incremental pricing will provide a a tailwind, if there's no material, economic pullback as as we said earlier.
Sara Borodinski: Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.
Matthew Pine: Thank you. Take care.
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Brian Blair: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Matthew Pine: Morning, Brian.
Brian Blair: I actually wanted to follow-up on MNCS. Margin performance and outlook. Bill, you just said Q1 mix impact couple of hundred basis points. By how much does that step up into Q2? And then given the visibility that you have on first half results, second half project pipeline, tariff impact, etcetera. Are you still confident in full year segment margin expansion?
Bill Grogan: Yes. So first off, I'd say Q1 margin was right in line with our expectations. And again, just it's very specifically attributed to the mix shift between our water and energy meter businesses. You know, we talked about last quarter. This is really a first half type of phenomenon as they get through the rephasing of their backlog. So I I think we are on track and, in line with expectations. I I think as we get into the second quarter, experienced in in the, first quarter. Again, that's why our overall Xylem margin, significant MCS pressure. But again, that that team continues to do a lot of great work on profitability that's being masked by this mix issue. Yeah. They drove a few hundred basis points of productivity through their 80/20 and organizational simplification efforts. They continue to drive material efficiencies through their sorting and design work. So they're tackling it. That'll create a better leverage point for when this mix issue were resolved later in the year. But we're confident that as we stand here today, full year MCS margins will expand year over year.
Brian Blair: Okay. Very helpful detail. Thank you. And as a follow-up, you have covered this directionally with some other responses, but, perhaps offer a little more detail on April order trends and you know, any apparent impact in the early days of additional pricing. Curious if there are call outs by segments or at a higher level, OpEx versus CapEx oriented businesses?
Matthew Pine: Just maybe starting with Q1, we exceeded our expectations on orders across all segments and into the first part of the quarter, you know, in our first business reviews in April, we know, we're tracking to our order forecasting. So we haven't seen any any pullbacks as of late. Obviously, we're keeping a watchful eye on that. It's as tariffs start to really work their way through the system and people start to react to that maybe from a demand perspective. We have seen a few project delays, mostly on the industrial treatment side. But those are well within, you know, you know, what we do in terms of hedging against, you know, as we negotiate contracts or there any project delays, things that we always account for with typical kinda delays in in the capital projects. So nothing outside the realm of things we don't, hedge against. So I think so far so good, but, obviously, there's a lot of road in front of us this year. And we're gonna have to take it kind of day by day, week by week, and month by month.
Brian Blair: Understood. Thank you again.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. Apologies if you covered this in the prepared remarks. I've been bouncing between calls, but can you just talk me through the the sequential dynamics in margin at NCS from 4Q to 1Q? Because I've I thought the the energy headwind is kind of on both of those quarters, but I know margin's down year on year in the 1Q, but still up fairly significantly sequentially.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. I I I think obviously, we started to see some of the margin improvement of overall MCS in Q1 of 2024. Which I think adds some of the just the year the year over year pressure as we look at mix between the the the two sides. On a quarter to quarter basis, I think just as there was a couple other one timers outside of mix in Q4. True up of incentive and things like that that mitigated the their margin expansion. So again, this was in line with our expectations. I think we we sequentially go down into the second quarter and then, you know, look for, sequential improvement and year over year improvement starting in Q3 and moving on to Q4.
Joe Giordano: Perfect. And then, like, you mentioned book to bill there, you know, looking at above one in the second half. Are we talking, like, getting back you know, it's a pretty big increase versus the January, you know, first half order rate. What's kind of informing that level of that magnitude of of increase in the back half there from from an order standpoint?
Bill Grogan: Just as we look at the commercial funnel and the activity of projects as we see to start to layer in one, and then two, just the movement of inventory through the channel as they rephase those projects. They'll have bled that down and start getting in a more normal order pattern.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Matthew Pine for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Pine: Well, we'll wrap it up there. Thanks for your questions, and thanks to everyone who joined the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. All the very best. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keith Buettner, Vice President, Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead.
Keith Buettner: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and discuss the first quarter and full year 2025 outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of the website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, February 18, and will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to Slide 3. We have provided you with a summary of key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to the prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis, reflecting the change in segments as of the beginning of the year. For the purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.
Matthew Pine: Thank you, Keith Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The results we released earlier today reflect a strong fourth quarter finish to a record breaking 2024. In a year of transition and significant transformation for Xylem, the team served our customers and communities with discipline and delivered on our commitments and the results show their impact. For full year revenue, EBITDA margins and EPS all set new benchmarks for us. Revenue grew 6%, we expanded EBITDA margins 170 basis points and EPS was up double digits for the year. The team's operating discipline was apparent across all segments and the integration of Evoqua is delivering cost synergies significantly faster than expected. In a moment, I'll ask Bill to drill down on the fourth quarter, but the headline numbers reflect a big finish to a big year. The team executed well on resilient underlying demand, with all segments delivering Q4 orders growth of mid-single digits for better that has given us great pace coming into the new year. We anticipate demand will continue to be healthy overall through 2025 despite uncertain dynamics in a few end markets and regions. The team is doing a great job managing what we can control and is committed to the transformation of Xylem we began in 2024, enabling us to improve focus, increase our speed and drive accountable execution. The transformation is behind our 8-K filing last week, which follows through on our discussion at Investor Day when we indicated our intent to simplify Xylem's operating model. We're moving from a matrix to a structure with a single access or segments. The plan streamlines our organization, which will strengthen our competitive positioning, enable us to better serve our customers. We've also taken several targeted capital deployment actions since our last earnings call, all aimed at optimizing our portfolio for growth and profitability. In December, we increased our stake in Idrica to a majority ownership and management control of the technology platform at the heart of Xylem View, which is a strategic growth priority for us as utilities continue to digitize. We also acquired a few tuck-ins to enhance our offerings in Water Solutions and Services and Water Infrastructure. Finally, just last month, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a noncore business that came with the acquisition of Evoqua and represents about 1% of revenue. As our 2024 performance indicates, transforming our operating model has energized the enterprise, and that's reflected in the 2025 guidance we issued earlier today, which is in line with delivering the long-term framework we committed to you last May. Before we go into more detail on that full year outlook, I'm going to ask Bill to unpack the team's fourth quarter performance, which provides the foundation for our momentum into 2025. Bill?
William Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. As Matthew mentioned, we are very pleased with the strong finish to 2024. The team stayed focused and consistently delivered throughout the year, exceeding on our expectations, delivering record revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the full year. Demand remains positive, with our ending backlog of $5.1 billion essentially flat from the prior year, driven by progress executing at MCS on their past due backlog, but offset in part by growth across the other three segments. Our book-to-bill ratio was near one in the quarter and exceeded one in the year. Orders were healthy, up 7% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across all segments, with Water Infrastructure leading the way with 10% orders growth. Revenue growth was robust, up 7% in the quarter despite a challenging comp of 9% growth in the same period last year. The team's operational discipline delivered quarterly EBITDA margin of 21%, up 140 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was driven by productivity, price and volume more than offsetting inflation and investments. We also achieved a record EPS of $1.18, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 and marking a 19% increase over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.5x. Year-to-date free cash flow increased by 29% from the prior year. The conversion rate of 116% was driven by higher net income, offset by higher net working capital and increased CapEx. Working capital efficiency in the quarter was negatively impacted by timing of sales, but our overall performance for the year was strong. Let's turn to Slide 6. In Measurement and Control solutions, we continue to convert the backlog, though total MCS backlog remained at roughly $1.9 billion, in line with the prior quarter. This is a 13% organic decrease from the prior year, driven by smart metering conversion. Orders were up 6%, driven by smart metering and analytics demand. Revenue was up 6%, again, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. EBITDA margin of 17.1% was 120 basis points lower than prior year, driven by mix, inflation and investments more than offsetting productivity, price and volume. As expected, there was a sequential margin headwind for mix in the quarter as energy meters accounted for a larger portion of sales. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 10% in the quarter, with strong demand in transport. Revenue increased 8%, driven by treatment and transport demand across most regions. EBITDA margin for Water Infrastructure was up an outstanding 360 basis points. Productivity, price, mix and volume more than offset inflation and investments. In Applied Water, orders were up 5% and book-to-bill was roughly one, lifted by large project wins in the US. and strength in Europe. As expected, revenues were essentially flat to prior year, primarily driven by softness in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin increased 60 basis points year-over-year. Productivity, mix and price more than offset higher inflation, lower volumes and other costs. Finally, Water Solutions and Services saw robust demand with orders increasing 8%, driven by strength in capital projects and dewatering. Revenue growth was up strong at 11%, with strength in capital projects, dewatering and services. Growth was also fueled by projects coming online faster than anticipated as we entered the quarter. Segment EBITDA margins was 22.8%, up 10 basis points versus prior year, driven by productivity, price and volume, more than offsetting inflation, investments and mix. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for our 2025 segment outlook. Before I go through our overall guidance, I want to highlight that we have not factored in any impact for the recently enacted tariffs by the US. administration. At this time, we do not believe that they will have a material impact on our full year 2020 results, but it is obviously a fluid situation, and we will update our guidance accordingly as we learn more. Heading into 2025, our markets remain positive, and our teams are delivering on our commitment to simplify Xylem, focus on our customers and expand margins. We are providing full year organic revenue guidance for the segments that is largely in line with our long-term framework. In MCS, we expect growth of high single digits. We are seeing some pockets of softness in Europe, but overall demand is still healthy and our pipeline is strong. Our expectation is energy meters will drive a majority of the growth in 2025 and water meters will grow low single digits. We expect to see sequential revenue improvements throughout the year, supported by our backlog and easier comps. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand due to the mission-critical nature of our applications and solid CapEx demand. Healthy utility end markets across most regions, Evoqua synergies and price capture will drive strong growth in the year. However, as expected, we will see headwinds from 80/20 actions as we simplify Water Infrastructure's offerings, and we do expect weakness in China's utility market. In Applied Water, we expect modest growth of low single digits. We see growth across developed markets, particularly in the US., with large projects coming online and a general recovery in their end markets. Growth will be offset in Applied Water as well by 80/20 actions as we exit unprofitable businesses. WSS growth is expected to be mid-single digits, driven by strength in outsourced water projects and solid demand in dewatering. This segment is supported by a $1 billion backlog and strong funnel activity across all of their businesses. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for our full year 2025 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to full year revenue of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, resulting in revenue growth of 0% to 2% and organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. This is on the low end of our long-term framework due to the 80/20 actions we are taking across our segments. There will be a larger impact in early phases of implementation. EBITDA margin is expected to be 21.3% to 21.8%. This represents 70 basis points to 120 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by productivity and price more than offsetting inflation in our investments in the business. We will also benefit from our simplification efforts, which helped to mitigate mix pressure from MCS. This yields an EPS range of $4.50 to $4.70, up 8% at the midpoint over the prior year. FX will be a meaningful headwind in the year, and excluding those impacts, EPS growth would be double digits at the midpoint. As a reminder, we are committed to low double-digit free cash flow margin in our long-term financial framework. However, cash flow will be impacted in 2025 by our recently announced restructuring actions that may drop us slightly below our long-term goals. Drilling down in the first quarter. We anticipate revenue growth will be in the 0% to 2% range on a reported basis and 1% to 2% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.5% to 20%, up 30 to 80 basis points, driven by higher volumes, price realization and productivity gains as well as impacts from our simplification efforts. We do want to note that MCS EBITDA margin will be down year-over-year, driven by the energy and water mix we highlighted earlier, but will be up sequentially from Q4. This yields first quarter EPS of $0.93 to $0.98. We are entering the year with momentum and in a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position, the durability of our portfolio and benefits for our simplification efforts. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions and volatility, including potential new or additional tariffs and fluctuations in FX. Regarding tariffs. We are ready to take additional price actions as needed to offset any increases and take cost actions to mitigate the impact on our margins. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on our strong momentum. With that, please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. We spend a lot more time looking forward than back, but the full year results do offer a moment for reflection and appreciation. We had a smooth leadership transition coming into 2024, and then we spent the year digging in and frankly, getting a lot more done. The results tell a great story, but not the whole story. What we've accomplished in just one year is a huge credit to our colleagues around the world. They delivered for our customers, at the same time, doing the difficult work of deep change. I really appreciate how the team has leaned in and embraced our transformation as an energizing challenge. Earlier, I spoke about simplification and taking complexity out of our structure. That work on structure goes hand-in-hand with refining our operating model more broadly, sharpening our high-impact culture, streamlining our processes and systems and optimizing our portfolio with targeted capital deployment. At the same time, we've amplified our commitments on sustainability, raising the bar again with our 2030 sustainability targets. And in 2024 alone, the team responded to more than 40 water-related disasters, serving communities in times of crisis from India to Spain, to the Carolinas to Brazil. Together, the team is transforming Xylem to be better positioned to fulfill on our purpose, to empower our customers and communities to build a more water-secure world. In 2025, our transformation initiatives will improve our profitability, further optimize our portfolio and make it easier for customers to do business with Xylem. We know this kind of transformation takes time and may not happen in a straight line, but we've made a great start, we have an outstanding team, the right strategy and privileged positions in attractive markets. Building on the progress we made in 2024, we're looking ahead to a strong 2025 in delivering on our long-term commitment to profitable growth and sustainable value creation. With that, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe we can start with the restructuring announcement. And just based upon your Analyst Day last year, you knew that there was -- this was a next step coming. And maybe it would be helpful if you kind of gave more color on the plan. Is it all SG&A? It seems like it's headcount, what's the mix between North America, outside of North America and maybe some payback expectations?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I'll start this off, and I'll let Bill get into some of those details in terms of the timing and geography and things of that nature. But I just want to say these actions, however necessary, mean that value colleagues sort of leaving Xylem and we don't take that lightly. We're going to make sure we have ensure a smooth transition and that colleagues are treated respectfully and fairly. So I want to start there. To your point, Deane, the plan is consistent with our '24 Investor Day in May, really about taking complexity out of our business, which includes not only simplifying our structure, but really the implementation of 80/20. It's a little bit of both in terms of the 8-K filing, the structure and the bottoms up we've done from the initial 80/20 work. We are focused on reducing that complexity, making it easier for our colleagues to do their job, but also making it easier for our customers to do business with us. And we've already seen here in the back half of '24 and as we enter '25, the organization is moving much faster. They're definitely more focused, and we have much more end-to-end accountability. Maybe one other point I would call out is this is in service of growth. And at the same time we're doing this work, it does allow us to redeploy our resources and our effort across the business to focus on customers. And in many cases, through 80/20, we have been moving some of our B customers to channel partners that can better serve them and be more efficient. So the majority of the workforce reductions are expected to be complete in 2025, with some of them moving into 2026 subject to local laws. But maybe I'll pause there and let Bill give you a little bit more color on some of the numbers.
William Grogan: Yes. And just to level set everyone, for those who didn't see it. As we highlighted in our 8-K last week, we expect to incur total pretax charges of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We incurred some initial costs in Q4, but the bulk of the remaining expense will be realized in 2025 and early '26. We expect to realize about $130 million of net benefits for the program over the next two years, with about $75 million of the benefit coming in 2025. Timing of the benefits will be more back half weighted as we work through the labor negotiations and different processes around the globe, as Matthew mentioned. So I think of it as kind of 30% first half, 70% second half. Again, these actions are going to impact all of our segments and corporate functions with Water Infrastructure and Applied Water having the two largest impacts in Europe, probably the most impacted region. The plan impacts a little bit less than 10% of our workforce and is mostly concentrated in SG&A.
Deane Dray: Great. I appreciate all those details. That's a big help. And then the second question unrelated, just given the administration change, there's some anxiety about potential rollbacks of PFAS. We saw a halt of industrial PFAS test that -- just what's your expectation here? I realize PFAS is not in your framework. That was made very clear at your Analyst Day. But just the understanding on -- and how -- what might be done differently from the industrial side versus drinking water side, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Matthew Pine: Yes, Deane, to your point, I'll just echo, we didn't have any PFAS regulatory impact in our guide or in the LRP for municipal or industrial. And industrial is the one that was still kind of a draft rule. And that specific draft rule, and I think you mentioned this recently in a note, Deane, was dropped with the Trump executive order to pause all regulations. And it was -- I think it was aimed largely at the chemical industry and really designed to set an affluent limitation or guideline for PFAS chemical manufacturers. So I would say that this has no impact on the drinking water regulation when that rule went final last year. And maybe a comment I would make, I'd say Lee Eldon recently stated in his confirmation testimony for EPA -- Head of EPA, that he would be an advocate for PFAS cleanup. So it will be kind of a wait and see when it comes to the industrial side, but we don't see any rollback of the municipal side. And I think that Trump administration is, as a lot of people know, were the ones that initially started the PFAS regulation for municipal drinking water in the first term. So in general, we're still bullish on PFAS. We know that the timing is going to push out. But states, as we've talked about in the past, have taken action of their own. And then specifically on the industrial side, Deane, we've seen a few states, specifically Georgia, recently set standards for industrial affluent. So it will be a little bit of a tailwind from a state-by-state basis. But from a federal perspective, the industrial side will probably push out, but the muni side is still tracking.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Halloran: Good morning everyone. So first on the MCS side, maybe just talk through how you think about the margin progression through the year? I know you said sequentially improved through the year. What are we thinking for an exit rate or an approximate exit rate all else equal once mix normalizes and given all the restructuring things you're doing? And then on a related basis, maybe just talk through what you expect to see in the end markets through the year that give you confidence in that high single-digit margin? Because I know some of it's backlog, but I have to imagine some of it is what your customers are saying, front log, stuff like that, too.
Matthew Pine: Yes. Maybe I'll take the first shot. So if we start just with the Q4 margin performance, and first, just to highlight again, that's really related to the mix shift between water and energy. There's a couple -- a few small onetimers, but fundamentally, mix is the biggest driver of the year-over-year decline. We talked about that last quarter and highlighted that. Then I think we need to just talk about the adjustment period over the next couple of quarters as we do go from less water meter customer volume as they rephase their deployment schedules, continue to work with our partners and customers to get home access and labor scheduling nailed down. We've said that with one to two quarters. It's probably closer to three quarters, inclusive of Q4. And this is going to shift that balance of sale towards the energy meters that we saw in Q4 and expect that through the first half of the year. And then I just want to make sure, again, from the full year perspective, MCS margins was -- were phenomenal, right? They were up 370 basis points last year. And some of those core elements we will see next year as they continue to capture strong price. The teams continues to drive solid productivity. Obviously, with these restructuring actions, they're going to get some benefit. Mix is probably the only thing that's an outlier relative to our short-term margin expansion journey for them. We said, I think Q4 is probably the bottom. That will sequentially's improve through the year as mix normalizes, some of the impact from the restructuring starts to take hold. And for the full year, we will see expanded margins. First half, there's a little bit of contraction, but then we'll see significant expansion in the back half with net-net, 2025 will exit at a higher rate than '24.
Michael Halloran: And then the second part of the question was just help me get to the high single-digit organic guide, and what that means from a customer perspective?
Matthew Pine: Yes. So overall demand is still healthy, right? The team has a very strong pipeline. We've won a couple of verbal awards that we haven't just received in the backlog yet. Really, Europe is the only place we've seen some softness. But the fundamentals across the majority of the business are still solid. We're kind of a long way to go on the AMI adoption curve. Really the short-term noise is just along this project rephasing. And just to remind everyone, right, the North American water business over the last two years has grown 30% per year, which is absolutely phenomenal relative to our peer set in that market. So as we look to next year, again, the energy meters relative to the refresh that they're going through, will grow at a significant rate, close to 40%. It's the refresh cycle, and we've had a couple of projects in backlog that we have full visibility to with defined ship dates. And then on the water side, relative to the backlog phasing that we have and in line of sight customer projects that we've won have yet to just get into our backlog, we're pretty confident in the ramp that we'll see there in the back half. But again, on the water meter side, kind of low single digits, and energy being the significant driver of growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back and follow up on some of Deane's questions on the restructuring. I think you said $75 million that you'll realize in benefits in 2025, which is about 90 basis points of margin expansion and kind of accounts for all of the margin expansion you're expecting at the midpoint of the guidance for 2025. You do get some organic growth, there should be some simplification benefits, there should be some pricing and other productivity benefits. Maybe you can just help fill in the gaps there on what the headwinds are that doesn't actually have margins up a little bit more with the benefit of this restructuring?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Yes. No. The simple walk, Nate, here is, if we look at roughly the midpoint of 100 basis points, our productivity and price are more than offsetting all of our material and labor inflation as well as our continued investment in the business, giving us about 50 basis points of expansion with that group. Then to your point, we're getting the benefit of our restructuring actions and the balance of the Evoqua synergies gives us about another 125 basis points of favorability. So about 175 basis points there. But then the biggest piece in the math is really the negative mix within MCS that puts about 75 basis points of pressure, again, due to that energy and water mix shift, netting out to the 100 basis points.
Nathan Jones: That's helpful. And I guess then you're still pretty early in the 80/20 rollout. And I wouldn't imagine that this restructuring program gets you to the end state that you're looking for. Are you able to comment on the potential to see opportunities to do some more restructuring in '26 or '27 or whenever you get through this and start looking at the next round?
Matthew Pine: Yes. I would say that the announcement in the 8-K does roll into 2026. So some of that's baked into that initial announcement in the 8-K. I would just maybe highlight that part of this 8-K was focused on our operating structure, and part of it was 80/20. And it was really driven by the kind of first wave of 80/20 with predominantly focused on our legacy Xylem business with a lot more focus on Applied Water and Water Infrastructure and a little bit on M&CS. So, obviously, we didn't get through the entire segment. I think we talked about having about 40% of the business kind of exiting '24 fully through the tool. And through the first quarter of this year, we'll have about 70% of the business. So absolutely, there's going to be more opportunity as we continue to really optimize the portfolio and the customer line simplification. So this is a journey. It's -- we need to move from a -- we talked about a transformation. It's really developing a transformative mindset in the business. And that means you're kind of never done optimizing. So for sure, there'll be more things that we look at over time.
Operator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone. Matter, Bill, can you give a little more color into the bookings environment that you're seeing and maybe some of the cyclical headwinds emerging markets and/or in Applied Water that you've seen and when they might turn orders up 7%, obviously seemed solid in Q4. Would you expect that kind of order trend into '25. And it looks like you're predicting a modest turn in Applied Water, can you talk about the visibility into that?
William Grogan: Yes. I think orders in the fourth quarter overall for all of our segments was extremely strong. So we we continue to be pleased with the commercial momentum we have across all of our businesses. Specific to Applied Water, they'll be back to growth in 2025. We do see momentum across the developed markets, particularly in the US. They continue to have some larger project wins that we realized through 2024, a lot of those will be coming online. And then just a general recovery in a lot of their end markets after a fairly challenging year. We did talk about growth will be offset a little bit by some of our 80/20 actions exiting unprofitable businesses as we really look for Applied Water to simplify their product portfolio and geographic presence, to your point, they have seen some challenges in emerging markets, really where do we want to leverage our technology and specific applications to win in those markets. And double down on our core here in our developed markets with our largest customers through some new technologies and better overall operating performance. So Applied Water is back to growth with a little bit of pressure from some of the 80/20 actions. But even on the 80/20 side, I think the incremental pricing they're getting from that tool set is really positive. So bottom line performance for them in 2025 will be really strong.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then it appears Xylem passed on some large water assets that were available for a while, but you do have a very strong balance sheet. So how are you thinking about M&A right now versus other methods of deployment repurchases? How should we think about ultimately what happens here? And obviously, you talked about the majority of ownership in Idrica. What does that mean for you moving forward?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Thanks, Andy. First, I just want to say how proud I am of the team's execution on the integration of Evoqua. I don't want to skip over that. I mean that was a big transaction, and we've delivered 18 months early in our cost synergies. So -- we built a lot of muscle and actually that muscle has translated well into our operating model transformation. We formed a transformation management office, largely for some of that team that did of local integration in Xylem. Andy, as we laid out in Investor Day, we want to be more consistent deployers of capital and helping to move us to the mid-teens EPS over the long-range plan. we talked about, we'd be optimizing the portfolio, whether that divestitures or just exits across business lines through 80/20 that are underperforming or no longer fit. One thing I'd highlight, and I might have mentioned this on the last call, that we put in place a very strong kind of acquisition committee process, and it's a much more strong bottoms-up process to drive more consistency and help us gain momentum. Obviously, we want to deploy capital obviously to our core. But second to that, we want to do accretive M&A. And we'll do opportunistic share buybacks if needed. But really, we want to be consistent deployers of capital. And hopefully, you're starting to see this as we exit 2024. And, to your earlier point, we're going to remain disciplined. And we're also going to be very aligned to our strategy and the value mapping work that we completed last year. So that's a little bit on capital deployment. And in terms of Idrica, we signed that -- signed and closed that in Q4 and moved our ownership to majority so we could more deeply integrate and rationalize the R&D investments of that joint venture with the legacy Xylem business. And quite frankly, leverage the platform across is a standard for Xylem to help us be more efficient. We have a lot of confidence in the platform and its ability to solve a lot of our customers' biggest pain point, which is trying to manage their data in application management. So I think that's a really good fit for us and a lot of good momentum in that acquisition.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys. Guys, I wasn't -- maybe I missed it. Is it fair to assume that the 80/20 headwind is about two points. Does that sound kind of ballpark? If you said it, I apologize, I didn't hear it.
Matthew Pine: No, no, we didn't. It's a little less than two points.
Scott Davis: Okay. And then just to take a step backwards, Matthew, when you joined on-time deliveries was kind of -- went through kind of a dark day, had to get to the other side of it. Where do you stand now on on-time deliveries? And maybe just some context to where do you stand now and perhaps where do you think you'll be in a year assuming you're not where you want to be now?
Matthew Pine: A great question. I just did a tour of North American factories a couple of weeks ago. And the two biggest thing I focus on, Scott, is quality and on-time performance. If you do those things right, and you have a great product with a fair price, you're going to win. And so we have made improvements in on-time performance. It's only going to get better through 80/20 because 80/20 will help us simplify our factories and have better flow and this better execution. We've already started to see it happen. We don't really get into quoting our on-time delivery, but I would just say that we probably, over the course of 2024, made a 500-basis-point improvement. And we have about, I would say, 500 to 700 basis points more to go to hit our kind of what I would call our entitlement or where we think best in class is. And if I look at our road map and our KPIs, we will come close to that this year. So we're keenly focused on that metric.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess one on the free cash flow. I know you're talking about this kind of being a little bit of a softer year. If I back into it, I mean, you've given us conversion targets in the past, I think, this year, implying around maybe 70% to 80%. So one, is that kind of a fair range to be thinking about? And then, two, what are some of the biggest factors here in '25 that you have visibility or confidence around will revert back in 2016? And is the target for '26 to be back to that 100% or higher free cash flow conversion?
William Grogan: Yes. I think, again, a little bit in the prepared remarks is really the largest negative factor is the cost of the restructuring program weighing on overall cash flows. We highlighted a little bit too. We've got some larger build on operates that's going to -- that will aid our top line and bottom line, but some upfront capital associated with them will impact. And then lastly, as we continue to improve our systems across the organization, some incremental investments to support that activity. Those are the three biggest things with the restructuring being the 80 million out of that.
Brian Lee: All right. Fair enough. And then I know you mentioned also in the prepared remarks, you're not factoring in any tariff impacts, that you're not expecting anything at the moment. Just to kind of level set us, none of the dust to settle here, obviously, but just as we think about your potential exposures, can you sort of walk us through some of your key kind of geos where you do have either supply chain or procurement exposure to some of the regions that are being talked about in terms of being potentially impacted by tariffs?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I'll start this off and turn it over to Bill to get into some of the numbers. But we don't believe that tariffs will have a material impact on our full year results for 2025. Our teams were ready, sprung into action yesterday to help offset the tariff increases. And we were out, obviously, with our China increase. We had to pull back on a couple of others that we thought will be going out yesterday that we were quick to take action, and we have taken action with regards to China. And we're -- obviously, we're moving and mobilizing our supply chain where possible to make sure that we're taking advantage of second sources. We spent a lot of time over the past two to three years on diversifying our supply chain, especially as we look at Asia. And then lastly, it's making sure that we're buttoned up on discretionary costs to mitigate any impact. So the teams are ready, and we've taken some action with regard to the China tariff. We'll continue to monitor the situation over the next 30 days and see what comes of Canada and Mexico, and obviously monitor our customers and our channel partners and just try to understand how this may or may not impact their order pattern. So that's something that we'll keep a close watch on. So maybe I'll pause there and turn it over to Bill to give a little color on the numbers.
William Grogan: So if we look at, let's just call it, the proposed tariffs for Canada and for Mexico and the enacted for China, they impact about 5% of our material cost as a percentage of sales. The Canadian tariff impact is really negligible. And to Matthew's point, the team has done a phenomenal job post COVID, lessening our dependency on supply from China and the supply chain there is really just for in-country production. The Mexico tariff is the 80 for us and primarily impacts MCS and Applied Water. Again, both segments are taking the appropriate actions to mitigate the impact on our customers and on our bottom line. So I think we're well positioned. It's obviously a very fluid situation. So we're keeping a close eye on it and taking any and every action necessary to mitigate the impact.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to check on your Water Solutions has been a really good quarter. I'm just curious what the trends are in that segment. I know that can be pretty lumpy, but what do you see going into the first portion of the year? And then you had a couple of months to digest President Trump and his new EPA pick. And obviously, treatment can be influenced by some policy there. Could you just talk about specifically what you guys think of this new administration how it pertains to Water Solutions? Yes. Maybe I'll hit WSS first. I mean Q4 was really the antithesis of Q3. The projects that customers are waffling on timing, you ended up starting or progressing a lot faster than we had anticipated. We knew there was a chance of this happening, but low enough probability, I didn't want to build it into the expectations for the quarter. Again, to your point, I think it's worth mentioning that we are seeing an increased demand for our outsourced water solutions and sometimes that can drive some lumpiness in WSS' performance where there's a revenue stream associated with the build out of the system before we get the long tail of recurring revenue. So as we build that business, can be quarter-to-quarter, some variations before things smooth out as that business builds over time. But going into next year, I think we're expecting another strong year from WSS as they continue to leverage synergies with the combined portfolio. Dewatering had a very strong year in 2024, and we look for that to continue next year. Again, the outsourced water projects, the funnel is extremely strong, and we have line of sight to some larger wins here later in the year. So I think we're excited about what -- that segment has only been in effect for one year, and the combination is really delivering some strong consistent performance. So maybe I'll turn it over to Matthew to talk about the regulatory environment.
Matthew Pine: Yes. So -- maybe I'll just start by saying we operate in a sector where there's, from my perspective, strong bipartisan consensus regarding the need for safe, clean, affordable water services. So on a number of issues, we see strong support on both sides of the aisle. We anticipate that water infrastructure funding will likely remain at kind of the historical norms. And we do checks obviously with the several utilities in the US., and we've confirmed continued OpEx and CapEx spending increases into 2025 to improve a significant aging infrastructure in the US. We'll stay close to our government affairs team, myself and some other key leaders were going to stay close to the incoming administration as they take their new positions, and we'll just keep a close eye to them. And we've had great relationships and with regard to Lee elan I mentioned earlier on Deane's question that water remains a key priority for him and the administration. And again, in his nomination hearing, he did talk about PFAS and the need to make that a top priority. So I'd say net-net, we're pretty positive on the new administration's focus on water and we'll continue to drive those relationships to make sure we understand it. Okay. We'll wrap it up there. Thanks for your questions, and thank you to everyone who joined today. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Xylem, all the best.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keith Buettner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Please go ahead, sir.
Keith Buettner: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's third quarter 2024 results and discuss the fourth quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of the website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, November 11, and will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to Slide 3. We have provided you with a summary of key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to the prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis, reflecting the change in segments as of the beginning of the year. For the purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you've seen in our press release earlier this morning, the team delivered very strong earnings in the quarter. In fact, I want to recognize the whole Xylem team for disciplined execution across the business. The result was record EBITDA margins and record earnings per share in the quarter. Operational discipline also delivered accelerated momentum in our integration of Evoqua. We're now well ahead of schedule and capturing the expected cost synergies ending the year above our run rate targets. Our profitability is also beginning to benefit from the work to optimize our portfolio and simplify our organization. All that work is in service of reducing Xylem's complexity in serving our customers better in addition to delivering systematic margin improvement in support of our long-term framework. The team showed great customer focus delivering healthy orders growth across all segments in the quarter. Organic orders were up high single-digits overall, with a book-to-bill greater than one, reflecting strong underlying demand in resilient end markets that continue to prefer our differentiated mission-critical solutions. Moderated revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by project timing pushouts in MCS and WSS, combined with tough compares versus prior year. Orders are up sharply in both of those segments, indicating healthy underlying demand and customer preference. Overall, end market demand continues to be resilient with a few pockets of softening in the short term. With good visibility through Q4, we're narrowing full year earnings guidance and maintaining the midpoint despite a slightly lower revenue expectation. Also in Q4, we expect to increase our stake in the Idrica joint venture, giving us a majority ownership position. As a reminder, Idrica is a global leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. The system powering the Xylem view platform at the heart of our intelligent solutions for utilities. Having been borne out of the utility operator itself, the platform has been deployed in more than 300 customers around the world. We took a minority stake last year and became the global distribution partner for the technology. Our teams continue to get traction with customers. And with this transaction, the business will be consolidated into Xylem's Measurement & Control Solutions segment. Now, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to get into the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill?
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q3 was a strong operational quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their focus and effort progressing on our organizational transformation. Productivity and pricing resulted in record-breaking quarterly EBITDA margin and earnings per share. The demand remains solid with our backlog reaching $5.3 billion, driven by notable growth in WSS and water infrastructure, offsetting continued progress executing the past-due backlog in MCS. Our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1 and orders were healthy, up 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by MCS and WSS. While orders remained strong, revenue growth moderated versus a challenging comparison of 10% growth in the same period last year. Q3 total and organic revenue grew at 1%, slightly below our expectations. The moderation came from project timing in MCS and WSS. The team's operational discipline delivered record quarterly EBITDA margin of 21.2% up 140 basis points from the prior year despite the modest top line growth. Productivity savings and pricing more than offset inflation, investments and mix, driving incrementals of approximately 130% on a consolidated basis. We also achieved a record EPS of $1.11, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 and marking a 12% increase over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains robust with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.6 times. Year-to-date free cash flow has increased by 27% from the prior year. The conversion rate of 79% was driven by higher net income, offset by increased CapEx and net working capital. Working capital efficiency in the quarter was impacted by timing of sales. Let's turn to Slide 6. In Measurement & Control Solutions, we continue to work down our pass-through backlog. Total MCS backlog now sits at roughly $1.9 billion, a 14% organic decrease from prior year, driven by smart metering conversion. Orders were strong at 12%, driven by smart metering and analytics demand. Revenue was up 11%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. This was below our expectations due to project timing, as we were able to ramp up production of past dues faster than our customers were able to schedule their deployments. We are seeing some pockets of softness in Europe and emerging markets, but overall demand is still healthy and the pipeline is strong, particularly for our AMI solutions in North America. We finished the quarter with robust EBITDA margins of 21.2%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year, with 53% incrementals. Year-over-year margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and volume, which more than offset inflation and investments. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 6% in the quarter, with strong demand across treatment and transport. Revenue increased 1%, driven by transport demand, slightly offset by treatment, which had a difficult comp given strong performance last year from legacy Evoqua's APT segment. EBITDA margin for Water Infrastructure was up 50 basis points. Productivity and price more than off inflation and mix, incrementals were strong at 45%. In Applied Water, orders were up 4% and book-to-bill was 1, reflecting a few large project wins, which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations, primarily driven by softness in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year but increased 110 basis points sequentially. Lower volumes, higher inflation and unfavorable mix were mostly offset by productivity savings and price. Rounding out the segments, Water Solutions and Services saw robust demand with orders increasing 11% driven by strength in outsourced water and in dewatering. Organic revenue was down 1% with strength in dewatering offset by declines in capital sales from treatment projects, primarily due to a difficult comp and project timing within the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin was strong at 24.7%, up 200 basis points. Productivity and price offset inflation and volume declines. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for our updated full year and Q4 guidance. Given our year-to-date performance in both commercial and operational momentum, we are updating part of our full year guidance. Our revenue guide of $8.5 billion results in approximately 15% growth with organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. The Evoqua integration is going very well, and we are accelerating expected cost synergies to an exit run rate of $130 million in 2024. In light of our lower revenue expectations, we are confident about driving further margin expansion through operational productivity and our simplification efforts and are reiterating our EBITDA margin guidance of roughly 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, including our cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. We are narrowing EPS guidance to $4.22 to $4.24 from $4.18 to $4.28. Free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be at least 120% of net income. We do expect significant conversion in the fourth quarter. The full year outlook for two segments has changed with MCS now expected to grow in mid-teens versus our prior outlook of high teens and WSS now expected to grow low single digits versus our prior outlook of mid-single digits, both due to project delays impacting the second half. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenue growth to be roughly 2% to 3% on a reported and organic basis. We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $1.12 to $1.14. We have solid momentum and continue to have strong orders growth and anticipate healthy long-term demand across our divisions and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including election uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and tariffs, our overall outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. And we look to our simplification efforts and 80/20 implementations to not only help address any short-term challenges we may face but also be among the key drivers to our systematic margin improvement over time, supporting our long-term profitability framework. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Again, I'm proud of the team's strong results in the quarter. The risk orders growth demonstrate the team's customer focus and commercial momentum, alongside healthy demand for our solutions. The record profitability and margin expansion only comes from real focus on execution, which shows up in the same discipline the team showed to get us out ahead of our integration synergy targets. That accelerated integration in turn, enables us to put greater attention on portfolio optimization and capital deployment. The team's performance is what gives us confidence to narrow the guide as we expect to continue delivering that same level of execution on continuing demand. At the start of the call, I referenced some of the benefits we're beginning to see coming through our work on simplification. Reaffirming what we said at Investor Day in May, we're building momentum and it's showing up in our results. We're doing the meaningful work on our operating model across culture, process and structure, and we're already beginning to see the benefits. I look forward to sharing more about that in coming quarters as the work continues. Lastly, I want to share a change in the executive team, which happened after the quarter's close. You may have seen our announcement appointing Meredith Emerick to lead the Applied Water segment succeeding Franz Cerwinka. I want to thank Franz for his many contributions, not only to Applied Water, but also in his prior leadership of emerging markets. He’ll stay on as a senior adviser to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain the momentum of the segment's 80/20 work. Meredith and I first cross path at Carrier, her experience there and at Mitsubishi has given her deep experience in engineered solutions for commercial and residential buildings across a range of industrial end markets. She has a track record of high-performance P&L leadership and emphasis on profitable growth, operational discipline and customer centricity. We welcome Meredith to the Xylem's leadership team just last week, and I know you value getting to know her in the coming months. With that, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with just like the tone of business, the timing of decision-making approval process. We're hearing lots of industrial companies talking about those kinds of delays, slower decision-making. And then very specifically, how did this impact WSS, you referenced timing of capital projects. When do you see these outsourcing contracts start to get released and what kind of time frame, we'll start there. Thanks.
Matthew Pine: Okay. Thanks for the question, Deane. I'll start out, and I'll turn it over to Bill to get into the details. But just to provide some high-level perspective, before I do hand it over to Bill, Q3 is really a tale of what I would call two stories. Utilities end market for us was up 10%, so up double-digits, but although a bit less than we anticipated primarily with M&CS. On the other side of that is the industrial and commercial building end markets were down 4%, respectively. And those are largely due to project pushouts, and I would say some slight softening in our mining verticals internationally. That's where we saw a little bit of softening. But in general, as you see from our orders in the quarter, very strong in general across all the end markets. Maybe I'll just pause there, and maybe turn it over to Bill to get into some detail on WSS.
Bill Grogan: So yeah, the difference between our expectations coming in the quarter for WSS is really, again, just the timing of some of these projects that pushed out in the back half. These aren't cancellations. These are really delays. Some due to just elongated commercial negotiations, Deane, some of these are really complicated outsourced water projects or project delays that we are a component of, and then just some election and interest rate uncertainty giving a little bit of pause in the industrial markets for big projects. We continue to have differentiated technology to support these projects and water is a critical component of the application. So we're highly confident that this is just timing. We have the orders. It's just when do they start to be put in place. Our expectation is a little bit of softness continuing in the fourth quarter and then pick back up again at the beginning of the year based upon all the indicators we're getting. And again, maybe the other thing I would mention is that we had really tough compare in this business as well for the quarter. Last year, pro forma growth was 10% on an organic basis. And we talked last quarter; the 12% growth just put some pressure on the pacing that we experienced in the back half. So fundamentals are still strong, high demand for our unique solutions. A little bit of delay here as we exit the year, but we're confident that we're back positive in the fourth quarter and then ramping in Q1.
Deane Dray: All right. That was really helpful and broadly consistent with the slower decision-making that we've seen elsewhere. And then just as a follow-up question, can we put the spotlight on MCS. There's been some anxiety, if I can phrase it that way, about the ramp down in the business as you work off past due backlog and you go from some pretty heavy 20% growth down to what we're expecting to be a normalized high single digits, which is still healthy, but just give us where are you in that process? I see the $1.9 billion backlog, how much of that is actually past due. And then meanwhile, you've had really strong orders this quarter. So what is that expectation about the ramp down to high single digits? Thanks.
Matthew Pine: I'll start it out Deane and just a few comments, maybe specific to Q3 and some of the trends, and then Bill can get into some color in the read-through as we head into 2025. We're now out of the woods on production constraints that we've been talking about for the past couple of years. They've come down very quickly. Our lead times have moved from 52 weeks to five weeks over the course of this year and we're able to ramp up production of the past dues faster than customers were able to reschedule their deployments. That's really the bottom line. And I really want to be clear on this point. This is not a demand issue like a typical destocking. This is a rescheduling of deployments that will happen over the coming months. The demand is there. It's just getting the deployments rescheduled to catch up with the shipments. Really, the market relative to AMI is still underpenetrated, it's less than 50%. Our funnel is up significantly year-over-year, up over 25%. And we're still winning currently out in the marketplace above our current market share. So there's a lot of positives here, a little bit of timing, and I'll let Bill kind of walk you through a little bit more color on that timing.
Bill Grogan: Yeah, Dean, I think we're likely to see this adjustment period last for the next quarter or two as our partners work to align customer home access and the labor schedule needed to nail down the deployment timing. The bottleneck shifted kind of from our production into the channel. So it will take a little bit of time to resolve. We do expect high single-digit growth here in the fourth quarter for that business, but the potential continuation of the rephasing into the first part of next year. But our expectations at this point is for MCS still to be within that high single-digit framework for the year. Just that as we talk about the normalization, and we've had questions just on the order patterns, and just want to remind everyone that historical norm for MCS is book-to-bill of about one, and then we'd have kind of backlog of about 60% of the next year's sales. So we expect to continue to bleed our backlog into the first part of 2025 and then start to be book-to-bill positive as we exit the year and just as they normalize to their historical patterns.
Deane Dray: Great. That’s really helpful. And not a question, just to shout out. That was a big free cash flow quarter. So congrats to the team.
Bill Grogan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning everyone.
Matthew Pine: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So can we just put a finer point on that MCS then? Because the backlog bleed this year, I know that you're going to continue to execute against the past due backlog next year, you still have very strong orders. Could you just frame what that impact looks like, whether it's how the past due backlog helped the growth rate this year? And is next year a more normal growth year for the MCS segment? Or is there an overhang from the execution against the past due backlog. I know demand is still good. It sounds like the quoting bidding is still where you want it to be but just want to make sure I think those two variables.
Bill Grogan: Yeah. No, for the all intents and purposes, we're pretty well caught up on our past due for the most part. And we're back to our normalized past due levels. So we've been able to progress on that kind of ahead of pace. And again, I think as Matthew highlighted, that's a little bit of the disconnect that was created. Relative to our expectations for next year, like I said, I still think the smart metering business will be at its long-term framework. There might be some timing first half, second half but we expect positive results from that business.
Mike Halloran: Thank you for that. So then kind of on where you are from an internal processes perspective, maybe just an update on where you sit in the segmentation, identification journey of the portfolio? And when you start basically, how broad through that portfolio have we gotten now? And when do we start seeing kind of that push pull of some pressure on revenue as you start executing against some of the areas of the business that maybe don't fit and then seeing the margin benefit from some of those actions. Has that started yet? Or is this more of a next year thing and just kind of an update holistically on the timing there?
Matthew Pine: Yeah, it's more of a next year thing. We're going to exit, I would say, Mike, in a really good position. 2024 was a year of really deep dive analytics and kind of zeroing up the business and we're through that process. And as we exit 2024, a lot of the implementations happening in Q4, and then we'll start to see results in Q1 through the course of next year. So that's going to really help from a bottom line perspective. We did talk about 80/20 specifically, and there are some other things we're working on, whether that's spans or layers or as we think about our structure, next year that will also help. But I think in the first part of our cycle that we talked about at Investor Day, there will be probably a little bit more pressure on the top line, but we're still very committed to the outlook that we gave 4% to 6% over the course of the next three years.
Mike Halloran : So if I just put those together then, you're basically saying if you take the order patterns, the timing of all these projects, what you're executing on, really no change in the thought process as you work through next year. Next year should look good but normal relative to how you frame things.
Matthew Pine: Yes.
Mike Halloran : Okay. Thanks everyone. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Matt and Bill.
Matthew Pine: Good morning.
Scott Davis: Guys, you mentioned price in each of the segments as being a positive. Is that -- should we think about that as price that in the backlog that's coming out that was priced appropriately and obviously higher. But -- or are you still able to get incremental price and new business today?
Matthew Pine: Yes. I think it's a little bit of both. Scott, as we talked in our Investor Day, we're really targeting to be price/cost positive, which we've been able to continue to do strong results again here in the third quarter with price cost spread of about 60 basis points, we continue to see some of the businesses show significant strength with that. MCS being the largest contributor on price cost with it being greater than 200 basis points. We've seen year-to-date price a little bit ahead of what we expected coming into the year. Some of that is the targeted efforts and results from our 80/20 implementation and then just different parts of the business, leveraging their differentiation to capture more value within their market. So that is a lever we think we're going to continue to try to expand upon as we progress. One, on just the process of pricing internally and how we execute on that and try to eliminate leakage and then the other half on the strategic pricing side. So, we think there's opportunities on both for us to be a continued tailwind as we get into next year and beyond.
Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then in the prepared remarks, you commented on pockets of Europe and Asia just being a little bit weaker. I imagine that I think China is probably at least half of your Asia business so that I would imagine that explicitly references China. But can you just a little clarity there. Is it -- are there similar reasons for pushbacks like Deane was saying or the -- I know there's been a fair amount of stimulus in China, but it doesn't seem to have helped any companies yet. Is there a little -- maybe just a little color on what your guys on the ground are saying that is this something that it leaks into 2025 or more of a shorter-term hiccup?
Matthew Pine: So I'll make some comments on China, too. And I think probably the one other area of emerging markets, that's a little bit softer for us is the Middle East and then some specific applications within Africa. But just -- from a China perspective, just to remind everyone, it's about mid-single digits of our total revenue, largely tied to public utilities within water infrastructure, that's about half of our business. There in China is the water infrastructure piece. Q3 orders did decline in kind of the mid-teens and revenue was down low single digits, and that has been decelerating throughout the year. We talked about our expectations for China being roughly flattish, and now it's gone slightly negative. The underlying demand there, especially with municipalities is still strong. But I do think the economic environment there remains difficult, right? Tight liquidity, especially for the municipalities is causing kind of projects to continue to delay and defer the real estate issues that they're having is adversely impacting our building services end market. So, we're keeping a close eye on China. The teams are focused, making their own lock, looking at areas where we have differentiated technology to address some specific opportunity set. But then how do we manage costs and infrastructure on the lower volumes to make sure we're focused on margins. So, I think it's probably something that lingers here in the short term. But China, overall, we'll get back to be a big part of our growth story at some point in time.
Scott Davis: Okay, good color. Thank you. Best of luck guys, I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones at Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey good morning Nick.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to start on Idrica. You talked about acquiring a majority stake in that business. So, a couple of questions around that. First, any kind of color you can give us on the financial metrics around that valuation and the impact to your financial statements from consolidating it? And then second, on Idrica, how does that change the outlook, the trajectory, your plans for that business now that you have control of it?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Maybe I'll start us out on the second part, and I'll let Bill get into the financials. We signed an agreement the other day on October 29th, and we plan to close on the business in December, Nate. I would say we took the majority position so we could more deeply integrate and rationalize our R&D investments because there's a lot of overlap and so we wanted to get that synergy and to really integrate it appropriately, we felt like we needed to have a majority share. And then also, we're going to leverage the platform in the user interface and standardize that across Xylem. So, it's going to have a tremendous impact on our ability to scale across the business and really drive synergies and efficiencies. We have a lot of confidence in the platform. It's the -- when we talk to utilities that was out and about in Australia and the U.K. over the past months and their biggest pain point is data management, application management, and we see a lot of interest in this, and we've got a huge funnel, and we're starting to win some big orders. So, strong -- again, strong traction. Orders are balanced across the globe. And I think the last thing I would say, the pull-through on the core business of Xylem has also been a pleasant surprise. So, maybe I'll pause there and then let Bill get into the little bit of financials.
Bill Grogan: Yes, Nathan, I mean, nothing material for this year. We don't plan on closing until late in December. So, it will be meaningful to our economics this year and then we'll lay out kind of more specifics as we guide next year and what the impact will be.
Nathan Jones: Okay. I guess my follow-up then Applied Water. I mean revenue comparisons there have been negative for a few quarters now, but the order comparisons or order growth has been positive for four of the last five quarters. Do you guys think that we've kind of seen the bottom in Applied Water and an expectation for return to growth going forward in 2025?
Matthew Pine: I think so. Again, right, AW has been our most challenged business here over the last couple of quarters. It is our shortest cycle most cyclical group and it has played out kind of in line with our expectations on that low single-digit decline. We're probably closer to the bottom from where we expect growth rates to be in Q4. That team has done a really good job leveraging their technology and their advantage in several markets to win some larger projects that will help support our expected recovery in 2025. So we're not giving a specific guide now, but I think there is some momentum behind that business that gives us a more positive view going into next year. And, obviously again they’ve been on our longest journey with 80-20. So they're finalizing some business decisions there that might put a little bit of pressure. But outside that, the fundamentals, I think, to your point, are going to get better here over the next couple of quarters.
Nathan Jones: Awesome. Thanks very much for taking my question.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead. Hello, Damian, is your line on hold or on mute perhaps? All right. Looks like we don't have Mr. Karas on the line. So we'll move on to our next question from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning all.
Bill Grogan: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: I wanted to come back to the dewatering. So you noted some strength in the quarter. I know in years past, the dewatering business has picked up a little bit of incremental business from various storm events. Was there any discernible impact in the quarter positive or negative? And then are you contemplating any pickup from restoration efforts into the fourth quarter?
Bill Grogan: Yeah. I would say it's on the fringe. We do go to market through channel partners in some of our territories, and that would determine maybe the level of impact. Maybe if I just elevate from there, the business in general was very strong in Q3, although we did see some pockets of softening in specific mining applications. But holistically for that business, it was pretty resilient. But in terms of the storm impact, it's not a huge impact for us and probably just on the fringes.
Brett Linzey: Okay, got it. And I just wanted to come back to the margin progression. So you're executing well in a tough macro, but the 4Q year-over-year does step down versus Q3 in the first half. I guess, is this just a function of the lower revenue expectation or mix? Or is there some cost to achieve some of the 80-20 benefits or resource commitments that might be a drag and won't repeat next year?
Matthew Pine: No, I think it's really just a portfolio mix as water infrastructure increases at a little bit lower margin rate, they have a seasonal increase in Q4. And then we've talked just about MCS having a little bit more of energy exposure versus water in the back half would be the two main things I'd point to.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.
Matthew Pine: I failed to mention with the question on Idrica, I was going to mention that our thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Spain, our colleagues that are there for Xylem as well as our Idrica partners. We've reached out everyone safe and healthy, but we need to keep that country and our thoughts and prayers are going through some devastating impacts from recent flooding. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for everybody that's joined the call, and we appreciate your interest in Xylem. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xylem's Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2024 results, and discuss the third quarter and full-year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight August 6. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis reflecting the change in segment as of the beginning of the year. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now, please turn to slide four, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to report the achievements of the Xylem team in the second quarter. As you've seen in this morning's release, the team delivered another very strong quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. With high single-digit organic growth reflecting gains in both volume and price, the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points. And with that outperformance, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 11%. The story of the second quarter is similar to Q1. On the demand side, our largest markets continue to be resilient. Internally, our outperformance is driven by increasingly disciplined operational execution by the team. This kind of performance momentum is only possible when the whole team is engaged in line to make a difference. And I want to say a big thank you to the whole Xylem team for the dedication and drive they've demonstrated through the first-half of the year. While there were a lot of highlights across the team, I particularly want to mention the standout performance in Measurement & Control Solutions. MCS segment revenue was up 26%, and EBITDA margins are up 700 basis points versus this time last year. The team is doing an outstanding job. Our first-half performance is a reflection of the value creation direction we set early in the year and discussed at Xylem's Investor Day, in May. That direction includes both resilient above-market growth and accelerated margin expansion. It's gratifying to see the kind of momentum reflected in our quarterly performance. In addition, our simplification initiatives in our work on 80/20 are progressing well, and are set to pay off beginning in 2025. Turning to the integration of Evoqua, in late May, we passed the one-year anniversary of our combination with Evoqua. The combination continues to reveal its value. Cost synergies are well on track, and the team is looking to accelerate our pace wherever possible. And our commercial teams are successfully taking Xylem's combined capabilities to the many customers who will benefit from our integrated solutions, both in utility and industrial end markets. With Evoqua integration on track, strong momentum from the first-half, resilient demand, and the team's increasing operational commercial discipline, we're raising our full-year guide for both revenue and margin, increasing our EPS guidance $0.06 from the prior midpoint. In a moment I'll provide an update on our high-impact culture and our leadership alignment, and also on our industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals, but first I'm going to turn it over to Bill to double-click on the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill?
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. Q2 was another great quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their amazing work. We outperformed against our guide across revenue, margin, and earnings per share. We continue to see resilient demand, and our backlog is at $5.2 billion, a modest decline from prior year as we execute on MCS past due backlog. Book-to-bill was approximately one, supported by strength in water infrastructure, while organic orders were down 1% in the quarter driven by project timing within MCS and WSS. Total revenues grew 26%, and organic revenue rose 9%, exceeding our guidance on a healthy combination of volume and price. Outperformance was led by MCS and WSS, as we saw growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 20.8%, up 170 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume and price more than offsetting inflation, investments, and mix. This reflects incrementals of 28% on a consolidated basis, and 50% on a pro forma basis. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.09, above the high end of our guidance by $0.04 and up 11% over the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.7 times. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 200% versus the prior year. And conversion of 62% is strong given seasonality. This year-over-year improvement was driven by higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx. And, we continue to benefit from improved working capital efficiency. Please turn to slide six. Measurement and Control Solutions had another great quarter, and again, exceeded our expectations. MCS revenue is up 26% driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. However, due to project timing orders were down 18% and book-to-bill came in under 1. We worked down past to backlog. And total backlog for MCS now sits at roughly $2 billion, A 12% organic decrease from prior year. We finished the quarter with impressive EBITDA margins of 23.4%, up 700 basis points versus the prior year and up 70 bps sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by volume, price, productivity, and favorable mix, more than offsetting inflation. As a reminder, we continue to expect a margin headwind from mix in the second-half as energy meters account for a larger portion of our sales. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up strong, 8% in the quarter, led by robust treatment demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 22% and organic growth of 7%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was down 60 basis points with roughly 40% pro forma incrementals. This decline was driven by inflation and acquisition, but was offset partially by productivity, volume, and price. Without the impact of acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 40 basis points for the quarter. In Applied Water, orders were up 5% and book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4% in line with our expectations lapping strong comps and 12% growth in the second quarter of last year. Decline was primarily driven by softness in developed markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 200 basis points year over year, but increased 100 basis points sequentially. Higher inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by productivity savings. Closing the segments with Water Solutions and Services, orders declined 1% organically driven by timing of large capital projects, offset by strength in the watering. Organic revenue was up 12% with healthy growth across most of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 23.8%. Up 60 basis points and driven by volume, productivity, and price. Offset in part by unfavorable mix and inflation. Two quarters in re-segmentation, we continue to see synergy momentum and benefits for our customers in combining our service-based offerings. Now, let's turn to slide seven for updated full-year and Q3 guidance. Given our first-half outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full-year guide. We are increasing our revenue guide by approximately $50 million, up from $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional 0.5 point of growth at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at approximately 16% and organic revenue growth at 5% to 6%. The integration is going smoothly and we continue to expect $100 million of exist run rate cost synergies in 2024 with a potential to accelerate by yearend. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.18 to $4.28 reflects an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Free cash flow conversion for the year is now expected to be over 120% of net income. The full-year outlook at the segment level remains largely unchanged with the exception of MCS, which we now expect to grow at high teens during our first-half performance versus our previous outlook of low teens. For the quarter, we anticipate revenue growth will be 3% to 5% on a reported and organic basis. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields third quarter EPS of $1.07 to $1.12. Our diversified portfolio of mission-critical products and services positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. And we talked about our driving profitability through simplification efforts and our 80/20 implementations at the Investor Day in May. We are progressing well on those initiatives, and I want to reiterate our commitment to systematic margin improvement through operational excellence, supporting our long-term profitability framework. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including geopolitical, election uncertainty, and tariffs, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. With that, please turn to slide eight. And I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. I'd like to mention two events in the quarter that don't show up in the financial results but are fundamental to Xylem's success and impact. First, in June, just a few weeks after our Investor Day, we gathered Xylem's global leadership team in Washington, D.C. This was the first time we had our top 150 executives in one room, spanning legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua. It was an energizing two days of collaboration focused on the work of leadership alignment and culture. I've spoken before about culture as the fundamental how Xylem -- how we'll deliver stronger execution of our strategy? How we'll realize our aspirations? How we'll create our next chapter of Xylem's impact. You can see in our second quarter results that the team is already working well and winning. What our Leadership Summit reinforced was how much more value creation potential we have ahead of us, with an aligned team and a high-impact culture. It was fantastic to see the team so engaged by the opportunities ahead of us. Last quarter also saw the publication of our annual sustainability report. We're very pleased to be tracking well towards our 2025 goals, but we took the opportunity presented by this year's report to set out our aspirations beyond 2025. We're raising the bar again by setting 2030 sustainability goals in three strategic areas. The first is decarbonization, reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and enabling our customers to decarbonize. Secondly is water stewardship aimed at reducing water demand, and finally, we'll provide access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for 80 million people. All three strengthen our customer relationships and increase our impact. Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note. This is Andrea van der Berg's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We're happy to announce that Andrea's taking on a new role within Xylem, and it's an exciting new opportunity for her. Over the years, so many of you have told me you deeply value Andrea's energy, accessibility, and professionalism, and I've benefited from her insightful counsel and positive encouragement in every circumstance. So, thank you, Andrea. Some of you have already met Keith Muller, who's taking the reins as our investor relations leader. Keith has had great impact as the Head of Finance in Water Solutions and Services segment, having joined us with the Evoqua combination more than a year ago. He brings deep knowledge of the business to his leadership of IR. And I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Keith and will find great value in his insights and perspectives. And with that, let's go to your questions.
Operator: And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we'll pause momentarily for the first question. And our first question today will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: Hey, I'll add my welcome to Keith, and wish Andrea best of luck and thanks for all your help.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Dean.
Deane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with 80/20, and I'll also make the observation you can see 80/20 at work in your conference call prepared remark and slides, and how much they've been slimmed down, and you get right to the point. So, really appreciate that. So, 80/20, I know you say the payoff is likely a 2025 of that, but we heard lots of specifics at the Analyst Day on the rollout. So, any updates you can share, I know we're still in the early innings, but you had Applied Water North America initially, MCS initially, any early actions, and what can you share? Thanks.
Matthew Pine: Yes. No, no, happy to give an update. So, again, the teams are progressing well. Like you said, we have three businesses in the thick of implementing the toolset. North American AWS and North American M&CS smart metering businesses, they're a few months ahead of global transport that kicked off in the second quarter. And we actually just had a kickoff for Applied Water, in Europe, that started on their journey last week. AWS and smart metering have gone through their initial quads and quartile analysis. And now they're working through the [need] (ph) of segmenting their businesses, how they want to support their ongoing customer base, and building their [zoom up] (ph) P&Ls really highlighting the appropriate level of resources they need to run those businesses. They've come out with some initial price increases. Again, those benefits take a little while to work their way through the backlog. So, again, no material short-term benefit, but we see a significant pickup at the end of this year, leading into 2025, where we'll see a more material P&L hit or pickup. The teams are focusing on communicating with their customers and how their toolset is going to impact them, really talking to their largest customers on how these changes will benefit them in the long-term, really improving the overall experience with Xylem as we bring new product innovation to them faster, improve our delivery and quality to them, so a lot of excitement around the toolset externally for their customer bases. So, progress continues. I think we're right on schedule. Again, confident in the value 80/20 is going to bring and provide for us over the next several years, really in line with what we highlighted in the additional impact the toolset is going to have in the framework we laid out back in Investor Day.
Deane Dray: That's a really helpful update, Bill. Thanks. And given that most of the operating results, so are either as expected or a little bit better. I could ask a broader industry question, if I could, just implications on the Supreme Court overruling the Chevron doctrine, I know we're still in the early innings, but any kind of high level thoughts what the ripple effects might be in PFAS remediation at the federal level, the super-fun timing? And look, I know it's not in your numbers, it's not in your three-year guide, but just the idea here is what might the implications be? And I can see that, at state level, that's where all the remediation efforts have been going in any way. And the states, like California, are not waiting for the federal government to lead the way. So, just from your perspective and insight, how do you think this plays out?
Matthew Pine: Thanks for your question, Deane. We didn't see this one coming. If you asked us three months ago, this was not on our radar. So, we're reacting to lots of different volatility out in the marketplace. But the Supreme Court striking this down, the Chevron doctrine, it does introduce some uncertainty in some regulations and federal laws, there's the risk of being challenged, much like the EPA's final rule on PFAS, to your point. Additionally beyond that, Deane, there's litigation ongoing already that's challenging EPA's cost estimates used to set the MCL level, the maximum contaminate level, that four parts per trillion, as you're aware. And it's only going to potentially push out what's already a long phasing timeline of three years to test and five years to mitigate PFAS. So, to your point, we think, ultimately, the states are going to fill in the gaps if the national PFAS regulation is reversed. We don't really anticipate that, but if it does you've got about 11 states today that have MCL, the maximum contaminate level for PFAS in drinking water already, even another 12 states that have some kind of PFAS regulation around guidance health or notification levels, things of that nature, and that's over half the U.S. population. So, while it may stumble a little bit out of the gates and there's going to be some challenges, that we're already seeing challenges in litigation, that's why we didn't bake it into our long-term framework. We just think it's too far out. But we stand ready to and well-positioned to partner with utilities, and we have partnered with utilities, as you know, and helping them manage this and other emerging contaminants. So, more to come, but that's kind of what we think.
Deane Dray: It's real helpful. Thank you.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey, morning, everyone. Thanks, Andrea.
Matthew Pine: Morning.
Andrea van der Berg: Thanks, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So, just level-setting some stuff here, if I look at -- obviously very healthy margins on the quarter, and Bill's earlier comment on the momentum there holds. But if you think about your demand commentary as well as how you're characterizing the second-half of the year, it doesn't feel like much has changed from a trend, thought process on how you're guiding the second-half of the year. Just want to clarify that and any thoughts around that?
Matthew Pine: Yes, Mike. No change or expectations for the second-half. Yes, I think it's playing out exactly how we thought when we gave our update last quarter. Yes, with the exception that we had some accelerated performance in M&CS, which drove us to take up our full-year guide, we increased our full-year revenue guidance up to 5% to 6% and some timing of capital projects in WSS that drove better results in the second quarter. Sequentially, Q3 looks a lot like Q2 from a dollars perspective, which is more challenging year-over-year comps really driving the lower implied organic growth rate. So, we're still confident, bullish in most of our end markets. The macro noise that we highlighted is there's things out there, but from our perspective, we don't see material impact or any signaling of expected slowdown for us. M&CS, there's still high demand for our smart metering products and our differentiated AMI network. Orders were down, but again, that's primarily just project timing. There's still a strong funnel of large deals in the U.S. and Europe and we had several wins recently, a really good one that leverages synergy sale with the [Adrica] (ph). So, the team continues to do an excellent job of finding new projects and winning new business. WSS, again, really strong growth, just really the timing of capital projects there, but they still have strong demand across the legacy ISS and the watering business. They had some orders lumpiness. Again, we had a huge build on operate project last quarter. We have a couple more of those in the funnel that could be realized in the orders here over the back-half of the year. So, really nothing there that is any concern, so bullish around kind of their high growth verticals. Water Infrastructure, again, really strong performance on healthy demand, high-single-digit orders with growth across all the regions, treatment was up over 20% with some large project wins. The Transport business is one of our most differentiated business, and continues to perform well. So, our developed markets and pretty much all our applications within WI are doing extremely well. AWS obviously is the one market that remains a little bit challenged. Again, it's our shortest cycle, most cyclical group of businesses. But what we've seen there has been pretty consistent with our expectations, kind of low-single-digit, second-half comps get a little bit easier, so they'll gradually get to a lower organic decline. And then some of the project wins that we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we'll start to get them back on the road to growth in 2025.
Mike Halloran: Super helpful. And then maybe some thoughts on how you think backlog tracks from here and what normal looks like once you work through the pass through backlog across a couple of segments, and how we think book-to-bill should track?
Matthew Pine: Yes. I would say backlog is still really strong. It declined slightly organically, that's primarily just us continue to work down the MCS past due backlog. That's a tough one to forecast just because of the lumpiness of some of the large projects within MCS and again just the new business opportunities within WSS on the build on operate. So, I think we'll bleed a little bit here as we progress the year, but still confident in kind of our long-term growth frameworks for the individual segments getting into 2025. So, I would say lumpiness probably gives us a little bit of caution to give you a specific number, but again, robust demand and outlook for most of our end markets.
Mike Halloran: And Bill, you mean bleed to a more normalized level because of the past due backlog normalization? Are you suggesting something different?
Bill Grogan: No, exactly. That's spot on.
Mike Halloran: Awesome, great. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.
Bill Grogan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning everybody and congrats Andrea, on your move. Hey, guys, you didn't talk at all about capital deployment, which is fine because you still have Evoqua coming in. But is there a certain tipping point where you get more confident being able to do deals? Are we close to that? Are we there? Just some commentary would be helpful.
Matthew Pine: Good question. Again, like you mentioned, Scott, our first priority is to focus on the integration of Evoqua. And I think you can see from the results that we're doing a great job on both the cost synergies, they're tracking well as well as the revenue synergies. We have, Scott, built a lot of muscle on M&A over the past 18 months with the planning of Evoqua, now the passing one year of execution. So, we've started to build that muscle in the organization, which is going to help us going forward. Maybe the other thing I'd just reiterate that I said at Investor Day is that we've also put in place what I would call a strong bottoms up process in our M&A kind of acquisition process to drive more consistent organic growth and deployment. And I think that's going to help us over the cycle. So, obviously, we just laid out the three year framework. It's not going to happen overnight, but I can tell you that we're very active and we have a very strong pipeline that we're managing. And it aligns well to the value mapping that we just finished up. So, again, we're going to continue to run those targets through our decision criteria, that strategic fit, financials has got to make sense. We're not going to do anything silly. And really to your point kind of organizational readiness, I think we're trending well, we've got good momentum and ready to execute our M&A pipeline. Some of it's just timing, but it is an important piece as we outlined at Investor Day to our EPS growth at mid-teens over the cycle. So, we're very active, but some of it's just timing and we're still in early innings.
Scott Davis: Okay. Good question or a good answer. Thank you. And guys, I don't I'm sure you don't want to give a lot of detail here, but you referenced the large project wins. I assume those are domestic. Are they related to mega projects? Can you give us a little bit of color on kind of the scope and size historically versus how you kind of think about what large looks like? I mean, there're so many big semi plants, just stuff out there of scope that we've never seen before that love to get a little color from you on those projects, if you can.
Matthew Pine: Yes, I think back in Investor Day, we talked about data centers that's starting to ramp up for us, and especially in our applied water business. But I think we're positioned uniquely to, Scott in the fact that we also move water through pumping, we treat it and then we also sense for it. So, as we're winning these kind of data centers, we can offer a more turnkey solution and we're kind of working at bottoms up as well as some of the actual providers that are building the data centers themselves. So, that's started to pick up some momentum. We had a nice win in applied water. We've had a couple actually kind of at the $7 million to $10 million range. And so, that's going well. Also, I'd say on the power transition, we highlighted a big win last quarter with green hydrogen. And so, the water needed for that over a 20 year contract is big. We've got some other ones that have not kind of fit within the quarter that are in the pipeline that we have got a lot of momentum around as well around power and we see more and more consistency in the semiconductor space with microelectronics and the need for clean water. And a lot of these places have water scarcity issues. And so, the water reuse is super important there. So, I would say that, some of these high growth verticals, we're seeing momentum in big projects. And we don't see that slowing, we see it only continuing and it will be a little lumpy within WSS specifically, but we see good momentum and a good pipeline.
Scott Davis: Okay. Thank you, and congrats on the first couple of quarters of the year here, well done. I'll pass it on.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I want to start off with some follow-up questions on MCS. Orders down in the quarter, I understand there's some lumpiness around that, but orders have been down have declined a little bit last couple of years, burning off some backlog in '23 and '24. Maybe you could just talk about the visibility into the order pipeline that you have to see that turnaround and start heading in the right direction to support growth. And with that, I know high-single-digits to long-term kind of guidance here, but you are burning a fairly significant amount of backlog down in 2024. Should we expect the 2025 growth to be a little bit lower than the long-term average because you're comping against that backlog burn?
Matthew Pine: Yes. I'd start us out here and then maybe turn it over to Bill. Again, just a reminder, we're still in fairly early innings to mid innings in AMI adoption. So, there's a lot of runway out there. And although it doesn't always show up in orders, we do obviously put some of the orders in backlog and it's or some of the contracts in backlog and how they convert to orders can be a little lumpy. And this is also a reminder that only 20% of that business is kind of big deals, 80% of it is book and ship or what we call flow. But Nate, just looking at the pipeline that I see, we've got a lot of room for continued growth in that business. And we don't see it slowing down. It's just a matter of timing, more than anything.
Bill Grogan: Yes. No, our expectation next year is that it will be in line with our long-term framework. It's just the backlog league to get us there. So, may be a little bit stronger before we get to kind of that high single-digits at some point in time next year.
Matthew Pine: Yes. And I think you had asked a few calls ago about where we are in past due. We expect to be almost complete with the past due backlog by the end of the year and probably wrap that up in Q1 of next year. So, that burn is happening and obviously leading to the increased guide and M&CS revenue at the high teens.
Nathan Jones: Second one I wanted to ask was on cash conversion. Obviously, the guidance has taken up to 120%. And I would think that 80/20 in the simplification initiatives should have an impact on working capital probably over the next at least couple of years that maybe drive cash conversion higher than the long-term average as you simplify the business, take inventory out, work on receivables and payables and stuff like that. So, any commentary you can give us on opportunities you're seeing in working capital as a result of these 80/20 and simplification initiatives. Thanks.
Bill Grogan: Yes. No, Nate, I think you're exactly right. That's a big part of the tool set as you start to reduce a lot of the complexity of the product portfolio. We get a lot more efficiency through just faster-moving inventory. Obviously, you reduced the complexity of a tremendous amount of long-tail customers and your DSO improves from that perspective. So, I totally agree, we'll see some benefits. The team does a phenomenal job right now with our overall cash conversion. But I think 80/20 will be able to take it to the next level. But I think that will be on the back end of the P&L benefits that we get. So, probably looking at as you get through the implementation, we said, hey, 12 to 18 months to realize the P&L benefits, it's probably in that 18 to 24 months. That's the second phase of simplification on the back end.
Nathan Jones: Made sense. Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Nate.
Operator: And our next question will come from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joseph Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.
Bill Grogan: Hey, good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano: Andrea, thanks for everything. You've been a huge help. If we -- if anything happens with water infrastructure, we'll now know who to blame on it.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Joe. It's been a project.
Joseph Giordano: A lot of my questions have been asked already, but maybe if you could touch on since moving the service business and combining it with WSS, like any like concrete kind of examples of how this is changing like conditions on the ground for you guys and leading to better results.
Matthew Pine: Yes, I can start this out. I mean I think that obviously, we did it for a few reasons. One is to increase our synergies because there is a lot of synergies when you now can move water and treat water. And so, now we're able to go in with the turnkey solution. We're already seeing probably that segment be the quickest to drive synergies, some of those we highlighted at the Investor Day. So, also, I'd say just a common tool set. When you think about back office, we had two service companies when we put the two companies together, the legacy vocal business was much more mature, had good processes and tools. And now leveraging that across the entire services business has been a big help. And I think probably the biggest thing is, over time will be our technician utilization, being able to utilize technicians across the entire portfolio. Now everybody is not completely spungable, but say a third to half of your technicians now can flex and do other types of work that they were doing before. And it also gives our Aqua Pros as what we call them, a broader career path. So, I'd say there's different aspects of how we're seeing it play out, but it's the fastest part of our revenue synergy right now, and it's working well.
Joseph Giordano: And then if I can ask maybe you talked about data center and stuff like that. If I think about like the large project pipeline at WSS and maybe also like general industrial-type exposure to infrastructure, are you seeing any bifurcation there because data center is definitely strong, but the commentary around large project activity in other sectors is kind of weakening. So, curious if you're seeing like puts and takes in any of those businesses there?
Matthew Pine: Not really. I mean, data centers that I think as I've mentioned, is not a huge part of our portfolio. It mainly shows up in Applied Water, although we've seen some synergies that we mentioned one of those in China at our Investor Day, but we've seen some other synergies where managing water at a data center as well as doing treatment. But it's not something that's going to be a big swing for us because it's not a large part of our business. But in general, we're seeing high growth verticals like pharma, life sciences, microelectronics, power, continue to be really robust. And look, no matter what regulations are, whatever's happening from that perspective, what's happening around climate and water scarcity is driving a lot of interest. I mean, I get phone calls all the time from leaders and CEOs in different parts of the world that are dealing with some real challenging stuff in terms of being able to keep their operations open, or the quality of their water, because of maybe saltwater intrusion, dealing with a different type of water they're trying to treat. So, we don't see any real slowdown. We're in really strong high growth verticals. And datacenters is one that's not big for us, but we're going to take advantage of it while it's hot.
Joseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Andrea, thanks so much for your help.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Andrew.
Andrew Kaplowitz: So, Matthew, Bill, you mentioned inflation and water infrastructure and margin that segment after being up nicely in Q1, year-over-year was down a bit in Q2. I know you said that acquisition, that was acquisition-related, but could you give more color into what you're seeing on the price versus cost side, particularly in that segment? Did anything materially change or is it just lumpiness? And we know you have some China exposure in there, so maybe you could talk about the competitive environment in China?
Matthew Pine: Price-cost was positive there. I think the biggest impact, and that's why we highlighted just the acquisition element, second quarter last year, during the short time that APT was part of that segment, it had an unusually high margin. It was in the low 20s versus its normalized rate of the teens. So, that was the biggest difference. That's why we added in the pro forma margin expansion, 40 bps, and it was at 40% performance incremental. So, fundamentally, the profit there is still strong. It's sequentially improved. We expect it to continue to sequentially improve as we progress to the back-half and have year-over-year margin expansion. I would say from a water infrastructure perspective, they do have probably the largest piece of our China exposure. China's been a little bit lumpy for us. It's actually the first-half it's been positive from a revenue perspective. The orders were down, but we see some of the larger projects, especially within treatment, continue to get delayed just as I think China is trying to figure out the overall economic situation and how they're going to fund several things across their investment framework. So, that's probably the one area we are continuing to keep our eye on as things just seem to be perpetually shifting to the right.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then, just maybe focusing a little more on applied water, orders; as you said, look good, they were for long cycle projects, maybe talk about the short cycle market as you see it. Is the business sort of bouncing along the bottom? What's the channel telling you? And you obviously mentioned the easier comparison in the second-half of the year. So, I know you talked about applied water returning growth in 2025, but it couldn't do that before the end of the year.
Matthew Pine: Yes, I think third quarter is still down, low single digits. Fourth quarter is probably closer to zero. Again, it's relatively in line, I mean, sequentially, the dollar amounts. The decline is largely seen in developed markets and primarily in our commercial and industrial space. Again, from a macro perspective, the institutional ABI has been negative for 16 consecutive months. And we continue to see manufacturing PMI, which are good indicators for us for that business. But I give the teams a lot of credit. Matthew highlighted; they're making their own luck. They're leveraging their differentiated technology to win some of these larger projects to get back on a growth track into next year.
Andrew Kaplowitz: I appreciate all the color.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: And our next question will come from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andrea, thank you very much for your help.
Matthew Pine: Good morning Bryan.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Bryan.
Bryan Blair: Very solid quarter and MCS again, MCS's margin again stood out. I'm sorry if I missed this detail, but Bill, you have called out and been very upfront about there being some mixed headwinds going into the back-half with energy deployments. Are you willing to size that sequential headwind relative to the strength of 1H?
Bill Grogan: Yes, I mean, we think it could be around 100 basis points in the back-half, sequential decrease from where we finished the first-half.
Bryan Blair: Okay, understood. Appreciate that. Something you offer a little more color on how treatment orders phase through the quarter. I think you cited around 20% growth there, so very robust for a business that tends to be leading indicator. Any meaningful differences by region that you would call out, and how does treatment moment influence your team's confidence in the back-half of that one?
Matthew Pine:
. :
Bryan Blair: Very encouraging. Thank you again.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes the Q2 earnings call. I would like to turn it back to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.
Matthew Pine: Thank you. We will wrap it there. Thanks for your questions, and thanks for everyone who joined today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Xylem, and all the very best.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.  
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Andrea van Berg: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter 2024 results and discuss the second quarter and full year outlook. 
 Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight May 9. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events.  
 Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.  
 Please turn to Slide 3. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis, reflecting the change in segment as of the beginning of the year. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine. 
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Xylem team delivered a very strong first quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. The team drove high single-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting a healthy balance of both volume and price. And the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin almost 300 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered EPS growth of 14%. 
 The story is pretty straightforward. We have strong commercial and operational momentum with resilient underlying demand in the majority of our segments and end markets. I want to thank all our teams for doing a great job. But I want to highlight 2 teams in particular, Measurement & Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services. In both segments, focused effort paid off in really outstanding numbers. In MCS, organic revenue grew more than 20% and margins are up over 500 basis points year-over-year. And in its first quarter as a combined segment, WSS stayed focused on serving our customers and delivered both the highest orders growth of all segments and made a significant contribution to Xylem's overall margin mix. 
 In addition to operational and commercial performance, the first quarter also reflected continued momentum on integration synergies with Evoqua. We saw a very solid Q1 run rate on cost capture, and we're confident in how we're tracking both on revenue and cost synergies. On the basis of our momentum, the team's disciplined performance and continuing resilient demand, we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and margin and lifting our EPS guidance $0.08 from the midpoint.  
 As we look forward, operationally, we're focused on maximizing value from every additional incremental volume we deliver. The team's impressive first quarter margin performance reflects our increasing operational discipline. We're driving simplification across our business, doing the few things that matter most even more efficiently.  
 To solve water, we have to simplify water both for our customers and for ourselves. Strategically, our demand outlook continues to be supported by secular trends that are set to continue across economic cycles. As the headlines reflect, we're seeing an increasingly water-challenged world. And just as with energy, the water economy is intertwined with every part of business and life.  
 So as water security becomes pressing, we'll continue to see increasing demand for the solutions that can help make companies and communities more water secure, and Xylem's platform of capabilities is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. We recently announced we'll be hosting our Investor Day on May 30 to take place both virtually and here at our headquarters in Washington. We're looking forward to the opportunity to provide updates on our strategic outlook, long-term growth and financial framework and our 2030 sustainability goals. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bill to cover the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook in more detail. Bill? 
William Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, exceeding expectations across revenue, margin and earnings per share.  I want to echo Matthew's thanks to all of our teams for remaining focused and turning in an outstanding quarter. We continue to see resilient demand with our backlog increasing 4% to $5.3 billion. Organic orders grew 3% in the quarter with book-to-bill above 1, supported by strength across developed markets, particularly in WSS.  
 Total revenues grew 40%, and organic revenues rose 7%, exceeding our guidance and a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by M&CS and WSS and we saw growth in all regions, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.2%, up 290 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume, price and mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This reflects incrementals of 26% on a consolidated basis and 57% on an organic basis.  
 Our EPS in the quarter was $0.90, above the high end of our guide by $0.05, up 14% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains healthy with ample liquidity to support capital deployment. We started the year with free cash flow conversion of 9%. This represents significant improvement versus typical seasonality of negative Q1 free cash flow conversion. This year, we delivered higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx.  
 Please turn to Slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had a great quarter and exceeded our expectations. Orders grew 3% on continued smart metering demand. Backlog rose to $2.2 billion, up 6% organically and book-to-bill came in slightly under 1 due to greater backlog conversion. M&CS revenue was up 22%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. We finished the quarter with EBITDA margins of 22.7%, up 550 basis points versus the prior year and up 440 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, higher volume and price and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation.  
 In Water Infrastructure, orders grew 6% in the quarter, led by robust transport demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 40% and organic growth of 6%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 320 basis points driven by productivity, mix, volume and price offsetting inflation. In Applied Water, although orders declined versus a year ago, book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations against strong growth in the first quarter last year, primarily driven by a decline in developed markets.  
 Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points year-over-year, an unfavorable mix, higher inflation and volume declines, partly offset by productivity savings.  
 Wrapping up with water solutions and services. Orders grew 7% organically led by dewatering and 19% on a pro forma basis with book-to-bill well above 1 in the quarter, driven by a large order for a 20-year outsourced water contract, but even excluding that large order, pro forma demand increased. Organic revenue was up 6%, while pro forma revenue increased 9%, with healthy growth across most of the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.3%, driven by favorable mix in volume and price and productivity.  
 The outperformance across WSS is a great reflection of our team staying focused on what matters, serving our customers throughout this integration and resegmentation.  
 Now let's turn to Slide 7 for our updated full year and second quarter guidance. Given our first quarter outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guide to approximately $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional point of growth versus prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at 15% to 16% and organic revenue growth at 4% to 6%. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20%. That represents 110 basis points of expansion versus the prior year driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 reflects an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint.  
 We continue to expect around $100 million of exit rate cost synergies in 2024. And free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be 115% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment levels remain largely unchanged from our comments in February.  
 For the second quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be 23% to 25% on a reported basis and 5% to 7% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields second quarter EPS of $1 to $1.05.  
 We came into 2024 at a healthy pace, and we've had a strong start to the year, building further momentum. Our diversified portfolio positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including inflation, higher interest rates for longer, a strengthening dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, our overall outlook for the year remains positive.  
 With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. 
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Two things I want to mention before we close. First, it's been such a privilege in my first 100 days as CEO to spend time with so many Xylem colleagues around the world. You can see they're doing fantastic work, and it's evident in today's results. And our integration progress is a great indicator of how smoothly the Xylem and Evoqua teams have come together. As a combined company, there is so much potential for growth and impact, especially as we pivot to even stronger execution of our strategy. 
 To achieve our potential, we're being very intentional about the culture we're building. Specifically, we're creating a culture centered on behaviors that drive empowerment, accountability and innovation. We call it our high-impact culture, and it's the heart of our how, how we are creating the next phase of Xylem's growth and impact. Of course, culture change takes time, and it starts with myself and the leadership team. 
 So it's incredibly energizing to see the cultural alignment already coming to life in our town halls and business reviews at all levels in the organization. We'll talk a bit more about how we're fostering our high-impact culture when we gather together for Investor Day at the end of May. Lastly, on Investor Day, we'll also be launching our 2023 sustainability report. We're very proud of what we've achieved and even more motivated by the work ahead. In this year's report, we'll be introducing our combined company goals for the first time, setting our ambition for impact through 2030. Given how fundamental sustainability is to Xylem's business model, I invite you to give it as much attention as you give our financial results. And as always, we welcome your feedback. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to lead us through Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with the Evoqua integration and just lots of focus here on the potential revenue synergies, the rollout of the European business. Just any color there in terms of what the potential is on some new outsourcing contracts? And then also, can you just -- any color on that large outsourced contract. That would be helpful too. 
Matthew Pine: Yes, I can start us off, Deane. I'll have Bill cover the big win that we had in our newest WSS segment on the long-term build, own, operate contract. But maybe just broadly on Evoqua integration update, it's really hard to believe that we closed about a year ago. We -- just to remind everybody, we closed that in what I call record time, announced in January, closed in May of last year. And I would characterize this as great momentum. Obviously, we've got an Investor Day coming up in about 4 weeks. And we're going to have some real tangible proof points to the progress that the teams are making.  
 Just briefly, cost synergies are tracking well to meet the $100 million run rate that we've talked about in our '24 plan. And Deane, on revenue synergies, we're ramping. That was the last thing that we were able to really focus on. Obviously, on the cost side, you can do a lot of work before the close. You can't gun jump on the revenue synergies before closing. But the teams have really ramped up. And again, we're going to have some nice proof points to share in a few weeks here in D.C., but I don't want to steal the team's thunder there. But great momentum. And you're going to get examples across 3 of our 4 segments of those revenue synergies.  
 And maybe specifically on international expansion to your point. We are making really, I'd say, quicker progress on the capital side of that. But we're starting to build momentum on the services side. We've got 3 or 4 large scale projects that we're working in the Americas that are kind of outside the U.S., and we've got some work that we're starting to investigate in probe in Europe. And so that's always been the longer part of our tail of the synergy. But I just -- I'm really happy with the momentum that the teams are making.  
 Maybe just 1 other comment before I hand it to Bill. You've seen in the quarter 1 results, we have not been slowed by integration. And that's an important point to make. This can be very distracting. And specifically with our WSS segment, where we recently did what I call a reverse integration with dewatering and assessment services, you can just see the outstanding results that the team posted in Q1 and more to come. So Bill, maybe? 
William Grogan: Yes. And Deane, maybe just to that project. I mean, great win by the team. It's a $100-plus million 20-year outsourced water project to support a large hydrogen plant investment with 1 of our key customers. Obviously, there's an upfront revenue recognition over the first 18 months, and it's about 1/3 of it and the balance will be recognized over the next 20 years.  
 So excited about that. Sticky recurring revenue that, that project will provide. The team has got a really strong funnel of large opportunities that continue to work through, and we look to see continued wins as we progress through the year. 
Deane Dray: That's all really good to hear. And just as a second question, and I'm not asking to front run anything about the analyst meeting that's coming up. But just there's an expectation that there's portfolio optimization coming, there's margin improvement that will be targeted. And I would just want to get a sense of -- I know that's going to be very inward looking at the 4 walls of the company. But what about the growth algorithm. Just during this period, are you still focused on M&A? Are you looking at new opportunities? And I just don't want to miss any of that growth upside during this period of kind of portfolio optimization? 
Matthew Pine: No, it's a great question, and you pretty much hit on 3 of my key messages that I'll be taking up in the Investor Day with me. Look, we're extremely focused on executing on the platform that's been built over the past decade, especially over the past year with the acquisition of Evoqua to drive above-market growth. I mean that's our mantra. This is our #1 execution priority in our goal deployment process this year, and it will be in the future years. And it's really obviously bolstered by the Evoqua synergies.  
 Look, Q1 is 1 data point with our new leadership team in place here. But look, we're up 6% in volume and 1% in price. And I think that's a good beginning of what we're building here on the top line, and I'm super proud of our team's top line mindset. It's not a secret. I've been very vocal about our operating leverage and so of our investors, quite frankly. And so we want to make sure that we're driving profitable growth in expanding our margins. And again, Q1 is a good example of that. We're at roughly 60% almost incrementals on a pro forma basis.  
 And the thing Deane, I would leave you with, when we talk about some of the inward focus, it's really about we have to simplify our business to grow our business. And we're doing both. And so that's really the mantra and the focus. And from a capital deployment standpoint, we'll get into more into that here in a few weeks, but we're going to be focused on high-growth markets with accretive margin and we're going to be more consistent in our capital deployment. And we've just wrapped up some value mapping work that's going to inform where those opportunities are. So we look forward, and the team looks forward to sharing that with you and others here in a few weeks. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. 
Michael Halloran: So a couple here. First, maybe just taking a step back here, you've been [indiscernible] year-to-date 100-plus days, Bill, you've been there, what, 6, 7 months now. What are the initial impressions as far as the momentum you're seeing, how the messaging you 2 are pushing through are starting to sink into the culture, sink in to the people? And what kind of impressions do you have so far? 
Matthew Pine: No, that's a great question. I did mention that in my opening remarks about the first 100 days. We -- not this me, but we as a team feel good about where we are. And we believe we've got -- we had good momentum coming into 2024. We believe now we're continuing to build on that momentum that you've seen in Q1. We're executing on a great platform, which I just teed up with Deane here. I'd say we did not have a cold start, right? We didn't start this January 1 and figure out how to start turning the crank.  
 With [ COO ] last year, having the opportunity to kind of refine the strategic priorities is a part of our strategy session with the Board. And those themes were really around value capture from our Evoqua transaction. Simplification, not only in service of margins, but growth, which I just mentioned to Deane. And we're deploying that more systematically through the business through goal deployment. I'm really proud of what I'm seeing when I'm out and about with the teams, and scaling services. So that, I'm pleased to see the progress there.  
 Obviously, I'm pleased to see the progress on our Evoqua integration, both economically and the results we're seeing. But culturally, the teams are coming together and working fantastically, and we're seeing, obviously, momentum there.  
 I think the last thing that's most important to me is the how because you can have all these objectives and strategies and things you want to go do, but if you don't have the right culture, then it's hard to execute consistently. And so the work we're doing on our high-impact culture, our how, it started last year with our senior leadership team probably about a year ago this time. And we just engaged our top 150 in the organization at the end of last year coming into '24. And we're seeing great alignment. I've spent a lot of time on the road the past 100 days globally. And I'm really pleased about where we are, but it's a long journey. We have a lot of work to do ahead of us. But with that focus and intention, I believe we can achieve great things. So look, I'm happy where we are. We're not satisfied, but I think we're off to a good start. 
Michael Halloran: And then kind of a broad question on underlying dynamics in orders. One, kind of twofold here. One, can you give the pro forma organic overall orders for the company or give some sort of proxy for it? And then second, if I listen to the messaging here, it feels like not a lot has changed in terms of what you're seeing from an end market perspective across the various segments. I'd like to just understand if there are any notable puts and takes that have either inflected more so or less so than you thought in the quarter or from a trend line perspective? 
Matthew Pine: Maybe I'll let Bill open up on your orders question, I'll give us some commentary and color on the markets. 
William Grogan: Yes. So obviously, organic was reported at 3%. The pro forma organic was 7%, so more than 2x that. 
Matthew Pine: Yes. So good momentum on orders in Q1. The book-to-bill was greater than 1 and backlog up 4%. And not a lot has changed. Demand remains healthy, Mike, in the majority of our end markets. And it's supported by a lot of the favorable drivers that we've been talking about around the secular trends. Government funding is trickling in globally across different parts of our coverage still a lot of resiliency in municipalities or utilities, OpEx and CapEx for that matter. I know that there's been questions about with rates, especially in the U.S. and in Europe with that slowdown, we're not seeing any slowdown. And you've seen with our results in the WSS segment this quarter, the durability of that business model. And I'm really proud of the M&CS team with their backlog conversion. We continue to win orders, though, and our orders are up year-over-year, and we've got good momentum there.  
 So I think a lot of what we talked about is said the same. The watch areas continue to be applied water. It largely was what we expected. We got a better second half comp, and we're working on some things in the business that I think we'll continue to improve performance there. Yes, so I think that would be my commentary on where we are right now from a demand point of view. 
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: Congrats on the -- getting through the first 100 days and having a good quarter here. Big picture, Matthew, when you see a synergy target after a deal like yours, I have to wonder, is it input or output, meaning are you trying to find $100 million in synergies? Or is it a natural output of the actions that are taken integration-wise, that's a little theoretical, but I guess somewhat kind of the -- the second derivative of the question is, is that if those synergies track above the [ 100 ] , will you likely be more likely to invest that back into the business or show it on the margin line? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. If you're referring to the cost synergies as a part of the Evoqua transaction? 
Scott Davis: Yes. 
Matthew Pine: Yes. So look, we did announce $140 million when we did the deal. So it is a little bit more than $100 million. Look, we're running to a target much higher than 140. And we're going to land the plane for sure at 140, and we're going to make sure that we put that upside probably somewhat to the bottom line, but also somewhat investing in growth. It's probably a mixed bag of whatever the overage would be -- would kind of fall half to the bottom line and half the top line growth. It's easy when you do these deals to look at cost synergies and they're on paper and they look like, okay, they're easy to do, they're procurement, back office, they're lift and shift factories. It looks pretty straightforward, but there's a lot of work that goes into this and a lot of tracking. And I'm really impressed, Scott, of the capability that we have built through this transaction. And that's only going to help us as we go forward and deploy more capital in the future.  
 So I think we're tracking well, we're going to deliver above [ 140 ], and we're going to use that to help continue to expand margins, but also to fuel growth in the future. 
Scott Davis: That makes sense. And the second question, I'd probably only get an opportunity to ask this once when you get a newer CEO. But when you think about the buckets of where Xylem is historically perhaps over invested or under invested or over loved or under loved, what stands out to you as areas of perhaps improvement that you'd like to see. I mean, you mentioned the cultural changes and some of the operational rigor. But if you could be more specific around -- around maybe some areas where you feel like you guys could use a little bit more love or the [indiscernible]? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. I think you hit the first one. It's culturally, and I think we're making good progress there. But you've heard me talk about simplify water. I think that's what it boils down to. Over the years as we've built this incredible platform, we have had some complexity conspired against us to some extent. And you can see a little bit of that in our margin profile. So it's not that we're going to be like super inwardly focused, but we do have to focus inwards so we can better serve our customers and our colleagues. And that's where we're focused. It's just making it simple to do business internally at Xylem as well as for our customers, so customer-backed mentality. 80/20 is one tool to do that. There's other tools that we're leveraging.  
 But I think putting this finer focus on what I would call the commercial execution of our business, which has probably been the area that we haven't focused enough around customers and product SKUs and things of that nature really just to simplify the business is the mantra, and I think it's going to pay big dividends for us going forward. 
Scott Davis: Super helpful. Thank you, Matthew. We'll see you all in a few weeks. 
Operator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Matt, I know you mentioned you continue to watch Applied Water. I think you did say that you won a couple of larger projects there that led to book-to-bill over 1 time. So maybe what does that say about the market? Is it like you thought, better than you thought, worse than you thought? How would you sort of characterize what's going on there? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. I'd say it's largely what we thought. If you look at the prior Q1s, we're up 10% in each 1 of those. So it's a tough compare. But it's our most cyclical segment, we do continue to expect low single-digit decline this year. It's kind of in line with what we planned. We did, to your point, have good Q1 orders performance. There were a few larger projects in that, that are a little bit out in the future. So it's not something that's book and ship. It's more of future projects. But we do continue to see soft markets, especially in Europe and emerging markets is where our orders were down. Obviously, we're watching developed markets as well, but obviously, Europe plays into that. But our really weakness in Q1 was emerging markets and in Europe for Applied Water.  
 The comps continue in Q2 to be difficult, and we're closely monitoring the funnel, and leading indicators on Applied Water. But look, we feel good about the business long term. It's just a little bit of a headwind in the first half. It will resolve itself in the second half. And we've got a lot of initiatives in place to reduce complexity and redeploy that effort in growth, and we feel confident about that going forward. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Helpful. And then obviously, it was expected, but can you talk a little bit more about how the new EPA rules regarding PFAS affect Xylem. Did they change the time line at all when PFAS may be impactful? Or is it just kind of slow and steady wins the race for how to think about your impact? 
Matthew Pine: Yes, it's the latter. It's slow, steady race. Look, we're glad to see the rule be final. Now we have some clarity on the rules of the road, the time line. Look, I'm really proud of our teams in providing clarity just 24 hours after the final rule on LinkedIn Live that really shows that we're customer-centric, we're focused. We're being a leader in the space to educate our customers. But again, to your point, this is a long journey. It will take time for the impacted utilities to comply. They've had 3 years for testing, 5 for PFAS removal, and that's a little bit longer than we initially anticipated in terms of when they need to be compliant. And we're really well positioned today and ready to partner with utilities on PFAS and other emerging contaminants for that matter.  
 One thing I don't know a lot of people -- if a lot of people know this, we have over 80 PFAS installations that we've done over the years, and we have long-standing relationships and really a differentiated offering through our service capabilities for our customers. And maybe the last thing I'd say also is we do continue to work on destruction technology. Obviously, the capture technologies out there, it's commercially viable, but there's still work to do when you capture the PFAS, how you destroy it. And so we've got a lot of great work going on with our combined company now and our Innovation Labs team to get after that solution. 
Operator: The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. 
Bryan Blair: Great to drill down on M&CS margin performance, kind of eye-catching step up in profitability there. Maybe offer some finer points on the drivers, seem kind of broad-based in terms of productivity, volume price mix in the quarter? And whether there's anything that we should consider one-time-ish that benefited results? And then lastly on that front, is it still the expectation that margin will improve sequentially throughout the year. 
William Grogan: Yes. No, Bryan, I'll take that one. I'd say [indiscernible] team delivered an outstanding quarter. Obviously, EBITDA margin is up 550 basis points with almost 50% incrementals. That team has been on a journey over the last few quarters, dealing with some pretty significant external challenges relative to the supply chain. And then internal challenges to ramp up production levels that they haven't been able to realize historically to deliver for their customers to make up for that past due backlog. They drove significant labor and material productivity to drive efficiencies to increase our output. They went out with incremental pricing, price cost negative for a while. They're back to price material cost positive. It took restructuring actions to address some underperforming parts of the business just to build a stronger financial foundation that they're now leveraging extremely well with this incremental volume.  
 The first quarter was a bit higher than our original expectations as I did see a little bit better mix towards North American water meters. We think that mix holds plus or minus here in the second quarter, but do see some unfavorable mix impacts in the back half as some lower-margin projects, especially in the energy space ship and that mix normalizes a bit. But we're really encouraged with the teams on momentum that they'll exit the year at record margins. They've started their 80/20 initiatives. So they're just in that phase, which I think will produce additional tailwinds as we exit the year. So really happy with their performance. I think it's -- we probably won't see as big of a step up as we progress through the year. It's probably more normalized now. It's just the strength there in the first quarter, but volumes will slightly sequentially increase as we go through the balance of the year. 
Bryan Blair: Okay. Very helpful detail and encouraging trends. Matthew, you mentioned that government money is starting to trickle in. And you touched on the outlook for PFAS and your team's positioning there. It would be great to hear just updated perspective on [ IIJA ] related growth opportunities overall. You've been pretty consistent in tempering expectations to date, understandably so, given the phasing of the rollout, but we have seen some acceleration in obligations and outlays, front-end reads are certainly very encouraging. And looking at the categories of funding and ultimate spend, I would have to assume that your team is going to participate in just about everything.  
 So curious how your views are evolving there and how we should think about the forward opportunity? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. I wish I could turn and stick on that hose nozzle and make it go a little faster, but look, it's -- I've been pretty consistent about this, whether it's in the U.S. or other markets, U.K., in Europe, with their funding. It's just going to be a slow drift and it's going to drip in and really help support our market growth over the next 3 to 5 years. And so that's how we continue to look at it. We don't have a big jump in our long-range plan in terms of incentives or subsidies that are coming in. So it's just going to trickle in and be kind of a layer on top of the market growth. And that's how we look at it. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. 
Nathan Jones: I wanted to pick up on 1 of Bill's comments and something I know I've talked to Matthew about before, which was the anticipation that in the future price will offset inflation. Several years ago, it had been Xylem's target for price plus productivity to offset inflation. So there's a significant change there. So just looking for some color on how you look to go about implementing that and what you think will give to Xylem the entitlement to be, I guess, a little more aggressive with price versus inflation than it has been historically? 
William Grogan: Yes. I think, obviously, price capture has been a focus with rising inflation. We're going to talk more about that at the end of the month, just a new approach to strategic pricing. I mean, I think for us, it's really -- we're looking to offset our material inflation with price and then let productivity handle the balance of indirect and SG&A inflation and fund our investments. I think the teams have got the operational productivity down, and now it's for us just to continue to refine and our process relative to value capture for the products that we offer to our customers.  
 We were price cost positive. We're looking to really manage that spread going forward, and that's really the target of the teams. 
Nathan Jones: I guess my follow-up question for Matthew. You talked about government funding kind of trickling in. There's I think, an increased focus in Europe on non-revenue water, big increases in the focus for that in the next [ half ] cycle and parts of Western Europe and Southern Europe after the 2022 drought. Can you talk about if there's any material opportunities from that increased focus on non-revenue water for Xylem's business over the next several years? 
Matthew Pine: Yes, I do. I think first with our Idrica platform is a great entree into that. There's a lot of opportunities to leverage the Idrica platform to help visualize that data through AMI systems. So that's a big focus area that we're working with utilities on across Europe and across the globe, but especially Europe. And you're right, there's a lot of funding in Europe and in the U.K. with the AMP cycle in the U.K. on non-revenue water. And also, there's a lot of focus on analytical instrumentation, especially out in the environment where they're holding polluters liable for contaminated water. So we see a great opportunity on smart metering and analytical instrumentation in that region with an overlay of our Idrica partnership and platform. 
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. 
Joseph Giordano: So on PFAS, I know we talked a lot about it, but can you maybe just talk us through exactly where you're exposed on that? And if there's capabilities that you don't currently have maybe like sampling or destruction that you're currently exploring either internally or maybe through acquisition? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. So -- we're -- obviously, we have the technology to capture through our acquisition with Evoqua coming together at Xylem. And we have over 80 PFAS installations to date. Actually, we just had 1 written up in Newsweek, I believe it was Newsweek a month or so ago up in Maine, where we were capturing PFAS from a well that they had dug to serve the increasing population. So we've got proven technology on the capture side. Where the innovation needs to happen and get to commercial liabilities on destruction. And then sensing, we can sense and bring it to a lab and get the sensing part of PFAS, but need to get sensors that can be in real-time flow. So those are the areas on destruction and real-time sensing whether it's innovation needed and our teams are working on that through our innovation labs. And with the 2 teams coming together from a legacy of Xylem and Evoqua, we believe that we can move faster and obviously spend less money getting there. 
Joseph Giordano: And then the last question, I guess, is 1 I never really thought I'd be talking to you guys about, but we're getting questions about Xylem is like a data center play now on the water side. So can you maybe explain the opportunity set in front of you, either on the power side as we have to ramp up generation capabilities to support a huge buildout or we're like in the buildings themselves on the data center side, how that opportunity kind of scales for you? 
Matthew Pine: Yes. I mean, look, on the power side, we're excited. It's one of our high-growth verticals. You heard Bill talk about the big win, $130 million build on operate win in hydrogen. And so we see that energy mix shift driving lots of opportunity for us. Specific to data centers, I do think it is a growth opportunity. We're starting to see it. Actually, one of our examples. I won't steal the thunder here at Investor Day coming up in a few weeks is about the data center, where we have synergy win there. But it's currently a small part of our revenue, probably less than $50 million.  
 Data centers do need a significant amount of water for cooling and many of them are being built in water-stressed areas, putting a lot of pressure on water resources. So we have a lot of solutions to help them from comprehensive treatment solutions to enable reuse. We've got obviously outsourced services for water management to help as well. So we do believe it's going to be an opportunity for us. It's probably not like maybe some of the other coverage that you folks have, but it definitely will be a tailwind. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks. 
Matthew Pine: Well, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you for your questions, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We hope to see many of you either in person or online at Xylem's Investor Day on May 30. And we look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction then. Until then, all the best. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspectives on Xylem's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results, and discuss our outlook and guidance for 2024. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investor section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, February 13. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investor section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements in today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the appendix section of the presentation.  Now, please turn to slide four, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to share the Xylem team's exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of a transformational year for the enterprise. The team delivered both Q4 and full-year results exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Looking at the fourth quarter, strong demand drove organic revenue growth of 9%. With disciplined execution, delivering EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points that drove double-digit orders growth. And our backlog is now more than $5 billion. Our Q4 performance capped off a year in which the team over-delivered in every quarter. Full-year organic revenues were up 12%, with EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. The team even delivered an Evoqua run-rate cost synergies in 2023, ahead of plan. Both the quarter and the full-year give us very strong momentum entering 2024. Despite a dynamic environment and the excitement of our combination with Evoqua, the team stayed focused on serving our customers. Joining forces with Evoqua has put the sector's most advanced portfolio of capabilities in the hands of our customers, and open up new opportunities to address even more of their water challenges. In our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua Services business and Xylem's dewatering business. And since them, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering. On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And it puts Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify. Looking forward, we are starting strong in 2024 with momentum from our outperformance in '23 and continued healthy demand in our major end-markets, though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China, and are taking a prudent view of end-markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment. Our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially at M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well-positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5%, with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4.00 and $4.20. I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail.
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently delivered throughout the year, exceeding on our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full-year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter, and greater than 1 for the full-year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Outperformance was led by M&CS and Water Infrastructure. All regions grew led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, price, and higher volume more than offsetting inflation. This reflects 33% incremental on the legacy Xylem performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impacts of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year. Our financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash, and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year. Please turn to slide six. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of 80/20, we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors. To assist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the Appendix. And now, on to the segment performance, measurement and Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. MCS revenue is up 21% driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year, and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price, and higher volumes. Water Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio, led by robust treatment demand globally. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30% on organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity, and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. In Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9 times as we continue to work down our backlog and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide, with the decline developed markets offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points, with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines. Integrated Solutions and Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations, as implied in our reported guidance, with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong, at 21.1%, driven by price realization and volume. Please turn to slide seven, I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure, and will update as needed in our Q1 earnings call. In M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remain strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by our robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission critical nature of our applications, and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor its office in China, where the majority of our business is in the utility end-market. In Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end-markets, particularly in developed markets which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels. ISS growth is expected to be mid single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel, particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy, and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis. Now, let's turn to slide eight for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15%, organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, and price offsetting inflation. This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run-rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income. Drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yield first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85. We are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions particularly in China in Applied Water which is our shortest cycle business. In the case of larger than expected volume declines, we are ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on a strong momentum. With that, please turn to slide nine. And, I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off in India. And, the scale of ambition there to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe-inspiring. We have an outstanding team there doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D in manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business. These markets present expansive commercial opportunity. And in both markets every project improves lives and increases sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands-on building a small scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water for the students and their community. I'll be honest. The experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health, and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we are bringing into 2024. Whether it's a scale of a school or the scale of a megacity, we have to make it easier for customers and community to solve their big water challenges, reducing the complexity of water solutions that is our focus, simplifying water. We have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions, and services in the sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity. We started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient. And as long as the long-term trends in waters continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers. Our investment thesis remains robust. And we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30, in Washington, D.C., one I hope many of you will join us. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Matthew, as we start the year, I'd love to hear what's top-of-mind for you on your priorities? I know we're going to get lot more specifics at the Analysts' Day, but I think everyone would love to hear more about what you're thinking the past and the opportunity for margin improvement broadly, and just some really thoughts on optimizing the portfolio potentially?
Matthew Pine: Great, thanks, Deane. First, I want to just acknowledge the team's Q4 and full-year performance during really a transformational year for Xylem. We had the Evoqua combination, we announced that in January, followed by the Idrica partnership. And then obviously we had a leadership change, all that while dealing with a lot of macro challenges out there around the globe. So, the team's done an incredible job staying focused. I'm really humbled and excited to lead Xylem into the next chapter. We've built, as I've said before, an incredible platform over the past decade. If you look back six or seven years ago, half the company did not even exist, so a lot of really good momentum there. And from my perspective, we're in a very unique position with our platform leadership of this 10-year journey, to have visibility across the water value chain. And this really enables us to provide holistic kind of optimized solutions to our customers. And moving forward, we're going to continue to build on that platform. As COO last year, I did lead the strategic planning process at Xylem. So, we have, I'd say, really strong strategic continuity as we transition this year. And I've talked about three strategic execution priorities that we're focused on. Number one, we have to deliver the Evoqua value capture, that's first and foremost. That's the transformational deal that we did last year. Number two, is -- and you hit on it, is we've got to get after margin expansion acceleration. And we're going to do that through productivity and continuing to drive operational excellence through the business. And then lastly, scaling our services business enabled by digital, which we'll talk probably later in the call about the WSS segment for 2024 and its ability to help us do that. One thing I'd mention that we don't talk a lot, it's kind of the soft side, and that's on culture. As we bring two large companies together, culture is really important. And we've put a lot of focus in that area. We call it high-impact culture. And there's behaviors to drive alignment around our culture. And those behaviors are, first of all, to have our people be inspired to innovate. We don't want people to feel a fear of failure. We want them to innovate, and that's going to drive the next cash flows and top line growth in the company. The second is we want them to be empowered to lead, and empowered in the business. And then thirdly, and most importantly, we want them to be accountable to deliver. And so, those are things we're really pushing the organization on get around that'll, I think, help us going forward. Maybe the last comment I would make is we have a call to action in the company that we've been working on over the past few months, and that's we want to simplify water. And what that means is really bridging our aspiration, which is Let's Solve Water, which everybody knows our tagline, to our strategic execution priorities, which is really the what we're going to focus on. So, that's really the rallying cry in the organization, and that's what we're going to be focused in 2024.
Deane Dray: Appreciate all that color. And just as a follow-up for Bill, would love to get an update on the rollout of 80/20 besides the check-the-box, say, successful recast of the slides, which I really like. And then, could you also lead in on the update on the revenue synergy plans on Evoqua specifically? I know there is a plan to rollout existing North America customers who have asked to have similar facility outsourcing in Europe, so an update there, please?
Bill Grogan: Sure. So, maybe I'll start with the first part of the question. And first off, 80/20 is a multiyear journey. As it gets weaved into the fabric of the culture, Matthew just highlighted, we are on a cultural evolution incorporate some new tools and behaviors into the organization. And you have to remember, 80/20 is kind of about systematic complexity reduction, and that takes time. It's not just a quick math exercise, and you're done. It's really about focused resource allocation methodology, aligning the teams around the things that matter most in the business. Obviously, there's a tremendous margin opportunity that comes with the toolset, but longer term, it's really a tool to drive better organic growth performance by over-serving your best customers and innovating around your best ideas. We've kicked off two pilots late in Q4 within Applied Water North America and North American Metrology within M&CS. It takes some time to do the analytics. And I look to see some benefits starting to evolve within six to 12 months. Obviously, as we get to Investor Day, we'll be able to put some more specific numbers around that. But I really think it's going to be a transformational tool for the organization as we roll it out, and be a big part of our longer term margin improvement story.
Matthew Pine: Yes. And maybe a little bit of color on revenue synergies, Deane. I am proud of the team. In Q4, we completed the APT integration to water infrastructure, which was a big deal. We've appointed regional synergy leads for the revenue capture around the globe, and incentives are in place to drive that execution. And one thing we've been really focused on is training our sales teams as well as our service teams. And as you know, in December, we announced the creation of the WSS segment for 2024, and a few comments there. Number one, we feel it's going to accelerate our synergies both on the cost side as well as the revenue side, which is where we're focused the most. One thing that maybe is not as intuitive, I do think it's going to help us with technician utilization, so we can leverage our technicians across the broader portfolio and also provide better career-pathing for them long-term, as well as leveraging technology. And then, the big thing it does for us, it really helps us leverage and enable the international expansion of WSS going forward in 2024, like I said, internationally. And then the most important thing, it makes it easier for our customers, because at the end of the day, it's about customer focus. And our customers, instead of picking up the phone to pick make four phone calls they can make one to Xylem to solve their biggest problems.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Yes, good morning everyone.
Matthew Pine: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So, a couple of questions here, first, you commented on confidence in the end markets and sustainability of existing trends. Maybe talk a little bit about utility in industrial markets. What the customers are saying at this point, willingness to put capital forward for CapEx-related projects, any signs of softness, acceleration? How are you thinking about things on that side?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I could start this out. I mean, on the CapEx front, we've seen continued momentum there. For us, the proxy is our Treatment business. Orders were very strong both in Q4 and the full-year, up double-digits. And so, that gives us a lot of confidence. And that number is not only just in the U.S, that's a global number. So, every region is performing very well in treatment. So, from a CapEx perspective, we haven't seen any pullback or any concern there. And obviously, a big part of our focus in our portfolio in utilities is focused on the OpEx side, and that's about 75% of the revenue and that remains pretty strong. And it's also we've talked about buoyed, especially the long-term. It's not going to be this year or even in the next year, but over the next five to seven years, it's buoyed by regulation globally, whether that's in the U.S. with the Infrastructure Bill, which Includes PFAS funding or if you get into Europe with The Recovery and Resilience Act and then the AMP cycle in the U.K., that gives us a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see those markets do well. I'd say, industrially it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the new segment WSS, which is a Legacy ISS business, which contains assessment services and dewatering now. We're seeing strong momentum there, especially in power, life sciences, microelectronics, we're seeing a lot of bid activity there and we feel good about that. We've seen a little bit of lumpiness in the Applied Water end markets, especially resi. Some of that is just due to coming out of the pandemic where people were investing their discretionary income and upgrading their houses and also weather has played some of our role and that is a lot of our resi products are applied into Ag applications. And so, we've seen some lumpiness there in the U.S. and a little bit in Western Europe. So, that's a little bit of the view of the landscape.
Mike Halloran: Appreciate that. Second question, just on the pricing side of things, I guess twofold, one, how are you thinking about pricing for 2024? And as you think about the multiyear journey here as you're rolling out 80/20 and all the other toolkits you're going to be implementing, what is the opportunity for pricing as you think about the broader portfolio?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Mike, maybe I'll take that one. So, price expectations for next year are going to ramp down versus the capture that we experienced in 2023, will be a little over a point. That's still significantly higher than pre-pandemic pricing, yes, but it is an opportunity as we look forward, as we calibrate and hone in the skills to continue to capture the value for our products across the portfolio. Obviously, that one point plus varies across the different segments with M&CS and WSS going forward, probably stronger price capture opportunities. And then, 80/20, I think will be up as we roll out opportunities within AWS as they've done some additional analytics and we look for just a better pricing methodology and capture on some of the longer tail customers that we have. Obviously, we're leveraging price as one of our components to offset inflation. The team does a really good job driving operational productivity as a second lever to offset inflation. So, we're going to manage price and material costs and stay positive. Obviously, that will compress a little bit next year as pricing goes down, but also our expectations relative to inflation will be price material cost positive and then look for productivity to really enhance our margins as we move forward.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Wanted to, you made some comments incrementally on China seemed a little bit more cautious, which is not a surprise just given what we've heard from others. But it looks like your business there has held up okay, at least versus some peers out there. But what maybe a little bit more granularity there would be helpful. Thanks.
Matthew Pine: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. China for us now with a new combination of the company is about mid- single-digit in terms of our revenue. With over 50% of that being water infrastructure from an exposure standpoint, largely tied to public utilities, we've seen pretty decent orders there. Q4 orders were up 11%, full-year up 10%. On the revenue side, we were up on a full-year about 2% low single-digits. But if you look back on a two year stack, we're down mid-single-digits in China. So, the backlog is building, but we haven't seen that convert to revenue yet. Things continue to slide to the right in terms of funding. I think if you read the news, you continue to see the government's intervention in the economy there and that's taking some of the funds away from investing in some of the infrastructure. But we believe that's more of a short-term issue. Across the utilities exposure, we continue to see again a healthy pipeline and we'll continue to monitor that funding. I would say, on the industrial side, it's a little bit of a similar demand environment and that's held up a little bit more resilient, to be honest over utilities. And the last thing I would say with China, overall, we expect China to be roughly flat in 2024 for the business.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's super helpful. Your balance sheet is in fantastic shape and given the way you structured the Evoqua deal, just it leads me natural question would be, are there should we expect kind of some bolt-on acquisitions or anything kind of in 2024 that perhaps you could talk about your M&A backlog and just as much as talk about the pipeline, perhaps talk about your interest in doing deals?  That would be helpful.
Matthew Pine: Thanks. It's a good question. We closed out 2023 very strong following the close of our largest transformational deal in our history. And so, one of the things we're laser focused on is making sure that we integrate Evoqua well and we get the value capture in the near-term. To your point, we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and the structure of the Evoqua deal allows us flexibility with a strong balance sheet. The short-term focus, Scott is going to be to focus on small to medium bolt-ons. Evoqua, we can fairly ring fence within the business, but there's other parts of the portfolio where we do want to continue to be inquisitive, with again with small to medium bolt-ons. And we'll continue our disciplined approach, and we're evaluating our longer term capital allocation framework, and we'll share more about that in Investor Day in May.
Operator: The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Good morning, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: Matt or Bill, when you look at the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion for '24, could you give us a little more color on how that margin improvement translates by segment? And then you mentioned the 80/20 pilots with a focus on MCS. You did have nice improvement, margin improvement in MCS in Q4. So, how do you think about the margin potential in that particular business over the longer term?
Bill Grogan: Yes, I mean, relative to the largest impact in margin expansion for next year, I think M&CS leads the pack. Obviously, we've started our journey on margin improvement and recovery as they've gone through chip supply shortages, which I think for the most part has resolved. They've added capacity within the production facility to meet kind of the record backlog levels that they've had. They've gone out with incremental pricing to improve the quality of the margin within the backlog. And I think the value of their products and solutions, they're able to continue to drive incremental price as we go into next year. So, I think their ability to exit the year at near historic record levels of EBITDA margin is the target. As they continue to leverage their volume and drive some pretty significant productivity as they look at their labor and material footprint around their products. So, we're excited about the progress that they've made and look for them to continue to sequentially improve as we progress through the year in 2024.
Andy Kaplowitz: That's very helpful. And Matt, maybe just a bigger picture question for you. I know you won a guy conservatively for this year, being prudent and applied in China, but you've got such a strong growth business in MCS, and you're still only got in 3% to 5%. Xylem had a longer term algorithm of 4% to 6%. So, as you take over the CEO range, do you worry at all that that's high or given all the self-help focus you know, focus on digitization, all these kinds of things, that that's still the right longer term growth rate?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I think again, a lot of that is not changed from what we've said in the past. It's just, I think, being balanced in our approach and with a watchful eye to China. We've got that flat year-over-year, but there could be some potential headwinds there. And also with Applied Water, which is some of that cyclicality and timing as we think about that, Andy. So, from a long-term framework, none of that's changed. It's just really more thinking about in the context of 2024 and, thinking about going out with a balanced approach. We do have a lot of healthy demand across our largest end markets. When you look at the year from a seasonality standpoint, it's normalized. There's no change in terms of the seasonality of our business and how we ramp from Q1 through the balance of the year. I think the thing I'd leave you with too, is our margin guide reflects low 40s pro forma incrementals. And so, we feel really, really strong about the margin that we're delivering as well in the growth.
Operator: The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stiefel. Please go ahead. The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Jones, is your line open?
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on the margin question. I think the vocal cost synergies get you something like 80 basis points. And you're obviously going to get some pretty good margin expansion out of the M&CS operating leverage, which when I do the math, it gets me well in excess of 100 basis points top end of your margin expansion target. So, can you talk about what could be the offset there or increased growth investments or anything that's kind of muting some of that margin expansion that I might otherwise expect?
Bill Grogan: Yes, I think the biggest piece probably in your high level math is we continue to invest in the business. Obviously, we've got significant growth opportunities over the long-term that we want to make sure that we're allocating resources around across all four segments. There's exciting things relative to product launches and market expansions that put a little bit of pressure on some of the significant accretion relative to productivity and the synergies that you highlighted. And then also, Nate, there's obviously a volatile macro environment that you want to make sure that we're more prudent relative to the guide that we have the ability to account for things that come up. So, I think our guide relative to the margin expansion is fairly balanced. I think and Matt you just highlighted at 40% incrementals on a pro forma basis, that's really strong flow through, so excited about the basis. That's really strong flow through. So, excited about the opportunities the team has laid out here as we look for a really strong year on our margin expansion journey. And I think longer term, obviously, we're just starting with the 80-20 implementation. That'll add some tailwind as we exit the year and into 2025 to try to get us at the higher end of that range longer term.
Nathan Jones: Great. And then, my follow-up, Bill, I think you just mentioned that the chip supply issue has basically worked itself out. Can you guys comment on where the past view backlog is in M&CS today and when you expect that to get to whatever a normal level of past view backlog is?
Matthew Pine: Hey, Nate, I'll take it. It's Matthew. Yes, we're making good progress on the past view backlog. If you remember, we started 2023 around 30% past due. We exited at 20. And we feel that we're going to get through the bulk of the past due backlog in 2024. Some of that may stray into '25. But for the most part, we feel pretty confident that we'll get through the past due backlog in 2024 with, again, with a little bit of carryover into '25. And so, really from a bottleneck standpoint, it really just comes down to our customers' ability to go out and execute the deployments. Chip supply is flowing. We've made investments over the past few years in our capacity. So, there's no capacity limitations from our point of view internally here at Xylem in our four walls.
Operator: The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Joe.
Bill Grogan: Hey, Joe.
Joe Giordano: I wanted to touch on Idrica. I guess one of the more like interesting kind of high level where can we go type stories within water, how to get a real connected utility. I'm just curious how you guys think about this. Like, how do we judge success? What how meaningful could something like this turn into, kind of over a near to medium term and just kind of maybe set expectations about where that can go?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I mean, I've been pretty bullish on this. You've heard me talk about being the aggregator of data in the utilities, much like, folks are in the building management world or in the residential home. We believe we have the capabilities through this partnership to be able to be the leader in aggregating utility data. We're off to a really good start. We only had about six months under our belt last year once we got the combination closed. The teams have made great progress globally and we built a significant pipeline. And one of the things I've talked about is, it's one thing is to get the platform in play at the utility, but it's about building on the applications as well as pulling through our core products. So, a little bit of a land and expand is how I would frame it. Get the platform in place, help them optimize their water networks with our applications as well as pulling through our products like AMI, our treatment products, et cetera. So, we've had some significant wins. Some of those I've highlighted on prior calls. We continue to have wins and build momentum. Like I said, and it's not a specific region, it's across the world, whether that's in the U.K., Italy. We just won a big deal in the Middle East, which is for a new city with fully digitizing their water management system with this platform. And I've talked in the past about some of the deals in Spain and the U.S. we've done, in terms of putting the platform in and being able to sell AMI deals as well as treatment products. So, I think it can be a big opportunity for us. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more color as we as we get closer to May 30th at our Investor Day. But we're really bullish on the partnership.
Joe Giordano: That's great color. And then, I just apologize if you mentioned some of this on the prepared remarks. I had to join late, but -- on Evoqua, like revenue side synergies, I know like selling an ISS solution outside the U.S. is going to take a long time to build out, but I'm curious if there's anything you could point to about like leveraging existing channels that you have and like Europe to put product through, which I would imagine would be a lower lift than to try to do a solution based on.
Matthew Pine: Yes, that's kind of a shorter to medium term objective, and we've already had some wins. We just had one in South Africa, actually, where we took the capital from the legacy of local business through the legacies island business in South Africa. So, we were able to execute and deploy that capital into an industrial application without really having to have service, folks on the ground and infrastructure. So, those are things that we're focused on kind of in the short to medium term is leveraging the product side and really the capital side of the legacy of local business through those island channels, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So, we are all starting to see progress there.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-session session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.
Matthew Pine: Yes, I just want to thank everybody for joining our call today, and for your interest in Xylem. We look forward to speaking again in early May, followed by our Investor Day on May 30, where we're going to provide more details on our long-term outlook. Take care, and make it a great day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions].  I would like to now turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Andrea van der Berg : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's third quarter 2023 earnings conference. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Pine; Senior Advisor and former Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan.  They will provide their perspectives on Xylem's third quarter 2023 results and discuss the fourth quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.  I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the investor section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, November 7. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the investor section of our website under the heading Investor Events.  Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements in today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with SEC.  Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.  Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the appendix section of the presentation.  Now, please turn to slide four, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. By now you'll have seen that our first full quarter as a combined company was Xylem and Evoqua together. The team delivered very strong performance across each of our segments. We significantly exceeded expectations on organic revenue growth, EBITDA margin and earnings per share, and revenue grew 10% organically.  We expanded EBITDA margin well above prior year, and we delivered EPS of $0.99 to the quarter, which represents 14% growth year-over-year. Orders were up 3%, and more importantly, our backlogs continue to grow, especially in our M&CS and ISS segments. Total backlog is now $5.2 billion, and this sets us up for continued growth momentum and demonstrates the health of our key end markets.  So on the strength of this performance, we are raising our full year guidance. I want to personally give a big shout out to the team for their strong operational performance during a period of integrating two large enterprises. Instead of getting distracted, the team continued to focus on serving our customers and delivering on our commitments. The integration of Evoqua is well on track to deliver the cost synergies we promised.  It's those synergies that underwrote the transaction, but more importantly, it's the growth synergies that excite us the most. And our customers have already begun to experience the advantages of our combined capabilities.  Overall, the quarter's strong result, it reflects our continued momentum. And that puts me in a very privileged position on my last earnings call as CEO of Xylem. In September, we announced the planned succession of both me as CEO and Sandy as CFO.  Matthew Pine is going to lead Xylem as CEO beginning January 1. I'll remain on as an advisor through the end of March. I'd also like to formally welcome our new CFO, Bill Grogan who is on the call with us today. He's alongside Sandy Rowland. Bill took on the role of CFO on October 1, and it's been a real pleasure to welcome him to the team.  Now as Sandy was in the Chair through the end of September, she's going to cover the third quarter results, but that's not going to happen before I take the opportunity to thank her for her many significant contributions as Xylem. She's been a great partner and a great leader over the last few years with me and the team. We simply would not be where we are today without her many contributions. So now over to you Sandy. 
Sandy Rowland : Thank you, Patrick. Before I go over the quarter's performance, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Bill. In the short time since he stepped into the CFO role, I've been impressed with how quickly he has immersed himself in the business and taken on financial leadership of the company.  Like Patrick, I will continue to stay on as an advisor through March to ensure a smooth transition, but the company will be in great hands with Bill working alongside Matthew next year and I couldn't be more confident in Xylem's future.  And now, let's look at the quarter. Please turn to slide five. As Patrick mentioned, the team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share. Each segment outperformed including Integrated Solutions & Services. As a reminder, since the combination with the Evoqua, we began including ISS as our fourth reporting segment.  For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets was down largely due to China, despite strengths in other parts of Asia and also in Africa.  From an end-market perspective, utilities grew 16%, mainly driven by robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and water infrastructure. Industrial grew 5%, driven by strong demand in the U.S. and healthy demand in Western Europe. Lastly, building solutions grew 3% with strength in developed markets, more than offsetting moderation in emerging markets.  Overall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter and book-to-bill for the company was approximately one. EBITDA margin was 19.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings, and favorable price-cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year.  Please turn to slide six, and I'll review each segment's third quarter performance in a bit more detail. M&CS revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by improved chip supply and backlog execution, as well as strength in test and measurement. All regions saw double-digit growth, led by an impressive 31% in the U.S.  Orders were down in the quarter due to the timing of metrology orders, while assessment services saw strong growth. Year-to-date, book-to-bill remains above one for the segment.  Our M&CS backlog of $2.3 billion is up 11% organically versus the prior year, a reflection of strong continuing demand for our AMI offerings and the accelerating trend towards digitization. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by volume conversion, price realization, and productivity, more than offsetting inflation.  And now let's turn to slide seven, and I'll cover our water infrastructure business. Water infrastructure outperformed due to stronger-than-expected price realization and backlog execution, with reported growth of 40% and organic growth of 7%.  As a reminder, we have integrated Evoqua's applied products technology business into the water infrastructure segment, further building out our treatment portfolio. This business outperformed expectations driven by stronger backlog execution. For both, utilities and industrials, the U.S. saw robust growth, while Western Europe proved resilient, offsetting some weakness in emerging markets. Organic orders in the quarter were up 14% year-over-year, and each region saw double-digit growth with particular strength in developed markets. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 50 basis points and 80 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua.  Please turn to slide eight for an overview of Applied Water. Applied Water revenues grew 1% on continued backlog execution, modestly better than expectations of flat revenue growth. Growth in building solutions was driven by continued strength in commercial, particularly in the U.S.  While industrial was down modestly, there was resilient growth in developed markets, offset by moderation in emerging markets. Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in the U.S. And segment EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points with continued strong price-cost dynamics and productivity, more than offsetting volume declines.  Please turn to slide nine. Last quarter, we introduced Integrated Solutions & Services as our fourth segment. ISS brings a durable recurring revenue base from businesses including outsourced water, which provide outcome-based treatment services to customers.  In its first full quarter with Xylem, ISS revenue exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance. On a pro forma basis, ISS revenue grew 10% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution.  Orders grew on a pro forma basis by 12% year-over-year with broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Book-to-bill was greater than one, and backlog exceeded $1 billion to end the quarter up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.6%, driven by price realization and productivity.  And now let's turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.2x. And year-to-date we have adjusted free cash flow conversion of 94%.  Please turn to slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick. 
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Today is the 12th Anniversary of Xylem's listing on the Newark Stock Exchange. And I think it's pretty fair to say that 12 years ago, water wasn't very widely recognized as an investable thesis. But since then, intensifying secular trends have made absolutely clear, the value of a platform of solutions to meet the global water challenges. In that time, Xylem has evolved in our composition, our scale, and our impact. But our investment thesis has remained constant. It's one that's focused on a multi-year runway of attractive organic growth with sustainable margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. And it's that financial strength and confidence that allows us to effectively deploy capital as we continue building a differentiated market-leading water solutions platform.  Under that thesis, we built a very durable business model. And Xylem colleagues and partners around the world are creating significant economic and social value as we serve our customers and communities around the world.  I am both proud of what we built so far, but also excited to see what Xylem is capable of becoming under Matthew's leadership. Matthew and I have worked side by side for the three and a half years. So this handover is progressing very smoothly. And I have total confidence he will lead this team to realize the full promise of our strategy and create an even greater impact and value in the years to come.  So now, over to you Matthew. 
Matthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. I am grateful and energized at the prospect of building on Xylem's momentum and creating our next phase of growth and impact. I'm also deeply grateful for Patrick's passionate, visionary leadership. His legacy is Xylem's bright future, having put Xylem firmly on a path of continuing profitable growth.  The strength of our partnership is making it easy to deliver the continuity essential to all stakeholders in this handover as we approach the turn of the year. And as Patrick said, our thesis is constant, our strategy is sound, and we are committed to our long-range plan.  Our team is solving customers' greatest water challenges with the most advanced platform of solutions in the world. In a fragmented, complex market, that integrated offering is a distinctive, competitive advantage. The opportunity ahead of us is to make it easier for even more customers to access the full range of capabilities they need to solve their most critical water challenges. In the process, we'll grow our penetration, our profitability, our durability, and our impact. The team and I look forward to sharing more color about the next phase of our growth at an Investor Day in May next year.  We'll provide a further update on our combined company opportunity and long-range plan then. In the meantime, I'm pleased to share our nearer-term outlook. I'll provide a brief update on our Evoqua integration, and then a picture of what we expect in our end markets over the next period. And then finally, I'll ask Bill to provide guidance for the remainder of the year.  Moving to slide 12, as you can see, the integration of Evoqua has gained quick momentum, and the team has come together remarkably fast. There's great collaboration, and we have the benefit of bringing two highly complemented cultures with a similarly strong sense of purpose together.  We committed $140 million of cost synergies within three years, as well as exiting 2023 with a $40 million run rate. And as Patrick mentioned, that's well on track. But the rationale for the combination has always been about growth, the opportunity to create more value serving customers with our combined capabilities.  In utilities, we'll deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's applied product technology offerings through our water infrastructure segment. The combination allows us to provide even more comprehensive treatment solutions in both clean water and wastewater.  In industrial, we will scale our presence in attractive verticals with services offerings of ISS. We see long-term market expansion in growing verticals such as microelectronics, power, life sciences, and food and beverage. And geographically, we will scale Evoqua's products and solutions internationally, including the services business, by leveraging Xylem's global distribution platform.  Both Xylem and Evoqua were market leaders on their own, but together, we're in even a stronger position. We are already seeing the benefits of scale, reach and integrated offerings, and a robust pipeline of global opportunities, as well as the combined wins both teams are posting.  And as we integrate our two businesses even more deeply, we'll take advantage of the opportunity to optimize our portfolio for growth. That will include structuring our offerings in ways that are matched to how our end markets address water management. The job is to make it even simpler for them to access solutions they need, and we're already hearing how customers appreciate having fewer vendors to coordinate across multiple domains.  Now, let's turn to slide 13, and I'll cover the outlook for our end markets. Our outperformance in the first three quarters of the year provides great momentum to build on. I especially want to echo Patrick's shout out to all of our teams for delivering such a standout performance this year, and in the third quarter. It's that kind of commitment and discipline that demonstrates the team's ability to execute through a dynamic macroeconomic environment.  That said, we continue to take a balanced outlook and are monitoring signs of softness on a regional level, particularly in China, and some end markets addressed by our Applied Water Segment.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook is expressed on an organic basis. At a high level, we anticipate that utilities demand will continue to be resilient, and industrial demand will provide steady growth. Utilities compromise approximately 45% of revenue. They continue to show healthy demand, and we continue to expect growth of mid-teens.  On the clean water side, we continue to see robust demand for our AMI solutions. On top of that, we're driving backlog execution on improved chip supply, and we're seeing even more traction on solution selling with our digital platform as customers increasingly value bundled offerings. We now anticipate growth of mid-20s up from low-20s previously.  On the wastewater side, OpEx is expected to remain resilient in developed markets, alongside steady CapEx spend across regions, underpinning demand. We expect to see high single-digit growth in wastewater overall.  Turning to industrial end market, which is about 45% of our revenue, we now expect global growth of high single digits up from mid-single digits. Developed markets continue to be resilient, although there are pockets of moderation in emerging markets.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we continue to expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business, particularly in commercial applications.  Overall, the demand outlook continues to be positive despite some variability in macro indicators. While the organic view does not include Evoqua, the demand profile in ISS is resilient on a foundation of recurring revenues, further increasing the durability of our business.  Now, I have the pleasure of turning the call over to Bill for the first time to walk through our Q4 guidance. 
Bill Grogan : Thanks, Matthew, and thanks Patrick and Sandy for your kind words. I'm incredibly grateful to Sandy for being so generous with her insight about the business during this handover. She has built a strong team and culture, and I wish her well in her new endeavors.  I want to start by saying how excited I am to join the Xylem team. I have long admired the company, both because of its rise to sector leadership and also because of its distinctive commitment to both social and economic value creation. And now, a month in, I'm even more compelled by the opportunities ahead of us. It is a privilege to be part of the team that will take Xylem forward, building on this extraordinary platform and performance. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year revenue EBITDA margin and EPS guidance. Full-year revenue will now be approximately $7.3 billion. This translates to total revenue growth of about 32% and organic revenue growth of about 11%, up from 9% to 10% previously.  We are raising EBITDA margin to approximately 19%, up from 18%, driven by higher volume, stronger price realization, and productivity initiatives. This reflects about 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. In addition, we are lifting full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.71 to $3.73, up from $3.60 at the midpoint.  The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: Low 20s growth in M&CS, up from approximately 20% previously, high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, and mid-single digit growth in Applied Water. And we remain committed to achieving free cash flow conversion of above 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of full-year assumptions in the appendix on slide 19.  And now, drilling down on the fourth quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 35% to 36% range on a reported basis, and 4% to 5% organically. By segment, we expect revenue growth to be mid-teens in M&CS, low single digits in water infrastructure, and remain flat in Applied Water.  We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.5%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $0.94 to $0.96. Our operational discipline, commercial momentum, and backlog strength give us confidence to the remainder of the year in delivering our long-term plan.  With that, please turn to slide 15, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker : Thanks, Bill, and thank you Matthew and Sandy. This is a bittersweet moment for me. I'm wrapping up my last earnings call with Xylem.  Leading and helping build this enterprise has been absolutely the greatest privilege of my career. I'm so proud of what the team has achieved in the past 10 years. Of the work that we've done alongside our partners, serving our customers and communities, and of the value we've created together. That said, it's clear to me personally, we are only just beginning to realize our full potential. Xylem is strongly positioned, our momentum is accelerating, and there has never been a greater need for solutions to the world's water challenges. It's incredibly gratifying to know that me, that my more than 22,000 Xylem colleagues and our partners are going to take the work of solving water forward under an exceptionally strong leadership team. We are poised to have an even greater impact and to create even more value in the many years to come.  On a final personal note to the many of you whose jobs include closely tracking and analyzing our business, I've come to know you quite well as you followed Xylem's growth. I admire and respect the work that you do. All the very best to each of you, and simply go keep making a difference.  Now, we're going to take your questions, and so operator, let's open it up for Q&A. 
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
Sandy Rowland: Morning, Dean. 
Patrick Decker : Good morning. 
Deane Dray: You'll have to indulge me. I need to start with some important congratulations, so let me just rattle through them here. So Sandy, thank you for all your help and wish you all the best. Matthew, you and I have already connected twice in person since the announcement, but in my view, you've got the right skill set and leadership to lead Xylem from here, so congrats.  And Bill, Bill, welcome. And I don't want to put too much pressure on you, but we are expecting the same sort of elite CFO contributions that we saw for years at IDEX, so congrats and welcome to you. 
Bill Grogan : Appreciate it, Deane. 
Deane Dray: All right, so, and Patrick, no tissues here, but you've had a fabulous 10-year run. You're handing off the reins truly in it from a position of strength, and I just remember when you joined Xylem, it was a company that thought of itself as a pump company. I mean, that's what they said. And the entire portfolio has evolved to where, I love how you phrase it, you're solving water.  So just, you should feel really proud about how you developed the company and the portfolio and the leadership team, so congrats. 
Patrick Decker : Thank you, Deane, and that means a lot coming from you. You've been here from the beginning.
Deane Dray: Yes sir, yes sir. All right, so let's just talk about the quarter if we could, and maybe start with Evoqua and how the business – Matthew referenced some new wins. Just how have the revenue synergy started, conversations with customers, what'll be the first opportunities maybe to take Evoqua's business with existing customers to Europe? So any color there would be helpful. Thanks. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, thanks Deane for the question. Maybe I'll just start at a very high level and just talk about the guiding principles that Patrick really stated when we did the deal, which I think were really important to our execution.  The first was, we said we have to deliver on our ‘23 plans, and as you can see from Q3, really strong performance. As most of you know, that was the legacy Evoqua's business Q4 in this past fiscal calendar Q3. So great execution by the team, and I couldn't be happier.  The second, we need to make sure we deliver on the value capture of the cost and revenue synergies. And on what I would call the softer side, which is equally as important when you bring two companies together, is to make sure we get the right talent on the field or the pitch, if you will, and make sure we retain top talent. We've done a really nice job there.  And then lastly, bringing the best to both cultures together. So obviously the work's not done, but we're off to a good start, and those guiding principles have helped really get momentum in the business.  Just quickly on cost synergies, we're tracking at the $40 million exit rate that we talked about, and those three buckets of corporate costs, procurement, and footprint. But more so on the revenue synergies, which you're getting at Deane, the momentum is strong. We've just completed the APT integration into water infrastructure, which is really a milestone for us.  We've appointed regional synergy leads in each one of the regions to drive the value capture. The incentives are in place, and the training's ongoing, both for the sales team as well as the services organization.  The short term, as you talk about, really the short term we're focused on cross-selling our products into industrial and back into municipal. I think the services, which I'll touch on in a minute, has been the biggest surprise so far. Midterm, we're going to leverage the Xylem footprint in Europe to bring capital products to customers, to the Evoqua products that are international, and bringing those folks from the U.S. to international. And then lastly, long term we're moving our services internationally.  But I wanted to give you an example of an early synergy win. We have a power customer, it's an oil and gas – well, actually it's an oil and gas customer, where we do the process water for them. It's a build-on operate. We do not do the wastewater and they had their wastewater system go down and it was crippling their operations. So within really 48 hours, we were able to bring the legacy businesses together, both on the treatment side, as well as the pumping and transport of wastewater in that facility and keep them up and running, and also keep them away from having fines.  We've had several examples like that where we can bring a full solution to the customer with one phone call, and I think that's really important. So off to a great start. There's many examples like that, but we'll be able to give a lot more context as we roll into 2024. 
Deane Dray : That's all really good to hear. And if I could have a follow-up on M&CS, just your update on the chip supply. It looks like we continue to see gradual improvement there. And any comments about the orders in the third quarter and just kind of what the funnel looks like? Thanks. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, I'll start with orders and I'll come back to chip supply. Although we were down 11%, backlog is up 11%, $2.3 billion in M&CS, book-to-bill ratio greater than one. Deane, the bid activity remains really strong in M&CS, especially metrology. Really the reason for the decline in orders in the quarter was more of a timing of the backlog conversion to orders.  As you know, a lot of the larger AMI deals, they sit in backlog for a period of time, anywhere from three to 12 months, while the utility is getting ready for the deployment. And when we receive the PO is when we book it as an order. So it's more of a timing issue, and that can be a little bit lumpy. But in general, we're really bullish on AMI adoption, and it's still fairly early innings.  On the chip supply, the original guide this year for the business was low teens. Now we're in the low 20s. So we've seen continual gradual chip improvement quarter-over-quarter. I think this quarter it came in a little faster than we had thought, and it can be lumpy. But really chip supply in Q3 was strong. We see that continued momentum into Q4, especially with our product redesigns. And then obviously we've got -- with the backlog, we have a lot of potential in ‘24 in M&CS. 
Patrick Decker: Deane, this is Patrick. Just to punctuate what Matthew had said, in that segment again, orders are only a function of when POs are placed. The key metric there is what's happening with backlog. And again, the backlog is very healthy, the deal pipeline is very healthy, and the win rate, especially in North America, is very impressive for AMI. 
Deane Dray : Great. That all sounds good, and congrats again to everyone. 
Matthew Pine: Thank you, Deane. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks, Deane.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. 
Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. 
Patrick Decker : Hey, good morning. 
Sandy Rowland : Hey Mike. 
Mike Halloran : So like Deane, thanks Patrick for everything over the years. It's been a long, long run, but we really appreciate everything. Sandy, same. Not quite as long, but best of luck moving forward. And obviously Bill and Matthew, I look forward to working with both of you. So I appreciate it, everyone. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks Mike. 
Mike Halloran : I don't think I've had four congratulations on a call before. 
Patrick Decker : Yeah. Hey Mike, we don't do things orthodox here, so – but we do them the right way through, it's called succession planning. So thank you. 
Mike Halloran : No problem. All right. So following up on Deane's M&CS order question, maybe broaden it out a little bit. If you think about end markets heading into 2024, I certainly appreciate Matthew's comments on the fourth quarter itself. Where are the optimistic points? Where are the concern points? A lot of moving pieces here, right? You have really strong backlog. You have some regulatory tailwinds that are starting to hit or at least it seems like it. But you also have this uncertain macro backdrop in some of these emerging market regions where there's a little less clarity. So maybe just talk about some of those moving pieces as you're thinking about next year and where you think there could be some demand sustainability or where you have a little bit more concern points. 
Matthew Pine: No, it's a great question Mike. We're committed to both the legacy businesses, long-range plans that were presented back in ‘21. Just start right there and just get that out. And really we have great momentum heading into next year with the platform that's been built by the Evoqua, Xylem combination. If you look back over the past decade of Patrick's leadership, 50% of the company didn't exist six or seven short years ago, and we're really operating from a position of strength in terms of the platform that has been built. So that feels really good as a jump-off point.  I think if you kind of think about the macro drivers or favorable drivers, the secular trends continue to be strong, scarcity of water, aged infrastructure in developed markets, water quality is increasingly an issue, and as many of us have seen this year with flooding happening all over the world.  So those trends will continue and they'll continue to buoy the business. Government funding, we talk a lot about the funding. It's going to be a dimmer switch. It's going to come over a period of time. But the next six to seven years, we'll see continued trickle funding globally, not only in the US. I think the resiliency of our OpEx and utilities will continue to be a strong point. I think the ISS durable business model, with the combination coming together with 75% services and aftermarket, gives us a lot more diversity of cash flows as we move into ‘24. And then lastly, M&CS backlog, which we just talked about with the supply chain improvements, I think are all positives.  I think if I had to mention a few watch items, our more cyclical pieces of the portfolio with the end markets and applied water are definitely a watch item. There's pockets of industrial weakness. It's really niche when you think about Ag or marine, but they are very small pieces of our business. But in general, industrial has tended to hold up pretty well.  And then I think the last thing I'd mentioned is China, which I mentioned in the opening comments. Industrial has remained pretty resilient in China for us. It's been the utilities, but it's been more on just a push to the right more than anything in China, which we can talk a little bit more about that later, but that's kind of the insights that we give. Obviously in our February earnings call, we'll be able to give more color, but that's what I see right now. 
Mike Halloran : Great. I appreciate that. And then second question, just on the pricing and mix. So price costs in the quarter sounds like the backlog for M&CS is better than the margin profile today, which makes a lot of sense. Maybe just talk about some of those two dynamics as you're looking forward ability to continue to manage the price side of things against resilient inflation and how we should think about mix on a forward basis. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, this price cost in Q3, continue to be positive for Xylem. We're up 70 bips. We expect pricing to moderate in 2024 as we lap previous increases. I think ‘24 is going to fall more in line with historical trends, but in terms of M&CS, definitely price costs contributed to a little bit of the incrementals this quarter. But we feel really positive in a step up in Q4 and into ‘24, we've taken some pricing actions that will start to really materialize into ‘24. And in terms of the mix, it'll continue to be a little bit lumpy with energy, but we're working that backlog down and we expect that to normalize as we get into ‘24. 
Mike Halloran : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks everyone. 
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, everyone. 
Matthew Pine: Good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Scott. 
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Scott. 
Scott Davis: I'll let Dean's congratulations kind of take the lead for me. And since he's the elder statesman, I will defer to him, but I agree with everything you said to everybody. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Scott. Thank you. 
Scott Davis: No problem. Matthew, can you, just on China, can you guys help us understand kind of the interplay between OpEx and CapEx? I mean, when I assume it's all CapEx that's declined and pushed to the right, but is there a certain OpEx impact as well? 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, I think it's – yeah, in terms of China, yeah. The under – I’ll just say, the underlying demand does remain fairly healthy. It's like I said, industrial has been more resilient than utilities, but with regard to utilities, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. It's really timing of funding, not only for CapEx, but also for OpEx as well.  And as we've seen in the treatment piece of our business, in China it's been actually a little bit more resilient than transport. Transport tends to be a bit more OpEx centric. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, Scott, when it comes to the funding. It's both CapEx and OpEx. 
Patrick Decker: Hey Scott, I guess two weeks ago I was – two weeks ago I was there for a week and I spent time with our leadership gang and the team and visited our locations in Nanjing, Shenyang, Shanghai, traveled around, met with customers, met with the team, and the whole purpose was to really get a sense for kind of how things feel in China. And all I can say is based upon our portfolio, what we have there.  Yeah, there's some near term shifting to the right on when backlog gets converted on the utility side, but underlying demand is still very strong there. That market is very positive and as many of you've heard me say before, as my father said, every generation thinks theirs is the last. This is my third time talking about the future of China in terms of demand for water and environment, and things felt very, very good in terms of robust underlying demand. 
Scott Davis: That makes sense. You guys, I don't think I ever – I'm not sure. I haven't asked this question. I don't think you've talked about it or maybe you have, and I just didn't remember, but how are you integrating the R&D efforts between Evoqua and Xylem? How are you kind of integrating and eliminating duplication if there was any? I would assume there'd be some maybe like in things like PFAS and things like that. And then how are you prioritizing projects with – assuming there is some level of integration, but I'll just let you guys comment on that. Thanks. 
Matthew Pine: That's a great question. We haven't talked a lot about the R&D synergies, but for sure they are there. Let me first start out by Snehal Desai leading that team. And I’m actually here in DC today with his leadership team.  So he comes over from the legacy of Evoqua business. And yes, there is some overlap, especially when you think about the work that's being done in PFAS, both obviously the capture technologies there about the destruction and the sensing is really where the innovations required. And obviously one plus one can equal three there. We were both working on that to get – separately. But now together, we think we can get there more efficiently and in a more expedited fashion.  But in general, yes, there were different solutions that we were working on separately, that as we come together we can get leverage from that combined spend and really that effort. 
Patrick Decker: And I think Scott, I would just add that part of our innovation effort, because R&D is only one part of innovation, was through the partnerships that we have through academia, venture capital startups coming to us, and that's where I think the scale and platform of Xylem and our relationships will benefit what the legacy Evoqua business was looking to capture, around things like PFAS, but other treatment solutions facing our customers. 
Scott Davis: It makes sense. Best of luck, everybody. Take care. Congrats on the quarter. 
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Scott. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. 
Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. 
Patrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Nate. 
Nathan Jones : I'll add my congratulations to Patrick and Sandy and congratulations to Bill and Matthew. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Bill Grogan: Thanks Nathan. 
Nathan Jones : Maybe just emerging markets outside of China. I mean, you've talked about some of the issues that China saw in the quarter and not particular to your business, I don't think, but maybe you could talk about the emerging market performance outside of China. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, I think ex-China, emerging markets has been pretty resilient for us across all different end markets, Nate. I think with the exception would probably be a little bit of weakness in the Middle East and our applied water business. But in general, if you look at the other businesses, they've been really resilient outside of China. And it's helped kind of buoy the – a little bit of the tough push to the right that we've seen in China. That's across all different regions; Africa, Northern Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Australia, New Zealand. 
Nathan Jones : I think for the follow-up, I'll ask about the Idrica partnership, Xylem’s new adoption. You guys had some pretty broad presentations at ACE and at WEFTEC this year. So maybe you can talk about customer reception to those kinds of things and customer uptake for those kinds of things. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, no, it's been fabulous. Actually, it's exceeded our expectations. We've engaged over 200 customers globally, and it's – the thing I'm excited about, it's been really balanced across the globe, both the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. We've got a tremendous pipeline built. We're working now on executing from orders to sales and deployment.  I did – if you remember, I highlighted – I'm going to highlight a couple of examples. One was in the U.S. in a southeastern city, a large city, we're able to cut what I'll say, land and expand. We took the platform, the digital platform and the utility to aggregate all their applications and then making it easy for them. Then we bolted on two of our own applications, which is recurring revenue. And then from there we picked up a $40 million AMI deal. So it's kind of land and expand, but it's also pulling through our products and solutions.  On the heels of that, we just also picked up in Europe from a large European utility, $20 million of treatment in metrology in southern Europe, the same situation. They have the platform implemented and we're able to leverage our relationship and pull through treatment and AMI solution.  So I've talked a lot about the platform being the consolidator of utilities information. We believe that's true, but the pull through we're getting and the relationships we're building allows us to bundle our offerings, and that's really exciting. 
Patrick Decker: And Nate, I – Matthew, he led the effort on cultivating the Idrica opportunity over a number of years, and obviously he's been involved in cultivating the Evoqua opportunity over a few years. What I would just offer up here is, this has always been as we've said, about helping our customers turn the lights on, on their infrastructure to understand, have a better feel for what's going on in infrastructure, so that when they spend the next dollar of CapEx or OpEx, where best to spend it.  And I think the, the few opportunities that Matthew mentioned already, where it's the pull through, that is as much the opportunity as the initial services sell to the customer. 
Nathan Jones : Maybe you'll have to add a discussion on the revenue synergies from Idrica to the revenue synergies from Evoqua at the Analyst Day next year. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, I think, but I think it's a good comment, because we do think the platform has scalability into the industrial and building services business. Obviously we're going to stay focused on utilities at first. So we stay focused and deliver, but it does have ability to expand into industrial. 
Nathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Matthew Pine: Thank you. 
Patrick Decker : Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. 
Joe Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning. 
Matthew Pine: Hey. Good morning, Joe. 
Patrick Decker : Hey. Good morning Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey, Patrick, Sandy. I mean, thank you for everything. Congratulations. And with five simultaneous calls going on today for me, being done with earnings calls sounds wonderful. So I'm very jealous for both of you. Congratulations. 
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Joe. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks Joe. 
Joe Giordano: Bill, maybe I'll start with you. Like as you come over from IDEX and you kind of want to bring the best of what that firm had, like how do you kind of kick-start an 80/20 kind of culture here? What's involved in really doing that and driving it to be like at the forefront? 
Bill Grogan: Yeah, no, a great question. And the team had already started that initiative before I got here. They recognize that it's a core tool that ultimately frees up organizational capacity, right. Its focus is to eliminate complexity, focus on the things that matter most. There's obviously the core analytics from a product and customer perspective, but thinking about more broadly and then leveraging those tools to help enhance our strategy.  So we're doing it very much like we did at IDEX, piloting it in a couple of locations. Getting folks familiar with the tools and the concepts and then rolling it out more thoroughly as we have initial successes and wins. So it is something I think that's going to have a tremendous amount of value, both on the top and bottom line, creating velocity to innovation for our customers and creating longer term returns for our shareholders. 
Patrick Decker : And I think – this is Patrick. 
Joe Giordano: Go ahead, Patrick. 
Patrick Decker : Sorry, sorry, Joe. That's all right. I just add that I think the way I would encourage investors to look at this is we've spent the last decade building a platform that customers can access for their needs, which means growth. And when you've built that platform, then you have something to actually apply 80/20 to.  And so that's why right now is the perfect time for this combination to be coming together and Bill coming in with his toolkit. The team had already been working on this, but I think what he brings to the table is going to be incredibly valuable to the enterprise in terms of value creation. 
Joe Giordano: Is that concept even more applicable to the Evoqua platform? I just think of them as having been built from like almost a, we have everything kind of ethos, right, of being nationally available and having tons of different products. It just feels like given the breadth of SKUs there, like maybe something like this, whether it's keeping everything and just charging appropriately or like it just feels like it might be more appropriate for that business. Is that fair to think of it that way? 
Bill Grogan : I think on balance, it'd be similar to the opportunities we have at Xylem that it's not hugely differentiated there. Obviously there's a – 80/20 is applicable to all different business models. So the service aspect versus a product based organization, it's still a tool that will drive significant value. 
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then just last for me, is the infrastructure order rate, do you feel like that's stable here? It's probably a number that caught most people by surprise being that strong. So is that in dollars kind of a good number? 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, the water infrastructure order rate? Yeah. It included a couple of big projects in custom pump. But in general, yeah, we're seeing good demand, resilient demand, both in developed markets and ex-China and emerging markets. So we feel pretty good and it's been pretty resilient. 
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys. I'll pass it along. 
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Joe. 
Bill Grogan: Thanks, Joe. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. 
Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. 
Matthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Andy. 
Andy Kaplowitz : Patrick, Sandy, congrats. We'll miss you. Matt and Bill, we're looking forward to working with you.  Maybe I could start. It just doesn't look like it, but are your customers outside of China changing their behavior at all based on higher interest rates or economic uncertainty? Your new public competitor in the water space mentioned that some North American municipalities are holding off on plant upgrades and some investments. But it doesn't seem like that is what your utility or industrial companies are doing. But maybe you can give us some more color on what you're seeing. 
Matthew Pine: Yeah, I would just maybe just specific to utilities and wastewater, I think, is the proxy for the question. Just a reminder that 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. and 75% of that is OpEx, which can be a little bit different in terms of the mix. We're seeing continued resiliency in orders in developed markets leading the way with emerging markets kind of minus China, like I just said to Joe, contributing nicely.  With regard to CapEx, I'd point to our treatment orders, which are up 6% in Q3. And we have a healthy funnel and pipeline up 8%. We have been reaching out to customers, kind of qualitatively a cross section of customers across the globe, and specifically in the U.S. They don't really see a major funding shift in spending. Plus the addition of stimulus money that's going to trickle in over time, Andy, I think will also help kind of keep things stable.  But in general, we haven't we haven't really kind of seen anything that's alarming for us, it would be a watch item. 
Patrick Decker : Andy, this is Patrick. Again, one thing I would offer to investors as you think about, I know we have some new entrants into the space. I think it's important that our investors understand that we've got the broadest water platform that's out there. And so I think drilling down into what percentage of our total revenue actually overlaps with some of our competitors that are out there is an important thing to pay attention to.  The treatment bidding pipeline as Matthew alluded to, is the single most important indicator as the health of the utilities over time. And that continues to be up, I think, mid to high single digits. So that's a reflection of what the underlying health of utilities are. And again, I just offer that as something for you all to focus on. 
Andy Kaplowitz : Definitely appreciate that color guys. And then maybe I could ask you for a little bit more on what you are seeing in our applied water segment and specifically across your channel and channel inventory there. Can you give us color into sellout versus sell-in? Do you still see inventory is in balance? Do you see a period of slow orders for that segment where they just continue to be a bit lumpy? 
Matthew Pine: Yeah. You know, Andy, within our applied water business, we don’t have a tremendous amount of stocking. Again, it’s if you kind of Resi commercial over the overall Xylem business, it’s only 10%, but a lot of our orders Andy or configure to order engineer to order, so therefore for a specific job. Yes, we have book and ship. It's mainly in our Resi business and a little bit commercially and a lot of that has kind of worked itself out.  If you look at our compares on the Resi business, which makes up 3% of our business, we're up on a year-over-year basis and we've kind of hit the bottom when we're coming out of the downturn on Resi. But again, it's a small part of our portfolio.
Andy Kaplowitz : I appreciate the color guys. Congrats again.
Matthew Pine: Thanks Andy.
Patrick Decker : Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.
Patrick Decker : Well, thank you all. I mean it's been a great privilege to work with such an extraordinary set of colleagues and partners over the past nearly 10 years. I couldn't be more proud of where we are today and I'm looking forward to seeing all that Matthew, Bill and the team are going to do is they take Xylem into its next chapter. The work has never been more important as to what Xylem is doing and this company has never been better positioned to make a difference, as we're committed to doing with our customers and communities around the world. Again, I want to thank you everyone and all the very best to you and your families. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today is a significant milestone for Xylem as we have the pleasure to present the performance and outlook of quite a different company than just a quarter ago as we describe our ability to make an impact on the world as society deals with growing water challenges.  The combination of Xylem and Evoqua has already begun taking shape as an even stronger global platform that will have a profoundly positive impact on our customers and communities. We have a responsibility in front of us to help at exactly the moment when the world's water challenges are coming into more acute focus than ever. When we completed the acquisition in May, our capability to meet this moment expanded along with our opportunities for growth. Now, 10 weeks into the integration of these 2 great enterprises, we are even more confident about the value we will create with our combined company.  There are 3 things that underpin that confidence. First, the team is delivering impressive performance across both companies. I am so very proud of our team for staying focused on serving our customers at a potentially distracting time. Each team, both legacy Xylem and Evoqua turned in a quarter significantly exceeding expectations and giving us brisk momentum for the future.  Second, our early progress on integration has increased our confidence in the cost synergies we previously laid out and the growth synergies ahead of us. We have moved well forward on both sources of value. And third, as water challenges continue to intensify for our customers across many parts of our economy and society, they are seeking simpler, more affordable ways to tackle them.  While we are now even more strongly positioned to solve those needs and capture that demand with increased exposure to attractive, durable end markets. We'll come back at these bigger points in a few minutes, but I want to make sure we also give appropriate attention to the very strong quarter we just closed. As we shared in our press release this morning, we significantly exceeded expectations on revenue growth, margin and earnings per share. Organic revenue growth was 15%, with total reported revenue growth of 26%. EPS was up 32% and grew 28%, excluding the impact of the acquisition. And we delivered EBITDA margin well above our guide at more than 19%. It was driven by strong demand and the team's continued focus on pricing as well as ongoing continuous improvement aimed at simplifying how we serve our customers.  Organically, all segments contributed double-digit revenue growth in all end markets. And each of our regions grew, led by notably strong pace in the U.S. and a solid recovery in China. Our legacy backlog was up 7%. And then we added Evoqua's backlog of more than $1 billion, and the 2 together bring our total backlog to $5.3 billion.  Well, we have a lot to do with the integration of these 2 great companies. We have strong commercial momentum, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. And again, I want to thank every one of our team members around the world and our partners for what they are doing every day to deliver real impact to our customers and our communities.  In a moment, we'll give more color on our outlook as well as detail on our end markets and regions. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig into the quarter's strong results.
Sandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Since this is the first time we are reporting as a combined company, I would like to walk you through how we will cover our performance. We now have 4 reporting segments: Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies business has been integrated into water infrastructure, immediately combining our 2 complementary treatment product businesses. Evoqua's Integrated Solutions & Services business, or ISS, is reported as its own segment, providing continued transparency on the segment's results.  Our other two segments, Measurement & Control Solutions and Applied Water are unchanged. Additionally, since this quarter includes about a month of Evoqua's results, we have laid out organic results compared to our previously shared expectations and broken out the impact of the acquisition. Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates shared are on an organic basis.  And lastly, we have reported EPS on an adjusted basis that adds back noncash purchase accounting intangible amortization from the Evoqua acquisition and Xylem's previous acquisitions. We have therefore recast 2022 amounts for comparison purposes. And now let's turn to Slide 6 for our quarter's results.  The team delivered strong performance, beating our expectations for both growth and margin expansion. Total revenues grew 26%, while organic revenue growth of 15% was led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. Each business exceeded our expectations, and we saw double-digit growth in all segments and end markets.  Utilities was up 17% due to robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 11% on strong price realization and demand across all regions. And lastly, building solutions, which includes commercial and residential grew 15%. Overall, demand remains resilient as demonstrated by our $5.3 billion backlog, up 7% organically, as Patrick highlighted, and now includes Evoqua. And while orders were down 2% on the quarter, book-to-bill continues to be above 1.  EBITDA margin was 19.1%, up 250 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points, exceeding our previous expectations. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.98, up 32% year-over-year and up 28% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review each segment's second quarter performance in a bit more detail.  M&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by improved chip supply as well as strong demand in pipeline assessment services. U.S. and Western Europe saw robust growth, and we continue to see favorable momentum in emerging markets. Orders grew 6% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and our backlog of $2.4 billion is up 17% versus the prior year, demonstrating continued strong demand for our AMI offerings.  EBITDA margin for the segment was up 590 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure, which now includes Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies segment grew 20% on a reported basis and 13% organically. Growth was robust across the portfolio, with revenues up double digits in all end markets and applications. Developed markets saw particularly strong growth driven by OpEx demand, while emerging markets grew 7%, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific.  Orders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, lapping prior year growth of over 20%, and book-to-bill was above 1. EBITDA margin for the segment was roughly flat year-over-year and up 20 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of Applied Water.  Applied Water revenues grew 12% on continued strong price realization and backlog execution. The U.S. and emerging markets grew double digits, while Western Europe grew mid-single digits. Industrial demand was both resilient in both Western Europe and emerging markets, particularly due to recovery in China. And while orders were down 6% in the quarter, our backlog continues to be elevated versus historical levels, and book-to-bill is 0.9.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 290 basis points in the quarter with continued strong price realization, coupled with productivity more than offsetting inflation. Please turn to Slide 10.  I'm very pleased to introduce Integrated Solutions & Services as our newest reporting segment. ISS is a leading North American water treatment solution and services provider that brings access to a durable and highly recurring revenue stream as well as a diverse and attractive industrial verticals. With approximately 75% recurring revenue, ISS is known for dependability and bringing mission-critical water treatment expertise to our customers.  Although we only reported ISS after our May 24 close, full quarter revenue was up 12%, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. And orders grew 4% with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 due to broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Backlog of nearly $1 billion to end the quarter, was up 15% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin post close was a solid at 24%. And now let's turn to Slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  After retiring over $600 million of debt in conjunction with the closing of Evoqua, our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x and in the second quarter, we had solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 86%. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Just a little more than 2 months post close, our excitement about the Evoqua acquisition has only grown. We've made great progress in 3 areas. First is our performance and outlook as the business stands today. We began the integration with an overarching principle, and that was to deliver continuity for our customers, keep our commitments and not disrupt business performance. The results tell a clear story of focused near-term delivery.  The combination of our team's disciplined execution and healthy underlying market demand has given us the confidence to raise our full year guide. But our current performance is, as you would expect, largely a reflection of our businesses as they are. What we're most excited about is our future potential and the opportunities ahead of us, which brings me to the second dimension on which our confidence is only growing.  When the transaction closed, we announced a combined leadership team. And frankly, I'm energized by the strong cultural fit the team has already been demonstrating and the early momentum we've created. We are well on track to deliver the cost synergies outlined when we announced the transaction. And as we progress through the integration, we have even more greater visibility of the operating efficiencies to be realized in coming quarters, along with the opportunity for significant further margin expansion.  At the same time, the whole strategic rationale of this combination has always been about further accelerating our profitable growth. And that's the third dimension I referred to in my opening comments. We are now even more strongly positioned in attractive, durable end markets with a significant component of recurring revenue streams.  Now that we have deeper insight into the intersection of our businesses and customers, we see those opportunities even more clearly.  So moving on to Slide 13. This is the right combination at the right time. Together, we have the strongest platform of capabilities to address customers' critical water challenges. Those needs are increasing, and we have the scale and reach now to deliver differentiated solutions globally. Our teams are already detailing how we will do that.  First, in utilities, we will deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies to our Water Infrastructure offerings. In industrial, we'll use the power of our combined offering to scale our presence in attractive industrial end markets. And then we will expand our Services Solutions business by leveraging Xylem's well-established global distribution platform.  Now as many of you know, this combination delivers on part of the strategy we laid out back in our 2021 Investor Day, and that was to expand our capability and our presence in industrial end markets. Increasing industrial exposure reinforces the durability of our overall business model and gains us greater access to attractive customer sets for even faster long-term growth. The recurring revenues of ISS, which deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles, it complements our M&CS and Water Infrastructure businesses, which also benefit from the resilience of utility spending.  We've already taken the first steps in offering our combined portfolio to light and general industry customers and we're already targeting attractive industrial verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics. Both have strong long-term outlooks that are driven by secular trends that align well with Xylem's existing business. We look forward to keeping you up to date with our integration progress on a regular basis and anticipate providing a longer-term growth outlook at an Investor Day likely to be scheduled in the first part of 2024.  Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matthew to say a bit more about our end market outlook.
Matthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. Turning to Slide 14. Before I cover our end market outlook for the year, I want to thank the team and our partners for a great quarter. Our continued outperformance and momentum give us confidence to deliver in 2023 and beyond. We have record backlogs and the value proposition of our differentiated portfolio in attractive end markets puts us in a strong position even in a potentially dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to take a balanced approach in our outlook and are monitoring leading indicators watching for signs of moderation. That said, we expect resilient demand in utilities and continued steady growth in industrial water applications.  And now I'll turn to our 2023 outlook by end market, which will be on an organic basis. Utilities, which is approximately 45% of our revenue continue to be healthy and we now expect growth of mid-teens, up from low teens. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of low 20s, up from high teens previously due to robust demand for our AMI solutions, and backlog execution on improved chip supply. In addition, we are seeing great traction on solution selling with our digital platform and customers are increasingly interested in bundling offerings.  On the wastewater side, we continue to expect high single-digit growth, resilient OpEx in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will underpin demand.  Turning now to the industrial end market, which is 45% of our revenue, we expect steady global growth of mid-single digits, but are keeping a close watch for signs of moderation. We expect any softness from developed markets to be somewhat offset by growth in emerging markets including China, where industrial momentum has continued to outpace utilities.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business and backlog execution. The overall demand outlook remains healthy. And although we are not including Evoqua in our organic outlook, we expect the contribution of mission-critical solutions and services in attractive high-growth verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics to further increase the durability of our business. That outlook, combined with our operating discipline, commercial momentum and large backlogs gives us confidence for the rest of the year and beyond.  Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through the detail of our raised guidance.
Sandra Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 15. We are increasing our full year guidance across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and also incorporating Evoqua. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year.  We expect total revenues to be around $7.2 billion for the year, which includes approximately $1.1 billion from Evoqua and another increase in our organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 9%. We are raising the low end of our EBITDA guidance to about 18%. And in addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.70, up approximately $0.35 at the midpoint. This incorporates a $0.15 raise from our strong organic outlook and a $0.20 increase due to acquisition-related adjustments. This includes a contribution from Evoqua of approximately $0.45 and the add back of legacy purchase accounting intangible amortization of $0.30 and partially offset by incremental share dilution of about $0.55.  As Patrick highlighted, we've made great progress on integration. We expect to be at $40 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of the year and we remain on track to deliver $140 million of run rate cost synergies within 3 years.  Turning to Slide 16. For 2023, our organic revenue growth by segment breaks down as follows: approximately 20% growth in M&CS, high single-digits growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water and we are still on track to achieve free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income.  We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 21. And now drilling down in the third quarter, we anticipate total company growth will be in the range of 40% to 45% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically.  By segment, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens in M&CS and mid-single digits in Water Infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, please turn to Slide 17, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We've covered a lot here. So we look forward to your questions. But just before we do that, I want to reiterate a fundamental point. This is a transformational step forward for Xylem, and we believe it is transformational for our customers and our communities. We are very excited about this strategic evolution, but the most important things about Xylem are not changing.  Our investment thesis is one of those unchanging constants. We are creating significant economic and social value with a durable business model that addresses intensifying water challenges. And we're doing that with a differentiated portfolio of solutions and services in attractive and growing end markets. This gives us a multiyear runway of profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation with capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio.  It has become increasingly apparent that the need for solutions to the world's water challenges is only growing, and we are in a very privileged position to serve those needs. So now we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Just a comment to start, and we really appreciate all the heavy lifting that went on, all these moving parts, recasting financials, the re-segmentation, the new end market mix and the move to cash EPS. And look, from our perspective, that all makes sense, but we appreciate all the work that...
Patrick Decker: Deane, before your question, I just want to -- I do want to give a shout out to the entire team here and around the world that have been a part of not just closing this transaction, but all the moving parts and pieces that you talked about. In the midst of exciting momentum, a lot of work, and we really appreciate that recognition.
Deane Dray: Yes. That's exactly what I was doing. And just the fact you did not skip a beat on the organic side of the business. Cash conversion, order intake and so forth. So that was the comment part. And now I go to my question. On the re-segmentation, ISS is a stand-alone check the box. That's what we'd expect you to do. And then combining APT with Water Infrastructure that also makes sense because that's where there's some interesting overlap in terms of go-to-market, customer, not so much on the technologies, but on the go-to-market side.  So first question, because that is where there's some integration that will be going on. So give us a sense of what that integration effort is on combining those businesses and anything about the cost synergies and any conceptual thoughts on revenue synergies?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Thanks, Deane. So I'm going to hand it to Matthew to comment on your specific question. I would say that the integration efforts are really off to a great start. And APT, that part of Evoqua is a clear and obvious opportunity for us, and I've been really pleased and impressed by the cultural assimilation of the teams. But with that, I'll let Matthew comment a bit more on why that integration, why now and what that kind of looks like for us.
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Patrick. Deane, first of all, as Sandy mentioned a few minutes ago in her remarks, they're very complementary businesses, first and foremost. And there is immediate synergies, both on the revenue and the cost side. So that's getting us out of the gate fast. The teams are making great progress, as Patrick mentioned. It allows us to quickly cross-sell our products, both in industrial and utilities. And an example of this would be in the utility space, being able to bundle our solutions and kind of walk through the front door with a total solution across the whole treatment train, if you will, from beginning to end. We didn't have that capability before. Bringing the 2 companies together enables us to bring that full offering to the table.  Also, something that maybe is not as intuitive is our technicians, what we call AQUApros, are out with our customers. Now they have a broader portfolio to solve customer pain points. And we're already seeing that play out just organically with our technicians recommending other -- recommending new products in the portfolio very quickly. So that may be something that's not as intuitive, but it's happening already.  I'd say thirdly, I'd say the R&D synergies. There's obviously R&D synergies when we bring the treatment businesses together. And then lastly, we -- Patrick mentioned leadership in the very beginning. We brought over 3 leaders to the senior leadership team from Evoqua. Hervé Fages will lead the combined treatment business. He has tremendous experience here and bringing those two pieces together will be instrumental for our out-of-the-gate performance on cost and revenue.
Deane Dray: That's all really good to hear. And so second question is, the theme is digital. And first, just give us an update on the chip supply. Does it continue to be a gradual supply improvement there? And what's the outlook and then related to that is, Patrick, there's been this digital path for Xylem, where you were targeting a 50% of revenues by 2025. And I know it's still early, and I'm not asking a real specific number here, but just conceptually, how -- and our view is Evoqua is significantly on the path of digital themselves. So now combined, that should help you towards this goal. So just chip supply and then conceptually, where are you on the path on half of digital revenues by what timeframe?
Patrick Decker: I'll let Matthew start on where we are on chip supply and then he and I will tag team on where we are in digital.
Matthew Pine: Great. Chip supply, Deane, as you mentioned, is continuing to the moderate improvement as we expected. Q3 will look a lot like Q2. We do expect a pickup in Q4 and also as we head into 2024, we do expect chip supply to improve, but also our redesigns will be coming online as we head into the really the end of 2023 into 2024. So that gives us confidence that we'll see that ramp Q4 and then into '24.  Maybe just a few comments on digital and then Patrick can wrap it up. We are making good progress towards the 50% of revenues digital goal. That was a legacy Xylem target. We can see it in the backlog. We have a lot of digital content that's trapped in the backlog. And that will start to release as we get better chip supply and we get better, just in general electronic supply over the course of the next 6 to 12 months. The continued adoption of AMI, as you see in the backlog increase this quarter with M&CS, we're up $300 million. So making significant progress on digital, especially buoyed by AMI.  And then I'd say, lastly, the partnership with Idrica is really important because it enables us to pull through more digital content. We're already starting to see that play out. So I'd say, all in all, we're in a good trajectory, and we're making good progress.
Patrick Decker: Yes. And I just -- I would wrap that up, Deane, with -- first of all, great question because it's a key underpinning of our overall story and differentiation in the marketplace, which is I know why you raised the question.  So high confidence in both the heritage kind of Xylem business. I would say what I'm most encouraged by there also is we continue to see really exciting adoption on AMI in the marketplace, which really is borne out by the print in our increased backlog and deal wins.  With Evoqua, the opportunity there, it really is more of a complementary strategy on digital. In the Evoqua businesses, we're really talking about the ISS business. The digital path that the team there has been on is really more around how do you use digital and connectivity to actually improve the productivity of the services offering making it easier for AQUApros to do their jobs. That leads to margin enhancement. That's a big opportunity within the ISS portfolio to improve our EBITDA margins by, again, digitally enabling kind of what they do every day, making less truck rolls, less visits to serve the customer, give the customer more data insights, predict where the issues are, before they have to go out and find them.  So there's a whole exciting area there that for those that are new to either the Xylem or the Evoqua story, we'll have more to share on that at our Investor Day going forward. It's very exciting.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran: So the first question, I think, is a relatively straightforward question, but I just want to level set everything, given how many moving pieces here that there are. So it sounds like guidance was raised both organically as well as your expectations that have moved higher on the Evoqua piece if we compare this to, call it, 2, 3 months ago, whenever you last gave an update. Can you just talk through the pieces of why that those expectations have moved higher? I know some of it is the second quarter outlook, but it feels like that it's a little broader than that. So can you just maybe line out those moving pieces for us?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Let me take a crack at that, Mike. If you rewind back to February, we -- if you look at where -- compared to our initial guide, organically, we're now forecasting about $300 million higher revenue. We did raise our guidance the last time we spoke and this quarter we raised it by another $75 million.  In M&CS, we started the year thinking that the business would grow somewhere in the low teens. We now are expecting 20% growth in that segment. And we're seeing very good strong incremental margins come from that business. So it's a combination of metrology. It's also a combination of the other businesses that we wrap around metrology and M&CS that's giving us good upside. And then the other 2 businesses, they've been performing really well. They've gotten ahead of the curve from a price cost perspective we sustain that momentum. But I think what's also encouraging is we're seeing significant -- we're seeing more increases on the volume side as well. And so it's really all parts of our portfolio that are contributing to the beat and raise.  When I look at the Evoqua side of the house, we talked about them contributing about $1.1 billion this year. This past quarter, we brought in about $175 million of revenue from Evoqua. Margins there are developing really nicely and if you look at our implied outlook for the rest of the year, there -- the margins for both companies are really right on top of each other. So it's really good to see strong momentum from both sides of the house. And I think it goes back to the deal operating principles where we've kept both teams really focused on delivering on the organic plan.
Michael Halloran: Great. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. Appreciate that. And then second question, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the momentum you're seeing on the utility side as we work through next year. Book-to-bill seems pretty good on the utility pieces. Obviously, M&CS is healthy. I think the infrastructure piece is healthy, though, obviously, you got some industrial in there. Backlog is very high on the M&CS side. Maybe just talk about the visibility you have on those pieces in the next year, wrapping ISS into that a little bit as well, and talk about how you're looking at the contribution from some of these regulatory drivers coming out of some of the funding that might or might not get released here?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So I'll start, Mike, and then I'll hand it over to Matthew. Just to your question, zooming out around utilities, we remain, I would say, more confident than ever around where utilities -- again, this is a global statement where utilities are in the cycle. One, we see here in the U.S. that while we're still early in the adoption of AMI, we continue to see an increased excitement around that. And that shows up in our bidding pipeline. It shows up in our deal wins. It shows up in our backlog. And I think the numbers speak for themselves there on where AMI adoption is going and our ability to successfully compete and win in that space of the market.  Secondly, the -- there are the underlying fundamentals of -- the largest part of utility spend, as you well know, is OpEx, it's repair replace. And given the age of infrastructure around the world, most notably here in North America but also in Europe. We see continued increases in that demand and outlook. And that's going to continue as a long-term trend.  I think in terms of other demand profiles beyond that, as we think about whether it be the Inflation Reduction Act, other infrastructure legislation here in the U.S. We get a lot of questions around PFAS and obviously, with our Evoqua capabilities coming in, that's obviously a very exciting area for us. But as we've said before, and I know Ron, the CEO of Evoqua in the past has said, that's a dimmer switch. It's not like all of a sudden one day it's going to show up. It's going to be adoption over time. And it just reinforces the positive tailwind that we believe we have in the areas that we're focusing on at Xylem.  So that's my commentary around utilities. I don't know, Matthew, if you want to add anything to that.
Matthew Pine: I think the only thing I would add to that, we have really close relationship with our customers, especially our utility customers. And based on conversations that we've had with them over the past few months, we don't see a reason that there's going to be any slowdown. The draft muni budgets for the next year for some of our weather utilities are showing growth year-over-year. So I'd say kind of -- that's kind of customer back, the feedback we're getting. Obviously, we play very globally in utilities, not only in the U.S. but half of our revenue is outside the U.S. And to Patrick's point, there's a lot of public funding globally both in the U.K. with the AMP cycle. In China, the EU and then obviously, in the U.S. So feels pretty good.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Can you talk through like kind of how the quarter went in Western Europe and China? I mean that's where the debt has been kind of squishy and maybe getting work there a little bit. And I'm just curious on your thoughts on potential for Chinese stimulus and where that might get directed if it does impact you guys?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Joe, it's Matthew. Just maybe just some comments on Europe. It continues to be resilient, especially in utilities, which is over 50% of our revenue in Europe. With the majority of that being in OpEx, as Patrick just mentioned earlier. We were up low teens in orders in Europe in utilities. And so that was really good news. The softness that we're seeing is more on the building solutions side, which is partially offset by industrial.  All in all, Western Europe is up low single digits in orders. So I'd say, all in all, faring pretty well there when you take the balance there in account.  China, which makes up around 6% of our revenues, we saw positive momentum both in orders and revenue in Q2. We were up 20% plus, which although it was an easier compare, it was really great work done by Shuping Lu, who leads our team there and the entire team in China. Just incredible resolve and just really in China for China, localizing products and shifting where some of the slowness is happening and getting into more of the high-growth areas.  Industrial has led the way in China for us, and we're starting to see a little bit of momentum in the utility space. And obviously, in the commercial building space in China, that's where the weakness is, but it's not a big part of our business in China. 75% of our business in China is more utility centric. So all in all, we're very confident in China, and we -- in the long-term outlook, given really the critical nature and focus on water in country there.
Patrick Decker: And Joe, you know this already, but for the rest of the listeners, I've been a long-term bull on China just because of the underlying demands and needs from a water and environmental standpoint there continues to be a top policy mandate of the government. You couple that with the strength of our team and our portfolio of offerings. We've weathered a couple of cycles in China over the time that I've been here. But when you go back and look over the last 7 or so years, it's like a double-digit CAGR of growth, and we continue to see that potential going forward. So I'm very proud of the team and optimistic about China for us.
Joseph Giordano: That's good color. And then just I wanted to follow up on Idrica. Just -- where is that in terms of like what needs to happen for that to become kind of like a core kind of beachhead for you and digitalization on a scale basis? And then, Sandy, I just had one clarification for you. APT within Water Infrastructure. Just curious how that looked organically on like a full quarter basis for revenue and orders?
Sandra Rowland: Yes, let me knock that out of the way and then Matthew can take Idrica. When you look at the performance of the full quarter of Evoqua, the business grew 9% organically and the APT piece of Evoqua grew 4%.
Matthew Pine: Great. Yes. In terms of Idrica, just for folks that are on the phone that may not know what Idrica is, it's -- we have an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide with Idrica, which is headquartered in Valencia, Spain. They were born out of the utility operator and the digital platform that they have that we're partnered with, addresses really the biggest pain point we hear from utilities, need for a singular platform to seamlessly integrate all of their applications and data. And I would say we have built really good momentum over the past 4 to 5 months. We've engaged over 200-plus utilities globally, and it's got really global reach, it's fairly balanced across the globe and have built a solid funnel with really significant synergy wins through bundling our solutions.  So I would say it is becoming the beachhead. It will become the beachhead and earlier in Deane's question, is going to help us pull through and drive more digital content and also reoccurring revenue, which is really important.  Just one example I'll give you in the U.S. recently where we leveraged this digital platform, we're calling the Xylem View which is the Idrica platform. We pulled through a large AMI order. Now you're seeing in the backlog. So you saw the backlog grow by $300 million. One of those big synergy wins was due to the digital platform that we enabled and pull through this synergy order. So it's going to help us with recurring revenue, but it's also going to pull through content, which is really strong.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to start on the cost synergy side. Pretty good run rate to be at $40 million by the end of the year, like 30% of the targeted cost synergy number. So maybe you could just start off by talking about where that's coming from to hit that kind of run rate that quickly in this kind of deal, the major buckets for the $140 million? And then if you can give us any color on how we should think about those layering in, in '24, '25, '26?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Sure, Nate. Let me kick that off. I think the cost synergy buckets that we outlined when we announced the transaction have not changed. So the first category was to go after a public company costs, overlapping public company costs as well as some of the SG&A savings. And so that is making up the lion's share of the savings that we're going to realize in 2023.  And the other two categories of savings, which are going to come from procurement savings as well as some site consolidations and manufacturing footprint overlap, we expect the procurement savings to start to kick in later in '24. And the manufacturing site consolidations, that's going to happen over time. We have those phased because we want to make sure we're purposely taking care of our customers.  So about $40 million exit rate in Q4 as I look into '24, we'll be more than double that when we exit '24. So I think all signs, we're very confident about the $140 million.
Nathan Jones: And I did want to ask a couple of questions or one probably long question about revenue synergies. It's obviously a big motivating factor for this deal to get done in the first place. Not looking for exact numbers. [indiscernible], more of those in early '24. But if you can just talk conceptually about areas where you see potential for revenue synergies and kind of the phasing of those. I mean, there's obviously the APT and Water Infrastructure combination, I think, certainly signals that there's revenue synergies there, and you talked about them before.  But maybe talking about things like expanding Evoqua's service-based business model internationally, maybe leveraging their footprint in the U.S. to develop some more service-based business models with Xylem's legacy products? And then any other channels you'd be willing to talk about to help us understand the opportunity here?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So Nate, this is Patrick. So I go back to the 3 overarching kind of areas that we're focused on. And what I would offer is we've also got special incentives in place for our teams to go capture the revenue synergy because we want people to be highly motivated to go do these things beyond their day job.  So deep in our utility penetration. And that really is around, again, combination of our treatment product portfolio of the 2 companies. They really do complement each other very, very well and leveraging what Xylem's really market-leading utility position is around the world. These are not North America comments alone, they're around the world, is a big opportunity.  Secondly, scaling our offering to industrial customers. Again, we call them industrial, and there's a number of customer sets that are in that area that we think there are big opportunities. We don't think we see big opportunities to really go solve their needs. So if you think about -- well, the third is expanding the ISS offering internationally.  And 2 and 3 have a lot in common because as part of our diligence when we looked at Evoqua, they have a really, really impressive roster of customers market-leading customers that cut across areas of whether it be power, whether it be food and beverage, whether it be life science, whether -- again, whether it be microelectronics that have needed even more Evoqua's capability than Evoqua has been able to provide in the past, especially international. And that's where we, as Xylem, have the footprint and we had the scale and the resources to be able to drive that adoption.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Jefferies.
Sandra Rowland: Operator, I think we've heard from him.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Maybe digging into building solutions a little bit. Commercial demand has continued to be strong. I think this is one area that you're anticipating a slowdown previously. So maybe just an update on what you're seeing there.
Sandra Rowland: Yes. I mean -- I'm sorry, so it was a little bit choppy, you asked about commercial? Yes. So our commercial business has been pretty resilient this year. We've seen -- continue to see strong revenue growth. And our outlook for the back of the year is -- we still are going in with an elevated backlog. So nothing has changed materially there.
Patrick Decker: Saree you were a bit choppy and breaking. I want to make sure we clarify your question in terms of which segment.
Saree Boroditsky: Yes. I think you're anticipating a slowdown previously. I think said maybe . Just trying to get an update there on building solutions. And then maybe just on -- just following that up on residential, obviously, small market for you guys, but how did that trend through the quarter? And are you seeing any positive signs there?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Saree, I mean, I think when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing really good orders momentum and strong book-to-bill. The one soft spot in our portfolio is residential. And before the acquisition, that made up about 5% of our revenue base. Now it's even lower than that. It's 2% or 3% of our revenue base. So yes, that is the weakest part of our portfolio. You're seeing a slower growth outlook in AWS for the second half of the year, offset by the other businesses that have more resilient end markets such as utilities.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: So Patrick, dewatering has obviously remained strong for you guys. We talked about it in the past being a little more cyclical, but it seems like it's sort of holding up well. So maybe you can talk about sort of what you see going forward, maybe even into '24 in that business.
Patrick Decker: Yes. So dewatering had historically, for those that may be relatively new to the story of Xylem, had historically been one of our more cyclical businesses. And because it's such a high-margin business, it would tend to capture spotlight even with a little bit of movement in terms of downturn. And there have been a number of moves that we've made over the past handful of years to diversify the end market exposure of that.  I'll hand it over to Matthew to kind of give his take on kind of where we are positioned right now. But I'm certainly proud of the work the team has done. And there's been a lot of work done on synergy, commercial integration even before the acquisition of Evoqua and I know it's like stronger now.
Matthew Pine: Yes. No, it's great, Patrick. We've put a lot of time and effort into dewatering over the past couple of years, Andy. And I would say maybe a couple of things. One is we invested in the fleet, both in Europe and in the U.S., which has really helped us capture more wins. Number two, really coming out of 2019, we needed to diversify our segments in dewatering. We were too oil and gas dependent. And we've done a nice job of mixing into light construction as well as into mini bypass and some different areas that are a bit more profitable and a bit more steady and less cyclical.  So those are a couple of key drivers, I would say that's really helped us. And the last thing I would say in the U.S. where predominantly our revenue is, we've done a good job of driving the businesses together and driving synergies with our service organizations, passing leads back and forth to one another, with our pipeline assessment service businesses, our valve maintenance business and whatnot. So really good on the synergy side that's helped drive growth as well.
Patrick Decker: I would just wrap up that answer by saying, I think in this business, like the entire business but certainly in this area, it's about leadership. We've got a strong leadership team in that area that are working together. They're leveraging the portfolio. They're focusing on what happens at a slight kind of local service level. This, just like our ISS business coming in, it's people, very people-driven business. It's an emergency room kind of operation. it's what happens every day, 24/7. And so the hearts and minds of the people really, really matter here. They do everywhere, but they really matter here in terms of what customers experience in the moment. And again, I just give -- I give an applause to leadership team for what they've done.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And I apologize, I joined the call a little late, so if this has been asked, but like on price versus cost, maybe talk about sort of -- you already talked about supply chain getting better, I think, but sort of what you're seeing on the pricing side versus that sort of improving supply chain? And then maybe looking at Evoqua too, any sort of differences in markets as you're thinking about price versus cost as you go to the second half of this year and into '24.
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. We've seen really nice development on the price cost side, and it continues -- the way we've managed it, it's now been a tailwind for us from a margin perspective. We are starting to anniversary some of the price increases that we took when inflation was peaking. And so you're not going to see as much of a tailwind from price in the back half of the year that you saw in the front half.  The positive thing is that this is actually the first quarter that we've seen inflation start to moderate and come through our results. And we would expect to see a little more of that as well in the back half of the year. So really great work by the commercial teams to make that happen over the past year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: A question on the M&CS margins. Kudos on super solid execution there. I don't think we've seen margins at these levels since I think right after you bought Sensus, so it's been a while. So just trying to get a better sense of what drove that, how sustainable it is? And then what we maybe should be thinking of run rates through year-end. And if you think this is a good sort of jumping off point for potentially getting back to a double-digit margin on a full year basis next year. Is that a reasonable sort of target to have at this point?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start us out and then turn it over to Sandy. But we've spent a lot of time in the past 6 to 12 months, really, the past 12 months on M&CS margins. And I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I would point to. Number one, obviously, we were hampered by chip supply, not being able to unlock the backlog. And so being able to unlock the backlog is really helped with absorption in our factories and helping cover fixed costs. So that's probably number one.  Number two is we're getting back to productivity in that business. We had to redeploy resources to go after redesign our products for chips. And so productivity has increased this year year-over-year, and we'll continue to drive that in the business.  And then thirdly, I would just say, in general, price cost has been a very good positive over the past 2 to 3 quarters in M&CS, which has helped buoy margins as well. So we'll continue that pace going forward and expect margin improvement sequentially going forward.
Patrick Decker: And Brian, this is Patrick. I would just offer up some historical perspective here for those that may be early on in the story here. M&CS is not a turnaround. We -- I mean, this has been an issue in terms of being able to deliver on what has been an impressively growing backlog over the course of the past few years. And we've had margin read-through on what that backlog is for a long time. We've made commitments in the past as to when we reach certain levels of revenue, what the margins would be, that's exactly what you're seeing right now.  So again, I give a shout out to the entire team that drives, especially the metrology part of our business because they've been executing on this ever since we did the acquisition. It's just -- it's always been something along the way. And now we're seeing that the clouds have kind of moved off the horizon and you're now seeing what the full potential or at least the next stage of potential is for this part of our business.
Brian Lee: Okay. That's great. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a second question around -- with the acquisition of Evoqua, clearly much bigger scale, but much more diversification across the business model. It seems like it'd be a lot less cyclical going forward. In the past, I know Evoqua has sort of broken out what the sort of their recurring revenue exposure is as a part of their portfolio or sales mix. Now on the combined entity, any sense you can give us as to how you think about the recurring revenue nature of the different segments where you have exposure there and kind of how that compares to Xylem stand-alone?
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, certainly, great question, Brian. I mean it was certainly not the reason for the acquisition, but certainly, one of the big benefits is that recurring revenue component. The Evoqua business, we have tremendous line of sight going into any given year based upon contractual commitments as to what that looks like. And so you're talking about the largest portion of their revenue is predictable and repeatable going into the year. And so -- and that really is ISS, which is obviously the largest part of what we got from Evoqua.  If you look at the other parts of our business, historically, our M&CS business, which is metrology, also has a lot of revenue under contract. And so a majority of revenue there is visible going into the year, but not even one year. It's looking at it over the course of a 10- to 12-year time frame, given AMI deals that are there. Water Infrastructure would be the next one, given the fact that we've got such a large installed base of our particularly submersible wastewater pumps, but also our treatment products that we do that are typically long-term kind of projects that we're operating under. And it's just a very stable repair replacement environment. We feel very good about that.  The area -- the business that's always been shorter cycle for us is our Applied Water business. But even there, we would say upwards of 1/3 to 40% of our revenue, while it's not under contract, it's a replacement model. And once you've spec your pumps into a commercial building, or an industrial application, the likelihood of a customer changing out to a new supplier is very low. It's very sticky, and we have market-leading positions there. So even though it's not contractual, we can kind of have that visibility going into the year.  So we will -- in the future, we'll give you specific numbers in the aggregate. I don't want to overcommit to that right now, but we feel very good about the durability and nature of recurring revenue of this business much more now than we did a quarter ago because of bringing in Evoqua.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, again, I mean, thanks to all of you for your time this morning and for your ongoing support. I look forward to seeing many of you over the coming months here before our next call. And just a reminder, lastly, again, really excited today about the power of the combination of 2 companies coming together that were strong on their own and performing well. And now is the time. It's the right time in this world for these 2 companies to come together because there are so many great water challenges out there to be dealt with, and we feel that we are in a position to really be a meaningful part of that. So thank you all very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

For the purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. Non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning everyone. As we indicated in our press release this morning, the team delivered very strong operational performance in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations on revenue, margin, and earnings per share.  Revenue grew 17% and Earnings per share was up 53%, and we delivered significant EBITDA margin expansion, driven by volume growth on modest supply chain improvements, productivity and operating efficiency, as well as a healthy price/cost mix. We saw backlog growth of 8%, alongside double-digit organic revenue growth in utilities, industrial and commercial. And growth across all regions, most notably the U.S., Western Europe, and key emerging markets, such as Africa, Latin America and China. The team came into the year with good momentum and has capitalized on supply chain improvements and our competitive position to secure customer advantages and convert our backlog. The results reflect resilient underlying demand, as evidenced by sequential orders growth in each segment, our very healthy $3.7 billion backlog, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than one in each segment. Given the team's operating discipline, the continued demand for our solutions and the intensifying long-term secular trends in water, we are confident about our momentum and growth outlook.  So based on that, we’re raising our full-year organic revenue guidance to high single-digits from mid-single-digits and we're raising our EPS guidance. Of course, we'll continue to monitor demand trends, given some macro uncertainty in the broader economy, especially for the second half of the year, but we remain confident in our position for the remainder of the year and beyond. Alongside this quarter's performance, we've also made great progress towards the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. Integration planning is well advanced, and all necessary approval processes are moving ahead as planned. We continue to expect the transaction to close by mid-year. We'll give more color on the Evoqua culmination in a moment, as well as more detail on our outlook end markets and regions. But first, let me now hand it over to Sandy to review the quarter's results.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our first quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team built on our momentum coming into 2023 with another healthy quarter of growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 17% Year-over-Year, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. In a moment, we'll look at detailed performance by segment, but in short, each segment grew double-digits and exceeded our expectations. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 23% with strength in the U.S. driven by continued chip supply improvements in M&CS, as well as price and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure.  Industrial, which is approximately 35% of revenues, grew 13% with strong price realization and solid demand across all regions, particularly in Western Europe. Commercial, which is approximately 10% of our revenues, was up 16% mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S.  And Residential, our smallest end market with approximately 5% of revenues, was modestly down. Orders performance overall was better than expected and underlying demand remains resilient.  M&CS was down 17% due to unusually high orders growth of 25% last year as a function of supply-chain lead times. Water Infrastructure orders were up 1% and AWS was down 1%. EBITDA margin was 16.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes and favorable price cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.72, up 53% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment in a bit more detail.  M&CS, revenue was up 32%, driven by better-than-expected recovery in chip supply. We saw double-digit growth, not only in metrology, but across our M&CS businesses, including Test and Measurement and Pipeline Assessment Services. There was strong performance across all regions, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. As mentioned, M&CS, orders were down in the quarter, but up sequentially.  Demand for our AMI offering remains healthy and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 8% versus the prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 690 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Robust volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now, let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure revenues were up 15% versus our guide of high single-digits, due to better price realization globally and stronger-than-expected demand in emerging markets. Growth exceeded our expectations across the portfolio, with revenues up double-digits in all regions and end markets. Geographically, the U.S. was up 22%, with strong price realization on utilities, OpEx demand and backlog execution. Western Europe grew 10%, with robust demand in utilities and industrial. Emerging markets was also up low double-digits, driven by strong OpEx demand in Latin America, Africa and China. Orders in the quarter were up sequentially and up 1% year over year versus double-digit growth last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 80 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix and strategic investments in digital and solutions selling, partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics. And please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of AWS.  Applied Water revenues grew 10% on strong price realization and improved supply chain. Geographically, Western Europe was up 17% due to backlog execution and healthy industrial and commercial demand. The U.S. was up 10%, driven by backlog execution and strong price realization, particularly in the commercial market. Emerging markets was down low-single digits, primarily due to lapping double-digit growth last year in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And while orders were down 1% in the quarter, they were stronger than expected and notably, book-to-bill was greater than one.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 480 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued strong price realization and productivity, more than offsetting inflation. And now, let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  Our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $800 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1x. Due to seasonality, free cash flow was negative in the quarter, but came in better than expected. While supply chain challenges are not yet behind us, we've made significant progress on working capital and we remain confident in our full-year guidance of 100% conversion. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand it back to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Although it's still early in the year, we look forward with confidence. We have strong momentum coming out of the first quarter, thanks to the team's continued operating discipline and resilient market demand. We'll be even better positioned for growth as we combine Xylem's market-leading portfolio with Evoqua's capabilities and presence in very attractive industrial end markets. And global trends are continuing to drive increasing investment in addressing critical water challenges, reinforcing the foundation of our long-term strategy. While we've been ensuring our team remains focused on meeting customer needs, winning in the marketplace and delivering on operational execution, we've also been preparing for our upcoming combination with Evoqua, which positions us even more favorably for the next phase of Xylem's growth.  As water risks rise in global importance, the combination of these two companies creates a transformative platform for solving customers and communities' most critical water challenges at scale. As we said in January, the deal economics prove out on cost synergies alone. But more importantly, the combined company is positioned for very attractive growth, increasing recurring and resilient revenues and significant margin expansion opportunities in addition to the foundational cost synergies.  On top of this, the combination is supported by a robust financial position and an even stronger balance sheet, which preserves our optionality for the future. Since our January announcement of the transaction, an integration planning team comprising of senior staff from both companies has been working to set the company up for success.  The integration is rooted in four simple principles: first, avoid distraction and deliver our 2023 plans; second, deliver on committed revenue and cost synergies; third, retain, motivate and develop key talent from each company; and lastly, bring the best of both cultures to the combined company. As we advance in the integration process, our confidence and excitement about the synergy potential of the combination continues to grow. And I'm sure many of you have seen Evoqua's second quarter results announced just two days ago. Based on their earnings release, it’s clear both Xylem and Evoqua have strong momentum. We’re remaining focused on serving our customers and delivering on our respective plans for the year. In addition to a solid quarter and confident outlook for the year, we also continue to see evidence of the intensifying secular trends at the foundation of our strategy. In March, the United Nations held its first water conference in over 40 years. It's one of many indicators of the global shift in attention to water and the focus on water's role in sustainable development. Xylem’s delegation engaged with government leaders and development agencies from around the world, particularly on the role of technology and innovation and improving water security. Despite the different worlds the private sector, government and NGOs often inhabit, sustainability is a powerful common language. For example, there was considerable discussion at the conference about water management and greenhouse gas emissions, as water management drives roughly 10% of emissions globally. It's a particular focus in our work with customers, helping them reduce their emissions. And as you'll see in our 2022 sustainability report to be released this month, we've enabled customers to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint, achieving that specific Xylem 2025 sustainability goal well ahead of plan. That's a meaningful step, but there's a long way to go in decarbonizing the water sector more broadly.  Fortunately, we are in the privileged position of helping customers achieve their net-zero carbon goals by deploying more efficient technologies that reduce emissions and their operating costs, ultimately making water more affordable for our communities. That is work that we're both purpose-driven and commercially motivated to do. Our sustainability report also details the progress we've made across the full suite of our 2025 sustainability goals. And I invite each and every one of you to give it your full attention when it's released in the coming days. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Matthew to provide a view on our end market outlook.
Matthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. Before I dive into the end market outlook, I want to congratulate the team on a great quarter. We exceeded our expectations across the board and made great progress on productivity initiatives, leading to healthy margin expansion. Overall, we are well-positioned to continue building on this momentum through the rest of the year. Looking ahead, we have taken a balanced approach in our outlook. Given the dynamics of the macroeconomic environment. Our backlogs are strong and underlying demand in our largest end markets continues to be resilient, providing confidence to raise our 2023 guide. That said, we are closely monitoring leading indicators and some of our more cyclical businesses, particularly in developed markets. We expect continued steady demand in emerging markets and are optimistic about a gradual recovery in China through the rest of the year. Utilities, which makes up the largest end market, continues to be healthy, and we now expect growth in low teens in 2023, up from high single-digits. On the wastewater side, we expect high single-digit growth up from mid-single-digit growth. We expect OpEx strength in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will result in steady global demand. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of high-teens, up from low-teens. This increase in our outlook is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and earlier improvements in chip supply through 2023 as seen in quarter one, allowing for backlog execution. We continue to foresee healthy momentum in our Test and Measurement, and our Pipeline Assessment Service businesses, due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. We are also seeing early benefits from the unification of our commercial team in the Americas. The team has made great progress in solution selling to our utility customers, bringing the best of Xylem's offerings to bear solving our customers' highest value challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for solutions globally. While U.S. industrial production estimates point to potential softening in the back-half of 2023, we expect that to be offset by growth in emerging markets and were supported by our backlog. In addition, our dewatering business continues to see strong demand from mining and emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and is benefiting from strategic investments we've made in our fleet. Moving on to commercial given Q1 out performance, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digits. We anticipate continued growth, driven by solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by new construction. We would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results and our monitoring the ABI institutional index and other indicators closely. In residential, our smallest end market, we continue to expect a low-single digit decline, due to normalizing demand in U.S., partially offset by continued resilience in emerging markets. Overall, we feel confident about the resiliency of demand, given our backlog and healthy orders momentum. Now, I will turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As a reminder, our guidance is on a stand-alone basis and excludes the combination with Evoqua. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We are raising our full-year organic revenue growth to 8% to 9%, up from 4% to 6%. This increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization and earlier-than-expected supply chain improvements in the year. In addition, we are lifting our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.35, up from $3 to $3.25. The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: high teens growth in M&CS versus previous guidance of low teen; high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single-digit growth with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low-single digits with growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential. For 2023, our EBITDA guidance is 17.5% to 18%. And as mentioned, this yields an adjusted EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35. We still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. And we've also provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions on the slide to supplement your model. And now drilling down on the second quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 10% to 11% organic growth. By segment, we expect high-teens growth for M&CS and high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. We expect second-quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which represents over 100 basis points of improvement versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance, demonstrating continuing dedication to serving our customers and communities and delivering very strong results. Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing that momentum while also executing a successful integration of Evoqua once the deal closes. We look forward to updating you on that combination in our next earnings call, when I anticipate we will be presenting the performance, outlook and opportunity of our combined company. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hi, good morning, Deane.
Sandy Rowland: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray: These are impressive numbers on organic revenue growth and the margins, especially total company margins, but that takes me to the first question on Water Infrastructure. And I know this is seasonally the lowest margin for that segment. But you called out three factors: mix, timing of projects, and some investments like in digital. And I was just hoping if you could size these and maybe give some additional color. Thanks.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Deane, great question. I think you highlighted some really important points. First of all, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter for our Water Infrastructure business. On an EBITDA basis, we were down about 80 bps this quarter. It's really essentially all-in gross profit and it really comes down to two or three items. One, just product mix, a little bit of geographic mix. And we had some larger-scale projects this quarter that typically carry modestly lower margins. And then, we have been continuing to make some investments in this segment. It talks to our optimism about its long-term prospects. And those investments have been really focused on increasing our digital selling and solution selling capabilities, and we're seeing proof of that investment come through in our orders momentum and growth.  And I think, Deane, when you look forward to the rest of the year, we think that Water Infrastructure margins are going to rebound in Q2 and the rest of the year in line with our typical seasonality.
Deane Dray: All right. That was exactly what. I was looking for. 
Patrick Decker: Hey Deane I would just offer - this is Patrick - that margin improvement is also supported by what we have in backlog. So these orders that are being won based on these investments support that continued improvement in margins.
Deane Dray: That's great. And that kind of takes me to the next question on M&CS and the chip supply. And Patrick, I remember when this first surfaced, and it was everywhere that everyone was getting these chip supply shortages and it just accentuated the point that Xylem is, from a smart water standpoint, so dependent on semiconductors. But at the time when it was most uncertain, you all said it would be a gradual expectations for a gradual improvement in the supply, and that's exactly how it's been playing out. So where you stand today, how does the backlog look in terms of like past due of M&CS chips, and is just - should we expect this kind of gradual improvement for the balance of the year? Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Sure, thanks for the question, Deane. I'll hand it over to Matthew to give more color on it.
Matthew Pine: Hi. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we had, for sure, better-than-expected results in Q1 in metrology. The chip supply continues to be lumpy, but it is continuing to move at a steady incremental pace, to your point. Our backlog continues to be 30% past due. That was last quarter as well because of the continued orders momentum that we've seen in this business, up 8% in metrology, in M&CS. And so we're going to continue to expect modest improvement, and we're still managing the variation in supply. And the one thing I would point out, as a lot of you probably remember, is the book-to-bill for automotive and industrial chips is still plus one. So we're still kind of working through this problem where on the consumer side, you're seeing a little bit more relief. So we're just going to be steady as it goes over the coming quarters, and we'll see those modest improvements. And with those modest improvements, we've taken up our guide from low-teens to high-teens for 2023 for M&CS.
Patrick Decker: And I would just offer that as well that, one, we’ve continued to hold on to all of our deals in backlog. There have been no cancellations. And so that's continued to be a good sign as we deliver - as we say we're going to deliver. And then certainly, two, as Matthew pointed out, continue to see really strong demand and end market wins, despite the chip supply challenges. So I think the confidence has grown over the course of the past year and more.
Deane Dray: Great, that's really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hi. Good morning, Nate.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on the M&CS guidance, chip supply, etcetera, et cetera. I mean, the guidance going from mid-teens to high-teens pretty much just considers the outperformance in the first quarter. If you model it out, the dollars of revenue each quarter doesn't really change for the remaining three quarters. I know you guys have talked about better chip supply, you have product redesigns to use more available chips that come in the back half. Is there still a little bit of maybe overly conservative approach to the guidance for M&CS, just given the improvements that you're seeing plus these product redesigns that start coming out, I think, probably in the third quarter?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Nate, let me give that a shot. First of all, we're really pleased with what we saw, from a delivery perspective in Q1, and we got out of the gate with a fast start this year. When we look at the next quarter for M&CS, we actually think it looks very similar to what we experienced in Q1. So good strong business in metrology, but also the other businesses that we have in analytics and assessment services, when it all comes together, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar. And then when we look at the back half of the year, we've got embedded in our guide a modest ramp-up in the back half. And we've got to continue to monitor the chip supply situation. It is not perfect operationally yet.
Matthew Pine: Yes. I would just add, we're trying to be prudent with the guide. To Sandy's point in the back half, we still don't have good visibility. We do - I call it the daily miracle, we're managing decommits and push outs and come ins of chips, and we're just trying to manage the guide and be prudent in the second half.
Nathan Jones: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe just following up on the 30% of backlog that’s past due, I anticipate that at some point here, the chip supply is going to get significantly better, and you could probably manufacture more than your customers are going to be ready to take, with the bottleneck likely becoming utility labor to go and install these things. How do you think about the progression of that 30% past due working that down to whatever a normal level of past due is and actually burning some of this backlog down '24 or '25, as we go along?
Matthew Pine: Yes, we'll progressively work the backlog down as the chips come to be more fluid. The bottleneck is not going to be - well the bottleneck now is chip supply, but the next bottleneck will not be our capacity. To your point, it's going to be really working with our customers to make sure they have the deployment capacity. And that's something we're planning on right now and really getting ahead and looking out and projecting with our customers through really the end of 2024 in lining up that capacity for deployment. So we're lockstep with our customers to make sure that we've got that set up as the chip supply continues to improve, that the deployment capacity does not become a bottleneck as we move through 2023 and through 2024.
Patrick Decker: I would offer up, Nate, as well -
Nathan Jones: Thank you, Matt.
Patrick Decker: As you probably know, Nate, the nature of these deployments at a utility level, these are years in the development and the approval process. And the main concern the part of utilities is that once they begin to get chip supply, that there’s a steady installation progress for them, so that there's no concerns by regulators as to whether not an approved deal was actually ever going to happen. So once, as long as you're showing steady improvement and deployment, the labor issue will not be a major bottleneck in terms of a major slowdown. And so, there’ll be a good steady progression.
Nathan Jones: Okay. So, I'll pass it on. Thanks for taking my questions.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Nate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joe Giordano: Hi, good morning guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Joe.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: So I guess going through this earnings season, we've heard a lot of companies talking about changing in customer buying patterns a little bit and maybe April trends being worse than what the average of the first quarter was. So just curious if you have anything to say there. I'm probably talking more on the industrial side than on the utility side there.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I mean, Joe, we saw nothing surprising coming out of our April results. Obviously, we're in the process of closing the books there for that month, but nothing has jumped out to be out-of-the-ordinary or change from what we saw in Q1.
Patrick Decker: And Joe, I think it's also safe to say that one of the things we track, not only in industrial, but across the entire portfolio is our bidding pipeline. And that bidding pipeline continues to be very healthy and growing consistently, so another good indicator. Matthew, you can probably talk to our channel partners on what you're hearing there in terms of the health of their inventory levels.
Matthew Pine: So from a channel inventory point of view, we do have really good visibility because we have strong relationships with our channel partners. And overall, I'd say levels are healthy, and they're not sitting on excess inventory. On the industrial front, there's not a lot of inventory, it's configured to order, engineered to order. But we have seen good demand in that area, specifically in emerging markets in the first quarter was really strong and resilient in industrial. Utilities, specifically in wastewater OpEx, that's been really healthy, and really resilient through the past 18 months, given our vertical integration in that segment.  On the commercial front, we're still not back to 2019 levels given the continued supply challenges and constraints that we feel in the commercial part of our business. And then lastly, which is resi is the smallest portion of our business. It's well-stocked, and we're seeing a little bit of moderation there.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. And then, Patrick on Evoqua, I know you can't say a whole lot, but is there anything you can - any update at all on timing or what are you currently waiting on? And then what can you say about what you've done internally to kind of prepare for this coming in? I know you're not you're not just sitting around waiting for approval. So can you maybe give us a little insight into getting the organization prepped for this?
Patrick Decker: Sure, yes. No, thanks, Joe. So just on the transaction itself, as I said in our - in our comments, I mean, really pleased with the progress. I'm proud of the team. I mean is a ton of work that goes into this from both companies, while people are doing their day jobs. So a lot of great progress there. There were several countries, obviously, beyond the U.S., that required approval. We've achieved clearance in all of those countries. The only remaining country is China. In China, our filing has been accepted for what we call a short-form review, which typically takes no more than 30 days. And we're moving well through that, and don't expect any issues there. And so, we've got our shareholder votes coming up on May 11th, both sets of shareholders. So we will get through that next week. And again, for all those reasons, we continue to expect to close this by mid-year. So that's on the transaction closure. You're right, we've got a dedicated integration planning team. I've spent a considerable amount of time with Ron Keating, their CEO and his leadership team. Matthew has spent a considerable amount of time with them as well. We've had many, many integration planning meetings. And on the cost side, clear line of sight to what we committed to before, that being $140 million in three years in very simple, straightforward areas. I didn't say simple is easy, but they're simple, but we are not going after rabbits here. We're going after big items, and deliver those as quickly as possible. And again, what we've always been most excited about is the growth synergy. And so, looking there, you're right, we are somewhat limited on how much detail we can get into until we have final regulatory approvals from a competitive standpoint. But as the teams have worked together, we're even more excited about the top-line growth synergies that are out there. As we've mentioned before, we’re most excited about the opportunity to deepen our penetration within utilities of the combined portfolio, to expand both their integrated services and solutions business on the industrial side internationally, but also a number of their treatment products that we can take through our channels internationally. We both have efforts going on around digital services and solutions, and opportunities to leverage our combined platform there to serve needs for different customer sets around the world. And then there's going to be opportunity in synergy in the areas of R&D and innovation, as well as some of our portfolio enhancements in that area. Obviously, Joe, as you know, some of these synergies are going to materialize sooner than later. And we'll be in a position that, once we get the transaction closed, in an upcoming call to give you more clarity on that in terms of how we're thinking about enhanced growth rates of the new company.
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open.
Mike Halloran: Hi, morning, everyone. So
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So following up a little bit on, I think, Nate's first question. So you think about - you've seen some steady deployments here, well you're expecting steady deployments here on the M&CS side over the next period of time here, call it a couple of years, which should give you some pretty good visibility. Doesn't it sound like the lag in deployments and delays in deployments have impacted call it, that order cadence. It seems like the bottom was back-half of the year and first quarter saw some nice sequential improvement on that side. I guess I'd like to understand a little bit about what that back fill looks like, what the conversations are looking like, from a pipeline perspective on that side? And how you think about the visibility here over the next period of time when you put those two together? The deployment piece and then how that pipeline and thought process with the customers is going?
Matthew Pine: Yes. Hi, Mike. It's Matthew. We feel really bullish on it. You can see our orders growth in Q1 was 8%. Maybe just take a step back and look at AMI adoption in total for the U.S., it's only around 30% today. And there's a very strong value proposition for this offering for our utility partners to make them more productive and more efficient in their business. And that's something, coming through the pandemic, they've really gotten laser-focused on. And I would say even with digital, in general, have really latched onto and started to ramp-up their capabilities. So we're very bullish over the - over the long term there will be more and more adoption. We're still kind of in the early innings, kind of 30% in. And then when you take a step-back and look around the globe, other parts of the world are a decade behind the U.S. in adoption of AMI networks. So as we not only work the U.S. marketplace and the U.K., which is also very similar to the U.S., we're now starting to focus on the international front and how we can improve our opportunities there is funding for non-revenue water and smart metering really picks up to some of the subsidies that are coming out in Europe.
Patrick Decker: And, Mike, it would be worth - Matthew, maybe if you want to give an update. We haven't talked about the Idrica partnership that we announced last earnings call, because that really speaks also to what utilities are doing around the digital side and what we're seeing there in terms of early wins.
Matthew Pine: Yes, just to reframe it just for folks that were not on the last call, it's an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide. It is a SaaS business model. Idrica is headquartered in Valentia, Spain. They're a leader in what we call data management and analytics. And as we’re out talking to a lot of our utility customers, the biggest pain point we hear from these partners, is the need to have a singular platform to integrate all of their applications and data. They have multiple applications, passwords, logins, siloed information, and this really gives us the platform, much like a smartphone, like in iOS platform to be able to integrate all these disparate systems. It's a proven platform. It's been deployed in over 300-plus utilities. What I like to say a lot is it's built by utility operator for utilities. They actually understand utility workflows, which is really important, coupled with our application knowledge that we have as an OEM. Our teams are building strong commercial momentum. Sandy talked about investments that we're making around the globe, especially in Europe, on digital investments and solution selling to deploy this platform. And we've built a significant funnel over the past three months. And it's really - it also enables us to pull through a significant amount of Xylem content. Now, I would say on the next call, we'll be in a much better position to kind of get into some detail on that as it matures over the next 90 days.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then maybe a similar conversation, obviously, you don’t have the deployment component necessarily with the core utility pieces within your infrastructure business, but maybe a similar conversation about bidding pipeline, thoughts, domestic versus international and the ability to maintain the momentum on the pump in the treatment side there.
Matthew Pine: Yes. So I'd say, in Water Infrastructure, the utility business, obviously, OpEx is very strong around the world. We haven't seen a really slow-down in CapEx either. If you think about Europe specifically, they're really wedded to making sure they spend their CapEx. And although, I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole of the infrastructure bill, but over time that will start to drip out and start to really provide long-term support and demand in the utility space with Water Infrastructure, both in the U.S. and around the world. There’s other programs like the European Recovery and Resiliency Act, you've got the AMP cycle the U.K. And all of these are coming online in the next - anywhere from six to 12 to 18 months to really buoy and lift the demand signal for that sector.
Patrick Decker: And Mike, a couple of other proof points. We look very much at the treatment bidding pipeline, because that's a leading indicator for the health of the wastewater side of utilities. And that bidding pipeline continues to grow off of record levels, to our backlog in Water Infrastructure itself was up 14% in the quarter. So really indicating strong health there in that part of the business.
Mike Halloran: Great. Really appreciate it everyone. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Scott Davis: Good morning, team.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: I was just kind of curious on how you guys think about the kind of long-term growth algorithm of industrial versus industrial production indicators and when I think about the ebbs and flows, there's so much of the installed base that's probably inefficient. At this point, it could be pulled out. And there's all these new projects, mega projects that we talk a lot about, including some pretty high intensity stuff like semi fabs, I would imagine you guys have a lot of content on. So is there any way to kind of quantify or think about growing 2x IP or 3x or 1.5x. Just kind of curious how you guys think about it internally.
Patrick Decker: Yes, Scott, great question. So I'll put a caveat upfront and say once we close the transaction with Evoqua, we'll be able to talk much more around how we view their growth outlook and the growth outlook of the combined company, both stand-alone but also through the revenue synergies that we're targeting. But as we just look at our respective participation in the industrial piece of the business, I would say for Xylem because of the nature of what we currently sell into the industrial base tends to be more of a GDP kind of business. We're selling into the periphery of manufacturing facilities. And so as long as the facilities are up and running, they're burning through various types of pumps that we sell replacement into. It’s a good business, good steady, but it's going to typically be in that low-single digit, sometimes mid-single-digit kind of growth.  When you look at what Evoqua does, they're providing very different water management services into the so called industrial users of water. And what drives the growth there, which historically has been in that kind of at least mid-single digit, if not even higher than that, depending upon where they are in the cycle is and this is where we do believe it will outpace broader GDP growth, is because of the increased demands coming into those users around: one, making sure they have access to sustainable water supply to keep their operations up and running. The value of water to them is not the price they pay-per gallon or leader. It’s not a big number for them. The value of water to them is when they don't have it and they are operating in water stressed areas and they have production stoppage and it's lost revenue margin.  The second is the increased regulatory pressure on them to manage their discharge of wastewater. And so, fines, penalties, but also reputational concerns they have and making sure they're seen as responsible citizens in the community. So those are the pressures that we see are really driving the demand right now in that part of what we call the industrial sector of water, and we see that can continuing.
Scott Davis: That's super helpful, Patrick. Am I correct to assume that a semiconductor fab is going to have a pretty large TAM for you guys.
Patrick Decker: Yes. That is correct.
Scott Davis: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Hi, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: Probably for Matthew. I know you've been working on a number of initiatives to enhance Xylem's productivity. Obviously, Xylem raised revenue guidance nicely for '23. I think you kept your margins. So maybe just more color on the progress you're making and what would you see going forward there?
Matthew Pine: Yes, I mean I'll start this off and then maybe turn it over to Sandy to kind of wrap this up. But we see really good momentum in driving productivity, Andy, in the business. There are several different areas that we were addressing in doing that, whether it's across simplifying our portfolio, reducing SKUs, making our factories more efficient, in what we build and really moving the long-tail out. In terms of footprint, I mean continued factory rationalization is obviously another point that we're looking at. Also within our M&CS businesses, as we continue to move that business forward, getting after productivity there has been a focus area of ours. It’s been kind of a 2.5% of spend, and we need to get that up around 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, which is kind of typical of the other two segments. So that's another big focus area as well. And also within M&CS too, if you kind of unpack the backlog, the shift to water - the water mix will pick up over time and provide some nice drop-through in high-caliber margin. So it's a combination of things that we're looking at, holistically, across the business to make sure, over time, we continue to build sequential momentum in the margin line.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. What I'd add on top of that, Andy, is obviously we're very focused on margin expansion and the goals we set for our organization for 2023 contemplated significant margin expansion. I think we've gotten out of the gate with a good start there. And if you look at what we're thinking about the rest of the year, one of the items that we're focused on is what do the incremental margins look like? And our guide contemplates 30% incremental margins at a period where we're continuing to make investments and a period of time where we don't have the most optimal mix, as we work on the deployment. So I think we feel good about where we landed and we're going to continue to be focused on productivity through the rest of the year. And we're going to be focused on making sure that our discretionary costs remain tight.
Patrick Decker: Yes. We're by no means satisfied yet with even where we are saying margins are going to be this year. Obviously, we're going to continue to run hard to drive those up even more. But again, we feel it's a responsible, prudent guide at this point in time.
Andy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And then Patrick, you talked a little bit about Europe and the U.S., in terms of regions, but I think China's been a bit of a drag on your performance in the past. It seems to look a little better in Q1. But what are you seeing out of that region in the near-term going forward?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. It has been talked about a lot. And it really is an emerging bright spot for us because we absorbed some pretty challenging numbers there last year. And you know that I’m a long-term bull on China, just given where they are in the overall investment cycle, from a water standpoint. So, orders in Q1 and revenue were both up high single-digit and outperformed there. Really encouraged by the reopening across China and what's happening from a GDP standpoint there. It really sets us up for a pretty strong year. I would say that we're seeing a faster recovery in the industrial and commercial piece of the market there, than we are utilities. But utilities based upon our bidding pipeline and backlog are set to recover in the second half. So that's a further tailwind for us. And again, the funnel remains very healthy there. So, encouraged by it. Still a long way to go, but we expect it to be a tailwind this year.
Andy Kaplowitz: Helpful color. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Matthew Pine: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, again, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest and questions and the support. Look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call. And I'm sure we'll see many of you at various conferences between now and then. As always, stay safe. And I look forward to speaking to you again.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release, the team delivered a very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations across each segment and region. Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered 20% revenue growth for the quarter and healthy EBITDA margin expansion. That performance continued and built upon the team's solid delivery through the year, fueling healthy momentum coming into 2023. On a full year basis, revenue grew 11% and earnings per share grew 14%. Water Infrastructure grew 15% in the quarter on robust utilities and industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the segment was up 12% for the full year. M&CS posted very strong fourth quarter performance. This segment was up 35% in the quarter on backlog execution from improved chip supply and continued strong demand, bringing full year growth to 8%. Applied Water grew 17% in the quarter and finished 2022 with 14% growth for the full year. Overall, higher volumes and positive price cost performance drove significant EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, up 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago. The team delivered that growth and margin performance on continuing resilient demand globally. We saw healthy orders growth sequentially. And for the full year, orders were up 4%, demonstrating the durability of our business. I am so proud of the team's performance in serving our customers and of their commitment to our purpose, solving water. The global trends driving investment in water systems continue to intensify. And as today's results demonstrate, we are already very strongly positioned to address them. That said, our recent agreement to acquire Evoqua announced 2 weeks ago, will create a powerful platform to address the world's most critical water challenges with greater capability, depth and scale. We've begun the important work of integration planning to set the combined company up for success and are well into the process of seeking the necessary approvals. Until the deal closes, which we anticipate will be midyear, we remain focused on delivering results to the stakeholders we serve today. On that stand-alone basis, we see continuing resilient demand in our largest end markets, particularly utilities, despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness, Execution of our backlogs with ongoing price cost discipline, further supply chain improvements and a return to 100% free cash flow conversion. We expect that this will allow us to deliver 2023 organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $3 and $3.25, up 10% versus last year at the midpoint of the range. We'll give more color on the outlook and guide in a moment, but first, I'll hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we look ahead at 2023.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team closed out a strong 2022 with another quarter of robust growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year, led by 26% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in Western Europe and the emerging markets. In a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 24%, with strength in the U.S. driven by chip supply improvements in M&CS, and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 15% on particularly strong demand in Western Europe and emerging markets and sustained strength in the U.S. Commercial was up 24%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S. and Western Europe. And residential was up 17%, driven by strength in emerging markets, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Compared to prior year, orders were down 3% in the quarter versus up 23% in the same period last year, but underlying demand remains resilient and in line sequentially. Water Infrastructure orders were up 13%, AWS down 6% and M&CS down 19%, following exceptionally high orders last year. However, M&CS orders were in line with the last quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. EBITDA margin was 18.7%, up 250 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially on strong volume and price, which more than offset inflation. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.92, up 46% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure outperformed expectations with revenues up 15% in the quarter. Growth was robust across the portfolio, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and industrial strength in emerging markets on continued dewatering demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up 26% with solid price realization on strong utilities OpEx demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. Foster Europe grew low double digits, driven by healthy industrial activity and emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by dewatering demand in Latin America and Africa. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 13% with solid dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utility strength in the U.S. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 80 basis points as price, net of inflation and volume conversion more than offset strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. The Applied Water segment also exceeded expectations with fourth quarter revenues up 17% on strong price realization and backlog execution. Geographically, Western Europe was up over 20%, led by supply chain improvements and strong industrial and commercial demand. Emerging Markets was up mid-double digits on strong residential demand in the Middle East and India. The U.S. was up low double digits as supply chain improvements and price realization were partially offset by moderating residential volumes. Orders were down 6% in the quarter, with healthy industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, offset by slowing U.S. residential orders. Segment EBITDA margin was up 270 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by continued strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation and further supplemented by productivity savings. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 35%, driven by recoveries in chip supply year-over-year and strong project execution in our test and measurement and pipeline assessment services businesses. Geographically, all regions were up more than 20%, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. M&CS orders were down 19% in the quarter, lapping a prior year compare of 28% orders growth during the peak of supply chain constraints. Demand for our AMI offering remains strong and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 14% versus prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 800 basis points versus the prior year and importantly, 130 basis points quarter sequentially. Strong volume conversion, coupled with price realization offsetting inflation, drove the expansion. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $302 million. The team did a great job driving down working capital to hit our previous outlook of 80% free cash flow conversion for the year. While inventory remains elevated versus where we targeted to be longer term, as there still are pockets of the supply chain that necessitate the extra safety stock that we are carrying, our performance in Q4 gives us confidence in our path to return to 100% conversion in 2023. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with over $900 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. And this is after paying down over $500 million of debt in December. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.0x. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2023.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team did an excellent job delivering for our customers and communities in 2022. Their commitment and performance stood out during a tumultuous year of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty; lingering pandemic effects, especially in China; and a challenging supply chain environment. I'm very proud of everything the team achieved, and they are already carrying all that commercial momentum, operational discipline and resilience into 2023. As we look forward, we see continued healthy demand in our major markets despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness in certain sectors of the global economy. We expect that the essential nature of our solutions and the secular trends in water will continue to underpin demand in the attractive, stable end markets that we serve. And we expect to be even better able to serve that demand as supply chain friction continues to ease, and we can progressively work down our $3.6 billion backlogs. Looking ahead, we are advancing our strategic delivery of solutions to the acquisition of Evoqua. As I mentioned earlier, and as you would expect, until the deal closes, we are only providing organic guidance for Xylem on a stand-alone basis. But there's no doubt that the combination of Xylem's global utility scale and Evoqua's strength in attractive industrial end markets creates a powerful platform for growth. We expect significant revenue synergies in areas such as cross-selling of our respective utility and industrial portfolios in North America, and growing Evoqua's international exposure via Xylem's global channels and customer relationships. Now those are just 2 of the areas where we see tremendous potential to add to the growth of the combined companies and expand our value to customers globally, especially in a number of the most attractive water end markets. But it's not the only inorganic move we're making to give customers more of what they need most. We've also taken a big step forward in helping them adopt the digital solutions they need to increase the resilience of communities essential water infrastructure. In the shadow of our big announcement with Evoqua, another important partnership flew under the radar, one which will accelerate and enhance our ability to deliver more digital solutions to the utility customers around the world. Last quarter, we signed an exclusive commercial partnership with Idrica to make adoption of digital technologies easier, faster and more affordable for our utility customers. Headquartered in Valentia, Spain, Idrica is a leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. Idrica's GoAigua platform simplifies deployment and operation of new digital capabilities in any water utilities operations. It gives them one secure integrated interface that brings together data capture, analytics and asset and process management onto 1 platform. Having been born out of a utility operator itself, the platform has the advantage of having been built by utility for utilities, and it's already been deployed by over 300 customers around the world. Under the partnership, we will take a minority stake in Idrica and become the exclusive global distributor of their technology. Together, we will enable more utilities to harness the power of connected solutions. We're very excited about it, and we look forward to sharing more as the partnership progresses. We made one other important announcement recently. This one was just before the end of the year, appointing Matthew Pine as Chief Operating Officer. The move ensures that we have continuing focus on operational excellence from an enterprise perspective across all our business segments and regions to continue delivering on our commitment to faster-than-market revenue growth and margin expansion. At the same time, it's also freed up some of my capacity to deliver on Xylem's strategic evolution and capital deployment. In a moment, we'll turn the call back to Sandy for more detail on our guide. But first, I want to invite Matthew to say a few words on his key areas of focus in the new role and provide some color on our end market outlook. Matthew?
Matthew Pine: Thanks, Patrick. We are very strongly positioned on intensifying trends with technology leadership in a large and growing installed base in attractive end markets. My focus as Chief Operating Officer is to further accelerate profitable growth and maximize the value we deliver to customers and communities around the world. Across the business, we continue to remove complexity, increase our local agility and unlock further scale efficiencies. This is all aimed, of course, at better serving our customers at the same time we deliver continuing margin expansion. We're driving this margin focus across the enterprise, taking particular aim at even more enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, in the M&CS segment, improvements in chip supply enabled us to build momentum, delivering the accretive backlog, we deploy resources back to productivity as well as new product introductions from innovation. Secondly, we continue to enhance our digital portfolio, as Patrick covered. Our customers need simple, integrated digital technologies that solve their problems cost effectively. Our portfolio increasingly meets that demand with attractive growth and margin profiles. Lastly, our customers depend on Xylem as a trusted partner to deliver ongoing support. So our third operational focus is in standardizing our solutions and creating new offerings. This will take us deeper into our installed base with aftermarket sales and services. New offerings such as outcome-based solutions and condition-based maintenance will enable us to capture demand, address customers' needs and expand reoccurring revenues. It's no accident that there's a theme running through all 3 of these priorities. Each is about growing revenues and improving our margins by serving our customers better, more thoroughly and more simply, making it even easier for them to do business with us and solve more of their challenges. When we talk about being in a privileged position, that's not mentally to refer to our strategic or market positioning. It also reflects our view that we are fortunate to work alongside the kind of customers that we do, partner with them to solve their critical water challenges they face. It's a privilege and also a great opportunity for continuing value creation from our shareholders, communities and all stakeholders. Now let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market outlook. We expect underlying demand and most of our end markets will continue to be healthy through 2023. We've taken a balanced view based on the strength of our backlog, critical nature of our largest end markets, and the continued value proposition of our differentiated products. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is our largest end market, will grow high single digits in 2023.  On the wastewater side, we expect mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of steady global demand. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand in developed markets due to the critical nature of our offerings as well as the benefit of continued CapEx spend in emerging markets. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains robust. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues being up low teens. This growth is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and expected improvements in ship supply through 2023, allowing for significant large deal deployments already secured in our backlog. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to go low to mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see strong growth in dewatering due to mining demand in emerging markets and the benefits of our strategic investments in our U.S. and European dewatering business. The commercial end market should deliver low single-digit growth on solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by moderation in new construction. In residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets. In both commercial and residential, we would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results as we continue to work through the backlog in the first half of 2023. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As mentioned, we expect Evoqua to join us in mid-2023. We Until then, our full year guidance is on an organic basis and excludes the combination of the 2 companies. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2023 revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; low single-digit growth in Applied Water from growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential; We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up low teens. For 2023, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. This represents a 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion versus prior year. And this yields an EPS range of $3 to $3.25, up 10% at the midpoint over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 100% of net income. In addition, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 10%, aligned with our capital allocation framework to grow dividends in line with earnings. We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro-to-dollar conversion rate of 1.08 and a foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 7% to 9% growth. By segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low single digits in Applied Water and high teens growth for M&CS. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by higher volumes and more favorable price cost dynamics.  And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2023, very strongly positioned. Our end markets continue to show resilient underlying demand. We're confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion and the team continues to outperform on strong operational and commercial execution. Beyond 2023, we remain well on track to deliver our longer-term strategic and financial milestones. We are very excited about all of the combination of Xylem and Evoqua will offer towards the creation of a more water secure, resilient and sustainable world, while driving value for our shareholders by accelerating growth and scale. The integration team met last week at our headquarters in D.C. The first of many meetings to set us up for success on day 1. And last week, I traveled with Ron Keating, Evoqua's CEO, to a number of their key sites to spend time with their incredibly talented people. Those visits only heighten my appreciation of the potential opportunities ahead and confirm the strong strategic and cultural fit of our 2 companies. We've also taken the next step in the regulatory process, having submitted the required filings here in the U.S. and progressing toward filings in the relevant international jurisdictions. We continue to anticipate the deal closing midyear A great deal of opportunity will open up when we bring our 2 companies together. During our next earnings call, we will provide an update on our progress. Meanwhile, our business remains squarely focused on delivering on our 2023 financial commitments and continuing our commercial momentum and execution.  Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Strong finish to the year, both revenues and margins. And I just want to say congrats again on finally getting to the altar on Evoqua. This has made strategic sense for so long. And have a midyear target closing is lightning fast in our view. I know that there's a lot of heavy lifting. So best of luck.
Patrick Decker: Thank you very much, Deane.
Deane Dray: Can we start with M&CS margins? It sounds like the 2 drivers here, the chip supply improving, and this has been kind of a steady story for the past couple of quarters. How much have you worked through that backlog? And how much of the chip supply improvement contributed to the margin improvement in the segment? And then I've seen a nice shutout for pipeline assessment. Is this all pure and what's driving that?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Deane, thanks for the question. Let me start, and Matt can add some color here. So we are very pleased with our Q4 performance in M&CS. The year has unfolded very much like we thought it would with continuing improvement in chip supply. The story in Q4 is actually a twofold story. We saw some upside compared to what we had forecast, and half of that upside came from some better chip supply. And the other half of the upside came from some of our other businesses in the portfolio that we don't talk as much about. So our pipeline assessment services business, a lot of projects were completed in Q4, really good results in our test and measurement business. And all of -- the entire portfolio across M&CS has good margin potential and good leverage. And so as we've got the top line going again, we're really encouraged that you're seeing that drop to the bottom line.
Matthew Pine: Yes. I think the only thing I would add, Deane, is that we did pivot in Q4 to a more continuous improvement as we started to roll off of our product redesigns. So we saw a really good lift in Q4 and continuous improvement. And if you look at the price cost and the exit rate in Q4, it was really solid building momentum. This was -- if you recall, this was the last segment to really be impacted by inflation and really overcoming that in Q4, which also led to the margin improvement.
Deane Dray: All sounds good. And just as a follow-up, I was hoping to get some more color on this announcement of the software platform investment at Idrica. If you listen to all of the trade shows and conferences, the biggest pain point for utilities is they get so much data, but none of it is connected, and it's all different formats. So this sounds really promising if it's one platform that then is able to integrate all of this. So some color on the pricing. Is this a SaaS business? Is it on-prem? Is it licensed? How will it fit in terms of the revenue stream? And you've got 300 customers now. What's the pipeline for new customers, new logos?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So Deane, I'll just make a few comments, and I'll have Matthew go a little deeper because Matthew was part of the team that was integral to this courtship over the course of the past year or more. So he's well versed along with other team members on the opportunity here. But you're right, you said it best. It's the amalgamation of data coming from different data sources that we refer to as the power babble, with different languages, different code, and it makes it very difficult for the utility to optimize their overall network. So that's really what Idrica is getting at. They got a great platform already around the world, and our channels to utilities is really the big opportunity for them. But overlaying this solution to where effectively the way I described it, it's almost as they built the interoperable operating software on which our operating technologies will sit along with other apps that make it easier for the utility user to interface. But Matthew, do you want to talk a little bit about pricing and just the opportunity in the upside?
Matthew Pine: Yes. So from a pricing point of view, Deane, really there's an implementation cost, obviously, to go implement the platform, which is a fee. And then it's really, to your point, a Software-as-a-Service. It's a subscription fee that's ongoing in some term is really the model that we've built. And just really amplifying your point, again, one of the biggest pain points we hear and we believe really this partnership will translate into really the digital adoption rates in the water sector. We see this as really being an aggregator in terms of bringing all these disparate systems together that Patrick mentioned. And our teams are engaged in building commercial momentum. We've implemented a few pilots that are starting to see great results from our collaboration already. But as we ramp through the year and build backlog, that will start to really unpack in Q4 and into '24.
Patrick Decker: And I would clarify, Deane, that when we say pilots in this case, these are actual commercial arrangements that are revenue generating. It's not a pilot where we're going and testing something. So we've already had some very impressive potential wins there that we'll talk about in the, hopefully, the next quarter.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: So I just want to follow up on that Idrica stuff real quick and then move on. But is that something that utilities would put in, like, on top of what they already have? Or would it like more likely go like something that they would decide to move forward with like if they're putting in a new deployment?
Patrick Decker: A lot of utilities don't have anything like this. So it's really on top of what they have, Joe, and it's integrating all their disparate systems, their SCADA systems, their PLC systems, their ERPs. Anything that's bringing data into their ecosystem gets consolidated into the platform with 1 dashboard and 1 interface. And if you think about a lot of the challenges of our utility customers and lots of different industrial customers in general, is they've got multiple applications, multiple passwords, all the information is siloed and they don't have a way to aggregate it. So this would come on as a layer to do that aggregation and give them a way to, as people say, democratize the data, be able to get the data to a user to make sense of all the information coming in.
Matthew Pine: And Joe, just to add, what -- when we say it's built by utility for, utilities is that there are many other solutions that are out there, but they can tend to be quite complex and overly sophisticated. And this really allows them to design a solution that meets the utility where they are on the journey. Not every utility is of the same space or the same place in the journey as to how sophisticated the system needs to be. And so it could be tailored in that regard, but it's also a highly standardized platform. And that's part of the efficiency of their rollout is how easy it is to maintain.
Joe Giordano: And then you guys were spending like a decent amount of resources kind of thinking about developing something like this internally at Xylem, if I'm correct. So now that you've made this decision here, which looks like it's already kind of packaged and ready to go for you, how do you reallocate the resources and what kind of impact does that have of not spending money trying to develop this internally?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So I think that's a great question, Joe. There are certainly some overlaps between what we're spending money on from an R&D perspective. Just to remind you, the structure of the transaction is that it's a commercial agreement, which allows us to take the product and sell it on a global basis. And on top of that, we have a minority investment. And so there are certain things that we're going to keep going on our end. And then there are certain things that we're going to be able to leverage between the 2 companies. But there are certainly some synergies there. But really, this is a growth play.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Just wanted to move to the 1Q guide here. Can you kind of talk a little bit about a bridge from maybe where we're exiting to where we are in 1Q? I'm trying to discern how much of this is being conservative versus how much is -- I guess it's early in the year and it's an uncertain year. Like if I look at, let's say, applied for example, or even M&CS. You're guiding applies basically up low single digits for the quarter and for the year. I would have thought that just given what's happening in resi, maybe it starts the year well above that and then finishes maybe flattish. So now you're kind of anticipating similar growth all year. Maybe talk us through that and M&CS, the guidance there kind of was what we expected heading in. But after the 4Q suggests like a 1Q step down off the 4Q run rate on revenue. So maybe talk us through that.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Joe, I mean, there's a few things to unpack there. Let me start and the team here will remind me what else you asked. So look, there is some seasonality in our business. And if you look at it from a revenue perspective, we'll have a step down in revenue between Q4 and Q1. We always do. The biggest step down is actually in Water Infrastructure that has a big Q4. M&CS, there will be a little bit of a step down to. It's not so much in the metrology business, but some of the other businesses that we highlighted earlier on the call, our pipeline assessment services business, our test business, there's some seasonality there. So I think it's somewhere between $150 million and $200 million step down, Q4 to Q1. And that aligns with sort of our historical patterns. As we think about the year and the seasonality in the year, different businesses look a little bit different. Certainly, you touched on AWS, which is our most cyclical business when it comes to macro. And from an AWS perspective, we're entering the year with a very, very strong backlog. And so as we've modeled that business, we have modeled a stronger first half versus a stronger second half. The other businesses don't have quite as much seasonality built into the plan, other than in M&CS, we have been calling for a bigger ramp-up in the second half when some of the redesign work comes online and that coincide with better chip supply.
Patrick Decker: So I would just add a couple of things, from a historical perspective, just to amplify what Sandy had said here. We are reflecting in our guide that backlog in AWS carries into the first half of the year, but we are forecasting softness in the second half. So obviously, that remains to be seen. Hopefully, things recover faster, and we kind of glide through this and don't get impacted by that. But right now, we're embedding our guide that there is softness that hits us in terms of conversion in the second half. Historically, Water Infrastructure has a bigger Q4 and slows down in Q1 because we're serving the wastewater side of utilities and they spend out their capital and OpEx budgets through the end of the fourth quarter and then they ramp up again in the following year. So just to give some context for those of you that may be new to the story.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran : So just following up on that last little bit there. Patrick, you gave some context on the applied backlog. It seems like you're expecting normalization as you work through the year that it makes sense and it's a short-cycle business. Maybe some thoughts on how you're thinking about the backlog tracking for the other 2 segments? And if you think that there's a chance for normalization either of those as we move towards the end of the year towards a more consistent run rate or more consistent balance between how you think about orders and backlog and revenue conversion.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Mike. I think we are already starting to see some normalization. If you look at the orders rate that we've had in the second half of the year, as -- particularly as the pockets where the supply chain has stabilized, we're seeing some of our customers there return to normal behaviors. I'd say Water Infrastructure is a great example of that. We've had a more stable supply chain there. And so that's where we've seen more normal order patterns, and we don't see a backlog that has been as elevated. We still have quite a bit of our backlog that's past due in M&CS, and we do expect to start eating into some of that in 2023. And I think that's a good thing because that means our projects are getting deployed.
Patrick Decker: Go ahead, sorry.
Matthew Pine: Yes. I was just going to build on the M&CS comment. We still have 30% of the backlog past due coming into the year. And so we'll still continue to monitor that as the chip supply continues sequentially to improve. That's something where we're looking at. But orders sequentially are good in that business, and we see good momentum going forward commercially.
Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And then on the kind of order side in the quoting pipeline side of things, obviously, orders taking the quarter not a surprise, given the comps, given some balancing out here. How do you think that the sequentials will work out through the year on the order side? What are the expectations there? And maybe any comments on how you're looking at the bidding pipeline as we sit here today in the areas where that's relevant?
Matthew Pine: Yes. From a bidding pipeline standpoint, I would say, look, industrial remains really strong globally. We primarily play in the general industry. there, and that's been pretty resilient. So that continues strong. Commercial is a bit of -- it's showing strength, however, expected to be slow in the back half, primarily due to new construction moderating. We track the ABI Index, the architectural billing index, that's been less than 50 in the past 3 months. And so looking for a little bit of a slowdown in the bid activity for new construction for commercial. And we talked resi, that's primarily a replacement for us. the orders are slowing down, largely due to the improved supply chain. It's probably the biggest area that we've seen the supply chain improve and also from pandemic investments. And so that's really what's impacted that. And then a strong pipeline in M&CS, plus water infrastructure, especially treatment. We're starting to see treatment really ramp up and the net backlog also continues to build, and we have a strong funnel.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones : I think I'm going to go to questions and if I can get any answers around revenue synergies from the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. I mean this is clearly a growth-enabling deal, and Patrick, you highlighted a couple of avenues for that. Investors have been very hungry for information on what kind of value that might add. So is there any color on kind of what your targets are going to be in terms of the expected growth for the combined businesses, how you're going to approach it? Are you going to have specific growth teams assigned to these kinds of projects? Any color and more color you can give us around those kinds of things?
Patrick Decker: Sure, sure. Yes. So as you've said, Nate, I mean -- so first of all, I mean, the economic returns of this combination are justified on the cost synergies alone. And I don't want to look past those because I want to make sure that our investors understand that we've got strong conviction around the $140 million of cost synergies within 3 years. Going forward, we will lay out exactly what the -- not only the 3 buckets are that we've talked about, and I can reiterate those if we need to, but specific delivery time frames, ownership, et cetera. So strong conviction around that cost synergy. Then beyond that, clearly, this combination is about growth. It really is taking a long-term view, not on the realization of synergies, but a long-term view on what the world needs right now in terms of a water company at scale and depth, and there are so many things that we can do together that we could not do as separate companies. Now on the revenue synergies I'm not going to give you a specific number as of yet. We clearly will do that, and I can talk a little bit about process. But clearly, we expect that there's going to be an accelerated growth rate of the combined company. And we will put a specific target out there as we get closer to finalization of this. In terms of the process, there is going to be a clear ownership within our integration work that's already kicked off. We have teams that have been assigned to go after each one of the several areas of gross synergy. Obviously, we have a view on that before we got the deal approved by both boards, but we're looking to see where there might even be other opportunities beyond that as we go forward. I laid out in my prepared remarks what some of those areas are. A few others that we did not highlight in my comments were around the combination of digital enablement in both companies. Evoqua is already doing a fair amount in digital enablement of their services, really focused on productivity and growth, and we continue to progress quite nicely in our digital enablement of more on the product side and the aftermarket service side. Last area is, we believe between Ron and I and the team that there is tremendous opportunity in the area of joint R&D, innovation and portfolio enhancement, whether that be organic or inorganic, given the complementary nature of the businesses. So that's what I can share with you right now, Nate. Obviously, we're as excited as you all are at being in a position to come out and share numbers around this, but we -- right now, we're focusing on getting the deal closed.
Nathan Jones : I have one follow-up question on a specific avenue of revenue synergies. Xylem historically been a product company and Evoqua developed this service-based model. Is there -- do you see the opportunity for you to implement new kinds of service-based business models on the legacy Xylem portfolio leveraging their service footprint?
Patrick Decker: Yes, we certainly do. I mean it will take some time. That will not be a day 1 synergy and likely not even a year 1 synergy. But absolutely, we see bringing some elements of their best-in-breed service offerings. And quite frankly, just their -- the whole cultural model around services, we believe is going to be an enhancement to our more legacy traditional product-oriented aftermarket services that are out there. Two, they've already done a terrific work, and I realized that Ron would say they're still on that journey. And I certainly appreciated that last week whenever I spent a few days with him at multiple sites is that they're very much focused on outcome-based solutions. And so I think there's an opportunity there to enhance our business models and offerings whether that be both on the utility side but also on the industrial. There's -- as you know, Nate, there's a fair amount of complementary nature of pulling through there. They've got some terrific products within their APT business on the treatment side that complement what we do and vice versa, our treatment portfolio, enhancing what they can deliver in their industrial services offering.
Nathan Jones : Yes, it seems to be a lot of avenues for growth there. So I look forward to hearing more about it over the next few months and few quarters.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis : Every -- just a couple -- one kind of point of clarification then a real question. But are you still raising price here and now that we're into '23 or the price increases you did in '22 pretty much enough to offset your inflation.
Matthew Pine: Yes. We did -- Scott, we did the last round of price increases back in November of 2022. So really, the price increase, in essence would be for '23 kind of heading into this year. So obviously, we're continuing to watch the marketplace and understand not only the inflationary environment and how that continues on. It really -- it's moderated some, but it's still up and also just also make sure we're monitoring our win-loss rate in the marketplace and making sure that we're appropriately priced accordingly in the market.
Scott Davis : All right. Helpful. And then I think about 2022, so much of the year, not just you guys, but most companies were held hostage by the chip makers. And how -- where do you guys see yourselves going forward and kind of redundancy or flexibility or whatever other words that we want to use to kind of describe it just to make sure that this chip issue doesn't come back every time there's some sort of dislocation that design is more perspective in the future?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Scott, this is Patrick. So I'd say, first of all, we, by no means, are out of the woods on this yet, even though we've seen sequential improvement. I would say that the health, all the discussions that we have with both the chip suppliers themselves and our intermediaries all have stabilized and strengthened. Clearly, I know people are looking at auto right now and hearing about weakness there and wondering whether or not all of a sudden, we're going to get a boat load of chips that show up. It just doesn't work that way in terms of the allocation. We continue -- the substitutes aren't easy in this space. And so the main thing we did, as Matthew alluded to earlier, was we spent a lot of time and energy and quite frankly, money this past year, redesigning our offerings to get to the next generation. So we could be best in line. I do think that as other sectors perhaps show slowness that will simply further strengthen the recovery for us, but we're not counting on that right now or baking that into our outlook for the year.
Scott Davis : That’s helpful, Patrick. Just to be clear, so when you talk about redesigning, are you talking about going to a chip design that’s more ubiquitous and more commonly used in consumer electronics? Or is there some sort of level in between where you’re at from that next-gen chip?
A –Patrick Decker: It’s just really getting to next-gen chips, where the capacity is being allocated are being built so we have more capacity for the future, yes, because we’re on legacy designs that they’re bringing down the capacity on those chips.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Patrick or Matt, I know you've talked about forecasting a slower second half in Applied Water, especially as new construction potentially sows in commercial. But have you begun to see any evidence of channel destocking or other customer behavior that concerns you in commercial markets? And then separately, have you put in any contingency in your guide for China reopening related noise? It looks like China was still strong for you in Q4?
Matthew Pine: Yes. So Andy, on the first one on channel inventory. We have really good visibility into the inventory given our relationship with our channel partners. The teams we meet monthly and actually quarterly with counsel meetings in addition to weekly sales calls in contact. So we have really good insight into the inventory. The levels are healthy and normalizing and they're not sitting on any excess inventory, which is reported back to us. There are some pockets that have not fully recovered. Commercial is not back to kind of prepandemic levels in terms of inventory. But resi, I would say, is normalized due to the improved supply chain and softening from the pandemic investments. On the industrial front, that's really more of an engineer-to-order product. There's not a lot of build to stock. And so that's where I'd leave it on the channel inventory there.
Sandy Rowland: Andy, let me take the China part of your question. So China was tough for us this year. We were down in China about 20% in the first half of the year. We saw a moderation in the second half -- and as we -- a little bit stronger Q3 than Q4 given the outbreak of COVID in Q4. And I think we've taken a measured approach to China and our guide for 2023. We do expect more of a recovery in the second half of the year in China. The slowdown has been more acute more on the utility side of the business, and we've seen stronger performance on the industrial side. And so our focus for our team is building orders momentum again. And we remain very bullish long term on China. We're just working through some of the dynamics there now.
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate that, Sandy. And then it seems like industrial dewatering continues to hold up well as it does tend to be more historically cyclical, but could the business be much less cyclical during the current cycle given the amount of activity that's out there. I know you mentioned mining. Maybe you could comment on the support you're getting from your strategic growth investments as well, what exactly you're doing there?
Matthew Pine: Yes. We made a constant effort back a few years ago to be a bit more balanced in our segmentation of that business, especially shifting more to the muni side, which is a bit more stable. And we've seen that part of the portfolio grow and also just making investments in our fleet and upgrading our technology. We are digitizing those assets and making those remotely connectable so we can improve the productivity for our customers. So it's a mixed bag of really, I'd say, some innovation as well as being thoughtful about being more balanced in the segmentation of the business.
Operator: It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. So again, thanks, everybody, for your time today. I know you're all very, very busy at this time of the year. Really appreciate your ongoing continued interest in Xylem. I very much look forward to providing you updates on our progress around the Evoqua transaction. And between now and then, safe travels, everyone and all the very best. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Now, please turn to Slide 4 and I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce a very strong third quarter performance, continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Across the board, the team delivered above expectations with all our business segments and regions posting strong double-digit revenue growth. And we see quite resilient demand in our backlogs and bidding pipeline. Overall, revenues were up 16% for the quarter, beating the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points. Applied Water grew fastest at 20%. Water infrastructure exceeded expectations by the widest margin and M&CS came in right on target with healthy mid-teens growth. Regionally, Americas, Western Europe and emerging markets each grew mid-teens. Demand at all of our largest end markets continued to be strong driven by the essential nature of our solutions and services and by intensifying long-term trends in Water. The team, from our factories to our channel partners and distributors, also delivered a tremendous operational performance. Their actions entirely offset inflation with very strong price cost discipline and effectively manage through continuing chip supply constraints. That focus paid off in growth but also with very strong EBITDA margin expansion. Margins exceeded the high end of our guidance by 130 basis points. This delivered on our previous commitment to significantly improve our margins in the second half of this year. Strong organic revenue growth and accretive margins drove third quarter earnings well above expectations, with earnings per share of $0.79. As you all know, our key end markets have consistently been resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and we expect that underlying demand pattern to continue. M&CS orders continue to be very strong. Water Infrastructure was up solidly. Backlogs continue to be up sharply year-over-year and the digital solutions proportion of our backlogs continue to expand. That said, some of our smaller end markets are more cyclical, such as residential within our Applied Water segment. Orders in those markets were down in the quarter and are expected to remain soft. Looking forward, we anticipate the demand dynamics of the third quarter to continue into 2023. On supply, especially chip supply, the outlook remains consistent with what we said last quarter. As expected, we have not seen meaningful easing of chip supply constraints. But forecasting visibility has improved, as has the reliability of deliveries. We expect to exit the year as we've outlined before. Things are gradually improving. Given the resilience of our demand profile, the vitality of our business and the team’s strong operational track record in this environment, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.65 to $2.75 on organic revenue growth between 9% and 10%. In a few minutes, we’ll discuss dynamics in our different end markets, along with some trends we’re seeing through the current cycle. I’ll also touch on how we’re serving communities as they invest to become more resilient in the face of intensifying water challenges. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to offer you some more detail on the third quarter.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. The team did a great job over delivering on commitments with disciplined commercial and operational execution on continuing strong demand. As a result, revenues grew globally, high teens in the U.S. and mid-teens in emerging markets in Western Europe on strong price and backlog execution as supply chains modestly improved. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 15%, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Industrial grew 16% with strength across all geographies, particularly in emerging markets in Western Europe. Commercial was up 17%, mainly due to strong backlog execution in the U.S.; and Residential was up 19%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the U.S. Global demand remains healthy on strong end market fundamentals, especially in Water Infrastructure and M&CS. That said, organic orders were down 1% in the quarter versus up 20% in the same period last year. Water Infrastructure was up 3%, AWS down 4% and M&CS down 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.3%, up 40 basis points from the prior year and up 170 basis points sequentially as price more than offset inflation. And as Patrick mentioned, our EPS in the quarter was $0.79, well above expectations. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment. Water Infrastructure revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was broad-based, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe, both up high teens as supply chain constraints improved. Industrial growth remained robust, driven by continued dewatering demand in emerging markets and increased activity in Western Europe. Geographically, Western Europe grew mid-teens, driven by robust transport and treatment demand. The U.S. was up low teens, led by strong utilities OpEx demand. Emerging Markets was up low double digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa, a continued growth in dewatering. Orders in the third quarter were up 3% organically with robust dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utilities strengths in the U.S. Segment EBITDA margin was largely in line with the prior year as favorable price realization offset inflation but was also impacted by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. SP999 In the Applied Water segment, third quarter revenues grew 20% organically, exceeding expectations. Growth was robust across all end markets, with each up high teens or greater. Geographically, the U.S. was up high teens with strength across all 3 end markets due to price realization and modest improvements in supply chain. Western Europe was also up high teens, led by growth in industrial, on strong price and continued demand. Emerging Markets was up almost 30%, driven by strong industrial demand in China and commercial development in the Middle East and Africa. Orders were down 4% organically with continued growth in emerging markets, offset by some moderation in Residential in the U.S. As a reminder, Residential, our most cyclical end market, is only about 5% of our overall revenue. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 110 basis points compared to the prior year and 200 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, supplemented with productivity savings. And now, let's turn to Slide 8 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 15% organically, in line with our prior guidance as chip supply played out as expected, with continued modest improvement sequentially. We also saw strong growth in test applications and our pipeline assessment services business. Geographically, the U.S. was up more than 20% on improved chip availability versus the prior year and favorable price realization. Emerging Markets was up mid-teens and Western Europe was up high single digits, driven by strength in our Test and Pipeline Assessment Services businesses. M&CS orders declined 2% organically in the quarter, lapping a tough prior year compare of 42% orders growth. Underlying demand for our AMI offerings remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue, yielding backlog growth of 35% versus the prior year. Our M&CS backlog alone exceeds $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter expanded 400 basis points sequentially and is now approaching prior year levels. The team did a great job driving margin improvement, even though volumes continue to be constrained by chip supply. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $149 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. You will note that our working capital levels are elevated as we've chosen to carry about 30 days of extra inventory. And while supply chains are gradually improving, delivery metrics are below historical levels and we can best serve our customers and communities by making this short-term investment. Having said that, our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash and $2 billion of available liquidity and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.3x. Please turn to Slide 10 and I'll hand it back to Patrick to give some color on underlying demand.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. In our last quarter's earnings call, we impact how demand in different end markets respond to macroeconomic headwinds. What we described then is what we're seeing in the marketplace now with healthy underlying demand in our largest end markets. Those patterns have repeated over past economic cycles. So they inform how we manage our operations in an environment like this one. Since all water is local, we experienced those patterns and trends playing out at a community level. What we're seeing is more and more communities selling increasing impact from climate change. They're finding their aging infrastructure isn't up to the task and then confronting the economic anxiety of major upgrades. So communities are investing both in short-term response and in longer-term resilience. Infrastructure investment is the much bigger driver of underlying demand. But our customers have to know we will also be there in near-term crisis which are happening all too frequently. For example, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, our dewatering pumps were already in place ahead of the storm to prevent the worst and recover fast. And storms are the only immediate needs. One Southeastern U.S. city called us with sewer lines leaching waste into community groundwater and their aging pipes are on the brink of collapse. Within days of that call, we were building [indiscernible] that will help that city's wastewater treatment running without interruption, while they make long-term repairs. Helping communities respond to shocks is a fundamental part of our mission. But the more durable value is in helping communities build the strength to withstand future water challenges and economic stresses. Xylem Solutions like advanced metering infrastructure, wastewater network optimization and municipal water recycling, amongst so many others, provide much more than compelling economics. They deliver game-changing resilience. With AMI as an example, cities can cut off water in the event of storm damage, respond instantly to customer crisis and even promote conservation through periods of scarcity and drought. And all of that additional capability costs a city less than their conventional meter networks. That value equation isn't unique to AMI. It's a hallmark of digital solutions across our Xylem portfolio, greater resilience and capability delivered far more affordably than conventional approaches. Those benefits are so important to our customers that we have been steadily extending digital capability into every part of our portfolio. The mini water crisis making headlines in recent months make it clear that the effects of climate change are already driving rapid increases in cost at the community level. To attack the problem at its source, more and more cities are making net zero emissions commitments. Our opportunity is to help water utilities reduce their own carbon footprint. More than 80 leading utilities around the world have already set net zero targets. Last month at Webtech which is one of the largest water trade events each year, we shared research showing how utilities can dramatically cut their emissions while boosting operational efficiency at the same time. The message is good for our customers, good for communities and good for our business. With existing technologies, you can reduce emissions quickly at low cost or even saving money. I am so proud of the team for leading the way on this topic with our customers and our communities. Several of my Xylem colleagues will be speaking at the upcoming COP27 climate meetings in Egypt later this month, to promote the discussion of water which we believe is the most important topic of our time. Now, I’ll turn it back over to Sandy to provide detail on our increased guidance and outlook for the year.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The 2022 full year outlook across our end markets remains largely in line with our previous guidance, with an increase in commercial upon improved backlog execution. We expect healthy underlying demand will carry on through the remainder of the year with continued modest improvements in supply chain. The outlook for our utility business remains unchanged with mid-single-digit growth across both wastewater and clean water. In wastewater, we see continued OpEx strength and the CapEx outlook is supported by modernization of aging infrastructure and continued new development, particularly in emerging markets. For clean water utilities, although chip supply remains constrained, we do expect a continued modest easing of chip supply sequentially. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment businesses to continue due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect low double-digit growth lifted from a previous range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, driven by strong global demand for dewatering and continued underlying demand for our solutions in the U.S. and Western Europe. We now expect the commercial end market to deliver high single to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single to high single digits on strong demand and backlog execution. In Residential, our smallest end market, we expect strong price realization and continued backlog execution to drive growth in the high teens. As a reminder, our Commercial and Residential exposure is largely replacement-driven and is approximately 15% of our total revenue. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our continued out performance gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Our raised guidance is driven by stronger price, backlog execution and continued underlying demand. We are also lifting the low end of our full year organic revenue growth, now 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 10%. Our revenue outlook on a reported basis is largely unchanged due to FX headwinds. Looking by segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and low double-digit growth in Applied Water. We expect measurement and control solutions to be up mid-single digits as chip supply continues to modestly improve. For 2022, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to approximately 17%. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 80% of net income. This is lower than our previous outlook, largely due to higher working capital levels as I referenced earlier. While we’re carrying about an extra month of inventory, our position is fully aligned with the requirements needed to fulfill our backlog. As supply chain stabilize, we will bring inventory down, enabling us to return free cash flow conversion of at least 100% and as we have consistently done in prior years. We’ve provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models as well as our latest assumptions on our basket of currency exposures which can also be found in the appendix. And now drilling down on the fourth quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 12% to 14%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, mid-teens growth in Applied Water and M&CS growth of mid-20%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I’ll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance overall. We delivered strong results this past quarter by continuing to do what we said we would do. And indeed, the team overdelivered, thanks to our commercial momentum and operational discipline. Even in an environment of macro uncertainty, the durability of our business model and the discipline of our team gives us great confidence in our continued growth and significant value creation over the long run. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to share a couple of executive appointments we've just made, adding even further strength to Xylem's leadership bench. Earlier, I referred to our strategy of extending digital capabilities across Xylem's product, solutions and services portfolio. We've just taken an important step in accelerating that process, appointing Xylem's first Chief Digital Officer. [Indiscernible] joined our senior leadership team last week, bringing extensive experience of growing digital businesses in the industrial sector. He'll be working with the team to further build out a simple powerful platform of digitized solutions for our customers and communities. He joins us in Danaher and I look forward to introducing him to you in future conversations. Before sharing our second recent appointment, I first want to recognize a colleague many of you know. Tony Milando our Chief Supply Chain Officer, has been looking for to retirement for a while but he graciously agreed to stay on while helping us guide the company through the challenges of the pandemic. He's built agility and durability into our supply chain, put safety and sustainability at the center of our operations and created a culture of continuous improvement that has made operational excellence a core part of Xylem's competitive advantage. We're finally letting Tony retire but his contributions will continue to benefit our stakeholders for many years to come. To build on the foundation of excellence that Tony has laid, we've appointed [indiscernible] Xylem's Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officer. Tom joined us next week coming from Generac Power Systems and he brings 20-plus years of experience leading global supply chains and operations in the industrial and services sectors. We're very pleased to welcome Tom at a time when supply chain and operations continue to be a foundation of competitive advantage. His remit is to take our operational excellence to the next level. Tony is going to stay on for a brief time to give him a good start and ensure a smooth transition. So with that, operator, let's now open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Can I start with -- I want to wish Tony all the best. He’s been a tremendous help all along. So we’ll miss him but wish him well. And welcome to the 2 new leaders, Tom and [indiscernible].
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Deane. Happy to have him on board and with mixed emotions to see Tony move on. But yes, it's been a great run. -- for sure.
Deane Dray: All right. So first question and look, really good numbers here, good growth. So that all kind of is a standout. What I’d like to talk about is the forward look -- and for the fourth quarter, just talk about the backlog conversion, earnings visibility and how has -- how did October get off in terms of demand?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Deane, let me start there. I think we've built good momentum throughout the year. We've had -- throughout the year, we've had strong orders growth all along. I think we have good visibility into Q4. The way we're kind of envisioning it is that it looks very much like what we just printed in Q3. So we'll see strong top line growth, EBITDA margins that are very similar to the strong step-up that we saw from Q2 to Q3 this year and maybe a little bit of a difference in mix. Water Infrastructure typically has a stronger Q4 when projects get completed towards the end of the year. A little bit of moderation in AWS. They were doing some catch-up orders to work through some of the supply chain and a slight ramp in M&CS. As we've talked about on prior calls, we're continuing to see a more modest step-up on the chip supply situation. And then sometimes in the -- towards the back half, second half of 2023 when the redesign work and some more supply comes online, you'll see a bigger ramp. So long story short, I think our Q3 and our Q4 look pretty similar. All along, we've called for a stronger back half compared to our first half. And we're really happy to report that that's playing out very much in line with our expectations.
Deane Dray: And specifically on backlog, what would be the typical 4Q backlog conversion on a percent basis versus what you’re expecting this quarter?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I'll give you some color around the backlog. When we look year-over-year, the backlogs are up about 30%. It's a little higher than that in M&CS and a little bit lower than that in the other 2 businesses. So all around, Deane, backlogs remain elevated. And so we're not able to convert as much of the backlog as we would have in other periods. And that's not because production levels are falling short. It's just because backlog still remain elevated.
Patrick Decker: And Deane, I would just offer that coming into this quarter, like we did this past our Applied Water backlog is up almost at least a month or more normally than what we would have visibility to. That's because of supply chain constraints -- we're going to -- and demand. We're going to see that begin to work off in Q4 going into Q1. And so Applied Water will normalize down to its historical levels which is still going to be attractive at very attractive margins. But where you're really going to see the strength come through continued is in the Water Infrastructure resilience because of utility demand and again, the conversion of chip supply on M&CS and given the deals that we've gotten back on.
Deane Dray: That’s real helpful. And then just as a follow-up, on free cash flow, completely understand the tweak here, adding more inventory. We’re seeing that elsewhere. But maybe share for us, Sandy, the precision, adding an extra 30 days, how does that square across the segments? And maybe weave in like how has lead times on -- how heavy [ph] lead times with your suppliers? How are those trending? Are they beginning anything close to normalization there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, great question. I think, first of all, Deane, where our inventory is most elevated is within our AWS segment. And in that supply chain, we have more China dependency, more global dependency from a supply chain perspective than we do in our other businesses. And so as -- that's where we've seen more disruptions as well. So that's exactly where we put some higher inventory levels. I would say that we've done a lot of scrubbing to make sure that, that inventory aligns with what we're seeing from a backlog perspective and we feel very, very good about that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I will -- I’ll start off on price and price cost. It was very good to see price more than offset inflation this quarter. Can you maybe talk about the pricing trends, the inflation trends? Should we continue to see price ramp up over the next couple of quarters as more price read through? Should we start to see the year-over inflation moderate? And so maybe price cost becomes an even bigger tailwind to margins over the next 2 or 3 quarters?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think, Nate, obviously, this has been something that our teams have been really focused on all year long. And I really applaud the good work that our commercial teams have done securing these important price increases to get in line with inflation. So a couple of milestones. On a year-to-date basis now, we're price cost neutral. In the quarter, we were ahead from a price cost perspective on both a dollar perspective and a percentage perspective. We still expect that price will be a tailwind in Q4 and that's part of the year-over-year margin expansion that we're calling for. Having said that, we start to anniversary some of the quarters where we secured price momentum. And so that starts to happen a little bit in Q4 and more as we move into Q3. But I think as we go into 2023, we'll be in a better spot from a price cost perspective than we certainly were going in this year.
Nathan Jones: And you probably start to anniversary the worst of the inflation comps at the same time, right?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. And so I think inflation, we've definitely seen an increase inflation compared to what we guided initially this year. We sort of came into the year thinking inflation would run around 10% or 11%. When we look all in for the year, inflation is running more in the mid-teens. I would say there is some slight moderation from a commodity perspective but we're still seeing headwinds on inflation in both areas like energy, particularly in Europe. And labor inflation is still out there. And when we look at labor inflation, that's not transitory, that's probably more permanent. So our pricing strategies are dynamic and they need to be in line with what we're seeing and experiencing from a costing perspective.
Nathan Jones: And I would think we should probably see the pricing improve in M&CS as we go forward. It’s the segment where it looks like pricing is coming through the lowest. Some of that backlog that doesn’t get repriced. I would pick some of that, it’s a bit hard to tell your customers you’re raising prices when you have all that pass-through backlog. So should we see price read through more in 2023 in the M&CS segment as we start to clear some of that?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Yes, I think our -- where we've seen price -- we've seen -- it's sort of matched where we've seen the highest inflation levels. And so from an ordering perspective, that's been AWS, what our Infrastructure and M&CS. Having said that, if you look at the past couple of quarters, we're starting to see some of our price increases that we've implemented in M&CS drop through. And so we still have good momentum there from a pricing perspective. And I think you'll continue to see that through the next couple of quarters. And I think that's also made a significant part of why we saw quarter sequential improvement in the M&CS EBITDA rate.
Patrick Decker: And I think, Nate, I would just offer on the M&CS side, specifically, AMI deals. Again, these are long lead time negotiated regulatory approval deals. They’ve got great economics associated with them. And I think our customers understand that we’re operating in a fairly high inflationary environment and they understand. And they understand that we’re being very transparent with them, around what the inflation impact goes in us and that we’re being responsible and disciplined. And the economics of these deals are so important to them that right now, the most important thing we can do is just continue to get chips and get the meters installed. And the good news is we’ve not seen any cancellations of those deals and backlog. So we feel good. We wish we had more chips, of course. But again, these projects require multiyear planning and utilities don’t tend to go backwards on these deals.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran: So a couple here. First, just on the utility building cycle which I suppose dovetails a little bit of the comments you just made there, Patrick. But -- what’s the frontlog look at this point? And what’s the -- and that’s kind of part 1 of the question and what the kind of underlying thought process is at the utility level today? And then secondarily, any update on what the adoption looks like for the more technology-oriented pieces of that utility pie?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So as you know, Mike, the -- so roughly 70% of our demand in utilities is OpEx. So it's repair replacement, very stable. If anything, right now, I would say it's probably overcharged because of just aging infrastructure and climate change. So we're seeing really strong growth there. CapEx which is the 30% roughly and this is a global number, not just the U.S. That's the one that we do keep close eye on throughout cycles. And as you know, what we've tended to see is the one driver that can lead to a reduction in CapEx spend historically if we were to see it which we've not seen it yet. I mean our frontline right -- our frontlog right now is very strong. the bidding pipeline is very strong right now. But if we were to see a slowdown in muni-tax receipts, if we were to see a slowdown prolonged in residential expansion in the U.S., those things tend to be later cycle, so it'd be a couple of years down the road. We're not seeing it right now, Mike but that's what we would look for -- on -- and that's on the wastewater side. Now historically, even during the past recessions around the world, if you set aside dewatering for a moment which does tend to be more short cycle and we diversified that part of the business away from kind of pure mining, oil and gas were much more in the muni space now and broader industrial space. But we would see it there. We haven't seen it. And we would ultimately see maybe a low single-digit kind of water infrastructure growth if we were to see a recession but we've not seen that in our frontlogs at this point in time. So we're keeping a close eye on it and we're trying to be responsible and prudent in our planning here.
Michael Halloran: Great. Second one, just on the European side of things. It seems awfully resilient from you at this point. Just some thoughts on the trends you’re seeing on that side.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. We look at our results, Mike, in Europe and they're very, very strong. We're also seeing good orders growth, especially on a year-to-date basis. And when we look historically and benchmark kind of one region to the other, Europe tends to be very steady. And I think you see very disciplined and resilient spend from the European -- so I think -- the European market. So on the industrial side, we're not seeing a slowdown either. So -- we're staying close to it. We're talking very frequently with our commercial teams who are in constant contact with our customers. But so far, it's hanging in there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Can we talk a little bit about M&A and your pipeline and it seems your balance sheet is in just great shape and asset prices are coming down a bit. So just some color on that would be helpful.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So as you said, Scott, we've got a really strong balance sheet. I mean we've got $2 billion liquidity. We got probably firepower of north of $4 billion. We're not going to hesitate if the opportunity presents itself. Pipeline remains really robust. It's a combination of larger opportunities. But we've got a number of small, medium-sized opportunities that are out there, mainly in the utilities space but also in the industrial services space. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. As you well know, it always takes two to tango. But nothing's changed in our view on valuations and our discipline in that space.
Scott Davis: Okay. Helpful. And then can you guys just remind us, [indiscernible], Sandy, you can help with us on these big extreme moves we’ve had in FX and you guys have a little bit different clearly situation than most of the companies we cover. But the net-net of all the different moves in FX, what that really means for you guys?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So I mean, I think when you look sort of year-over-year -- actually compared to our budget, we're seeing significant headwinds from an FX perspective. I would say from an EPS perspective, it's been a negative by about $0.15 to $0.20. We'll see where the things ultimately shake out in the fourth quarter because even over the past months, the FX rates have been volatile. But I think we're really proud of the team. That's one of the challenges we've been able to overcome when we look at sort of we started the year and where we stand today. Just as an example, we started the year planning for a euro assumption at 1.13, dipping down below a 1:1 ratio for the end of last quarter and into this quarter. So good work that we've been able to overcome, continue to stay disciplined and controlling what we can control.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: I thought it was interesting on the new role for a Chief Digital Officer. Can you talk about like the buy versus build proposition for a true digital platform kind of like on top of your AMI platform?
Patrick Decker: Sure. That's a great question, Joe. So digital is certainly not new. So we've got a great foundation that we've already built, both organically as well as through a number of the acquisitions we've done. So [indiscernible] comes in really building on that solid foundation. We are continuing to look at the opportunity to both build internally which is really as much about talent capability, commercializing, selling those opportunities. But our pipeline from an M&A standpoint is still very much focused on adding other solutions and technologies to the mix. And I look forward to having [indiscernible] join us on one of our upcoming calls and share his perspective on what he sees and the opportunities in front of us. But it's a combination, Joe, between organic and M&A.
Joe Giordano: Okay, great. I know -- look, it's good to see the progress at M&CS but I know that you're not happy with where margins are like big picture. So can you kind of walk us from where we're exiting this year to like what a 20% margin looks like at M&CS, like on EBITDA, what things have to happen to get there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think great question, Joe. We've been working really hard to get our margins back up in the M&CS side. And obviously, volume plays a big role in that. we've talked historically that when we get revenue up into the $350 million level per quarter, you'll see revenues -- you'll see EBITDA margins in the mid-teens. To get to the high teens, 20% benchmark, we need to be north of $400 million of revenue per quarter. And we are certainly focused on productivity initiatives the disciplined steps we're taking around, pricing and looking at our backlog and incremental pricing opportunities there are an important catalyst as well. And then, of course, our backlog has a higher digital mix. And so that will naturally bring with it some higher margins. So it's a real combination of factors and the good news is we've seen some uptick in the revenue, a little bit of a flattening from Q2 to Q3 and we'll expect that continued moderation and then another kind of step up more in the back half of next year.
Patrick Decker: And Joe, I would just add that one of the things that we've not really punctuated in the past is as we were going through the redesign of our chips to be able to help support our customers through this challenging time to move these installations along, there were costs that we added in our P&L to support that. At the same time, we had to redirect some engineering resources away from classic productivity, continuous improvement. So we're working through that. But despite that, you see the margin expansion that we've laid out in the quarter and that we expect for the year and that we expect to win the next year. So I just want to make sure we're making strategic choices here to take care of our customers, not just for the future, for the long run but like right now because that's the value they expect from us.
Joe Giordano: That all makes sense. And just last quick for me. Just given how shorter cycle AWS is, I know backlog is extended there but it's like the shortest backlog throughout the company. And just when I think about price this quarter at 1,000 basis points, when price starts to normalize and orders are coming down and that business just starts to get to more like reasonable levels, what do we -- how do we think about like margin deleveraging in that kind of scenario? You made a lot of progress there. So how much of that do you expect to be able to hold on to as volumes kind of come down?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think one thing that is important to remember is if you look back the past few quarters, our price increases were not in line with inflation. So we're now at a point where we're getting back to our more historical margins and we can drive margin expansion through productivity levels and incremental growth. So I think we're getting back to a place that's good and healthy for that business and a lot of work to make that happen.
Patrick Decker: And we continue, Joe, to make investments in innovation and R&D within that segment also within Water Infrastructure. I know M&CS has kind of gotten more the headline over the last few years. But we continue to make increases in R&D spend in those segments because that kind of refreshment of our offerings and portfolio, we see and our new products that we bring to market that they’ve got much higher margin and growth rates than what they’re replacing. So it’s important to note that there’s a refresh that continues to go on in both of those segments.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Patrick, I know you’ve said that you have elevated backlog and a strong pipeline of opportunities but just focusing on orders for a second, down a bit this quarter, they decelerated over the last couple of quarters. I know it’s really just more difficult comps. But you did mention a little slower U.S. in Applied Water, for instance. So could you give us some more color into what you’re seeing in orders and whether you believe orders will continue to decelerate or how to think about orders going into '23?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So we feel good about the trend lines on demand. And again, that goes back to the question around what our frontlogs look like in terms of bidding pipeline, whether that be AMI, whether that be treatment which is a precursor for wastewater demand and we see healthy demand within our channel partners, even on the Applied Water side. So it is really a year-over-year comp issue. If you look at our orders year-to-date, we're still up 7% year-to-date and it really is a tough comp in the third quarter. I would say that, again, it varies by end market. We've obviously -- we haven't talked China, for example. China is 7% of our revenue. China was up 10% in the third quarter on revenue. But I would say that the public utility funding there in China has been pushed to the right because of the lockdown restrictions there. But we still expect there to be a recovery in utilities but it's probably not going to be until later next year. And there is no change in our long-term plan or outlook on China. But it's a meaningful part of our revenue and we've overcome that with demand across the rest of the portfolio. So the fundamentals are there. We are watching all the signs. We've got our KPIs that we track, especially in our short-cycle businesses. We have seen some moderation, as Sandy said earlier, in Residential which is a very small part of our business. We've seen some slowdown in a couple of other small pieces of our business. So we'll keep a close eye on it. I mean we're not out of the woods yet. But even in commercial, the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index, is still strong at north of 50. And when it's north of 50, that indicates strength in that part of our segment which we continued to see growth in. But again, we're keeping a close eye on all this, Andy.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Patrick. And maybe if I could just follow up on your dewatering business. Kind of a similar question. I know you raised your industrial growth to low teens but what are your industrial customers telling you about the opportunities in dewatering? And do you see those orders staying positive and dewatering into ‘23?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Andy, good question. We're seeing both strong revenue conversion in dewatering and we're seeing good orders momentum there. I think Patrick referenced a little bit earlier on the call. I think there are some important things to note if you look at our business today than what our business looked like a couple of years ago. Seeing good emerging markets growth, good growth, that includes Latin America as well where they're seeing good activity. We've made some investments on the rental fleet in really all of our markets on a global basis. And those projects are -- have good returns, fast paybacks. We're seeing a lot of that equipment out on order and converting to revenue. And we're still seeing resiliency on our equipment sales side of the business in dewatering. Put it right up there in one of those end markets that we need to really continue to focus on. It is absolutely one of the shorter cycle businesses and understanding the -- what our customers are seeing is important there. So -- but so far, that's been pretty resilient.
Patrick Decker: I would just add Andy, that the thing -- when we say customers and dewatering, there's the part that we handle direct, where we have our rental fleet and then there are our channel partners that we actually replenish their fleet and then they have their own rental fleet. And in the past, the part of that business that can turn very quickly is if our channel partners that are all local around the U.S. predominantly, if they get nervous and they see things, they then pull back on replenishing their fleet and that can happen very short cycle. And so we are in regular calls with them to get a feel for how they're feeling about the general macro economy right now. Thus far, it's strong and resilient but that's the area that we would keep a very close eye on.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I guess first question I had just following up on an earlier one. Price read out by almost 250 basis points more this quarter than in 2Q. It sounded like based on Sandy’s comments that maybe you’re starting to see a peaking sort of cadence in terms of price. So I just wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. And as we start to lap some of the price increases over the past year and we head into ‘23, are we thinking more like a typical low single-digit price year starting early next year, just kind of get a sense of the cadence of price are into next year?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Brian, I think I touched on it a little bit earlier. Last year, starting in Q4 is really where we started to see some of the impact of our price increases, hitting our revenue. So absolutely, the compares start to get tougher, a little bit tougher next quarter. I think you're going to still see strong pricing. It should be one of the key drivers for the margin expansion that we're calling for. And then we're obviously -- pricing has become very dynamic. It's not a decision we make at one point in time. We need to continue to take all the inputs from we're seeing on all the different components of our bill of materials, everything from the commodities we buy to the freight costs to deliver the product. So I'm not going to share what our price realization looks like for 2023 at this time. Certainly, we're in a much, much better position as we go into '23 from an equilibrium perspective around on price cost.
Brian Lee: Absolutely. Yes, makes sense. And I guess a follow-up here, just to focus too much on the short term. But if I look at the guidance here for 4Q, I know nothing about the past couple of years has been sort of normal but it does imply a pretty flattish performance across key metrics, revenue, EBITDA, operating margin. Seasonally, you typically have a pretty meaningful increase from 3Q to 4Q across a lot of those headline metrics. So kind of walk us through, is there anything impacting near-term seasonality in the model here? You just kind of working off more backlog in 3Q than you expected. Just any sense of why this year, maybe 3Q to 4Q is a little bit lighter than you typically see in past years?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think you touched on a bit of it, Brian. If you look at particularly our water infrastructure business, we typically see a bigger drop-off Q2 to Q3. We didn't see that as much this year. That was a big part of why our revenue came in higher. And so as a result of that, we see more of a flattening Q3 to -- we still see a little bit of a step-up going into Q4 on Water Infrastructure but not as dramatic. And some of that is -- we did see a little bit of supply chain improvement and we got some more projects across the finish line. So for the full year, yes, Q3 and Q4 look good. It's a big step-up from what we saw in the first half and we're exiting the year right in line with what we were expecting.
Patrick Decker: Yes. And I think, Brian, the other -- I mean, regionally, the 2 areas that I would say that we’re just seeing things playing out a little bit differently this year than we have in the past. I mentioned earlier, things shifting to the right in China. And again, we have the uncertainties in Europe. And so we just think it’s prudent to build that into our outlook for Q4.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: A lot has been covered on the call but there is a big differential between the strong order growth between Applied Water growth and the decline in orders. So since you expect to work down the backlog through this year, how do you think about growth as we head into 2023?
Patrick Decker: Is that specifically for Applied Water?
Saree Boroditsky: Yes for Applied Water.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, I’ll take it. We obviously have a very elevated backlog in AWS. We have more than doubled the backlog than we typically have in any one quarter. And so I think -- we actually are able to work some of that backlog down. I think it’s a real positive sign that supply chains are improving, that customers are reverting back to more typical ordering patterns. And as we look at that business longer term, it’s probably the lowest grower in our portfolio. It delivers a lot of cash. It’s a good operating business for us. But over a longer-term basis, it’s low to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio. And when do we exactly revert to those levels and it will take a little bit of time to work through the backlog. But that’s sort of how we see that business longer term fitting into our portfolio.
Patrick Decker: I mean we look at that part of our portfolio as market growth itself is GDP on a global basis. And we always look to and have historically beat that by some share gain. And that comes through investments in innovation through R&D. We continue to refresh the portfolio. But to Sandy's point, we're coming off of elevated backlogs due to one demand but also supply chain constraints. We'll see that normalize as we go into 2023. And in our upcoming call, we'll lay out by segment what our outlook is for '23.
Saree Boroditsky: Great. That’s helpful. And then obviously, you put out the strong book to build in AMI. How long and advanced are you seeing customers place their orders? And then when does this show up in revenues?
Sandy Rowland: AMI is -- it's a very long selling cycle. It's a big decision for the utilities to make -- we're working on RFPs that go out anywhere from 1 to 3 years. We have a big backlog in M&CS. If you look today, we still have about 1/4 of it that's past due. And so we're going to start working through that as chip supply recover. What we're most excited about is that the pipeline remains strong. We're winning a good percentage of those awards. And the value proposition is very, very sound.
Patrick Decker: We are still early in the conversion of large utilities across the U.S. to AMI let alone the smaller- to medium-sized utilities. So that’s why the front log, the bidding pipeline looks so attractive across the market and that’s why we remain confident. But these are long-term deals that take a while to negotiate and we’re pleased with our position.
Operator: It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your continued interest and support. Really appreciate it. I know between now and the next earnings call, we’ll have a chance to meet with many of you in person. Between now and then, stay safe and safe travels. Look forward to seeing you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints. Revenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide. The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments and supply improvements in M&CS and Water Infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad-based, Western Europe was up 9%, and North America at 6%, and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double-digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand. In addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water Infrastructure set the strongest base, growing orders 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs were up sharply versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog. EBITDA margin also came in well-ahead of our guidance. We delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated, and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected. What we are seeing is a gradual improvement in supply, which provides further confidence in our second half outlook. The team also delivered pricing actions to mitigate inflation across all segments, and I want to give a big shout out to the entire team, including our distribution and channel partners for managing through a dynamic market environment. We combine those disciplined actions with productivity savings from simplifying the way we work and entirely offset inflation in the quarter. We expect demand to remain resilient due to the essential nature of the services our customers need from us. So as you've seen in this morning's release, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 10% growth for the full year, and we're raising the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. We'll come back and discuss our full review of the macro environment in a few minutes, but let me hand it over now to Sandy for some additional color on the second quarter.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide 4. The team did a tremendous job over delivering on our commitments with disciplined execution on strong fundamentals and continuing demand. As a result, revenues grew globally high single digits in Western Europe and mid-single digits in the US. In emerging markets, revenue grew low double digits, excluding China, which was slowed by ongoing COVID restrictions. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 2%, led by strength in Western Europe and the US. Industrial grew 12% on increasing activity in all geographies, particularly the US, Western Europe and Latin America. Commercial was down 1%, strength in Western Europe was offset by continued US supply chain challenges. And residential was up 13%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the US. Organic orders were up 6% in the quarter, with water infrastructure up 21% and AWS up 2%, partially offset by M&CS. Global demand continues to be strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.2 in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 16.6%, well-above our guided range, and that reflects a 240 basis point rise sequentially on strong commercial execution and discipline on discretionary costs. Price contributed two points of incremental revenue growth sequentially. As Patrick mentioned, pricing and productivity benefits combined more than offset inflation, and our EPS in the quarter was $0.66, coming in above expectations. Please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure revenue exceeded expectations, growing 9% organically in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, driven by continued backlog conversion, and our US wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the US and treatment applications in Western Europe, alongside strong dewatering growth. Emerging markets, excluding China, was up high single-digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa. These markets were down mid-single digits, including China, due to COVID site access restrictions there. Orders in the second quarter were up 21% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by strong underlying demand supported by large infrastructure projects in the US and Canada. We also saw sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in North America and Western Europe. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 240 basis points as strong price realization, volume and productivity benefits more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Page 6. In the applied water segment, second quarter organic revenues grew 7%, modestly exceeding our expectations. Geographically, the US was up high single-digits with strength across industrial and residential, partially offset by supply chain constraints in the commercial business. Western Europe delivered low double-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, led by benefits from new energy-efficient product introductions. Emerging markets was up low single-digits, driven by strong industrial demand. Orders were up 2% organically and continued to outpace revenue with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the quarter. Segment's EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year. And while price realization more than offset inflation, volume and mix for the quarter were negative. Despite lower volumes, demand remains robust as seen in our book-to-bill ratio. However, we expect to continue to deliver sequential EBITDA improvement as the benefit of pricing actions comes through our backlog. And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS exceeded expectations on strong demand and modestly better chip supply with revenue declining 2% organically. We also saw strong growth in our test and pipeline assessment services product lines. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were down mid-single digits and emerging markets was up high single-digits. M&CS orders declined 9% organically in the quarter, due to lapping some large deals in North America and the UK. Underlying demand for our AMI offering remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue. We recorded a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and has built a backlog of over $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was ahead of expectations, expanding 120 basis points sequentially on improved volumes. As supply chain stability improves and we convert our backlog, we will see strong margin accretion on higher volumes as we have previously discussed. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $67 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. Our financial position remains strong with $1.1 billion in cash and $1.9 billion of available liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. As you've seen, the team is delivering strong results in a very dynamic environment. Given the prominence of discussions about macro uncertainty in the economy, it's worth spending a few minutes talking about our confidence in the resilience of underlying demand for Xylem's offerings. The aspect of our sector and our business model that gets most discussed in this context and for good reason is that, our offering is at the core of essential services through the ups and downs of economic cycles. Cities and towns must provide essential water and wastewater services. So, the demand associated with water management tends to be quite resilient. It's also important to understand the dynamics between OpEx versus CapEx across economic cycles, particularly for water utilities. OpEx spending is very stable, given the basic need for day-to-day water services, CapEx which represents roughly a-third of spending on Xylem's offerings is focused on infrastructure expansion, or refurbishment, and it comes with longer regulatory and funding approvals. So spending against these projects once approved, historically, has not wavered to a material extent. And this is not just a US dynamic, but it applies globally. You see it in Europe, both at the regional level. For example, with the EU's recovery and resilience funding, and at the country level as seen in the UK's AMP process. Similarly, infrastructure funding is embedded in China's five-year planning cycle. And of course, you're all familiar with the recent US federal infrastructure funding and the time lines on which the state revolving funds work. Those structural advantages of the sector, however, are only a benefit, if our portfolio delivers distinctive value to our customers through the cycle. For many of our customers, value is defined in terms of becoming more efficient. And that means modernizing their infrastructure, with digital technologies, to make their networks more affordable. Our AMI metrology backlogs offer a proof point about the resilience of that demand. Despite the ongoing chip supply challenges that have dogged the tech sector for the last year, our backlogs have continued to grow. Our distinctive data and communications driven AMI solutions, deliver a step change in both efficiency and resilience for utilities. AMI represents now roughly a-third of all water meters in the US, which shows the progress of adoption, but also the potential for future growth. Given the budgetary pressures the utility face, both to generate revenue and reduce water loss, smart meters will remain a top imperative. One other demand trend that will persist through the cycle and in fact, is set to increase is the growing response to climate change. Cities around the world are committing to net zero emissions. At the same time, they are investing in mitigating the impacts of climate change that are already here, like those, we've seen this summer in the form of historic and tragic flooding in the US and Asia. These are generational challenges. Innovations and new approaches are absolutely essential to solving them, because water management is a significant carbon contributor, accounting for up to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. In commercial and residential markets, cities have begun introducing building regulations to reduce emissions, including efficient water management standards for both regional construction and retrofits, and the utility market, which produces greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the entire global shipping industry. It's going to be required to reduce its carbon intensity in line with the commitments of their cities, municipalities and countries. And we at Xylem are an outright leader in this space and are in a unique position to support our customers in their sustainability commitments. You may have seen that we released our annual sustainability report in May. Among all the progress made against our 2025 goals, I'd highlight that we enabled our customers to reduce their carbon footprint by 730,000 metric tons in 2021 alone using our technology. That is the equivalent of taking 160,000 cars off the road. And we're on track to help them reduce their emissions by 2.8 million metric tons by 2025. So stepping back, we're very confident that the macro force is driving our underlying demand will continue. We're also confident that Xylem is better positioned than ever to create value by helping our customers respond to them. So now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more detail and color on our outlook and guide.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we've provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The outlook across our end markets has broadly improved. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year, with improved price/cost mix and modest improvements in supply chain. We now expect our utility business to grow mid-single digits, up from low single digits. On the wastewater side, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from low to mid-single-digit growth on improved backlog conversion and resilient global demand. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains solid globally. For clean water utilities, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from flat. The main driver is earlier than expected easing of chip supply constraints. Although, supply has improved, lead times continue to remain elevated, and our volumes continue to be constrained. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment services business to continue, due to increasing focus in our end markets on infrastructure and climate challenges, as evidenced by our strong backlog. Please turn to slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth and increased activity in the US and Europe and strong global demand for our solutions. We continue to expect the commercial end market to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new introductions in the US and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect healthy demand to drive double-digit growth, up from mid-single digits. As a reminder, the majority of our commercial and residential end market exposure is replacement driven versus new construction. Now let's turn to slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our outperformance in the second quarter gives us confidence to increase our full year guidance for organic revenue growth and to raise the low end of the adjusted EPS range. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, up from 4% to 6%, and we have raised the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. The increase in the reported revenue guidance is more modest, as the strength of the dollar offsets roughly half of our operational improvements. We have modified our assumptions on our basket of currency exposure, which is included in the appendix. These changes result in an incremental $0.05 headwind to the full year EPS guide. And this is on top of a $0.10 EPS FX headwind that we discussed last quarter. On slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We now expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single digits and low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from high single digits, driven by disciplined commercial execution and backlog conversion on continued strong demand in both segments. We now expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up mid-single digits, up from flat. This reflects the outperformance in the first half from chip supply improving sooner than expected. For 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA margin range, which is now 16.5% to 17% and this yields the adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We're carrying about a month of extra inventory to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions and provide continuity of service to our customers.  We expect to bring conversion back to historical levels as supply chain stabilize, enabling us to return to free cash flow conversion of at least 100%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. And now drilling down on the third quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 10% to 12%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water infrastructure and mid-double-digit growth in Applied Water and M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 17%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We saw the power, some short-term swings this past quarter. A small improvement in chip supply had a big impact. Currency movements have been offering what you could call a challenging forecasting environment and the unexpected duration of COVID shutdowns held China back.  Just a quick note on China, our team and our customers there have been continuing to serve their communities under very tough conditions, given the extensive restrictions in place to manage COVID, I'm incredibly proud of the team. We expect to see progressive improvement in the market for the second half and have full confidence China will continue to be a source of innovation and growth for the long run. In the context of short-term uncertainty, our job is demanded through the unexpected. Meeting those challenges is what being a good operator is all about and the team has certainly been doing that. The team's strong operational execution is built on the same foundation as our 2025 growth and strategic milestones, a consistent story at the heart of our investment thesis. We're building on our leadership position as a technology company with a durable business model. We're benefiting from long-term secular trends of rising demand, driven by water and climate-related challenges. We're driving above-market growth and margin expansion as we digitize our portfolio to serve our customers' imperative to be more efficient. We're successfully putting sustainability at the center of everything we do, across our company, our customers and our communities. And we'll create additional stakeholder value with disciplined capital allocation as opportunity is won. Strong continued demand and the kind of performance we're seeing from the Xylem team show our ability to deliver on that thesis. And with that, operator, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker : Good morning, Deane.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with the better news on the chip supply. And we've been hearing that from other manufacturers that it's starting to improve gradually, and your commentary is pretty consistent with that. But just some additional color, what you see in the quarter? And what's that outlook for the second half? How much of the backlog in digital might you be able to sell?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Good morning, Deane. Thanks for the question. We certainly were pleased to see definitely slightly better supply throughout the quarter. And I think if you go back to where we were from a low point from a revenue perspective, last year in Q4, we're under $300 million of revenue. We clawed that back and we're approaching 350 in the second quarter. So it was definitely a bigger step-up than we had anticipated. As we look at the second half of the year Deane, we see a more modest increase from Q2 to Q3, and then a little more -- another step-up into Q4. We think we're going to exit the year really in line with what we had modeled. We've just been benefiting from some better supply earlier in the year. And I give credit to the team that has been in really close contact with all of our key suppliers leaning in and also being opportunistic in the spot market so that we could take care of our customers.
Patrick Decker: And I would just add Deane that – sorry, for my voice that in addition to that the team has done terrific work not just on landing chips in the spot market, but a lot of the redesign work that we talked about in past quarters is nearing completion. And so there was an added cost in the quarter for that, but it was there to really make sure we secured supply for our customers. And we also shipped out more mechanical meters in the interim in order to bridge that gap while we're waiting on the chip to come through. So there were multiple dynamics, but as Sandy laid out things certainly got better and we feel more confident now about the second half than we did before.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. And just the context of this and I'm not sure if you can give specific numbers, but our expectation is that the profitability of these digitally enhanced products and services they're roughly 50% more profitable than the legacy I don't want to say dumb, but not digitally enabled products and services. Is it still that magnitude of difference in margins on the digital side?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Deane, the margins are clearly richer on the digital side. And we saw that in our mix in M&CS in the quarter. We were about 5% less digital this year compared to last year. And I think that was with the purpose of taking care of our customers and putting product into the hands of our customers where -- to keep them up and going. And so that took a more mechanical meaning this time around. I think as we look at longer-term where we expect to land from a margin perspective nothing has changed structurally from what we laid out in our Investor Day last year in September.
Patrick Decker : If anything gained the backlog has gotten stronger, especially with some of the large deals that we brought in over the last few quarters and the bidding pipeline remains very robust just given how early we still are in terms of conversion to MI across, especially the US on the water side of things. So we expect that runway to be there for quite some time.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just last question for Sandy, on the free cash flow, we've seen most of the companies this earnings season trimming free cash flow guidance, all because of higher working capital commitments both supply chain inefficiencies and big demand. Just -- how do you -- the expectation for returning to 100% free cash flow, is that really dependent on the supply chain? And what would be the time frame?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. I think a great question, Deane. When we built our plan for 2022, we expected that supply chains would be meaningful -- meaningfully improved in the second half of the year. And we're not seeing big changes yet. And therefore we think it's prudent to carry some extra inventory with the leaning of delivering on revenue and delivering on our backlog. So there's, a couple of things that are going on. Lead times are still elongated. We're still having problems where we're missing one or two key components and then we're not able to get the entire solution out the door. And of course inflation is bringing up the overall balances in our inventory. But we will bring that down. We'd expect that is certainly in 2023 at the latest and it will be a key focus item for our teams. This is not something that we plan to do for a long period of time.
Patrick Decker: And from a segment perspective Deane, it was most notable in Applied Water, where again we've had continued knock-on effects whether be supply chain casings coming out of China due to COVID. Obviously, we expect those to continue somewhat in the second half. And that's why to Sandy's point we brought in an extra month of inventory into that business. So it's very visible. We know exactly what it is. It's totally under control. It's simply a matter of meaning to do that in order to supply customers and maintain that demand.
Deane Dray: All right. That was great color. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Nathan.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Nath.
Nathan Jones: Going back to M&CS, I think Dan asked enough questions on the chip supply and how that's progressing. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the expected profitability of that business as we see revenue pick up in the third quarter, and then you've talked about a bigger step-up in the fourth quarter, assuming that it's probably going to continue to improve going into next year. Can you talk about the path to getting back to those profitability targets that you laid out at the Investor Day? Where might we be able to get to in 2023? How quickly can you get to that kind of expected margin level on the business?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. I think obviously a really important question, Nath. I think one thing I want to call out is we've already seen from the low point in Q4, 300 basis points of margin expansion from Q4 to Q2. And that's evolving because of the higher volumes, partially constrained by some of the things that we referenced earlier in the call the mechanical mix the redesign costs on optimal manufacturing flows. But as we look out into the back half of the year, there's not as much of a pickup from a revenue perspective, but we would expect margins to kind of continue along the same trajectory that we've recognized from Q4 Q to Q2. And I'm not going to give guidance on 2023 on this call. But as we look out to 2024, 2025 we don't see anything structurally different about where margins should land in that time period.
Nathan Jones: Okay. My follow-up is Europe and Industrial. One of the biggest concerns we hear from investors is Europe and industrial not only are you not seeing that. I think that was one of the stronger areas in terms of growth in the quarter and solid orders there. Maybe you can talk about the trends that you're seeing there? And then, if you can talk about the resilience of the industrial business in general, particularly the lot industrial side of the business, and how you would expect that to react in the potential for a recession in Europe?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. I think for us Europe has been a real bright spot. And it's not just in one segment. It's really across the entire portfolio. We've seen good revenues in Europe. We've seen good orders. I know, there's a lot of concern about potential recession in Europe, and the industrial market in particular. I think one thing, I would call out is that, if you look at our dewatering business, for example, which is more industrial, we've done a lot to diversify the end markets there, much less exposure to oil and gas than we did in the prior recession. I think we're down to about 1% revenue in that end market. And then, of course, there we've also been diversifying from a geographic perspective.
Patrick Decker: Again, I would just offer up, Nathan, you publicly recall this, but if you go back over time, and look at previous kind of industrial recessions back in kind of the 2015, 2016 timeframe, our European business still held up in terms of growth during that timeframe, because the results are much less cyclical there given the end market exposure that we've got. And also – so for example, I think the numbers in 2016, Europe still grew 3% despite being in the middle of an industrial recession.\ So, we feel pretty good about that. We think it would be that resilient again. I think as you well know, if we were to first see any softening in orders which we've not seen to this point, it would be – it would be in our short-cycle businesses, which would be more applied water and dewater. And again, we've not seen that yet. Our backlog continues to grow good book-to-bill, and again, obviously there would be actions that we would take, if we began to see those metrics coming through, as we've done in the past. We can phase investments. We still have further productivity opportunities to go after across the organization, and we're sitting on record backlogs. And the fact that, we've been able to weather the chip supply issue, without losing any business, and those deals and backlog is pretty strong statement about the resilience of our pipeline and the markets that we serve.
Nathan Jones: Thanks for taking my questions. I’ll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Thank you
Operator: We will take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Connor Lynagh: Yeah. Thanks. Just wanted to talk a little bit about cash flow and capital allocation. So, on the cash flow side, your full year free cash flow guidance does seem to anticipate some pretty good relief on working capital investment in the back half. I'm just thinking through, it looks like you have a CapEx acceleration. Obviously, we can sort of get to the EBITDA number. So – is that because you think that you will be starting to work down inventories, or is that just sort of a seasonal release in working capital that you're anticipating?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. No. Great question. We do have a plan to start working down some of our inventory through the back half of the year. It's nothing dramatic. It's going to take place over the next six months on a very gradual basis. And I think we are – our teams have been doing a good job on the elements around working capital. We are going to continue to lean in hard on collections, and make sure we bring those in, and that – we've seen really good results through the pandemic on our collection front. And similarly, we're doing work around, getting better terms from a payable perspective. I may have referenced it on another call. We have a supply chain financing program that's quite active, and it allows our supplier base to take advantage of our credit rating. We're getting more of our supplier base engaged on that program, and that will give us some incremental days from a payables perspective. And I think, it all ties into being prudent also around cost and discretionary spend, and CapEx spend to make sure, we start seeing a better cash conversion in the second half, which lines up with our historical seasonality as well.
Connor Lynagh: Makes sense. And then, I was noticing, it looks like you slowed your cadence of buybacks in the quarter. Is that driven by any concern around the state of the business? Is it because you're starting to see more opportunities emerge on M&A? Just any color on what you're thinking there?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. So we haven't changed our strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We've typically bought stock back in the first quarter, which is when we have a vesting date in our equity compensation programs. And so this was nothing that we bought back stock in Q1. We wrapped that up at – in the March time frame. And as we look at our M&A funnel, and pipeline, we still see a really – we're really encouraged by the funnel, the range of opportunities, and that remains a higher priority for us than buying back our stock.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, I would just add to that, if you look at our balance sheet, we've got upwards of about $4 billion in dry powder, and we are not hesitant to do a deal when it needs to be done. But again, that would all be in advanced in serving our strategy that we've laid out. As Sandy said, the pipeline is very active all different sizes of opportunities in that pipeline. But again, we want to continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. And again, as I always say it takes two to tango.
Connor Lynagh: Right. Makes sense. I'll leave that comment for somebody else to ask about. But – thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Mike.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: Many thanks for that. So the – obviously, you guys seem pretty confident in the underlying trends of the end market. I know, you spent a lot of time talking about the – your ability to react as things do so here or there. But obviously, backlog is really strong. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how that visibility from the backlog stretches out here? How does that compare to what that normal visibility looks like? And any color you can around how much – how booked out you are as we get to out years at this point?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. I think, Mike really good question. Nothing has changed structurally about our backlog. If you look at our AWS business that has a larger book-to-bill ratio than the other segments, and we're carrying record backlogs across really all three of our segments. And we did see really strong book-to-bill ratios across the portfolio in the quarter from an orders perspective. As we look at our water infrastructure and Xylem's M&CS backlogs, they stretch out for longer periods of time. Water infrastructure is in the middle. We have our transport business, which turns fairly quickly and a treatment business that has projects that stand out for multiple years. And then M&TS is the longest coupled with the supply chain constraints, which don't magically disappear at any one month, we have a $2 billion backlog there. So that's going to take a couple of years plus to work to work through.
Mike Halloran: Appreciate that. And then the price cost cadence sequential improvement catching up on the price side relative to the inflation pressures. How does that work in the back half of the year on an EBITDA dollar basis when you think your whole? What do you think margins start reflecting the positive pricing you're putting through?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I mean, we are really pleased with what we saw from a price perspective. We've leaned in harder on price, because inflation is also coming in higher throughout the year. A big milestone we did get price cost positive in the quarter from a dollar perspective, given the magnitude it's slightly dilutive to the rate in Q2. Q3 is a little bit lower from a seasonality -- a little bit lower on the revenue side compared to Q2 just because of the typical seasonality in our water infrastructure business. And so in Q3, we expect to continue to be price/cost positive on a dollar basis, probably still in the same order of magnitude about 30 basis points this quarter in that order of magnitude dilutive from a rate perspective. And then we think in Q4, we should be positive again from a dollar perspective and neutral from a rate perspective. So, really good progress across the portfolio to reach this important milestone.
Mike Halloran: Thank you. Yes.
Patrick Decker: If I could just go back to your question on visibility and backlog. I think the other dimension that we feel much better about now than we even did in the last industrial downturn is the visibility and the closest we have to our channel partners, our distribution channel partners both here in the US as well as in Europe, where we have meaningful indirect channel business. And we've got much better visibility and coordination with them now than we did back then. So we got hit with a couple of surprises last time around in a quarter or two, we feel much better about that not happening going forward. So they are also our eyes and ears of what's going on in the marketplace at a local level.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that Patrick. Thanks, Sandy.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning everybody.
Patrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Scott.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis : A couple of little things here. I mean, the supply chain issues, I mean, chips we've been talking about for quite some time, have the other supply chain challenges gotten a lot better the non-chip related stuff getting materials faster easier.
Patrick Decker: Yes. Scott another great question. It's a mixed bag. I'd say, supply chain in the aggregate has modestly improved versus Q1, but it really does vary across the three segments. So as we mentioned, chip supply getting a bit better within MCS, but lead times are still long but they're not worse, they're getting better. And water infrastructure, we have seen improvement in lead times from our European factory into the US. And certainly, what our infrastructure has benefited over the last year by offering more competitive lead times due to better vertical integration that we did within the company. But then I would say as we mentioned earlier one of the reasons we're carrying an extra month of inventory is because of applied water. It's not limited to ply water but that's the main driver. And that's really again just knock on effects from China mainly castings, but also we see continued delays in shipping and logistics that we're just having to work through. So I'd say, it's getting marginally better across the board, but it really varies by segment. . 
Scott Davis: And we talked a little bit about China. I -- how does it work? When you think about their controlled economy like that and their CapEx budgets and how they think about cadencing projects and stuff when you have the lockdowns like you've had this year does it -- does it push the projects to 2023 but then the existing 2023 plan remains and then they try to catch up does everything pushed, right? I mean how does China kind of work?
Patrick Decker: Sure, yes. So -- and obviously, it's a big market. So it does vary depending upon the vertical -- the end markets that we're talking about. What we find is that the utility side is much more stable. So right now the issue for us has not been so much for our plants not to be up and running. We returned back to, kind of, normal levels in terms of staffing and presence back in May I believe it was. It really though is logistics and transportation have been at a standstill because customers and colleagues are required to be at home. These impact all kinds of projects Scott, but mainly the government-funded projects. But that's not a bad thing because those projects don't go away. They simply shift to the right. And we would see from the past that there would be an accelerated catch-up as the restrictions are lifted. So we've got plenty of capacity in our factories and as to the distribution partners to get this stuff out. It's simply a matter of sites not being open. I mean, customer job sites, utilities not being open. That's what we're waiting to see recovery. We're not assuming that we're going to get much of any recovery in the second half of this year, but we do expect that to recover to come back quite strongly in 2023. But no structural changes in our view on the attractiveness of China. This is simply things moving to the right. 
Scott Davis: Okay. That’s really helpful. Best of luck. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brain, your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi. Hello. This is Miguel on for Brian. Just a quick question on the supply chain on the chips. I know a lot has been talked about there, but it sounds like on chip supply it's definitely -- commentary sounds it's improving, but some of your peers have still been kind of been more cautious on the chip supply. Is there anything on the supply side or what you're doing specifically that maybe is helping you out a bit more recently versus peers? 
Sandra Rowland: I can't speak for all of our peers. I think, we have been working very -- as we said earlier, working very closely with our suppliers. The trajectory on where we exit the year is very consistent with what we expected. It's been good work to get some better chip supply earlier. And also within M&CS, there have been some other product lines that have been strong as well. It's not only the chips that drove the upside in M&CS. So we're seeing good results from our test business, some traction with our pipeline assessment services business. And so that broader portfolio is also helping us get out ahead of what we had modeled for the year.
Patrick Decker: The only other thing I would add, which I – I'm cautious to share too much on this because we've got good visibility but it's not perfect because things could change. But I do think, depending upon who you're including in that peer group, it talks about digital, we've got somewhat higher concentration. Therefore we get a bit more leverage with suppliers. And we've got some really strong relationships with our partners, whether it be the direct suppliers from the chips and wafers or whether it be our partnership with Flex, we aggregate our demand and I think it gives us a stronger platform, at least stronger than what would be if we were doing it all on our own. So some of these things it's also just – I mean the number of calls that I and others have been on with the leaders of these companies and you just got – the team has been working it. And we've had to be more patient than we wanted to. But I think those relationships and those investments and relationships are beginning to pay-off.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thanks a lot. I’ll pass it on. Appreciate the color.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Saree Boroditsky: Good morning. So you highlighted strong growth in dewatering applications across most geographies. Could you talk about the benefit that had on March during the quarter? And should that continue to be a margin tailwind for the remainder of the year? 
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So if you look at water infrastructure business sits, we saw a really good margin performance. That business has been the most resilient when we look over the past couple of years. And certainly, the recovery in dewatering is a contributing factor. And so a lot of hard work has gone into our dewatering business both to diversify it from an end market perspective, from a geographic perspective. We've made some purposeful investments in our fleet to make it more modern and current and we're seeing that upside on the rental side as well. So certainly dewatering positive seeing good orders momentum there continue in the quarter on a global basis. So certainly helpful to the margin expansion story with the water infrastructure.
Patrick Decker: Yes. And I would just add it's – I mean certainly, it's one of the shorter cycle businesses that we've got and it's not immune to cyclical downturn just like it hits it up on the way up. I think the other area that we benefited from is full on integration within our commercial team, most notably in North America, where I think it's been upgraded and leadership. I think there have been investments that Sandy as talked about. And the diversification has really been away from heavy oil and gas and mining and looking at more utility muni opportunities, where there's visibility with some of our other businesses in the portfolio. So good lead generation by sharing leads with our field services teams. So we're in the early stages of that, but we've had some really good growth rates there. We're up maybe yes double-digit here through the first half of the year on the order side and we hope that continues.
Saree Boroditsky: Okay. And then obviously, you've talked a lot about MCS and kind of the strong growth outlook there, but organic colors declined in the quarter. So just wondering, do you expect to see orders turn positive again? 
Sandy Rowland: I think when orders -- we've had a real surge in orders, over the past several quarters and so while the headline print on orders for MCS may have been negative, when you look at the orders from a dollar perspective, we're still running well ahead of what we're able to convert from a revenue perspective. I think we had $475 million of orders in the quarter, which is still a really good number relative to our revenue. The pipeline continues to be robust. We're still in the early innings of the overall AMI conversion journey. About one-third of the industry has converted to AMI, in North America. So, there's still a lot of runway and we have a really differentiated product there that's gaining traction. 
Patrick Decker: Yes. And I think as we said earlier, I know none of us ever like to be talking about difficult year-over-year comps, when you have big deals in a quarter last year, but it is there is some element of the nature of that in the business. And we'll certainly be even more transparent, going forward as to, how big are those deals, what other big deals are coming because it is a big rich pipeline right now that we're bidding on. And so, we have been running hot for the better part of 1.5 years or so, on some big deals big books. So but we were very positive on that pipeline. 
Q – Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Patrick, I said maybe you could talk about, what you're seeing on the municipal water front and how IAG [ph] funding may be starting to flow in. Have you seen any of that funding, yet? And how are you thinking about that moving forward into 2023? . 
Patrick Decker: Yes. No we've really -- we've not seen -- I mean well first of all, we see demand in utilities very robust. And especially here, I mean stable in Europe, good emerging markets obviously ex-China and was really strong in the quarter here in North America. We really have not seen anything meaningful, come through from a funding standpoint, yet. So that would still be upside. And -- we talk a lot about the infrastructure bill here in the US. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you've also got the recovery and resilience funding going on in the EU. You've got at the country level in the UK's five-year process, that we talk about. And then you've got the infrastructure funding that's embedded in Sean's five-year planning cycle, which remains unchanged. So all those together, we think really point to a very strong funding infrastructure for utility spend globally.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Got. That's helpful, Patrick. And I know Sandy, you talked about price cost improving. Obviously, you've mentioned productivity in the past. It seems like it's also improving, but maybe you can talk about that how constrained labor is and you're sort of pushing productivity as you go forward and how that impacts the overall price cost dynamic?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So I think we were price cost positive excluding productivity in the quarter. So that was really encouraging. We have a pipeline of continuous improvement product -- projects that we're driving across the portfolio. Some of that has been a little bit constrained this year, as we've moved engineers off of continuous improvement projects, on to redesign work. As Patrick talked about earlier in the call is that work matures and we move through the sort of the test and certification part of that process, we'll be able to bring some of our resources back and focus on continuous improvement projects and continue to pick up momentum on the productivity front as well. But I think looking across the globe our teams are doing a good job there and it's contributing to our margin improvement story on a quarter sequential basis.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open
Joe Giordano: Hey guys. good morning.
Patrick Decker: Hey good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Hey Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey. So, when -- you think when we start -- when this all normalizes on supply chain, you look back at how it went and you think about -- sorry when you think about M&CS like what do you think you're going to come out thinking like this is what we did really well. This is some things that we need to like structurally maybe alter going forward to kind of meet a new reality.
Patrick Decker: It's a great question. I think right now Joe as -- certainly as I look at it and Sandy can certainly comment here. I think we're going to look back on and say we did quite well is navigating through the chip supply and holding a team together, holding morale, people spending days and nights and weekends over and over and over again on the phone with suppliers. Customers working -- our commercial teams are working with customers keeping them on board. Nobody happy. But the team's fortitude really shown through and it continued to show through. I think two, the fact that there have been no cancellations in a record backlog is a testimony to that. And no decline in the margins of that backlog due to chip supply. Our margins have been impacted by some of the near-term choices we've had to make on spending money on redesigns, on selling some mechanical meters in at lower margin than our other meters. And so those I think are all going to be in the plus column. I think if there were things that we could have done differently the one that comes to mind for me was I think we probably waited a little too long to get going on some of the redesign work. I don't think we missed it by much. But I think we all learned that the sooner you get on that, the better you're going to get because it takes a while to sort through that. So, that would be my high-level takes on this, but we're not out of it yet. So, we still have time to reserve the right to get smarter. 
Joe Giordano: That’s good color. Thank you, Pat. And then maybe I'll ask one some of your more international products, you've been hearing this from some other companies. Have you seen like increased international competition from like maybe competitors who are selling in US dollars, but have like fully local currency cost basis, so they don't really need to raise prices. I guess their margins are benefiting and you guys are in a comparably tougher situation. Are you seeing any of that?
Sandy Rowland: Joe, we're really not seeing anything meaningful on that front. We're seeing across our end markets with our competitors that they are also taking price increases. I mean nobody has been immune to inflation in this market. And so we have been the price leader where we have competitive advantage. And so--
Patrick Decker: We have a structural probably a somewhat different structure than some of our peers or other companies that you follow. And that our competitive base products that we for example sell out of Europe. Those product lines are also predominantly European competitors. So, we've got great footprint, whether it be in Italy, whether it be in Sweden, whether it be the UK. So -- and we've reduced our lead times on still being able to ship those things into the US. In North America, the markets we serve, our competitor there are for the most part, US-based companies also. So, there's just structurally not that big of a disadvantage vis-à-vis our competitors. We're kind of all in the same boat. We don't take that for granted. We're always looking for ways to further localize and take cost out and reduce lead times. 
Joe Giordano: Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning and wanted to say nice quarter.
Patrick Decker: Thank you
Sandy Rowland: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Appreciate it.
John Walsh: A lot of ground covered, question around price cost. One, just wondering, if you could talk about what you're seeing sequentially with some of the big cost buckets be it materials, logistics et cetera. And then, I know you've done some structural pricing initiatives, just how much of the price you think is structural? And how much might be tied to surcharges? Thank you.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Yes, I'll take the last one first. And -- when you look at what we've done from a pricing perspective, we haven't taken the approach to tack on surcharges. What we've done is more permanent price increases. So, that's been our road map there. Let me give a little bit of color from a price perspective, we saw a big step-up in our price realization from Q1 to Q2. We'd expect that to moderate in the back half of the year, because it was the second half of the year, last year that we started turning on our price increases. So, that will level out a bit in the second half. And I think the other thing, I would just close with to remind people, there's been some headlines on some moderation in commodity pricing. We're still seeing inflation in many of the other categories, freight, labor, overhead, et cetera. And so, we're still facing an inflationary environment. But net-net, all in, we're going to be in a better place in the second half of the year, than we were in the first half.
John Walsh: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-on, any color you can provide kind of last time we saw commodity deflation and experience that. I mean, obviously, as you just noted it's more than commodities, but just curious historically, the ability of the price.
Patrick Decker: Yes. The -- if you take one example of when we were in the heavy tariff situation and then a number of those tariffs were rolled back, we did not give up those increases because of the value that we were selling to our customers, and they understood the situation we were in. And so, historically, when there has been a rollback in material inflation, we've been pretty successful at hanging on to that. So, I think almost entirely successful in doing that. But I'm sure, there's an exception or two here or there. But in the headline numbers, they don't roll back.
John Walsh: Great. Thanks for fitting me in and taking the questions. Appreciate it. Welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously supply chain problems affect everybody and probably touched on this a quarter ago. Are you seeing any situations where some of the smaller middle market players that could be prospective acquisition targets for you, are struggling disproportionately and perhaps creating kind of an opportunistic situation for you to look at M&A?
Patrick Decker: No. It's an interesting question. And I think it was perhaps raised earlier in the previous quarter when we were all even more, needy into supply chain challenges. We never really looked at it that way. We haven't really seen, I mean the companies that we look at are high-quality and may not always be at big scale, but they are pretty good at managing their supply chains as well. I mean, they're much more focused on product line or a couple of offerings. Having said that I do believe -- and this speaks to maybe the question that Joe asked earlier, I think all of us look at supply chain now as being one of the new most important competitive advantages that a company needed to have, because whether it be chip supply this time it will be something else down the road. And the world is so interdependent at this point in time. And we've got a whole lot better ourselves. We still have ways to go. But I do think that it can be the form of a new synergy going forward, but it's not prominent in our thinking about the specific pipeline that we've got right now.
Pavel Molchanov: Understood. A follow-up about the U.K. specifically. There was a report from one of the government experts the other day saying that without the implementation of smart water metering, the U.K. would be experiencing outright water scarcity by the end of this decade, pretty striking headline. Just thought, I'd get your perspective on that.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. So I won't prognosticate on the prediction. But what I can reinforce is, the lead of late which is the office of water in the U.K. they regulate the 17 or so utilities that serve the U.K. And that five-year AMP cycle they go through there is a preempt piece to that where they all have to come for with their proposals in order to get their funding approvals, their rate cases approved. And all that is published very visibly as to what are the top three priorities that each utility is focusing on, they're mandated to have that. And we can confirm that, in this last cycle unlike any cycle before, virtually every one of utilities when you look at what they were trying to solve for it was things around scarcity. It was things around water losses and how they do all that in an affordable efficient way. So that common theme was a big deal. And then also in some cases, climate change impact in terms of flood prevention and building more resilient infrastructure. So there is a lot there. It makes it a very attractive market. So hopefully that was helpful.
Pavel Molchanov: Thank you very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker, for any additional or closing remarks.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The team came into 2022 with strong momentum, and they've taken full advantage of robust underlying demand around the world to deliver our first quarter operational results above expectations.  Revenues grew 4% organically, surpassing our guidance. Despite ongoing chip shortages constraining our utilities business, supply is slowly improving, which is reflected in quarter sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in our metrology business.  Revenue strength was also broad-based globally. We saw healthy growth in every region, excluding China, given the COVID impact there. Western Europe was a standout, delivering 10% growth in the quarter.  But the robust global demand for our offering comes through most clearly in the pace of order intake. Orders were up 14% for the quarter, with record order bookings in every segment. M&CS at the fastest pace with a 25% order surge, as the value proposition of digital technologies continues to fuel demand.  Orders performance across the portfolio pushed our already healthy backlogs to 50% growth year-on-year. EBITDA margin performance was also above our previous guidance due to strong price realization, which mitigated much of the inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we continue to drive productivity and further simplification throughout the business. As a result of that good work from the team, we delivered EPS of $0.47, again, above our expectations.  The quarter did present some fresh challenges. China's ongoing response to COVID is having significant impact on our business, and it will have flow-on effects for some time in the global supply chain. And while our European business delivered exceptional revenue growth, the euro rate began to move unfavorably.  So conditions are dynamic. But the quarter's operational results show that the team is doing an excellent job, navigating the challenges and managing what it can control on a global basis.  Looking ahead, we're in a very strong position. as structural demand continues to be robust in all end markets and regions. And we have market leadership in the categories where demand is greatest, especially in digitally-enabled solutions. So we are raising our guidance for the year, and are on track to deliver the longer-term growth and strategic milestones we laid out at our Investor Day last fall.  Before turning over to Sandy for performance detail by segment, I want to mention how proud I am with the Xylem team and of our partners for their response to the war in Ukraine. When the war broke out, the Xylem team stepped up right away to provide for the safety and well-being of all of our Ukrainian colleagues and their families. Similarly, our team has shown extraordinary support by raising money for the humanitarian relief work of our NGO partners, whose activities include providing essential water and sanitation services both in Ukraine and the refugees. It's become one of our most successful mass giving campaigns ever, and I could not be prouder of the team.  Now I'll hand over to Sandy to review the quarter's results by segment.
Sandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll give some additional color on our first quarter results. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did a great job delivering on our commitments with particularly strong performance on price and backlog execution. Revenue growth was healthy in all regions, led by a double-digit result in Western Europe and mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenues grew high single digits excluding China, which was affected by COVID shutdowns.  In a moment, I'll offer detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 3%. Strength in Western Europe was offset by ongoing chip supply constraints and their outsized impact on our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 10% on increasing activity in all geographies, excluding China, with particular strength in Western Europe. Commercial was up 11%, led by healthy growth in the U.S., and residential was up 15%, also driven by the U.S. Organic orders were up 14% in the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the quarter set historically high order intake with robust demand for our technologies across all segments.  EBITDA margin was 14.2%, which was above our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected price realization. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 290 basis points. We got healthy price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation, and lower volumes from chip shortages impacting our higher-margin smart metering solutions. As previously mentioned, we'll continue to offset inflation with progressive price realization. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.47.  Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the quarter were up 12% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets.  Water Infrastructure revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, and we saw revenue acceleration in our U.S. wastewater utility business as prior quarter order to revenue conversion delays eased.  Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up mid-double digits driven by treatment deliveries in the U.S. and healthy utility OpEx in both regions. Emerging markets was down low double digits due to a challenging prior year compare in China and impacts from the recent COVID lockdown. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 140 basis points a strong price realization and productivity benefits were more than offset by inflation and investments.  Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, first quarter orders were up 8% organically, led by price and underlying global demand. Revenues increased 10% on strong backlog execution across all end markets, along with solid price realization.  Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-double digits. All end markets showed strength, and we benefited from the traction of new product launches. Western Europe delivered high single-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, and increased activity in large industrial accounts.  Emerging Markets was up mid-single digits on backlog execution and activity. Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points in the quarter. Similar to water infrastructure, we delivered solid price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation.  And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 25% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand and pipeline assessment services.  While a portion of our M&CS backlog includes orders that have been delayed due to chip shortages, our M&CS backlog is up 60% versus the prior year. It is now more than $2 billion. As we anticipated, revenue declined 9% due to constrained chip supply. We are encouraged by the gradual improvement in availability, and we realized significant quarter sequential gains. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both margin accretive and resilient. There have been no cancellations of AMI awards.  Geographically, Western Europe and emerging markets were flat with some growth from our pipeline assessment services business. Chip shortages pressed U.S. revenues down 14%. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 470 basis points compared to the prior year, but higher than last quarter. As we've noted in previous calls, the business gets very strong operating leverage from higher volumes and revenues, and those are still being held back by the supply-constrained conversion of orders. We were able to partially offset those effects with price and productivity gains.  And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. Consistent with typical seasonality patterns, we used cash in the first quarter. This year, we also strategically increased safety stocks to mitigate supply chain volatility and are carrying higher inventory balances.  Our financial position remains robust with $1.1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.  And please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We'll turn to detailed guidance in a moment, but as I mentioned, we are increasing our revenue outlook due to continued strong demand and higher price realization. We're also raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance by $0.05, despite increasing foreign exchange headwinds.  The team is demonstrating that we are able to use our market leadership to drive price while holding and in many cases, even gaining share as reflected in the level of our order growth trends and expanding backlogs.  In fact, I want to give a big shout out to the team, including our channel and distribution partners for doing such a great job making sure our pricing moderated the effects of inflation. We also continue to foresee chip supply playing out much as we anticipated. We've had improved supply this quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in each successive quarter through the year.  Supply of chips remains well below our current needs and is expected to remain that way through at least early 2023. Yet, our team, along with our most critical suppliers and our customers continue to navigate the challenge and maintain current backlog while still winning new business.  With our ability to capture price on surging demand and with progressive order to revenue conversion, we're confident in lifting our full year guidance. Inflation will continue to be a significant factor, of course, so we will keep driving further price realization as appropriate.  In just a moment, you'll see we've significantly modified our euro exchange assumptions, and that will have a moderating impact on our reported EPS, but we expect the team will be able to cover the majority of those headwinds operationally. Sandy will give more color on that at a segment level in a few minutes. But the overall picture is more positive than we previously anticipated for the year, and puts us squarely on track to deliver our longer-term growth and strategic milestones.  When we laid out those milestones, we also detail the strategic pillars that would enable us to deliver them. They included making it easier for customers to do business with us, making it easier for our colleagues to serve them and continuing to reduce business complexity. So today, alongside our quarterly results, we've announced that we are further unifying and simplifying our segment and regional leadership.  Since the acquisitions that created our M&CS segment, we maintained a separate commercial interface to utility customers. This was necessary for some time to create a strong and focused new offering from Xylem, which has proven successful in achieving record deal wins and backlog.  Now we believe we have the opportunity to move to the next phase of our journey and building a single platform, one that leverages the market-leading breadth of our portfolio and makes it easier for customers to access it. We've previously done that across the rest of the world, except North America. So today, we announced that we are moving to 1 interface for our customers across the Americas as well.  We are integrating and unifying the leadership of the Americas commercial team. They will report to Matthew Pine, who will also now assume leadership of both the AWS and M&CS segments.  In Europe, Hayati Arcadis continues to lead commercial operations as well as the Water Infrastructure segment and will now lead the build-out of Xylem services offering globally. And Fran Sabinco will continue to lead commercial operations across the emerging markets.  As a result of the changes we've announced today, Colin Sable will leave Xylem after a transition period during which he will focus on a smooth leadership handover and provide advisory support to me and the leadership team. Most of you know, Colin. And so you know he has been a stalwart contributor to Xylem's growth story since the beginning. In his 16 years with the company, both with Xylem and our predecessor, ITT, his insight has been at the center of our strategic vision. His leadership has contributed to our emergence as a market leader in digital technologies as our M&CS orders growth shows, and I am profoundly grateful to have benefited from his considerable talent and unwavering commitment. We will miss him at the leadership table and our colleagues will miss him as a leader.  Turning to sustainability. Our growth framework emphasizes the creation of both economic and social value. Our performance on social value creation is highlighted in our annual sustainability report, which we'll publish later this month.  I won't steal too much of his thunder, but I am happy to share that Xylem is well ahead of schedule and reducing carbon emissions. Since 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas intensity by 12%, across Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We've also driven our own water use down by more than 20% and doubled our rate of water recycling versus just 3 years ago.  The rigor and transparency of our reporting reflect our commitment to accountability as a sustainability leader. So I invite you to dig into the report when it comes out because sustainability is so fundamental to our strategic differentiation to our investment thesis and to our growth.  Now I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more color on our outlook and guide.
Sandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with modestly better volumes and stronger price realization across our end markets.  Our end market outlook remains largely consistent with the view we offered last quarter with a few notable changes. We continue to expect our utility business to grow low single digits. On the wastewater side, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth on resilient global demand. We anticipate wastewater demand in emerging markets to continue being driven by investment in public utilities, healthy OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. One note though is some shift to the second half due to the impacts from COVID closures in China.  The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains very solid globally. On the clean water side, we continue to expect demand to remain very robust as the AMI and the advantages of a static meters continue to gain momentum with an increasingly broad spectrum of utilities.  With double-digit revenue growth in the second half on improving chip supply, we expect full year revenues to be flat. We expect continued momentum in our Test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth on steady demand for our solutions globally. We foresee healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from robust mining demand and our channel expansion strategy. In the U.S. and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity continues to ramp in light industrial applications with considerable traction from new product introductions and large account activity in Western Europe.  The commercial end market is now expected to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new product introductions in the U.S. and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth on healthy demand.  And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As Patrick mentioned, our outperformance in the first quarter is giving us risk momentum, and we are increasing full year guidance for organic revenue growth and raising the low end of the adjusted EPS range. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year. We are lifting full year organic revenue growth to 4% to 6%, up from 3% to 5%. The 1% organic growth increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization. But from a reporting perspective, we anticipate it will be offset by a lower euro.  We are narrowing the EPS range to $2.40 to $2.70, which boosts the low end from $2.35. This reflects strong price realization, which will be partially offset by inflation and the euro FX headwinds. The emerging impact from a weakening euro is significant to us. Our initial full year guidance assumed a euro of 1.13. Our updated guidance now assumes the euro at 1.05, which is a $0.10 headwind to the full year EPS guide.  For your reference, we have included an FX sensitivity table in the appendix. We will closely monitor the global supply chain environment and continue to proactively manage impact from China's COVID lockdowns and the secondary effects of the warrant in Ukraine.  On Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid-single-digit growth due to stronger price. We continue to expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. This assumes down roughly double digits in the first half of the year and up double digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the year progresses.  For 2022, we still expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And this yields adjusted EPS range of $2.40 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. And we still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models.  And now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be flattish to up 1%. This includes low single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, and M&CS is expected to decline low double digits. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We came into 2022 in a strong and enviable position, even in the face of headwinds from chip supply and inflation. Our performance in the first quarter has shown the team's ability to capitalize on our market leadership and deliver with discipline despite the various challenges around the world.  Demand has never been greater, we have strong commercial momentum, and we have a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic flexibility. And we have a great team showing resilience, agility and experience in managing the dynamics of a truly global business.  While our customers are as local as water is, the biggest water challenges are global, and the water sector is increasingly well networked internationally. Still, Xylem is one of only a small handful of global water players. That puts us in a strong position to play a leadership role in support of both the sector and our mission to solve water. So as you likely saw in our March announcement, we made the decision to move Xylem's headquarters to Washington, D.C., which is one of the main crossroads of the global water sector. Washington is not just the seat of U.S. water policy. It's where water thought leaders from all over the world convene, including the private sector, governments from around the world, multilaterals, academia and civil society.  We've also taken the opportunity of the move to reimagine our footprint for more flexible ways of working and simplifying and leaning our headquarters. The new location is on Water Street. Yes, it's on Water Street, right on the Anacostia River. We'll be officially opening the space in mid-June, and I look forward to welcoming all of you when you visit D.C.  Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note of thanks. This is Matt Latino's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We previously announced that Matt is taking a new role in Xylem, and it's an exciting new chapter for him. I know from comments so many of you have made over the years that you deeply value Matt's energy, accessibility and professionalism, and I benefited from his insightful counsel and his persistent positive encouragement through every kind of circumstance. So thank you, Matt.  Some of you have already met Andrea Vanderberg, who's taking the reins as our Investor Relations leader. Andrea has had great impact as the Head of Financial Planning and Analysis for Xylem. So she brings distinctively deep knowledge of the business to her leadership of IR. I'm confident you'll really enjoy getting to know Andrea and will find great value in working with her and from her insights and perspectives.  Now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital.
Deane Dray: Good morning, everyone. Maybe we can start with MC&S and just more encouraging news on the chip shortage front. Can you give us a sense, now you've got record backlog that is -- I'd be interested in hearing what the implied margins are. And maybe some sense about -- so customers are giving you these orders, knowing they're going to be delayed to a degree. So it doesn't sound like you've lost any competitive positioning there. So maybe we can start there.
Patrick Decker: Sure, Deane. I'll start with the latter half of your question, then I'll have Sandy speak to the margin profile in more detail. You're right. I mean, we've -- I think the team has done a great job working both with the suppliers of chips, but also with our customers on hanging on to deals and backlog. So we've had no losses of deals here in terms of cancellations. Also, what we're seeing is really good traction in terms of momentum, especially around midsized utilities as we're seeing greater adoption there as well, which is really encouraging. And so it smooths out kind of what our demand is going to be over time. . What we would say on the chip supply, as we said in our comments, is that we've seen a gradual recovery. And so we're not changing our outlook for the full year. It's just more confident in terms of what we're seeing there. So really encouraging.  Sandy, do you want to speak more to the margin profile?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Deane, when we look at the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in, we're really encouraged about the margin structure. It's accretive to the company. And as you already know, this business gets really good leverage. I think you can see that already when you look at this quarter sequential improvement even from Q4 to Q1, where we've had about a $20 million pickup in revenue and seeing very good margin recovery as the revenue line grows. So very satisfied with the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in.
Patrick Decker: Not out of the woods yet, Deane. I mean, obviously, still risk there, but we think we've got that embedded in our guide for the full year.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And then the follow-up question are on the recent headwinds. And look, FX has always been -- we know your exposure, that's the math, and I'm glad you've laid that all out. But how about reflect on China, it's roughly 8% of revenues, just true me up on that. And how -- what's the expectations on how this plays out? We know your headquarters is in Shanghai, and just some real-time update and expectations of the reopening.
Patrick Decker: Sure, Deane. Yes, so our revenue exposure is roughly $350 million, about 7% of our total revenue. The impact in the first quarter was about $20 million in revenue. Our guide implies another $20 million in Q2. So first half of the year right now will be down about 20% in revenue. Second half, we expect to be up about 20% because we saw some of the impacts of lockdown even in the fourth quarter, still lingering in China.  We've got 4 factories in China. As you said, we got our headquarters in Shanghai. Three of those factories were closed for a few weeks. Later, they opened up at 50% capacity. All 4 of our sites right now are 100% at utilization. Our Nanjing plant, which is the one that supports our Applied Water business, it actually never closed. And that's the reason why AWS actually had mid-single-digit growth in China here in the first quarter.  So we expect there to be a gradual opening in China. We think it's all manageable within our guide. Obviously, there's a risk there. But our people are all safe and sound and they're working their backsides off to make sure we deliver on our commitments.  We did talk about also that there is the global supply chain effect. And we think that's the one that really is kind of the wild card going into the second half of the year, but we feel that we've got that embedded in our guide.
Deane Dray: That's all helpful. And just lastly, with all the comings and goings, I want to wish Colin all the best. We'll miss him. He's a class act, great insights on the water sector. For Matt, well-deserved promotion. I still have his cell phone, just let them know that possibility. And welcome to Andrea as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran: I just want to echo Dean's comments on the comings and goings. So first, on the utility side of the equation, it's kind of a broad question because it's both for the wastewater and the water side. But you look at the tailwinds that are emerging there, really across regions. And it just feels like there's a lot of momentum, particularly with the backlog, the underlying demand where tax receipts are, et cetera. If you take a step back, and obviously, you've got some geopolitical concerns out there, but what do you think could derail that momentum at this point? It seems like it's on a pretty good track.
Patrick Decker: I think the -- it's a great question, Mike. I think from a demand standpoint, we don't see many storm clouds on the horizon here right now, just where we are in the overall investment cycle. I know some may have questions even around what's happening in Europe from a geopolitical standpoint and focus on moving towards oil and gas alternatives, et cetera, will money be derailed or directed there. That's not even the way that the funding mechanisms work in Europe from a water utility standpoint. So we think even that's pretty robust at this point in time. . I think the -- I think in the near term, the challenges remain, in our case, chip supply and just being able to continue to execute what we have in our pipeline. Our bidding pipeline remains very healthy, north of almost $2.5 billion in the bidding pipeline at this point in time. So again, I'm paid to be paranoid. So we're looking at any storm clout there that we could possibly see. But it feels pretty healthy right now.
Michael Halloran: How far out are your backlog stretching at this point? And how do you think about the conversions? Just -- and that's more of a broad comment. And I'm hoping you can compare that to what a typical conversion cycle looks like. We all know that everything is getting stretched into 2023, given the chip shortages. But help give some magnitude for how far out do you have visibility at this point?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. I think great question. And obviously, it varies by segment. When we look at our AWS segment, that's where we typically carry a very small backlog. But as we look over the past 18 months there, orders have really been high, and we've been constrained from a delivery perspective because of supply chain challenges. So in that case there, we have a backlog that gives us really good coverage for the next couple of quarters out.  In water infrastructure, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We have some short-cycle businesses there, and we have some longer cycle businesses there. And so in the shorter cycle, we have coverage as we look out for more coverage than we typically have as we look out for the rest of the year. And M&CS, the story there is we keep getting orders that are outpacing the amount of revenue that we're able to deliver. And I think it's going to take us about 2 years to catch up on the demand that we have today and the balance between supply chain.
Patrick Decker: And Mike, I would just -- I would offer up, I think to your question around visibility from an overall market sentiment standpoint, our bidding pipeline, especially in the treatment and on the wastewater side being treatment and even on the clean water side being metrology, we've got visibility there and a bidding pipeline of at least 2 to 3 years out. And that's why we're speaking with the level of confidence around what the overall market sentiment is.
Michael Halloran: And then a follow-up then it's the capital deployment side, you've been pretty constructive in the last few quarters on what the pipeline looks like? And it seems optimistic on your ability to convert some of that pipeline? Maybe just an update on what you're seeing in the market and how actionable it is.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So we still feel really good, Mike, about the pipeline in terms of opportunities, and they range from larger opportunities of moves into various end markets. But even in the small- to medium-sized opportunities that are there. We've got some things here that we're pretty excited about in the near term that hopefully, we'll be able to execute on. So more to say there over the coming quarter or 2. But in general sense, we -- I feel -- certainly, we feel the M&A pipeline is as healthy as it's ever been. But we're -- we continue to be disciplined on valuation.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. .
Connor Lynagh: Just wanted to follow up on that capital allocation conversation. So given what the share price has done, I'm assuming that you would be less interested in using share currency for deals. But just curious how you view the calculus of that, how you think about share repurchases? How do you -- the competing uses of capital between organic investment, M&A and buybacks and sort of how you pay for M&A?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So again, we come into the year with a really strong balance sheet. Sandy laid out what our firepower is at this point in time, and we are not hesitant to do deals. Obviously, we're going to be disciplined around valuation. I would not preclude equity from being used in the right situation, but it's not our first lever to really lean in on around capital deployment in general.  We also don't see M&A and any repurchase of shares being at odds with each other. In the past, we've used share repurchase authorization that we have out there right now to offset dilution of our long-term incentive grants. But we realize now there are time to be opportunistic given the current environment. And again, we think we're able to be both opportunistic on share repurchase as well as still do strategic M&A. These are not binary decisions, in our case.
Connor Lynagh: Makes sense. And I just wanted to follow up on a separate line of questioning from earlier, which is basically, it seems like your customers at this point have to be pretty aware of what's going on in chip supply chain. I'm curious, have they changed their behavior around awarding new contracts? Is most of the ordering that you're seeing related to existing customer relationships or at the pace of sort of newer deployments, stayed steady, accelerated, decelerated?  And on the other side, are you changing how much you're bidding? Where -- in terms of time line or how aggressive you're being on some of these bigger projects given the time to deliver.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Great question. So let me parse it apart a bit. In terms of kind of existing contracts and deals, we've seen no cancellations there. Our customers are very well aware of the challenges. In many cases, they've got multisource, and so they're seeing the same thing from our competitors along the way. So they realized that we're not alone here.  But -- secondly, it's the fact that so much work has gone into getting the regulatory approval of these large AMI deployments. The returns on investment for them are so substantial in terms of revenue generation that they just want to continue to move forward and execute these things. And so the likelihood of them going back is minimized in that context.  Are they frustrated? Of course, we all are. But we've been weathering this for a while now, and we've been working closely with them to find alternatives to meet their needs, even though it may not be the level of metrology they originally spec, it's good enough right now to move forward, but still with a clear view of what the original approved implementation is going to look like.  In terms of new deals, yes, this is not just with existing customers. We're winning a number of new customers along the way, especially in that medium-sized part of the utility sector, which is really encouraging for us. In terms of changing our own behavior, we are -- we've been very disciplined along the way on being very open and forthright on what delivery frictions are right now so that we are not overpromising and underdelivering to any new deals that we're winning. We're being very clear about that. And I think customers appreciate that transparency as I'm sure our competitors are being transparent as well with them on what their own delivery lead times are.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Patrick, I'd like to follow up on some of the comments there about medium-sized utilities starting to adopt this AMI technology. All of the conferences I've been going to, which, admittedly, are probably larger utilities that are attending those. But it seems like the shift to AMI is going to become ubiquitous here and it's -- the inflection point has been hit, and I don't think there's any doubt that, that's getting adopted. So it's definitely encouraging to hear about medium-sized utilities beginning to get on board with that kind of stuff.  Can you talk about the market opportunity that, that present? Because I know a few years ago, when you bought Sensus, that was really targeting those larger and leading utilities to try and drive that waterfall down into the market. So just any update you can give us on what you're seeing out there, what that market opportunity could be, how long that drives this high level of order growth for you?
Patrick Decker: Sure, Nate. Again, good question. You're right. We have been very focused on the large utilities initially because, in many cases, as you will know from the conferences that you attend. Oftentimes, the medium to smaller utilities are looking to some of the larger ones that will lead in terms of proven technology, et cetera, but not always. I mean they've got their own minds and their own investment plans. . Oftentimes, for those medium utilities, they're looking at entire implementations of AMI as opposed to maybe for a larger metro area, it could be sections of a city. So when they make the decision to go full scale, it takes them a little bit longer to make that decision because it's a bigger strategic choice for them to make. And so it is encouraging to see that level of adoption happening.  They also -- their timing typically is tied more to the retirement of the existing metrology deployment that they have within their cities or communities. And so we see this as being a really healthy, steady stream of conversion over time because while they may study AMI for a while, getting ready for a complete upgrade or overhaul. These things are phased out over time. It's not going to happen all within a few years. It's going to be staged out over a decade or more, at least across the course of the U.S.
Nathan Jones: Which has been good for long-term demand trends. I think is the point that I'm trying to get to out of that, that you should have that steady stream of continued orders in the M&CS business. I just want to ask one on. Go ahead.
Patrick Decker: Nathan, sorry, just really quickly, I mean, just another data point for you. I know you're aware of this and maybe others are not. I mean, again, when you think about the U.S. alone, we're talking about more than 50,000 water utilities, and the largest majority of those are small to medium size. So that's why we're so excited about this part of the market. And still less than half of that market has adopted AMI.
Nathan Jones: Yes. I did want to ask one on price cost. The mass saving this morning shows you about $35 million negative on price cost, and that's responsible for a large portion of the margin compression that you saw year-over-year. Great to see that pricing step up from 200 basis points in the fourth quarter to 420 basis points in this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for continuing to close that gap and to generate more price to cover the inflation that you're seeing in the business?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. Great question. Great question, Nate. This is something that our teams have been very focused on. And since we saw inflation start to rise last year, we've implemented numerous price increases. In some cases, we had to work through existing backlog before the new prices took effect. And so we saw a big step up from Q4 to Q1 in our price realization. And as we look forward throughout the year, we would expect that to continue to ramp in each successive quarter. . As we look at Q1, we -- our price did cover material inflation and freight. But you're right, we were still underwater. We didn't cover sort of our labor inflation, our overhead inflation. As we look out to Q2, we expect that to be neutral. And then in the second half of the year, price should outpace the inflation effects.  And I think it is important to note in our guide, we did increase it for stronger price realization based on what we experienced in Q1 and what our outlook is for the next quarter. And we also did up our inflation outlook.
Nathan Jones: So the point there is that by the second half of the year, those price and inflation numbers that you put on the first page of the slide deck are going -- price is going to cover all of that inflation?
Sandra Rowland: That's our expectation.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Miguel on for Brian Lee. I just had 2 quick ones, follow-up questions from the prior questions. On price/cost real quick. So price/cost was seemed negative in the first quarter. I think that was expected, and then you just mentioned you expect it to improve for the rest of the year. Is the expectation still for the full year that the price cost would be positive?
Sandra Rowland: That's our expectation for the full year. Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate all the additional color on the backlog on M&CS. So the backlog gives you visibility on orders for, I think you said next 2 to 3 years. I know you haven't seen any cancellations yet, but at what point would customers consider canceling orders if the lead times become so stretched out? Or maybe is there a way to think about it, where are customers intentionally placing orders well in advance of projects to get their spot in line? Hopefully, that makes sense.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So we've not seen any -- there's been no double ordering in that regard. I mean, the team is very disciplined around that. And the nice thing about these large metrology implementations is we know exactly what the endpoint count is that they need. And so we work very closely with our customers there to make sure that we're not taking duplicate orders.  We are prioritizing customers. We have someone allocation. Obviously, we're trying to prioritize those that are most stressed at this point in time. You never say never on these things in terms of at some point in time, somebody canceling. But I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the customers understand that there are a few other alternatives and these implementations have gone through such a rigorous long-range regulatory approvals, and they're so critical to their own revenue generation capability that as long as we're able to meet their kind of basic demand as best we can and give them as full transparency as possible, we've been very proud and very pleased in working with them as well as with our chip suppliers. We talk a lot about the customers.  We are working as closely as possible with our suppliers to redesign a number of our chip requirements for next generation. We're redesigning our own products to meet minimum needs here in the immediate term. There's -- it's a multifaceted angle here, and that's why I'm so proud of the effort of the team to navigate this, including our customers' patients.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: I wanted to -- just looking at your organic growth guidance range. So underlying that applied water is really the only one you nudged up. I was surprised, Water Infrastructure, you weren't willing to take that up. And can you -- could you comment on that, first off? And then secondly, shouldn't we start to see some of like the benefits of this water infrastructure stimulus bear fruit later this year? Or what are you guys thinking on that front?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. I think when we looked at adjusting our revenue guide and our forecast, the primary reason that we adjusted it is for a stronger price realization, and we're seeing that in AWS more than any other segment. As we look out for the rest of the year, we're still monitoring chip supply for the other segments. And water infrastructure has a high concentration in China. When we saw the impacts in Q1 from China, they were largely concentrated in water infrastructure, and that's also where we'll see the impact in Q2.
Patrick Decker: And on the infrastructure bill, no real meaningful change there. I mean we do think it's going to be a positive over time. I don't really see that being a big impact here in '22 as things continue to settle out. We see that more as a benefit in '23 and beyond.
Andrew Buscaglia: No. Okay. Okay. And then just to be clear, so you obviously expect some nice price cost tailwinds in the back half of the year. But based on your Q2 guidance, it really does assume a pretty big step-up in margins in the second half. Is there anything else specifically that would provide that tailwind beyond just price cost? Or is it recent cost savings or anything that you expect will drive higher incrementals or something like that?
Sandra Rowland: It's really four things. You touched on the first thing. The first thing is price cost, and that will continue to improve throughout the year. The second thing is chip supply and M&CS as that revenue ramps in the second half, it has very good contribution margins. The third point, I would say is China. We have a very modest we have revenue declines in the first half in China. We're expecting to see a good pop in the back half in China. And then we announced today some leadership changes. We're pursuing some simplification opportunities and some of those will drive cost savings in the back half of the year as well.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes. And presumably, free cash flow, same thing, you're in kind of a hole in Q1, but as that EBITDA goes up, you'll generate more cash and then I assume working capital management probably takes over from there.
Sandra Rowland: Yes. What we saw from a free cash flow perspective in Q1 is very much in line with our historical patterns. We typically use cash in the first quarter. As we work through the rest of the year, one of the things you may note is that our inventory balance is up. That was purposeful. We've taken on some incremental inventory to try to mitigate some of the impacts of the supply chain challenges. And we're going to be thoughtful as we try to work that down in the back half of the year. .
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Patrick, Sandy and once again, congrats, Matt. You'll be great. So I have -- sorry to beat the dead horse here on this, Sandy, but the pricing and the price cost. I think I heard you say during your prepared comments that you had increased your assumption for inflation I'm just wondering whatever other metrics you can give us around pricing would be helpful, whether it's where you're expecting that ramp to go in the second quarter, what your full year pricing will be because the gap is still pretty large right now. So anything you can give us on pricing to give us a little bit more color on what you mean by ramp.
Sandra Rowland: Yes. I think just to give you some context, Scott, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points impacts from our price increases. That doubled to 400 basis points in Q1, and we would expect that to continue to increase. Now since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we've seen some of our commodities increase, our costs, particularly around stainless steel, which is impacted by nickel.  And so as we roll forward inflation assumptions for the next 3 quarters, we see more headwinds in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million. And so in response to that, our teams have gone out and implemented incremental price actions, some that they were not contemplated when we put together our budget. And so our teams are acting quickly. We've changed some of the practices around price increases. We used to have over a 60-day lag time between when we announced a price increase and when it went into effect. And now we're down to less than 2 weeks across our businesses.
Patrick Decker: And I would just offer up, Scott, that again, I think what we've been really pleased with is the resilience of our volume and our share. And in some cases, even gaining share in certain parts of the business. And so we -- the market really has shown a level of resilience in this area. And I think, again, we've been acting as a leader in this area. And pleased and as things continue to move from an inflationary standpoint, we'll continue to act responsibly. .
Sandra Rowland: The other thing I would add, Scott, is the impact on our margins is price/cost has gotten a lot of attention. The secondary impact is mixed. When you look at our revenue mix, with M&CS being down this year, the revenue that we've lost because of the chip supply constraints comes with high margins.
Scott Graham: Get it. I was going to say who would have thought utilities would have given up so much on pricing, but it's a brave new world out there. Okay. My other 2 questions are around, can you -- what is the percentage of the backlog for M&CS that is being held up by the shortages, if you got it, you could ship it kind of thing, what's that percentage?
Sandra Rowland: Yes. So I think if you look at our M&CS backlog, it's around $2 billion. And we have I would say, between 20% and 25% of that backlog is held up by the tip delays. And that's been growing each quarter because our orders have been outpacing our revenue conversion.
Scott Graham: Yes. Got it. And then lastly, Sandy, I know as you entered here, I guess, over a year ago now. I don't know, have you ever calculated it or you and Tony calculated, what is the organic sales rate that you guys need to generate a certain level of operating leverage. Is it 3%, 5%? I mean, how do you look at that?
Sandra Rowland: I'm not sure I totally follow your question, Scott. I think we -- when we model our long-range plan, we understand assumptions around inflation. We also set productivity targets across our organization, both in the manufacturing centers and across the functions. And we have a goal as an enterprise for productivity to outpace inflation. Now the past 18 months have been a little bit different, but that's our overall philosophy.
Patrick Decker: And I think, Scott, the -- I mean, just some other -- trying to parse out your question here. I mean if you think about the incrementals in this business, I mean any dollar of growth that we get in this business is going to drop very healthy incrementals to the bottom line between the 30%, 40% range. In terms of what we've laid out in our long-term guide is in that mid-single-digit range, which, obviously, really drives heavy margin expansion, especially given the mix with M&CS. So maybe that helps frame out a little bit. But I mean, this is a business that generates very healthy incrementals at whatever level of growth there is.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: First, on the M&A front, you -- given that blue chip companies such as ourselves are struggling with semiconductor and other component availability, presumably safe to say some smaller players are struggling even more. Does that create any kind of opportunistic quasi distressed M&A opportunities that perhaps you would not have seen a year ago?
Patrick Decker: It's an interesting angle. It's not really one that we're prioritizing right now. I mean the things that we have in the pipeline, again, we really focus on the strategic logic behind them in terms of for the long run. We kind of look through this cycle in terms of chip demand. I understand where you're coming from with the question. But I wouldn't say that, that's really heightened our view on any particular asset based upon chip distress.
Pavel Molchanov: Understood. Following up on Europe, the weakness in the currency, does that reflect any underlying softness in kind of European GDP and demand patterns that might impact the volume in the second half of the year?
Patrick Decker: Not as we see it. Based upon our experience in Europe over many years, Europe is very resilient when it comes to underlying demand. So it's a much heavier OpEx element there in terms of repair replacement of installed infrastructure. It's less reliant on new CapEx. And even when there is new CapEx, the funding mechanisms tend to be pretty well sheltered, at least, in the larger economies across Europe. I'm not saying there are no economies that are not immune to it, but we've really never seen big swings there on the CapEx side.  In terms of what we do see is the lion's share of our business there is repair and replacement, which is very stable, very steady as well as really attractive margins. And so we feel pretty confident right now around the outlook for Europe as we see it today.
Matthew Latino: Ashley, I think -- do we have any more questions?
Operator: Yes, I apologize. We'll go next to Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: We talked a lot about price, but just curious how you think about -- like is there a level where it just the amount of price that's required to increase, it just starts causing demand destruction because projects start to be -- to not make sense and customers I understand why you're raising, but I'm just not going to buy right now?
Patrick Decker: Joe, it's something that our teams stay close to every day. That's one of the biggest challenges, obviously, in this kind of inflationary environment is where is that limit. And we're always looking at win-loss ratios. We leverage our capabilities in sales force and our bidding pipeline there to get a feel for what that trade-off is. And so the team stays very close to that. And we look at that on a regular basis. And so until we see meaningful moves in that win-loss ratio, that tells us that we need to continue to make sure we cover the inflationary impacts.  What we're encouraged by thus far is that in the areas where we've taken price increases, we continue to see volume growth in those businesses. And so that's a good healthy indicator as well. But it's not something by any means, Joe, that we take for granted, something we're very, very close to.
Joseph Giordano: And last, Patrick, I think raising the low end of the guide as it was such an important kind of tone here for you guys. But just on the other side of that, was there thoughts on trimming the high end and maybe talk through your thoughts around that and what the scenario is that gets you there this year?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. I mean, yes, you can imagine all management teams spend a lot of time thinking about when you make a change in guidance and how you want to approach that. We just felt that it was prudent at this point in time and confident to raise the lower end. Trimming the top end, we still see a path there. And obviously, things have to go in the right direction. But -- and obviously, there are clouds on the horizon that every company is seeing right now, but we see a path there, and we'll continue to monitor that. . In terms of what those are, it's what we've talked about before. We need to continue to see pricing momentum. We need to continue to see improvements in the chip supply and delivery around those areas. And hopefully, we'll see some improvement on the outlook for China. China is not a demand issue for us. It's really a matter of when we're able to ship out our backlog there as well as mitigate what the downstream impacts on the supply chain are.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, thank you all again for your time and attention this morning and for your support, and I look forward to catching up with you between now and the next earnings call. In the meantime, stay safe, stay well, and I wish you all the very best. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 10:00:00) =====

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our release this morning, the team delivered a strong operational performance in the fourth quarter meeting or exceeding our expectations across all major metrics. Despite the challenges that 2021 presented us especially in the second half, I'm very proud of the team for what they did to deliver on our commitments. And as a team they delivered a very strong full year performance. This was reflected by mid single-digit organic revenue growth, solid EBITDA margin expansion of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21%. And orders grew 23% for the year and in the fourth quarter giving us very strong momentum coming into 2022. We posted our strongest orders growth in our M&CS segment. And it reflects the need and desire of our customers for digital solutions to address their growing needs around water affordability and infrastructure resilience. Our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments also posted very strong orders growth for the year and the fourth quarter demonstrating the healthy demand across our portfolio. We continue to experience very strong underlying demand globally with double-digit orders growth across all regions and we expect that momentum to continue throughout 2022 and beyond. And our investments in R&D are clearly paying off enabling us to win market share due to the customer value we're creating. And our investments in geographic coverage have made significant contributions to our overall growth especially in emerging markets where we posted double-digit revenue growth in 2021. Of course, the other side of the story in 2021 was the constrained supply chain challenges of the second half along with inflation that really accelerated in the last quarter. As we anticipated in our last conference call, the severe chip shortage affecting the entire tech sector held back our ability to convert such strong orders into revenue, especially in our M&CS segment. Against that backdrop, the team did an excellent job managing what we can control, bringing discretionary costs down below 2020 levels and taking aggressive pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. In fact, price realization in the fourth quarter was modestly higher than our expectations, and we expect to offset inflation further as we deliver accretive margins in our backlogs. So despite all of the year's headwinds the team not only delivered solid operational results but they did it with heart and purpose. Along the way we made significant progress towards our 2025 signature sustainability goals. One example of that is that the team set a Xylem record for hours volunteered to solve water challenges in our communities around the world. It's a privilege, to be a part of a team with that level of commitment to our mission. Now looking ahead to 2022, we see continued strong demand for our products and solutions, strong fundamentals across our business in terms of productivity and free cash flow conversion, and continued ability to drive price as a market leader to offset inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, our outlook is tempered by the reality of a prolonged chip shortage, limiting the speed at which we can convert orders to revenue. So we are being balanced in our guidance, based upon the visibility we have. Our guidance assumes modest and gradual increases in chip supply in the second half and into 2023. And as volumes return, we expect to realize significant margin expansion consistent with the first half of this past year when we operate in a less chip constrained environment in M&CS. And we see this in the backlog margins we have coming into 2022. In the second half of this year growth in margin expansion both gross margin and EBITDA are expected to return to levels that put us on track to deliver on the 2025 strategic and financial framework that we outlined last September at our Investor Day. In a moment, we'll discuss the assumptions in our 2022 outlook, and speak to our intentions for capital deployment given the strength of our financial and competitive position. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we turn back to 2022.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick indicated, significant chip shortages impacting the utilities end-market in the U.S. more than, offset utilities growth in Europe and strong growth in the Industrial segment globally. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did an outstanding job delivering on our commitments and increasingly tough circumstances with particularly strong performance on price and discipline on costs. In a moment I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 9% a result of supply chain constraints acutely impacting our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 7%, on sustained strength in China and healthy activity in the U.S. Commercial was up modestly at 1% and residential was down 4% on challenging comparisons in the prior year when we grew mid-teens. Organic orders were up 23% in the quarter as demand for our technologies continues to be healthy across all segments. EBITDA margin was 16.2% which was within our guided range. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 260 basis points as productivity savings and strong price realization benefits were more than offset by inflation mix and strategic investments. We continue to invest for example in geographic market coverage to serve increasing demand and enhanced digital capabilities across the portfolio. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.63. And please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were up 30% organically versus last year. That includes a project cancellation last year in India, which we discussed on a previous call. Otherwise, orders were up mid-single digits. This order's pace reflects resilient demand in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. and Europe as well as increasing demand for dewatering particularly in emerging markets. Water Infrastructure revenue was up modestly in the quarter. Healthy growth in Industrial was partly offset by a small decline in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. where order to revenue conversion was challenged by long ocean transit times. Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. Healthy treatment deliveries in both geographies were offset by the delays I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down low single digits, largely due to an especially strong performance in China last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 50 basis points as significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation and strategic investments. Please turn to page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 10% organically in the quarter, driven by healthy demand in all geographies. Revenues increased 3% with high single-digit growth in industrial and a modest increase in commercial, partially offset by sales down mid-single digits in residential. Geographically the US was up high single digits. Growth in all end-markets was led by ongoing industrial recovery. Emerging markets was up mid-single digits on continuing industrial strength in China and momentum in Eastern Europe. Western Europe delivered low single-digits growth with moderate gains balanced across all end-markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 340 basis points in the quarter. Material and freight inflation more than offset solid productivity gains and accelerating price realization. And now let's turn to slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 28% organically in the quarter, reflecting strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand across all other applications in this segment including test and pipeline assessment services. This puts our M&CS backlog up 63% versus the prior year. As we anticipated, revenue declined 17% due to constrained chip supply. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both resilient and margin accretive. There have been no cancellations of AMI contracts and we expect large project deployments will resume in the back half of the year as component supply becomes available. Geographically, US revenues were down 21%. Western Europe and emerging markets declined more modestly at 10% and 2%, respectively from pockets of growth in our water quality test business. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 750 basis points. Volume was the biggest factor as this business gets very strong operating leverage from higher revenues, which were constrained by the lower conversion of orders. Those volume effects along with higher inflation were partially offset by productivity gains and cost discipline. And now let's turn to slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with $1.3 billion in cash and available liquidity of more than $2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.2 times. After delivering free cash flow conversion of 181% last year, our free cash flow conversion was 77% in 2021, slightly below our target for the year. While our team made continued progress driving collections, we consciously increased our inventory safety stocks in the second half of the year to mitigate supply chain volatility but we remain committed to at least 100% conversion over the cycle. A further item of note. As we previously advised, we are derisking our balance sheet with the buyout of our largest defined pension plan in the UK. We expect to finalize this transfer in 2022, at which point we'll recognize a non-cash charge of approximately $170 million, primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses, which are reflected in equity today. Lastly, in line with our capital allocation framework. Today we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 7% and that is our 11th consecutive annual increase. Please turn to slide 9 and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2022.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Sandy. We see strong demand continuing through 2022 and strong fundamentals in all our businesses. On the other hand, the reality is that supply constraints will continue to be an important and not entirely predictable variable. So we are reflecting a responsible set of assumptions in our guidance, while working aggressively to improve the situation. We anticipate chip availability will improve for the year, but not linearly and not all at once. In the first half, shortages are still likely to hold back conversion of orders to revenue with disproportionate impact on our higher-margin solutions. So we'll be focused on operating with discipline, driving price productivity and cost during what we foresee being a transitory period. In the second half of the year, supply should begin to improve modestly and the pace of chip shipments will have a determining effect on our growth rate and margin expansion. As components begin to come through, the margin upside is highly accretive to our margin profile. The positive side of this dynamic was apparent in the first half of 2021 when chip supply did not limit M&CS growth and we saw margin expansion of more than 500 basis points in the portfolio. Given the size and growth of our metrology backlogs, it's worth expanding on a point Sandy made a moment ago about the resilience of those backlogs. Large AMI projects are not easily substituted and they offer a compelling business case for our customers, particularly as they are addressing issues of affordability and regulatory commitments. Our utility customers often spend years in pilot testing, approval and procurement to determine these solutions. So despite these near-term delays, we do not anticipate backlog erosion. Turning to slide 10. You can see our focus areas for 2022, which will keep us aligned to our long-term financial framework. The team is managing through the current challenges with great discipline, working with both suppliers and customers. Even though we expect chip supply will gradually improve in the second half we don't anticipate suppliers will be able to serve 100% of our requirements given the sheer size of our order books. So we're working with our most critical supply partner to accelerate redesign options and we're staying close to our customers to prioritize serving their most mission-critical needs. Since visibility about the likely rate of improvement is imperfect, we're also phasing our ongoing strategic investments with an eye on leading indicators of supply recovery. Now, before I turn to Sandy for more detail on our outlook, I want to comment briefly on capital deployment. We're coming into the year with a strong balance sheet and more than $2 billion in liquidity. So, M&A naturally comes to mind as a strategic accelerator for sustained growth and margin expansion. And those of you who've been with us a while, you know that we're not hesitant to do a deal when there's a good deal to be done in service of advancing the company's overall strategy. And our view is that there are opportunities for strategic value creation in the marketplace for a company like us with our financial strength and sector leadership. But we will continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. Now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more on our outlook.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. We expect underlying demand will continue to be healthy through 2022. However, as Patrick just described, business conditions aren't likely to normalize on an entirely predictable path. So we've taken a view of the year that reflects those dynamics, balancing external constraints and potential upsides. We anticipate our utility business overall which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow low-single-digits in 2022. On the wastewater side, we expect low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of resilient global demand. We anticipate strong demand in emerging markets, driven by considerable investment in public utilities, increasing OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity is very solid globally. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues will be flat. Demand remains robust but deliveries will be constrained by chip shortages mentioned earlier. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. And now, please turn to slide 12. Looking at the Industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from increasing mining demand and benefiting from our localization strategies. In the US and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity ramps in light industrial applications. The Commercial end market should deliver mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement business in the US as well as acceleration of institutional construction. In Europe, we see increased construction activity, driven by the rise in funding for green buildings, driving demand for our new eco-friendly product offerings in that space. In residential, our smallest end-market, we are expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth with healthy demand. And now, let's turn to Slide 13, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2022 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% with flat revenues in the first half and high single-digit growth in the second half. This breaks down by segment as follows: Mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both Wastewater Utilities and Industrial. Mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water from solid mid-single-digit growth in Industrial and Commercial applications and low to mid-single-digit growth in residential. We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. As Patrick mentioned earlier, this assumes down double-digits in this half of the year and up double-digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be partially constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the second half progresses. Despite that partial recoverability and the availability of chips, volumes and margins will remain supply constrained. The constraint will have an unfavorable impact on volume and mix more than offsetting the benefits of price realization and productivity savings through the year. For 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In the first half of the year, we anticipate EBITDA will be approximately 14% to 15%, bouncing back to 18% to 19% in the second half. And this puts EBITDA in the second half in line with the long-term targets we laid out at Investor Day. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.70. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 100% of net income. We have provided you with other full year assumptions on this slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.13 and as foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down in the first quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be in the range of flat to up 2%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS is expected to decline low double-digits. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% impacted by higher inflation and supply chain challenges. We expect this will be the low point in adjusted EBITDA in the year with accelerating sequential quarterly improvement. And with that please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. 
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2022 in a strong and enviable position. The market demand for our solutions and technologies has never been greater. We have strong commercial momentum with very strong orders growth and high-margin backlogs that prove our conviction about the investments we've been making and our customers need and appetite and the foundation and flexibility of a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic options in a dynamic marketplace. In the short term of course, no one likes being constrained by externalities. But we have strong resolve and operating discipline and fully expect to deliver a year of results on track with our 2025 strategic and financial goals and that are aligned to our overall investment thesis, that of being a technology leader with a durable business model, bringing differentiated offerings to a market of rising demand for sustainable water solutions, committed to driving above-market growth and margin expansion as our portfolio continues to digitize and to accelerating value creation with disciplined active capital allocation. So now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hey. Good morning, Dean. How are you doing?
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: Really well. Thanks. Look, since it's the biggest swing factor in your guidance the chip shortage and it didn't sound like you have Tony on the line this quarter, but I had some questions that -- if we can go into a little more detail on the shortage situation. And again, this gets a bit more technical. But can you give us color between your shortages on the microprocessor side which typically you can get substitutes and alternative sources versus microcontrollers, which are so much more tied to firmware and it's really hard to substitute and redesign. So the extent to which that could be helpful is there a distinction there in terms of shortages and both and when you expect to get recovery in those two-class of chips?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Certainly, Deane. Great question. So you've nailed it. If we look at our supply chain challenges right now, 80% of the issue roughly is microcontrollers. And I'll come back in a moment to what we're doing there to try to mitigate that as best we can. And we can also talk about what we're doing to make sure that we hold on to the backlog that we've got right now which has really attractive margins in it. But the 20% that is more on the microprocessing side, we face those challenges in Q4 and the team did a terrific job on substitution, really going out into the open market and broad distribution and really helped us mitigate that. Otherwise we would have really had a bigger hit in Q4 than what we mitigated, now really is about the microcontroller. So, what we're doing there, we are partnering with our suppliers on redesign. And there what we're doing is we're redesigning along with where they see future designs going across the broader technology sector. But those really -- those impacts really aren't going to hit us until -- or benefit us until probably Q4 going into '23 because it is a lead time. We are doing alternate sourcing and that's certainly helping us buffer some of the demand here. And we're also resurrecting some of our legacy meters as a bridge in some of these larger AMI implementations to go ahead and get these projects started. Lastly, I would say on the large AMI deals, what we work with our customers on is they've really been encouraged by us going out and beginning to build out the comm side the communication side. So we get the products going. And we've also opened up them to have the opportunity to go out and use alternate meters. And honestly, Deane, they've come back to us because, they realize, they believe in the value proposition, they see what we're doing here and they want to be with us. So, we're working it every day. We feel good about where we are in terms of protecting backlog and the team is all over this in terms of what we can do to mitigate the chip supply situation.
Deane Dray: All right. I'm glad I asked to that level of detail because, a couple often times you just say chip shortage and move on. But...
Patrick Decker: Deane, on that point also, Deane, just to give you a feel for kind of how things are going with our suppliers right now. We had a number of de-commits from our large suppliers in Q4. Those de-commits have ceased. We haven't had a de-commit for quite some time now. They've actually been delivering on forecast. And the lead times, while they are still very lengthy, I mean we had lead times up to 78 weeks on some of our key components here. Those have moved down modestly, but the good news is they're moving in the right direction.
Deane Dray: Got it. And I appreciate the color on the not losing share or having cancellations within the meter backlog. So that's real helpful. And just the follow-up question, this has come up a couple of different times and ways in this call is, you've booked the 23% organic order growth, which is really healthy and gives you that longer-term look. And you've said that the implied margin are healthy or accretive. I just wonder, what base margin are you comparing that to? And just the extent to which we're all looking at what the 2025 target is? And so, how would the -- where is your booking now compare on profitability either this year or for next year? Thanks.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Great question, Deane. The momentum that we have on the orders front is really, really strong and it's broad-based across our portfolio. So when I'll start with more of our book and ship businesses in AWS and water infrastructure, there we know that we've taken price actions throughout 2021. And actually we've taken some incremental price actions already in 2022. And so we know that those orders that we recently secured are going to be more competitive and balanced against the inflation headwinds that we're facing. When we think about the longer-term large AMI contracts, most of those contracts have inflation adjusters, which are tied to CPI. And so that -- while those -- all of those won't be delivered in 2022, it's going to take us some time once we get back to good flow on the chip side to clear out that backlog, but those price resets will help protect the margin. And when we think about those large AMI deals where we're looking at gross margins above 40%.
Patrick Decker: Yes, incremental margins. 
Deane Dray: Real helpful. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hey, Nate. How are you doing?
Sandy Rowland: Good morning Nate.
Nathan Jones: Very well, thanks. Very well, thanks. I want to start off just talking a little bit about price versus inflation. I think the disclosure for this quarter registration at 560 basis points in price at 200 basis points. I'm a little surprised you aren't able to capture more price and close that gap a little bit to inflation, given demand is very strong given customers across industry have been conditioned to expect price increases at the moment. Are there opportunities for you to be not just a little bit more aggressive on price, but significantly more aggressive on price to close that gap? 
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think really good question Nate. The inflation rate certainly picked up on us in Q4. So when we look at sort of exit -- when we look at overall inflation for 2021, it was in the 8% range. And when we exited Q4, it bumped up to about 12%. So that was a meaningful increase and it actually outpaced what we had incorporated into our guide. On the flip side, we did get some more price in the fourth quarter than we had modeled and so they kind of netted, which is why we came in with EBITDA margins in line with our forecast.
Patrick Decker: And so Nate what I would offer up here is as we -- it really is a story of momentum. So to Sandy's point we were very aggressive on price in Q4 and continue to be. And our price/cost is going to be positive as we go into Q2. We weren't able to go in and reprice all of our backlog. We repriced some of it, but we're going to be price cost positive in Q2. That really ramps in the back half of 2022. And for the full year we are going to be price/cost positive for the full year.
Nathan Jones: That's very encouraging. 
Patrick Decker: The teams have done a great job on the pricing front.
Nathan Jones: Thanks. Cancellations you talked about, no cancellations on the AMI side of the metering business. Have you seen cancellations on more of the replacement side or losing some share on the replacement side? I understand the differences between your business and some competitive businesses. Maybe you could explain those differences a little bit. Their results -- Badger had 20-odd percent meter growth. Neptune had double-digit meter growth. Can you talk a little bit more about what the differences between those businesses are more attacking your side of it, I think, contributes to it. Just the differences there that are resulting in that differentiated procurement. 
Patrick Decker: Sure. So Nate, yes, so perhaps what I can do is just spend a moment on explaining kind of the metering market. So you've got two different types of meters. You've got static, which is really kind of where the market is going that's where the market overall is going. Our competitors are also moving that direction and then you have the mechanical kind of traditional meters, which we certainly have those, but it's a much smaller portion of our portfolio. The benefits of static versus mechanical from our view and certainly customers view is static meters are more accurate over the life of the meter. You have less moving parts in a static meter, you're able to build in other kind of bells and whistles like advanced alarms around link detection. And obviously, with the data that it's able to gather helps around non-revenue water. So there's a lot of kind of economic and environmental value and that's why the industry is moving towards static. We are further along in that move. And so as a result of that, we are more exposed to chips because the microcontroller really is the brain, of that static meter. And so to your question around, kind of the day-to-day replacement business, to be honest we have seen some customers that have gone back to traditional to say "Hey it's good enough right now." But that's only transitory. And even we are resurrecting, our old mechanical meters to help bridge that time that we're there. Most importantly, on these larger signature wins, again these large AMI deals, which are really the indicator of where the market is going. We've not lost those. And if anything we've seen -- we're still winning deals in that environment because the value proposition is so strong and so robust. And again, what we're focusing on right now is, making sure we get the communications platform in place to really secure those and move those forward. 
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I’ll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Nathan.
Matt Latino: Thank you, Nathan.
Operator: Next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Bryan Blair: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Bryan
Sandy Rowland: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: I was hoping you could offer a little more color on dewatering trends. You highlighted the strength in international markets specifically emerging markets. I'm curious about the relative growth of equipment sales versus rental. The stronger drop-through on the latter? And what's contemplated in your guidance for that business, specifically? 
Sandy Rowland: So good question. I think we have seen increasing momentum in dewatering, as we move throughout the year. And in fourth quarter overall, we saw high single-digit growth. We actually saw growth in all of our markets but especially strong momentum coming in emerging markets because of strong mining demand. Really, it was on both fronts the rental front and the equipment sales front both showed positive signs. We've taken some steps this year to invest a little bit more on the CapEx side to refresh our fleet. And we expect to see some positive benefits from that as we go into 2022. 
Patrick Decker: Yes. Bryan one of the things -- on that last point, one of the things that we had done when we were in the down cycle in that business, we were curtailing some of our CapEx to protect margins and just see kind of stabilize that business. Now we really see there being opportunity that is, we invest even just a little bit more in the fleet and from a CapEx perspective That traditionally has yielded very positive returns, both from a growth and a margins perspective. And we don't have all that built into our guide but we do see a strong recovery there. 
Bryan Blair: I appreciate the color. And as a follow-up focusing specifically on the US market. Just curious how your team is thinking about the potential catalyst from infrastructure spending. There are other areas of your business that I guess somewhat naturally get more attention on that front. But I would imagine the tailwinds for general construction activity, commodity demand would read through pretty nicely perhaps more of a 2023, 2024 catalyst but any color on that front would be helpful. 
Patrick Decker: Yes, certainly. You're right we don't have any of that built into our guide for 2022. It really is -- and we didn't really even have anything built in meaningfully into our outline of kind of long-range, objectives in our Investor Day because we always talked about that being a possible support mechanism. So it is at 2023 and beyond. But yes, just some specifics on this. I know others have commented both positive and maybe not so positive on when it's going to happen.  Our view is we're talking about $66 billion of investment in a critical Water Infrastructure. 80% of that is going to be administered by the EPA, who we have very strong relationships with at the highest levels. Nearly half of the 193 programs that are funded in this bill, contain commercial opportunities for Xylem. It is more than a one or two-year thing. It really spans over several years. So, there clearly are commercial opportunities there. But again, they're not in our outlook but we are net positive on the trends that we're seeing right now, and the conversations we're having with customers. 
Bryan Blair: Understood. I appreciate the detail there. I was -- perhaps remiss. I was referring specifically to the dewatering outlook, but I understand there are broad-based prospective tailwinds?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. No. I think – I think the areas that it would be most impactful for us would really be in predominantly three specific areas. It would be certainly dewatering on the construction side, you would see it in our water infrastructure business on the treatment side most notably. We'd also see it on the clean water side, as we're talking about the – addressing non-revenue water through some of our solutions there. And then there would be an ancillary benefit even on our commercial building and industrial side in Applied Water, where you've got a knock-on effect of some of this infrastructure demand. But it's really going to be predominantly in dewatering treatment and the clean water side?
Bryan Blair: Helpful color. Thanks, again.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Ryan Connors: I wanted to just look at the M&CS from a bigger picture standpoint. And I think, it's fully recognized that supply chain has been a big challenge. But really, if you look back the M&CS profitability issues really predated the pandemic and the supply chain issues. I mean, if you look back at some of the press release and commentary from 2018 and 2019. I mean, that business has been sort of a drag on profitability for a long time. So is – I'm wondering, what your perspective is on that? And is part of the takeaway that it's not a great business in normal times and it's – we see it's a really bad business when things get tough, or I mean what's the longer picture looking back at the pre-COVID challenges in M&CS?
Patrick Decker: Sure, Ryan. Fair question. I look at the proof points of this business and that is I look at the backlog, so I look at the investments we made I look at the deals that, we've won, I look at the margin profile of those deals in the backlog. I look at the margin profile of even our repair replacement business, and it is very attractive. I look back at the first half of 2021, where we demonstrated even mid-single-digit growth. And we showed 500 basis points of margin expansion from an EBITDA standpoint during that time frame. Have we been – have we had our licks and our knocks over the last few years, absolutely, whether it be a battery supplier having a fire, whether it be trade conflicts. Now, we have the impacts of chip shortages. Yes, that is the nature unfortunately of us being in a technology leaning business, but the proof points are there. The investments that we've made are paying off in terms of demand, margin profile, and we love this business. And we – again, we're guiding responsibly this year. We want to give you a balanced view. And even within that balance view look at the margin profile of what we're committing to in the second half of the year, and that is right in track and right on line with what we laid out in Investor Day back in September.
Ryan Connors: Now, one of the things that a relevant peer company had an issue with the tech business where it was repeatedly the source of trouble and discussion disproportionate to its size and decided, you know, what we're going to just fold that into the other businesses to keep it from attracting so much attention to itself. Would you – would there – and I know M&CS was a relatively new segment. Sensus, I guess, was within water infrastructure for a while, and then it was broken out. Would there be any sense to making a similar move to kind of changing the reporting structure so that M&CS doesn't repeatedly sort of dominate the discussion as it has?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. Just for a matter of correction. So, actually, Sensus was not part of water infrastructure. So I just want to clarify that. It's always been a stand-alone piece. And no we don't have any plans or any reporting changes or integration. I mean, I want to be clear to all listening. It's – not everything we're doing from a digital standpoint is happening within M&CS. M&CS is a proxy for the clean water side of the utility market. Water Infrastructure is a proxy for the wastewater side of utility market, and Applied Water is a proxy for those customers in the world that consume water. Digital runs through all three of them. It just right now is more prominent within M&CS. And as a result of that, that's why we're getting hit on the chip side. I mean, 30% to 40% of our M&CS revenue is exposed to chip shortages right now. And two-thirds of our backlog is dependent on chips. But that is a result quite frankly of the demand that we've created in the marketplace because of the innovation that we're driving. So no, there's no plans to rethink or change our reporting structure.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Thanks for your time.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. This is Miguel on for Brian. Thanks for taking the time.
Patrick Decker: Hey, Miguel.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Miguel.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Just wanted to touch back on the M&CS cadence that you laid out for 2022, low-double-digits in the first half and then high-double-digits in the second half. And then you also noted that organic growth is going to be flattish for this year, but the backlog is going to be rolling through and that backlog has grown. So when we think about the cadence for the year, how much of that first half second half cadence is that backlog getting converted? And then, how much of that might be any additional price actions that might be also contributing to that cadence? Thanks. And I have a follow-on.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So just to give you some perspective on how we're thinking about M&CS and how it shifts through the year. We exited Q4 of 2021 with about $300 million of revenue in the segment. And so that would put us on a $1.2 billion run rate for the year. Getting back to flat assumes that throughout the year we kind of add about $20 million of incremental revenue each quarter. And it puts us back at the end of 2022, very much like what we saw in the first half of 2021 from a size perspective. And while we're starting to eat into some of the backlog, we're by no means clearing all of that in 2022. That's going to take 18 to 24 months to get that worked through. And so we would expect very strong growth coming out of this segment in 2023 and 2024.
Patrick Decker: So we've again built what we believe to be a balanced and responsible guide here. By means is there a huge hockey stick built into this guide. And certainly, what we see in terms of backlog conversion, I mean that is the upside variable for us as we look out over time here. And again, the margins that are built into that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And my last question, I can pass it on is, so last quarter you called out some order push-outs in the fourth quarter into 2022. And then just thinking through the guidance for this year is 3% to 5% organic and then, long-term annual organic growth is 46%. You mentioned you didn't lose orders. But how do we think about I guess, a bridge on those orders coming out of 2021 and into 2022, the guidance 3% to 5% organic in 2022 and that compares to the long-term guidance of 4% to 6%. Just trying to think through those orders. But then, you also mentioned the 18 to 24 months, I guess it will take to flow through all that backlog. So, just looking for a little bit more color there. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So, we've got -- we came into the year talking about -- I think in the last call we talked about there being about $100 million of orders that had moved to the right based on supply issues. That number right now would probably be about $120 million, that's moved to the right. And so to Sandy's point, we're really not eating tremendously into backlog in this guide. That happens even more in 2023. So, when you look at our orders growth for the full year of 2021 and even Q4, a big chunk of that is deals and the M&CS backlog that don't convert until 2023. And so, that really is the big swing factor here in our guidance is how quickly can we convert that volume based upon supply. So we exit this year, second half more in line with that up mid to high-single-digits year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue in line with what we talked about at Investor Day.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks. It’s very helpful. I’ll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: Just focusing on capital deployment for a minute. Your balance sheet is obviously in really good shape here and we know you've been a little more quiet on the M&A side lately. So, do you think 2022 is more of an active year for you which could include M&A or maybe the potential for a bigger repurchase given what the stock is doing?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Thanks for the question. As you said I mean we are coming into the year with a really strong balance sheet again over $2 billion in liquidity. As always it takes two to tango here. And I think we've shown before that we're not hesitant to get a deal done when there's a really good deal to be done. I do think that the -- there's an attractive market right now. There are assets out there both of scale and even kind of small to medium size that we have been studying and I think this will be an active year. And certainly what's going on in the markets right now by no means deters us from that commitment. They will always tie back to our overall strategy, but it's a rich market and we're looking forward to 2022.
Andy Kaplowitz: And then Patrick what are infrastructures hung in there in terms of margin performance a fair amount better than the other two segments. We obviously know about the chips impacting M&CS. But is there anything different in terms of that segment's performance that you might be able to apply to other segments to improve their performance as you wait for the chip shortage to run its course and your backlog to burn.
Patrick Decker: Sure. I would say both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water are they are more mature businesses. They are we're market leaders in that space as we are in M&CS but they're in different end-markets than our M&CS segment is in terms of a conversion to digital and kind of being a large deal kind of dependent. So, they've done a great job. Those teams have done a great job of operational discipline around productivity price realization. They continue to do that. We continue to invest -- and those businesses our vitality indices in both those businesses continue to be quite impressive in terms of how we're driving innovation in that space. So, very pleased with it. I think the water infrastructure business serves the wastewater side of the market for the most part. That does tend to be a more stable environment where the big chunk of that is OpEx versus CapEx from a utility perspective. And on the Applied Water side, they're serving the users of water which again tend to be more stable in terms of end-market demand. And the reason we've outperformed the market there is really the aggressive stance we've taken on new products and entering some new markets on the emerging market side. So, there's nothing I would say we translate from those two over to M&CS. Each one of them is in a different part of the cycle and serving different part of the market. 
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning John.
Patrick Decker: Maybe just two quick ones for me. Following up to Deane's question, we've been starting to hear some companies talk about this metric of kind of how much of semi chips or components they've already secured to give them visibility into their outlook. So, you made the comments you've had no de-commits. But I'm just curious on your commitments from your suppliers do you have the majority of what you need committed at least to deliver on your guide, or do you need to get more commitments from your suppliers to deliver on the guide?
Patrick Decker: Yes. No great question John. So, our guide really reflects a modest recovery in the chip supply. So, to put some numbers at least directionally around that obviously it depends upon the product line and specifically the component. But overall coming into the year, we only were getting about half of what our demand was on the critical components in terms -- if you think about what we could ship in terms of backlog versus what we were able to we're talking 50% supply there. Our guide has reflected in that a gradual recovery that really does not start even until the second half of the year and we get roughly back to about 75% of our demand that's there. And then that improves continually into 2023 and beyond. So, we think we've been responsible here in balance in our guide. It does not assume a miraculous recovery. And clearly that is the big swing factor. If that were to improve considerably than so would our outlook. But right now that's what we see. And that's why we're guiding the way we are.
John Walsh: Great. Thank you for that color. And then, maybe just one on expectations of where backlog and orders could go for the year, you obviously talked about a lot of demand. Would you expect that backlog kind of burns through the year as you convert into sales, or could we expect to see backlog kind of continue to grow?
Sandy Rowland: Yeah. You know John, I think we talked a lot about this, that we're not going to be able to eat into a tremendous amount of our backlog, particularly in the M&CS segment because of the supply chain shortages. So when I look at Xylem overall, we would expect backlog to continue to grow in 2022. There are a couple of segments where we have especially large backlogs that are really book and ship business. And if we get customers back into more normal ordering patterns you may see a modest reduction there. But overall, we expect next year that we'll be talking about strong backlogs as well. The pipeline the bidding pipeline and funnel still looks really robust.
John Walsh: Great, I appreciate you taking my questions. I'll pass it along.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys. I was hoping you can talk a…
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Matt Latino: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia: I was hoping you can talk a little bit about -- you're not seeing, cancellations which is great in your backlog building. If we are to see some of these projects move forward, I guess, where do you feel more optimistic regionally that this is going to occur. And I think I say that because I think earlier this week the Finance Minister of India is calling out $530 billion in public infrastructure spending in one year I think. So I'm just wondering if we're going to see upside if these delays move forward, where will it be coming from do you think?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, certainly, I would say, the two areas that we would see more meaningful progression. And we feel very good about our emerging markets business. We continue to expect that to be growing in the high-single digits. It's been a great performing part of our portfolio for a number of years now. And if anything that business has become more balanced, I would say before we were very largely dependent on China. China is still a great business for us. And we expect great results there. But it's good to see the rest of our portfolio there move forward. It's also more mature in terms of OpEx spend versus CapEx. So that's one area where we think -- we feel good about it and there could be opportunities to accelerate that. It really -- the biggest swing factor would be within M&CS. And it's mostly water utilities in North America. And I would say there, it really is the large utilities where we've won these large AMI deals where it is less likely that they would ever switch out to someone else. And as I said earlier, we're already doing the comms work to secure that volume going forward. And so if there were any kind of releasing of orders in terms of being able to convert them it would be in that space. Those are the two big swing factors for us.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay, interesting. And maybe one last one on -- with your capital allocation and M&A, you had some commentary there. I'm wondering, now that the supply chain challenges seem to be more prolonged. Is that kind of -- maybe you hesitate in terms of moving forward with anything until you get a better handle on rightsizing the ship here? Or is it the other case where do you think the -- do you think some of your targets might feel we're comfortable being part of a bigger entity like yours where the supply chain challenges may work in your favor I wonder.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. So it's a great question we're experiencing right now in terms of the chip supply issue does not change our view on M&A. Our resolve there is strong. We see attractive opportunities working through these supply chain challenges. We have the team in place that's all over this. And they would not be distracted by anything we might do on the M&A side. At the same time, I think you're pointing to the fact that, certainly in these types of situations companies at size and scale certainly have an advantage and we certainly look to leverage that strength. When the time is right and the opportunity is right and again it takes two to tango.
Andrew Buscaglia: Right. Thanks very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. 
Joe Giordano: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. 
Patrick Decker: Hi, Joe. Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hey. So Patrick you've referenced a couple of times on M&CS like first half of 2021 is like a barometer of where we might exit. If I look back though like even first half 2021 it's still pretty far away from a margin standpoint from like what we saw in 2017-2018 on EBITDA. Like what kind of conditions need to be in place to really get that business to like a 20% level? Is that like a realistic couple of years outlook? 
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, it's a great question Joe. So if you think back over time after we acquired the Sensus business and we built the M&CS segment the portfolio, we also made a fairly significant investment in digital whether it be in the metrology business and some new product introductions designing for large deals that we were looking to win. And also we were – pardon me, making investments in some of the new digital acquisitions that we made. So again that's paying off now when you look at the growth in orders and backlog the margin visibility we have in that. So that is a period of time that we were going through. And when we've looked at this segment when we get to a run rate of roughly $400 million in revenue which we have visibility to in our backlog you're looking at EBITDA margins that are 20% plus. So I realize that people have been patient, people have been wondering kind of what that curve is. And again it really is about demand that we see in backlog and the margin profile that we see. But that time line that you're talking about Joe was a period of investment. 
Joe Giordano: Yes. Not fair. I also noticed that the inflation at AWS was like significantly higher than the other two segments. That was just like a weird kind of way it flowed in on a quarterly cadence but anything that we need to note there? 
Sandy Rowland: No that's a great observation, Joe. I think that's a trend we've been seeing all year that the inflation has impacted our AWS business the most. We did see that tick up in Q4. I would say that's part of the business that we're also seeing the greatest price realization. And we're a little bit out of balance in Q1. And as we move into Q2 and the back half of the year, we're going to be in a much stronger position there in light of the actions that we're taking to drive more price realization. 
Patrick Decker: And I would say Joe the other piece of this is Applied Water is the business that is also more U.S.-centric in terms of impact there. We clearly have seen higher inflation from a geographic standpoint in the US. We've seen that also in M&CS, but the reason you don't hear us talking as much about it is because again we have these price clauses in our large deals in the backlog. So it's a different kind of cycle that we're facing in those two businesses. 
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Graham Price with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Graham Price: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. 
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Graham Price: I guess on the infrastructure spending side you talked about the US and emerging markets and you specifically called out strong funding activity in Europe. So I was wondering what you're seeing there both with respect to spending and then time frames as well. Is that a 2022 story or more of a 2023?
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think, in the aggregate, discussions around infrastructure spending by geography. I would say certainly in US and Europe that is more of a '23 story. We don't have that really reflected in our guide. I think that when you look at it in the various countries that we label as emerging markets, China is in its first year of its latest five-year plan. So, there will be softness there in the early part of this year based upon our historical experience. And then it will quickly begin to ramp. So we still feel very good about China. India, other parts of Eastern Europe as an example, we see those being opportunities and benefits that we will see in '22, because those programs are already active. But I think for US and Europe which is the largest chunk of this, it really is more of a '23 story. Otherwise Europe is in a very healthy state right now from a demand standpoint. And we don't really see any shocks or big inflection points there. It's pretty predictable for us right now as it relates to Europe.
Graham Price: Got it. Thank you. That's certainly helpful. And then just curious, I guess for 4Q, did you see any site access issues due to Omicron and COVID? And then, is that an issue that you're tracking going forward?
Patrick Decker: We did. It definitely is one we're tracking going forward. We didn't have any meaningful site access impacts from Omicron. But we certainly have supply chain challenges in terms of logistics and port delays and we navigated through that. We didn't really highlight it a lot in our coverage on Q4 because the teams really just did a great job of working through that. So we did get impacted by that on the supply chain. We have some of that carryover in Q1 and we have that reflected in our guide for Q1. But certainly, as we look forward, we don't see that as being a lingering issue for the balance of the year at least based upon this current strain.
Graham Price: Got it. Understood. Thank you, very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Great. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for your time and attention this morning. And again, I appreciate the support and the great questions. We'll be back in touch with you on our next earnings call, if not between now and then. So, have a good day and stay safe.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Xylem Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem, so we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year. Sandy, over to you.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits while the US declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad based across all segments and regions. In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19 impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the US and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad based across all regions. Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The US was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. Geographically, the US and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. And now please turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. By geography, Western Europe was up 1% while Emerging Markets was flat. The US was down mid single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. And now please turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team has clearly done a great job delivering a solid quarter's earnings in difficult circumstances. I want to give a special shout-out to our sales, service and supply chain teams. They've been pulling out all the stops to care for our customers despite the unusual challenges. Let's turn to the quarter now and look forward. Since the supply chain environment has everybody's attention, we want to provide more detail on what we're seeing and the actions we've been taking. So I've asked Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to walk us through that. Tony, over to you.
Tony Milando: Thank you, Patrick. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carry reliability is at an all-time low. We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the US. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short term mitigations and longer term actions. In short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly two months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and thus improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life, and we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well established localization strategies there. So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Tony. So now turning from supply to demand. It's essentially the opposite story. Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be at risk and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach User Conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. On longer term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and to science based targets. Over the next two weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net zero commitments with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just one reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. Turning back to the near term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid to high single digits to flat. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the US but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentary, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial de-watering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs, and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid single digit outlook in the commercial end market. The US business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp, and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid single digit growth. We expect high single digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid single digits rather than up mid single digits. We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50 which, at the midpoint, reflects 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our three year average right around 130%. We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter. This includes flattish growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS down high teens. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Just in the last couple of days, we've been recognizing Xylem's 10-year anniversary. The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 10 years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. The immediate challenge around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions, and we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization. All of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day. So I'm confident that our current market momentum will carry us strongly into 2022 and beyond and keep us on pace to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial milestones. Now let's turn the call over to you, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Operator, please lead us into Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: It's a busy day here, but the comments on chip shortage are not unique just to you guys. But can you help us understand, particularly with Tony on the line here, I mean, how does this work? Do you know when you're getting chips in? Do you have visibility around deliveries? Do we get a bunch of them in January and then you're able to make deliveries in 1Q of next year? I mean, just help us understand a little bit about how you think about when you get chips and when you can actually -- and visibility around that?
Tony Milando: I mean, we deal with our contract manufacturers and our electronic suppliers. We give them forecasts and it's very similar to the way we deal with all of our materials. We provide forecast in advance. We're committing forecasts out over a 12 to 24 month horizon depending on the component. So it's not very different than anything else we do in terms of how we get supply in, no more complicated than that.
Patrick Decker: I think, Scott, to your question also, how quickly will this snap back? And Tony, maybe you can comment on that because we don't see this being, all of a sudden to your question, Scott, in the month of January, a bunch of chips show up and the problem is resolved. It's going to be a bit of duration here as we work through the constraints. But Tony, do you want to comment on that?
Tony Milando: So there's a number of industries that are all clamoring, as you guys know, from the constraints, whether it's industrial or automotive or the personal electronics industry. So we're all looking for the same things. And so we are working very closely with our contract manufacturers and directly with our technology manufacturers, the IDMs, to make sure that they understand our demand and what they're committed to and we're looking to get those in over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. And so we anticipate it to get better. We don't know when that's going to get better but it will certainly -- we certainly do expect to get better as we move into next year.
Patrick Decker: And I think, Scott, there are a number of people that are out there right now that are prognosticating on when this is going to get resolved. And there are different views across the board. What we're trying to do is to give you a very balanced responsible view because there still is uncertainty. And Tony and the team are working their backsides off to make sure that we get, hopefully, more than our fair share of allocation of the chips. And again, we'll know more about that as we come back around in our Q4 earnings call.
Scott Davis: And when you miss a shipment to a customer, I presume that moves into backlog at that point? Or at that point, does the customer have the right to cancel and perhaps goes to somebody else? I mean, are the lost revenue risk, I mean mechanically help us understand that.
Patrick Decker: So yes, we've not seen any project or order cancellations. Things are moving to the right. The reality is our competitors are dealing with the same issues. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers are being patient because they're seeing this as an industry wide issue. And when you think about the criticality of what we do here for, especially utilities, it's a comment I made about our Reach User conference. We got a lot of really good feedback from, again, more than 500 attendees there. And they understand the situation. So things move to the right. And I mean, do they have the right, in some cases, to cancel? Certainly, but they don't have other alternatives right now to go for.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Maybe you could just give us more color on overall how you're thinking about getting ahead of cost pricing productivity. I know you've previously mentioned you raised price a number of times. Do you think you can get ahead of inflation, logistics costs as you turn the calendar into '22 with pricing and productivity?
Sandy Rowland: Let me give you a little bit of color. First of all, we are seeing the price realization come through as we expected. So we expected to start seeing that tick up in Q3 as we work through some of the backlog of earlier orders. And we do expect that momentum to continue to accelerate into Q4 and into 2022. When I look at where we stood in the third quarter, if you look at price and material and freight costs as a basket, we're neutral. And as we move into Q4, we expect that will be modestly positive.
Andy Kaplowitz: And then I wanted to follow up on Tony's prepared remarks where he mentioned that Xylem is better positioned in Emerging Markets because it is very local for local supply chain, whereas in developed markets, maybe a little more of a global supply chain. So could you give us a little more color on what could be done to improve localization in developed markets? Does that mean a ramp-up of investment here in the US, for example?
Tony Milando: So first of all, our underlying strategy is to make where we sell. So while in Emerging Markets, we're highly localized there, we're pretty substantially localized also in Europe and in the US from a manufacturing perspective. But we will continue to move in that direction to bring local supply to those regions where the business case makes sense. So we are less localized in the US and in Europe but we're still substantially supporting those regions by in-region supply chains basically.
Patrick Decker: And there's definitely not a -- you should not expect, Andy, to see any significant uptick in either OpEx or CapEx to address localization in the US. This is not a material thing. It's more working with our suppliers and our third-party manufacturers to have them work with us to move that on an accelerated basis.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: It sounds like the supply chain conditions have worsened. This is true sector wide, so no surprises there. But since your Analyst Day a month ago, you had sized $100 million of revenues that would be pushed some into 4Q and some into 2022. Where does that stand? Just your best calculation, how much did it end up getting pushed? It sounds like it was more than $100 million.
Sandy Rowland: Deane, I think let me size it up. I think 30 days ago, we thought that we'd have somewhere between $35 million and $40 million impact in the third quarter. We saw about $50 million impact in the third quarter. About half of that was related to chip shortages and the other half related to sort of other supply chain delays. As things tighten, we've probably sized Q4 right around $120 million. And the greatest impact will be, again, on the chip side. And that's why you see the guide in our M&CS business down in Q4 quite a bit.
Deane Dray: And if you just step back, it really does sound like the meter side of your business is most impacted because that does have exposure to semiconductors. So if you think about the shortfall, how much of that is centered in your meter business?
Sandy Rowland: When I look at Q3 and Q4 combined, I'd say about 65% of the impact is in our metrology business.
Patrick Decker: And the large majority of that impact, Deane, in Q4 is the metrology business. And again, it's not a demand issue, so it's simply shifting to the right. And something I don't think we shared in our prepared remarks but it's important, I think, for everyone to see is when you look at the, whether it be the issues around getting access to chips, whether it be the port delays, the logistics challenges, the margin on our backlog which has shifted to the right is equally as attractive as we had laid out at Investor Day. And so we're not giving up margins to chase volume here and that's where I think the partnership with our customers has been really, really important.
Deane Dray: And how about -- just to stay on that backlog margin thought for a moment. Are you doing any, like, partial assemblies? We're hearing companies that are just lining up partial, nearly completed products in the hallways and so forth. And the reason this is important is when you do end up shipping those in the following quarter, you've already expensed a portion of that assembly and labor and so forth, so it actually goes out with decent margins. But just are you doing partial assemblies and where does that stand?
Tony Milando: Yes, we absolutely are. You'd see our inventory ticked up a bit and part of that is a result of parts coming in being rescheduled but also prebuilds with waiting for those extra parts to come in so we can ship them out. So we're absolutely doing that.
Deane Dray: And Tony, I love the color about using smaller ships and different ports. We're hearing about other companies doing that, so we applaud those efforts and keep up the good work.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: The de-watering business and Water Infrastructure seemed like it was really strong. Can you provide more color on how you're thinking about demand in that business going forward, and should that be a tailwind for margins?
Sandy Rowland: When we look across the portfolio and within our Water Infrastructure business in the third quarter, this was a bright spot for us. We saw 8% growth in the quarter. On revenue, we saw strong orders and the cost structure in this business, when we do get growth, it helps us from a margin perspective. So I do want to shout out Emerging Markets doing really well in this business. We're seeing good strength in mining and some of the other industrial markets. And that's been a key part of our growth.
Patrick Decker: And it definitely is. It's one of the highest kind of margin accretive businesses in the portfolio when we get that volume growth, so that certainly will help us as we go into '22.
Saree Boroditsky: And then just sticking with M&CS. How does pricing work on some of these long term contracts? Will we be able to get price for some of the supply chain inflation that you're currently seeing within the current backlog?
Sandy Rowland: So I think this is -- we're pretty well positioned here. The way most of our M&CS contracts work, the longer term ones, there are escalator clauses embedded in those contracts where we look at a basket of price indexes and then we're able to adjust our prices based on where the index is.
Patrick Decker: And this is a historically consistent situation that we've seen in the past when there had been periods of upticks in inflation or supply challenges. And part of the reason why we have that flexibility is, again, we're not in this alone. Our competitors are also dealing with supply challenges. But two, it also is the fact that these deals, when they've been approved by regulators and authorities, are being approved because they're going to be generating significant revenue for utility. So it's in their best interest to go ahead and move these things forward even if they have to wait or take on some adjustment in price escalation. It really comes down to what our overall value proposition is with those utilities.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: So I guess, the margin dynamics impacting M&CS, but can you talk a little bit about -- you did so well in Water Infrastructure on margins. Applied Water was just a little bit below what I was thinking. So I guess, what are the differences there that would impact margins between those two segments?
Sandy Rowland: So I think there's a couple of dynamics. One was one of the points that we talked about through an earlier question. You saw the uptick in the dewatering business and that's good mix for us, so that helps margin. I think the other impact was there's some differences in inflation impacts between what we saw, for example, in our Water Infrastructure business and our AWS business. So it was more modest in our Water Infrastructure business.
Andrew Buscaglia: And you talked about utility weakness. I'm wondering, are you seeing any initial signs of hesitation around spending, given that this infrastructure stimulus seems to be dragging on, we don't have quite the clarity we thought we'd have at this point in this year?
Patrick Decker: No, we've not seen any signs of that and our bidding pipeline continues to be very robust. And again, the conversations that we had with, again, these 500 plus utilities at our Reach Conference, which is not just around metrology, this actually -- beginning of last year was the first time we had turned that into a Xylem Reach conference, it used to be Census. And so the conversations we're having with utilities there are across the entire portfolio of solutions. I've said before, I think that there is historically not really ever been of reliance at the utility level on federal government subsidization or funding, so nobody is kind of relying on that in a significant way. Again, the orders activity in the US was up very, very strong. And again, it really just comes down to some of the port and shipping delays that we're working through. But we've seen no hesitation in demand or order outlook.
Andrew Buscaglia: So those orders just keep you confident that the demand's still there, I guess, as long as we don't see cancellations, that you feel confident there?
Patrick Decker: That's correct. And again, I would reinforce that it's not just the orders in the backlog but it's the margin on those orders in the backlog that remains robust.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I just wanted to go back to [M&CS] for a minute, just under $320 million of revenue in the third quarter. The guidance looks like it's maybe $300 million of revenue or slightly below that. Is that kind of the level of revenue that you're restricted to with these chip shortages, logistics shortages, and that's the way we should think about at least the next couple of quarters, three quarters until some of this stuff starts to loosen up, or are there product redesigns or other things that you can do to try and boost that in the short term?
Sandy Rowland: I think, Nate, if you look at our guide for Q4, we're right in that neighborhood. We think that over time, the chip supply is going to improve and so that will gradually ramp. I think we've also seen some strength in some of our other businesses outside of metrology, which have opportunity to grow sooner than that. So assessment services is part of our portfolio. Our test business is a key part of that portfolio with really good margin structures. So we can grow there. The chip supply will constrain us over the next couple of quarters but we do expect that to gradually recover.
Patrick Decker: And again, Nate, again, I go back, this is not a demand issue. So it's simply a matter of when we're able to convert these orders into revenue. And again, we're not seeing any signs of cancellations, and the margins remain strong. So I know you've heard me say that a number of times this morning but I think it's an important point to reiterate.
Nathan Jones: No, I'm just trying to get an idea of what the first half of '22 might look like in M&CS…
Patrick Decker: And Nate, we're trying to give you a responsible prudent view. There is a fair amount of uncertainty out there, not around backlog or margins but we're trying to -- again, we're trying to be balanced here.
Nathan Jones: Yes, it's about getting it out the door and not getting the orders in the door.
Nathan Jones: On the localizing supply chains question that people have been asking about, I mean, the contract manufacturing that you're doing and the importing that you're doing, I assume it's mostly on the technology side and it's coming from Asia to Europe and the US. Is it even possible to localize that manufacturing? Are there suppliers that you could leverage in the US and Europe to localize that? Is it just cost prohibitive because they're much higher cost than Asian suppliers would be? Just is it even possible to do that?
Tony Milando: So our large contract manufacturing -- we use contract manufacturers everywhere, but the largest one that we have is in Mexico actually, and so that's really supporting our US business. So it's largely the assembly and some of the componentry is localized here. Now granted, the electronics are coming from Asia and so we continue to look at possibilities to bring that closer. That will be a bit -- I mean, that's not something that we're looking to do necessarily but that's largely localized right now.
Nathan Jones: Is it just not possible to localize that from Asia?
Tony Milando: On the chip side, it will be something that I think we'll wait for the supply base. The supply base is a little thin for chip suppliers in North America, so most of that still comes from Asia.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to return to Water Infrastructure and I wanted to clarify a comment you made before. Obviously, orders have been very strong within that business and I think you called out the de-watering business, in particular, as an area of strength. But is that the main driver of the significant increase in orders this year or are there other areas that you would point to?
Sandy Rowland: In orders growth, the orders growth has been really across the board in Water Infrastructure. It's impacting -- we're seeing good growth on the treatment side and the largest part of our business is transport, and so orders there have also been very strong.
Connor Lynagh: And then just thinking through that strength, I mean, this might actually be a better question for just the whole company, but you called out some change in the typical order intake to actual revenue conversion or shipment timing. I'm curious how different that looks versus history, because basically the order intake would suggest that 2022 is going to be quite a good year for a lot of the segments but just hoping you could sort of frame how we should risk that relative to history.
Patrick Decker: We won't comment yet on '22. We'll come back around to that in our next earnings call as we give guidance for '22. But yes, we do not have a demand issue here in Water Infrastructure. And the challenges that we saw in Q3 and we're weathering in Q4, we do believe to be more transitory and it really was around, again, some of the port delays and other freight challenges and shortages. So we think we'll get through those over the coming months here. And yes, we feel good about Water Infrastructure going into '22.
Sandy Rowland: And I think the other question you had was about conversion time between when orders get placed and when it converts to revenue. And certainly, there is an increase in demand, strong demand. You don't put up orders growth of the magnitude that we're posting. But we do acknowledge, everybody is recognizing that lead times are getting longer across the board. And so there is a bias for customers to put their orders in a little bit earlier than they usually have.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: You alluded to the fact that everybody is in the same boat in terms of supply chain complications. With that in mind, are you seeing any distressed M&A opportunities in terms of acting as a consolidator with regard to some smaller players for whom these supply chain issues are perhaps even more problematic than they are for blue chips?
Patrick Decker: We definitely see ourselves as being in a privileged and strong position from an M&A standpoint, whether it be, again, our financial wherewithal, our bandwidth to do M&A, both financial and human, the balance sheet. And so we still remain very confident on that front. I don't know that I would say that the chip shortage and supply chain challenges are necessarily unlocking any opportunities that we would not have already had in our pipeline. We remain continued focused on what our priorities are strategically in that area. And that really is around, we see some opportunities to do some bolt-ons with utilities. Industrial, commercial building continue to be areas that we are very positive and very focused on. Again, it takes two to tango. And so again, we'll keep you updated on that. We're very confident. We're very excited about the M&A pipeline. But I wouldn't say it's changed dramatically because of the supply chain situation.
Pavel Molchanov: A quick follow-up on the opportunity in Europe. Obviously, a lot of emphasis on the reconciliation and the infrastructure builds in Washington. But given that the European Union Fit for 55 package is already finalized and very much being implemented, I'm curious if you've seen a pickup in customer activity orders from the EU within the context of their climate policy.
Patrick Decker: I would say that not in the immediate term, although, I would say we are hearing more and more discussion around that. And so we see that as being an opportunity a bit further out. And I think even the conversations around COP26 are providing a backdrop. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're going to be very prominent there as is the water sector. And so we do think that, that bodes well for demand but it's down the road. It takes time for these to convert into orders.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I know you all alluded to this, but I just wanted to understand a little bit more. If I look across the three segments, it seems like price hasn't read out as much in M&CS versus Water Infra and Applied Water. You mentioned sort of the inflation escalators in some of the contracts and then some of the, I guess, regulators stepping in and approving those. But can you sort of give us a sense of the time line for that, is that sort of an annual review? And then if you do have unregulated utilities in your mix for the meter business, is the construct the same or is that case by case?
Sandy Rowland: So one thing I think to level set. If you look at, first of all, inflation where it hit us the hardest, it has been outside of our M&CS business. It's been higher because of the types of commodities that we purchased that we've seen greater inflations in these other two segments. Those contracts have those escalator clauses. They come at different times and we are seeing favorable price coming through in M&CS.
Patrick Decker: So just to add to that, Brian. When you look at our metrology business, which is where the largest majority of our longer term deals reside, we typically have price escalation clauses built into them and those are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis. And so we expect that to roll through as those orders get implemented. And so we're less concerned around the margin expansion or price realization in that part of our company.
Brian Lee: I guess that's sort of a segue into the second question I had. Just in general, there's been a lot of discussion here on the call around the chip shortages you're seeing. In terms of inflation, it does sound like it's less of an impact in that segment versus the others. Can you kind of give us a sense of what you're seeing there? And then at a company level, I think you're talking about seeing price costs go positive here in Q4. Would you say that's the same sort of time frame for M&CS or is that more into 2022 as you see price read out?
Sandy Rowland: Brian, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier on the call that across the company, we were neutral from a price cost perspective in Q3 and that we expected that to turn positive in Q4 as we're seeing price realization sort of ramp sequentially through the year. And so we feel like in the first part of 2022, we'll continue to see that trend as well. So our teams have worked really hard to be thoughtful and responsible as it comes down to price. This year, we've taken multiple price actions. When we look sort of at our expectations around where we thought inflation would be, we thought it would be across the company around 3% at the beginning of the year and it's going to turn out to be closer to 5% on an annual basis. And so that's been the reason we've gone out with these price increases to keep that in balance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: A couple of questions, sticking on the supply chain. I wanted to get your take on something that we've begun to hear just in the last week or so from some of the macro economists about sort of a surge in double ordering and even triple ordering in all sorts of products across the economy. And so I'm curious about what your take is on that on both sides of your business. Do you think there's any of that going on in terms of the orders that you're seeing from customers? And then on your side, are you doing any excess ordering and chips and other things to kind of stockpile supply to sort of place multiple orders, hope something gets through in time?
Patrick Decker: I'll go first and then I'll have Tony talk about what we're doing on the ordering side ourselves. I would say where we've seen some of that uptick and people trying to get ahead of the supply chain constraints has actually been more around the port delays, the logistic challenges and some of those orders that we see, it's hard to put a specific number on it. But the order growth, I think, certainly in Water Infrastructure and most notably, Applied Water, some of that certainly, which is largely book-and-ship business, has been people trying to get ahead of the supply chain delays. Not that we aren't seeing any of that within M&CS but the large majority of that business, again, is driven really by some of these large deals and those orders converting. So there's some ordering in advance but it's less prominent there than it is within the other two segments. And Tony?
Tony Milando: And Ryan, I would just add that we're not doing double or triple ordering. What we are doing is working with multiple suppliers to try to get parts wherever we can, whether it's brokers or distributors or the IDMs. But I mean, that's a natural outcome of the bull up effect is to double and triple order and double down on these things. But we're not doing that here. We're just working with multiple suppliers.
Ryan Connors: And then my other one just had to do with another thing that's been in the news a lot in the quarter is sort of labor issues and strikes and some big industrial companies like Deere, for example. And your own financials reports say 17% of your US labor force is unionized, I believe most of that is census. Anything coming up there in terms of CBA negotiations or anything that you could share with us there?
Tony Milando: No, nothing with our unions. We have very good relationships with the unions around the world, particularly in the US. We are seeing labor tightness, as we mentioned earlier in the script, particularly in the US, not so much in Europe or Emerging Markets. But we're not anticipating any challenges with our unionized facilities.
Patrick Decker: And I would just add there as well that where we are seeing some of the labor tightness is in some of our distribution locations around the US where we are in high-traffic distribution centers competitively, and that's obviously a very tight part of the labor market right now. So we've been taking actions to try to be more flexible, to try to get the workforce in, hiring ahead, knowing that we're going to have some natural attrition. But as Tony said, it's really not to do with our unionized workforce.
Operator: And at this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Patrick Decker for any additional closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Well, thank you all very much. Really appreciate your interest, your support. I know we've covered a lot here this morning. I look forward to our follow-up conversations with many of you and we'll see you on our next earnings call. And in the meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And again, I just want to say thank you to all of you who have been a part of this journey of ours over the last 10 years as we celebrated yesterday our 10th anniversary of trading for the first time as Xylem. So thank you all very much and we'll be back in touch.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Xylem’s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Patrick Decker: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The call is starting a bit later in the morning than usual this quarter. So, by now, you will have seen that second quarter performance exceeded our expectations on all major metrics, including orders, revenue, margin, and earnings per share. I'm very proud of the team beating the healthy pace we set in the first quarter and just delivering a very strong first half of the year. Underlying demand for our solutions was robust across all segments and end-markets. The team did a great job converting that into better-than-expected performance and continuing to expand margin. They delivered even more exceptional results on orders, which grew 29% on underlying demand across all regions. In addition, backlog is up 35% versus this point last year, that broad expansion reflects commercial momentum that puts us in a strong position both now and into the future, as we continue to invest in sustainable growth. At the end of the first quarter, we raised full year guidance on revenue and earnings. The second quarter’s performance shows a continuing strong trajectory into the second half. And we are reflecting that by further raising full year revenue guidance. The topline benefits are likely to be moderated somewhat by inflation and a challenging supply chain environment. But we've been proactive on price and are working with our supply chain partners to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. So, we are also raising the midpoint on earnings per share guidance for the full year. In a moment I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing globally. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. The second quarter offered a strong story of continuing demand recovery as revenue grew 11% organically compared to the prior year. We also saw momentum across most end markets on a quarter sequential basis. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by clean water applications and continued wastewater utility OpEx demand. Industrial was up 17% on broad-based strengths as economies reopened and activity continued to ramp. Commercial grew 12% and also improved sequentially led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe, while residential, our smallest end market grew 29%. Geographically, Western Europe and China were both up mid-teens with increasing demand seen across all end markets. The U.S. returned to growth with site access restrictions easing during the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 29% on strong underlying demand across all segments and regions, with particular pace in M&CS, which grew orders 70% on large water metrology contracts. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvements and it reflects higher orders growth than in the same period in 2019. Importantly, we exit the quarter with overall backlog ups 35%. Looking at the key financial metrics, margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.3%. The 200 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion came largely from productivity volume and favorable mix, partially offset by inflation and investments. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, which is up 65%. Please turn to Slide 5 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure delivered strong results during the quarter. Orders were flat, but up 22% excluding the large prior year deal in Telangana, India. Order intake was robust in treatment globally. Revenues were up 6% organically. Wastewater utilities remained resilient and we are now seeing recovery in the industrial end market. Geographically, emerging markets delivered mid-teens growth from industrial recovery driven in part by increasing mining demand in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe delivered double digit girls from continued strong utility OpEx activities. In the U.S. healthy utilities OpEx demand reflected in strong orders growth, was offset by the lapping of prior year treatment project deliveries. EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year as strong productivity savings and volume effects, offset inflation and investments. Now please turn to Slide 6. The applied water segment had a very strong quarter driven by continuing market recovery across all regions and end markets. Orders were up 43%, organically in the quarter with particular strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenue grew 18% in the quarter with double digit industrial demand driven by reopening activity, and especially in marine and food and beverage applications. Residential growth continues to be robust on strong market demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up double digits while yet Western Europe contributed 27% growth on increasing industrial demand. Emerging markets were up 24% due in part to broad industrial recovery and momentum in China. Segment EBITDA margin grew 200 basis points compared to the prior year. The expansion came from strong volume, leverage and productivity, more than offsetting material and freight inflation. Now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. M&CS deliver a strong quarter as large project deployments began to ramp. We also realized gains in our industrial water quality testing business. Orders for the segment were up 70% organically on strong demand. Our M&CS backlog now stands at $1.5 billion, which is an historic high and almost 50% higher than at this time last year. We have secured more than $400 million in large contracts in the last 18 months. That reflects a number of major projects, which increasingly include our blotter digital solutions in combination with our core metrology application. Revenue was up 11% led by 17% growth in water applications, driven by large project deployments and double-digit growth in water quality applications. Energy applications were down modestly due to project timing and supply chain constraints. Unpacking the results by geography, emerging markets in Western Europe were up 20% and 25% respectively. The U.S. was up mid-single digits on strong demand for water quality applications and assessment services. As a reminder, for this segment in particular, growth rates can be uneven due to the impact of project timing. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was up 460 basis points compared to the prior year. Strong productivity savings from prior year restructuring actions, favorable mix and volume leverage more than offset inflation in investments. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, $600 million of senior notes will mature to be paid with cash. Free cash flow conversion was 172% in the quarter in line with our expectations and historical seasonality patterns. Net debt to EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. Pease turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Sandy. I want to touch on three areas briefly. Our operating discipline, our growth platforms and sustainability. On operating discipline, the team did an excellent job on margins in the quarter, delivering 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion year-on-year, in addition to quarter sequential improvement. We do anticipate some inflation and component supply challenges in the second half, but we're confident in our ability to manage through them and to mitigate their impact. Earlier, I noted our extremely healthy backlogs. As we've worked through these volumes, the team is doing a great job, making sure we manage the pressure on working capital this can create. In fact, despite serving spiking demand, we've improved working capital both year-over-year and quarter sequentially. As Sandy just mentioned, that performance puts us firmly on track to deliver our commitment on attractive free cash flow conversion. We clearly have significant capacity for capital deployment. On top of strong organic growth investment options, we have an attractive and active pipeline of M&A opportunities. Our growth platforms are an area we'll be delving into at our Investor Day in September, so I'm going to refrain from too much detail here today. I do want to draw attention to two things, however. Last quarter, we highlighted the pace of growth in emerging markets. This quarter, that pace has continued. Despite India's hard acceleration through the quarter due to COVID impact there. I'm very proud of the entire Xylem team's discipline and compassionate response in all countries affected by COVID, both in terms of our own operations and also how we've leaned in to support customers and help serve our communities. I also want to take a moment to draw a connecting line between our portfolio and some of the dramatic water-centric events we've been seeing recently around the world, by which I mean the flooding in Europe, China, and Central Asia and the drought in American West. These events reflect a trend as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent. And that trend requires an affordable response to keep communities safe, resilient, and water secure. So we continue to invest in specific technologies in our portfolio that respond to these challenges. As an example, automated wastewater network optimization is amongst our most advanced digital solutions. Its job is to manage overflows and prevent flooding. And our customer deployments are already preventing 1.4 billion cubic meters of water from flooding communities. Similarly, we also continue to innovate in the technologies that make communities more resilient to drought, technologies like leak detection, smart metering and especially water reuse. Already 1 trillion gallons of water are being recycled using Xylem technology, which brings me to the topic of sustainability more broadly. The numbers I just quoted come from our annual-sustainability report, which we published in June. And I think they bear out what we've said for some time. Our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our business strategy. We were pleased to report, for example, that almost half of our major facilities are now operating on 100% renewable energy, helping reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by more than 7% year-over-year. Beyond our own footprint, our solutions have enabled our customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 700,000 metric tons last year. The report details progress on all of our signature sustainability goals and shows how sustainability is deeply embedded in who we are as a company. Now with that, I'll hand it back over to Sandy to provide commentary on our end markets and guidance for the remainder of the year.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Our full-year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water, affirming our anticipated growth of mid-to-high single digits. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady demand in Western Europe and North America as operators continue to focus on mission-critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets. Bid activity and long-term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid, though some COVID concerns linger in certain markets. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery. Consistent with other technology companies, the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half, given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components. Our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year, we are now anticipated growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions. We're seeing upticks in demand, particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets. We're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage, driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well. The U.S. replacement business is growing at a first pace. New commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat, but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector. With growth in Western Europe and China sustained through the second half, along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency, we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid-to-high single digits, up from the low single digits previously. In residential, we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year, up modestly from our previous expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are further raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, up from our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. This confidence is based on clear demand recovery, combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For water infrastructure, we expect mid-single-digit growth from a previous expectation of mid-to-high single digits. We expect low double-digit growth in applied water, up from mid-to-high single digits. And in measurement & control solutions, we expect mid-single-digit growth. We also expect EBITDA margins in the range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full-year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint. That's grounded in a strong first-half performance with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year, as well as volume leverage from the top line growth. The third quarter is more challenging, primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization. However, price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters. Overall, we expect strong second-half margins compared to the first half of the year. This yields an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70, reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges. That range now reflects a 28% increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint over last year. We continue to expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% as previously guided, putting our three-year average right around 130%. We have provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, one item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year. Because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results, we've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18. This change, along with some other currency movements has a $0.04 negative impact on our second-half outlook. As you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Also, we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from 50 million to 60 million to now 30 million to 40 million, while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to high natural attrition and the timing of actions. And now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our third-quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5% to 7%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in applied water, and low single-digit growth in M&CS. We expect third-quarter adjusted-EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, largely in line with our strong second quarter. While inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter, we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team has been doing an outstanding job capturing market demand, giving us exceptional orders and backlog growth. We expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand. And the team will manage through the near-term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year. Looking forward, trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand-in-hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way. Those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis, that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies, addressing scarcity, resilience, and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins, and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment. This puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term. We are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our upcoming Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 30. It will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team, especially those who joined us over the past year. So it's a great chance to provide a full-strategic update, including our long-term financial targets, and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers, including discussions with a few of those customers who've deployed some of our most advanced technologies. Matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days. Now let's turn the call over to you and are happy to take any questions you may have. So operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hey, Mike. How are you doing?
Sandy Rowland: Hi, Mike.
Michael Halloran: I'm all good. Thank you. So two questions on M&CS here. First, maybe just a little deeper dive on how you see that backlog conversion playing out? Obviously, a really nice sequential move in orders, really good commentary from an underlying perspective on what the underlying cadence, demand, et cetera, looks like. But you also have the supply chain challenges, shortages, things like that. How do you see that playing out right now in terms of site access, in terms of availability, in terms of when that next ramp or rollout really can start accelerating again?
Patrick Decker: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. Great question. So yes, the backlog growth in M&CS specifically was about 49% in this past quarter. So a really good uptick. Really encouraged by a number of not just the large-deal wins that the team has achieved there, but also the base business, the day-to-day business grew quite nicely in the quarter, and we see good momentum there. We feel that the site access issues have certainly eased. I wouldn't say they're completely resolved, but they're certainly trending in the right direction. Where we're really seeing – and really, the primary challenge out there right now, which the team is all over working hard to mitigate that is some of the component shortages. And that's not limited to us. That really is not just across our sector, but as you all well know, broader sectors as well. But the team is all over. We're doing everything we can, whether it be kind of paying up for some components, making sure we lock in commitments around that. So we're very – we feel very good about the momentum. It really does feel like that part of our business is turning the corner in terms of converting things into backlog. We look at the margin in backlog, especially as we go into 2022 and feel very good about that, not just what they've achieved already this year. Again, challenges aside in the second half around component shortages, and those are real. They're not insignificant, but we're confident we can work through that. And it's shaping up very nice for 2022 and beyond.
Michael Halloran: So you touched a little bit on it in the answer, but just dig a little deeper. Could you just talk about the mix of the backlog, how that's tracking versus some of the more digitally oriented and the newer solutions you're putting in the marketplace, broader approach there versus more traditional. And also thoughts on how you think the backlog margin is tracking out as well in comfort level given all the moving pieces?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. And I think on the – let me take the second one first. The margin on the backlog, we're confident about as we go into 2022 and beyond. Again, we've got this near-term challenge we're working through in Q3 and Q4 on component shortages, et cetera. But again, we're holding our own there. As it relates to the mix, we continue to see a real adoption of – even in these large metrology deals that we're doing, there is an ever-going increased component of that, that is digital. And so we're very encouraged by that. And we continue to see a number of really impressive wins on the branding that we call Xylem Vue, which is the purely digital kind of data-driven diagnostic capabilities. And so we're very encouraged in that area as well. But there's definitely a shifting mix toward the digital component.
Michael Halloran: Great. Thank you for the time Patrick.
Patrick Decker: We'll have more that we'll share on that at our upcoming Investor Day to kind of unpack and unbundle that for you all.
Michael Halloran: Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate it.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane. How are you doing?
Sandy Rowland: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. Doing real well. Thanks. Just like to pick up where we left off there on the supply chain. And it looks like you are managing through this based upon your margin success. We were expecting you to get some price increases in the second quarter, how did that play out? And then what's the expectation for second half on a price cost for the total company? Thanks.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, Deane. I think that we're very happy with how we've managed through the inflation dynamics through the first half of the year. And we were able to realize some incremental price in Q2. We do expect that, that will continue to ramp throughout the year. Just as a reminder, we're now up on our third price increase for the year. We got out of the gate early with a price increase in the first quarter because of the continuous rise in the commodity prices. We've then taken that decision to take two additional price increases. I think there is one unique dynamic that we're working through. The backlogs are a little higher than we typically find at any given period of time. And so the realizations, there's a little bit of a timing issue. But net-net, I think we're doing a good job here, and it will continue to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter.
Patrick Decker: Yes. And Deane, I would just offer that, so yes, as Sandy said, the most challenging time frame we say right now is really in Q3 because we did have this big bump in backlog. And so that's – we're shipping that out. We – there is price realization in there. But as you know, commodities especially have moved so quickly that we've gone out now and we'll go out again with further price increases. But we – as we look at the exit, especially in Q4, that really all comes back into complete equilibrium. And we are net positive at that point once again.
Deane Dray: Great. Just a quick clarification. And, Patrick, I don't know if you were anticipating I was going to ask this question until you gave the partial answer earlier is in the orders, especially MC&S, the digital component, can you put a number just broadly? It doesn't have to be that precise, but how much of these orders have a digital component. And you can include Sensus and their smart meter part of that as well.
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, absolutely. And I think, Deane – I'll give you an answer. And Deane, I think this is absolutely what we want to delve in a bit more at Investor Day. We really kind of want to lay out that baseline and that framework as to how we think about digital and what that kind of trend line is and what our metrics and incentives tied to that are. So much more to come at Investor Day. But just to put it in perspective, we've had, in the last 18 months, we've had $400 million roughly in large-deal wins. And that has had a significant digital component to it. And so that just gives you one sense of kind of proof point. And then there are a number of, again, really interesting projects and deals that we've won with what we call the Xylem Vue, which is, again, purely the diagnostic kind of consultative side of the business that we'll be highlighting at Investor Day. So we'll cover more of that on September 30. But hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor of that. There's a real meaningful adoption here on the digital side that we want to give the appropriate color to. We're very, very excited about it.
Deane Dray: Of course, happy to wait until then for those specifics. And just last one for me on water infrastructure, just tempering the guidance on the top line going to mid-single digit. Just what are the key headwinds? And how would you calibrate those?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think it's a modest shift. I think we did take the water infrastructure guide up in the first – at the end of the first quarter, we initially guided to about a 4% increase. We took that up. I think we're very close in the same spot. It's largely unchanged.
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think there's some timing of project delivery and some shipments. We had some pretty impressive comps versus last year. Deane, I wouldn't read anything into that. I mean, we're trying to be prudent just in terms of the guide for the second half. But there's nothing happening from a market standpoint that is changing our view on that segment. We're very confident. It continues to be very much in that healthy mid-single-digit kind of growth rate as we'd expect. And there, that also cuts across geographies, Deane. We're not seeing any kind of slowdown or shift in spending in the U.S. because of infrastructure discussion or any of that is just – again, it's trying to be prudent.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to – not to beat the dead horse on the supply chain issues. But if you just want to drill down there. Some of the sort of peer companies have talked about sort of foregone revenue because it's so tough to get some components and things. But it sounds like you're not really saying that. You mentioned, Patrick, paying up for components. And it sounds like in your case, it's more of a – you're willing to take it on the margin side if you have to and to get the business and be able to shift the business. And it hasn't really been a revenue headwind leaving business on the table either in the past or in the second half. Is that a fair characterization of what I'm hearing or is it not?
Patrick Decker: No, that's fair, Ryan. I mean, again, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a huge shout out to the team that's working through this because it is challenging. I mean it's not an insignificant challenge that they're trying to overcome at this point in time. But just to put some kind of parameters around this. And we estimate right now, we've probably moved roughly at least $20 million of revenue out of the second half of the year into 2022. Obviously, there's never any guarantee. Obviously, that comes with healthy margins. And so if it weren't for that, we would probably be talking about a further adjustment to our guide. But that's the reality that we are working through at this point in time. And it's not without risk. So our teams are working their backsides off in that regard. Yes, we don't feel that we are losing revenue from a competitive standpoint because we're all facing the same challenges. And this is a pretty sticky business. It's hard to swap out suppliers. So that's the right characterization, Ryan. Hopefully, a little bit extra color can be was helpful.
Ryan Connors: Yes, it certainly was. And then as a follow-on to that, you, at the corporate level, as well as all of your salespeople that you've given us all access to with the trade events and things, always talk about pricing for value as opposed to pricing for commodities. So how do you handle this weird environment where you're suddenly having to price for commodities? I mean, do you build in de-escalators if certain things go down in the future? I mean, it just seems like a very different discussion than you normally like to have around sort of pricing for value?
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, you're absolutely right, Ryan. I mean we – the teams are continuing to remain primarily focused on pricing for value. And that, again, really tying back to, again, what are the customer outcomes that we're looking to achieve here in terms of helping them achieve their goals. And so we are getting better, I think, at pricing for value. I would say in these kinds of interesting environments, we were not really doing surcharges. So it's not like we're putting it out there where we have to dial it back later. And so we're trying to be disciplined in that regard. At the same time, we also dealt with this. It wasn't that long ago, we were talking about the tariffs and all the other interesting pricing challenges that we had to overcome. So again, I don't want to minimize the incredible hard work the teams are doing to deal with this pricing environment. But I'm very pleased and very proud of what they've accomplished thus far.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Good. And then I did have one last one. I didn't hear a two-question restrictions. So hopefully, I'm not in over here, but…
Patrick Decker: Two-question restrictions, Ryan.
Ryan Connors: I'll hop back in later. That's fine.
Sandy Rowland: No. Go ahead, Ryan.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Just a very big picture. But just obviously, stock is sitting at an all-time high. You've got a great currency. And we've seen this weird kind of valuation gap develop. You've got a great story to tell around ESG, maybe others do not. So this huge valuation gap has opened up. I mean, has there been any thought to how that influences your M&A strategy where you use that currency to raise capital? And kind of arbitrage that by some of these smaller companies who don't seem to be – have their ducks in a row on ESG and bring some of your best practices there? I mean is that something that you thought about?
Patrick Decker: Absolutely, Ryan. I mean, it's a great point. But if I bring it back to center on that theme around kind of capital deployment, again, the pipeline is very active. It's – we believe there are things that are actionable there of different shapes and sizes. We absolutely would believe in using our currency in the right way and leverage that in the right way to go after really attractive strategic assets that are a good strategic fit. Obviously, we still are going to be disciplined around returns and it really is around growth, making sure it's accretive, making sure margins are accretive. There's a technology component, we believe it's very important that there is a services recurring revenue component that are very attractive. So those fundamentals don't change. But your question around using stock as a currency, that is something that we are very much open to in a disciplined way. And I like the point you made. I do believe that – and again, I'm very proud of what the entire team has done here on making sure that sustainability for us and the broader ESG is not just some kind of stand-alone thing. It's deeply integrated into our business. It's what we do as a company. And it's in our operating processes. We have incentives tied around it. And I do think that, that is an area of synergy as we look at other companies that we could bring into the portfolio. So I think a very good point in your part, Ryan.
Ryan Connors: Very well. Thanks. And thanks for letting me squeeze that one in.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to return to the orders, which obviously pretty much across all segments look very impressive. I'm curious – and I appreciate this is probably difficult to quantify, but I'm curious if you're seeing behavior from customers that would suggest that they are anticipating supply chain bottlenecks of their own? In other words, are you seeing over ordering? Or do you think this is just representative of very strong demand trends in a true underlying sense?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we are seeing great momentum on the orders front. And so we do believe that demand is coming back in a very sustainable way. I think if you break it down a little bit by our segments, I think in water infrastructure, in particular, we're probably seeing the most natural order flow and not really an acceleration or deviation from historical timing. When you shift over and look at AWS and M&CS where I think we're up 43% in AWS in the quarter and 70% in M&CS, there is true demand returning. But we are seeing customers try to get in line a little bit, whether it's ahead of longer lead times that we published, some incremental pricing actions that we've announced, or importantly, the supply chain components that we've talked about extensively on the call. All of that in combination is certainly impacting some of the buying behaviors. But I think the order momentum that we have is – we're really excited about, and we think it positions us well not only for the second half of the year, but as we look forward into 2022 and beyond.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. That's helpful color. Thank you. Just on the guidance, water infrastructure is the loan area where you seem to revise down the view a little bit. I'm just curious if there's specific projects or specific regions that are driving that? And I guess how would you contrast that with the strong ordering activity that you've seen year-to-date? Is it more of just a temporary supply chain issue? Or is there something more significant underlying that?
Sandy Rowland: I think it's minor. We try to tighten the range a little bit as we move into the second half, but we did have some U.S. treatment orders that just got pushed out a little bit in – that we had in Q2 that have gotten pushed out, and some of that plays through the rest of the guide. But I think fundamentally, we're seeing good orders momentum in treatment. We're seeing good orders momentum in dewatering, and transport is – continues to be strong. So there's nothing there from an order perspective that gives us any concern. And I view it just as we're tightening the range a little bit as we move into the second half.
Connor Lynagh: Make sense. Thanks. I'll turn it back.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Nate.
Nathan Jones: I had a follow-up question on the MCS order rates. Obviously, all-time record, so fantastic stuff there. I know you guys account for that a little bit differently. You don't stick the entire order for a 10-year project into the backlog when you say that you need to have POs in hand to actually book it as an order. So can you talk about what's driving that? Is it the ramp-up of projects that you had previously won? Or are they orders here for new projects that you're just winning now?
Sandy Rowland: So I think great question, Nate. I think you've got the flow well understood. The first step for us is to bring something into our backlog. And we tend to see that around large metrology deployments. And as we get closer to the rollout phase, we start to see real orders that come in from our customers. And I think we're seeing a pop in the order rate because some of the large orders, large awards that we brought into backlog are starting to convert into orders now that some of the site access restrictions are easing. And some of it also is what I just answered before. We are seeing that some of the customers are trying to get in line sooner to get in front of some of the component shortages. But I think backlog is a leading indicator and the orders means that it's starting to – will start to convert into revenue in a more short-term basis.
Patrick Decker: And I would add, Nate, it's not too much specifically in a reaction to your question on the order flow and so forth. But we didn't call out earlier. And I really do want to get a shout out to our team within M&CS that manages our analytics business. I mean they've been performing very well. It's really high margin, and that business really has been showing robust growth and strength. So that's – it doesn't move the numbers dramatically in the aggregate, but it's very rich in margin. And I'm very proud of what the team is doing there.
Nathan Jones: Great. I had a follow-up question on the restructuring expense and the high-natural attrition comment. I mean, obviously, you were looking to take some of those heads out anyway. But can you talk about whether or not you're worried at all about high-natural attrition if you're losing talent for one reason or another? And any steps you might need to take there to protect that talent base?
Patrick Decker: Yes, Nate. It's again, another great question. I would say labor shortage, managing attrition, it is a challenge. It is a headache. It's something that I and management team worry about a lot. But it's not our primary challenge. I mean I think our primary challenge right now is, again, working through the component shortages and the supply chain challenges, which, in some cases, is an indirect impact of labor shortage, broadly speaking. I would say one of the areas also that we are very focused on is retaining some critical areas like software engineers, a very competitive landscape at this point in time. I mean we are focused on it. We feel that our – not only our purpose and mission as a company is very compelling for attracting and retaining a wide variety of talent. But two, we are continuing to look at some flexible areas that we can just drive further retention. Obviously, the pandemic has been hard on everyone around the world, and there is some dislocation occurring right now. And so we're being very thoughtful as to how we work through that. We built any of that incremental cost into our outlook, but that's something that we are going to continue to stay very close to because the talent is just so, it's so essential here in terms of what we're trying to accomplish.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Patrick Decker: Hey Scott.
Matt Latino: Hey Scott.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning Scott. 
Scott Graham: So, couple of things if you said it, I didn't hear it. Did you – can you offer us a single point number for what pricing was?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, it's about 50 basis points in the quarter.
Scott Graham: Okay. And then to that end it looks like the pricing occurred in the Applied Water and M&CS segments, and it looks like water infrastructure pricing was negative. Is that true?
Sandy Rowland: In water infrastructure it's flattish. And then we did see that the greatest price realization within AWS, and that's where we're seeing some more of the commodity increases hit most rapidly. And we did see a little bit of pricing benefit in M&CS, which is tied into our contract terms with our customer. I think what's important to note is that we're going to see – we do expect incremental pricing benefits as we move through the year, and you're going to see that number rise in each of our upcoming calls.
Patrick Decker: Yes, so, the other thing I'd add Scott is just and I think Sandy touched on this in her response to you was, we saw commodity inflation has not hit us equally or consistently in each aspect of our business. It really is a different issue of mix. And so obviously our pricing is driven by our views on not only selling value, but dealing with commodity inflation. So, we just saw more of that earlier on given the shorter cycle nature of our Applied Water business and because of some of the component shortages and other things in M&Cs. I'm not saying it was not an issue in water infrastructure. Our team would not be happy hearing me say otherwise they've dealt with it also. But it’s just the timing of when those commodity inflation impacts would hit us. But we felt good about the run rate within each of the segments.
Scott Graham: Yes. Well, I have no doubt the price is going to get better. You guys have made that clear. I'm just wanting to stay on water infrastructure for one more second, then I have a quick follow-up. It would imply from the slide on – Slide 5, that mix was then negative in water infrastructure, right?
Patrick Decker: That's right. So, Scott, we have – we did see watering return to growth, which was great to see. It was more in the sale of pumps into our channels than it was about the rental side, which would have driven higher incremental margin for us with just how rich that rental side is. So, it was really just a little bit of the mix of where we were seeing the return, particularly in the industrial side, you saw it in the emerging markets and you saw in some of the areas where we serve the mining sector. And it was a lot of pump sales as opposed to the rental, but we have seen rental start to come back here. I think that's something that – that could be something we see in the second half, particularly in North America as the construction markets and other areas get going.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think one thing is important to recognize if you look at water infrastructure, if you look at it quarter sequentially, we did see an uptick in margins as we move from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we think that they were well positioned on that front. 
Scott Graham: Okay. And then my last question is Sandy, this is with you, I think, you said you are expecting strong margins in the second half, but flattish based on the construct of your guide. You would be happy with your second half margins, you pulling them strong, but I think the guide implies that they are essentially flat, right?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So, I think if you look first half, second half, we expect higher margins in the second half of the year. If we look Q2 to Q3, those two quarters actually are shaping up to look very similar. They're about the same size from a revenue perspective. And our guide is very close to what we realized in Q3. And then we do expect it uptick in margins in the fourth quarter. But not as much year-over-year improvement in the second half. And I think that's very consistent with our guide for the year. We expect it to come out of the gate strong from a margin expansion perspective. And I think we’ve realized about 300 basis points of margin expansion in the first half.  As we look into the second half, we don't have that same tailwind. Last year we had restructuring and most of those savings came in the second half of the year. And we realized that in the first half of the year. And I think we've also been very purposeful about how we phased our investments. So, we were purposely phasing those in the second half of the year. And some of those investments will start to ramp up a little bit in the second half. And then of course, inflation is just higher than what we had initially incorporated into our initial guide. And I think those are all the pieces.
Patrick Decker: Yes, I think the only thing I would add Scott is that, I think, probably the most important thing is the read-through is how we see margins in our backlog. We are looking at very high backlogs here. The margin looks very encouraging, very sound, taking a consideration, pricing, the mix, et cetera. So, it sets up well for even more for 2022 and beyond. And as Sandy said, we are making some investments here in the second half as you would expect it to do. I mean, we always do, but we were purposeful in how we phase those into our outlook.
Scott Graham: Patrick, do you mean that the margins in the – first of all, Sandy, thank you for that clarity. That was great. Patrick, do you mean margins in the backlog are up versus the first half gross margin?
Patrick Decker: What I'm saying is margins will continue to continue to be accretive coming to the backlog.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: End of last year you guys were talking things seemed pretty positive around some movement in emerging markets. And things sound like they are going okay so far, year-to-date. But I wonder, you mentioned some site access issues broadly, and some other – some of your peers are experiencing similar things. So, what about some of these countries that are maybe less vaccinated, do you think puts a pause in what you're seeing? Do you think there might just be a lag there before we start to see some of that?
Patrick Decker: Sure, yes. So, I mean, you're absolute, right. We are a very global business. And so, we monitor this whole issue of not just the most recent variant, but the pandemic overall very closely. And we've not seen any meaningful change in customer demand. As a result of that obviously, we continue to take all precautions to keep our own people safe, to respect our customers’ protocols. And I'm very, very proud of the work that the team has done from the very get-go. I mean, first quarter of last year, we saw first in China and it's hard to believe now, we’re year and a half on. But our teams are very disciplined around this. Really, I mean, despite the sharp deceleration in India in the quarter because of the Delta variant there, we still saw very strong growth in emerging markets collectively. China, most notably, but Eastern Europe and others are performing extremely well. So, we're keeping a close eye, but again really haven't seen any meaningful impact as of now on the Delta variant.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes. Interesting. Okay. And then just probably it's been an active year for M&A. I'm just wondering what's the latest with you guys on that front? It definitely seems like you're in a strong position to make a move if you'd like to. So, any sort of update there would be great?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So, again, the pipeline is very active and attractive pipeline. And again, it's a combination if we – I always bring it back to what are we solving for with M&A. And so, we look at it first by end markets in terms of what we're trying to build out in our offerings for customers. And then I look at it and we look at it from a technology and kind of application standpoint. I’d say on the utility side we will continue. Certainly, second half of this year and onward, we will continue to look at and do bolt-ons and tuck-ins from a technology standpoint around, out that utility offering and feel very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline there you know. We talked a lot in the past about industrial. And certainly, that continues to be something we were very interested in and we've got an active pipeline there. As I always say, it takes two to tango. And so, we can't control the timing of when these things happen, but we continue to cultivate those opportunities. And then there are other verticals, I mean in commercial and resi lag that we certainly keep on our radar screen a look at. So, we feel good about the pipeline. And you will see some things there that we'll continue to do on the bolt on front, and we'll continue to cultivate some of the larger opportunities here over time. We're going to continue to remain disciplined on valuation. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other questions, we certainly are open to using our stock as a currency where it makes sense. So that will not be a disabler, it's an enabler when and if that makes sense to do.
Andrew Buscaglia: Got it. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Andrew.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
Patrick Decker: Hey Joe good morning.
Sandy Rowland: Good morning Joe.
Joe Giordano: So now it's one question, huh? Okay. All right. Yes, so just like with Delta, and, of course, you touched on this earlier, but are you hearing just on the margin, you said orders are kind of getting released because of site access, opening back up. How you like doing the risk internally of that being walked back by your customers a little bit with like actually in requirements, having that issue and like?
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, it's definitely something Joe. I mean, my comment, when I say, we're monitoring closely, we'd rather this far, we've not seen meaningful impact. You're absolutely right, to remind all of us and we certainly are on top of it that we don't take this for granted. And I think again we do build contingency plans into our thinking here as a leadership team. Unfortunately, we've had too much experience in dealing with this over the course of the last year and a half. And weathered it well. But we just, all I'm saying is we haven't seen it yet at this point in time. And obviously we are we are being very vigilant. We are encouraging vaccinations within our own team, we are doing the face masking, we continue to maintain all necessary safety protocols within our own operations. And again, very much respecting the wishes of our customers. I would say that one of the, and you've probably heard this elsewhere, Joe is, at least from a deal flow standpoint, I think, we've all kind of learned how to negotiate these projects and do these deals without being in front of each other all the time. I don't think that's going to change dramatically. To your point it really is. But when the deal actually has to get executed and something gets implemented and installed, yes, we keep our eyes wide open for that. But again, we've not seen any impact on that certainly as of now,
Joe Giordano: Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jake Levinson with Melius Research.
Jake Levinson: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Jake. 
Jake Levinson: Just had – well, I mean, I think, it's pretty unusual that we're talking about having your working capital improve at these levels in the middle of an upcycle. So maybe you can parse for us what's really driving that certainly not the first quarter we're saying that. But is it lean manufacturing, is it restructuring, is it the supply chain initiatives really just any color you can provide there would be helpful?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the team is doing really good work, keeping their eye on the ball of working capital. And that's one of our key KPIs that we monitor very closely throughout the year. And I think it's really, it's all aspects of working capital. So, our credit and collections team, is doing a really good job driving down the past due. So, we're seeing good results there. On the inventory front, we'd actually like to carry a little bit more inventory right now to manage through some of the supply chain challenges. And we had actually built into our plan building up a little more inventory. But the reality is as soon as we are getting that in, it's going back out the door to meet demand, which is a good thing. And we have an active supply chain financing program that helps us take advantage of our strong credit ratings. And we're seeing good adoption with some of our suppliers onboarding into that program. And that's giving us some benefits. So, it's really across the board. And we're going to continue to drive it through the rest of the year.
Jake Levinson: Thanks, Sandy. I appreciate the color. And I'll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Jake.
Operator: [Indiscernible] Andrew your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I think it's the afternoon now. How are you guys?
Patrick Decker: [Indiscernible]
Unidentified Analyst: Can you give us more color into your applied water business? I think it is your only segment in terms of revenue that's now decently above pre-pandemic levels, at least on a quarterly basis. I know residential smaller than commercial residential seems to be driving quite a bit of strength. So how sustainable is that? And then in commercial, it does seem like your commentary regarding commercial recovery, especially in the U.S. has changed significantly for the positive. So, what are you seeing there?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, I'll – let me take the first piece, and then I may ask you to repeat the second part of your question. On applied water, I would remind everybody that it is predominantly a GDP kind of business. I mean, we're confident that we can outperform that and grow faster than GDP. But what we're seeing right now is obviously a fair amount of reopening activity. And so, some catch up there. Obviously, it's a short cycle business. So, as we've gone out with successive price increases there has been some pool in buying there, no doubt. But we do feel good about the momentum. I would say also one of the things that we're very pleased about there is the team has made an increasing number of investments in new product development in that business to refresh some product lines. And so, we're seeing the impact and success of that and we're going to continue to make those investments really focused on things like energy efficiency as one example. But again, I think that it's a similar rebound right now that we're seeing from previous downturns, on a global scale. So, feel good about it, I think, it's sustainable. But again, that really would explain to here in the immediate term what that stronger demand is. And again, we expect that to continue through the second half of this year and into 2022.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, Patrick, I was just – the second part of the question was around commercial specifically. I mean, it does seem like your commentary has turned more positive here. Obviously, we're all worried about the virus. But anything specifically that's changed in your business over the last quarter or two?
Patrick Decker: Yes, that's okay. Thank you. So, if I took them at first in the U.S. our replacement business, which is our book and ship, is very solid there. And we do expect new commercial building to be a bit soft through 2021. So that's not really driving our growth here, it really is a replacement piece. You may have heard us say before, when we talk about commercial, we talk about the institutional sector of commercial, not so much kind of the pure non-res. And that outlook actually is improving. And we think that will further improve just based upon some of the discussions like infrastructure spend, et cetera. We've also seen a healthy activity in Europe where we had double digit growth in the first quarter. That's come from some modest share games as well as we believe the resilience of our supply chain versus some of our peers. And again, really focusing on new product launches it's tied to things like smart drives, again, eco-friendly products being launched, the whole energy efficiency play that we're trying to get ahead of in terms of impending regulations that are coming forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, Patrick. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Just one will be about software in your M&C business. Can you give an update on what the demand picture looks like in terms of digitization, virtualization from the utility sector of vis-à-vis software solutions?
Patrick Decker: Yes, certainly, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day with real hard specifics and numbers around that to dimensionalize kind of where we see the conversion kind of pace being within the utilities specifically. But we are encouraged by the adoption there. And that is not only a U.S. phenomenon, we're seeing that in Europe in the emerging markets as well. And it really is – I think what we see it's tied to most importantly is around affordability. So, as our utility customers are looking to deal with these challenges in front of them around again, scarcity, water equity, building resilient infrastructure, it always comes down to how they're going to pay for it. And that's where we're really getting most traction right now is whether it be around reducing the initial capital outlay because of smarter infrastructure, whether it be reducing things like water losses which is immediate revenue generation for them. Those are the areas that we're seeing most traction right now in that dialogue. And we're seeing some of those pilots that we we've been talking about the last year or more really converting now into sustainable revenues. So absolutely interest, absolutely adoption wish it was even faster. We'll have more to talk about that in the Investor Day.
Pavel Molchanov: Thank you very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor to Mr. Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, thank you. Again, thanks for all of you for your continued interest. We look forward to our Investor Day on September 30. Again, as I mentioned, Matt and the team will be getting the details logistically out to you very shortly. Meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And we wish you all the very best. Talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. Your may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Xylem First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations.

In the appendix, we have also provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We announced earlier this morning that our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations on orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies. Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter, with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets. Orders were up double digits in all 3 of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically. Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year-on-year, and with momentum up strong sequentially. U.S. demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%. Alongside top line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion. I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020. Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Therefore, we are raising our full year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS. I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. The first quarter was clearly a meaningful step forward. The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets. Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year, with performance better than our expectations across the board. Strong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery. Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%. I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%. Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all 3 business segments contributed double-digit order gains. Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. Looking at the key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%. The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%. And geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year. The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance. EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation. Please turn to Slide 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe. Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies. Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets. By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential. Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior year COVID shutdowns as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margin grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively. The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity. And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects. Segment backlog is up 29%. As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement, but finished flat year-on-year. Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business. In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half. Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively. Modest price realization and strong productivity savings as well as a prior year warranty charge more than offset inflation. Now, let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations as well as our historical seasonality patterns. Managing working capital remains an enterprise-wide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6x at the end of the quarter. Now please turn to slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already heard about our emerging markets teams exceptional first quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively. Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight. In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth. But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us. Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in Water Infrastructure. And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher growth nations continue to urbanize. We expect emerging markets overall will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy. Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated endpoints. Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic. We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio. In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks. All of these projects deliver network-as-a-service, software-as-a-service and advanced analytics. In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning. And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with ESRI. ESRI is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short. These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment. By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability. And with last week's agreement, Xylem and ESRI are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together. Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world. We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together. Turning next to operating discipline. Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations. As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost. And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions. In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation. The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%. Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover. That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors. Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation. Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time. The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability. I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020. However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability. As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our Signature 2025 sustainability goals. We'll be those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June. We'll be reporting, for example, that in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways. Now the report is largely retrospective, but of course, we continue to move forward. In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance. It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives. Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team. That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose. With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck. The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes. First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits. On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and OpEx needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there. On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again. Before I move on from utilities, let me briefly touch on the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan. We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure. More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets. We are encouraged by those possibilities. But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations. Please turn to Slide 11. The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market. We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all 3 of our business segments. We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth. And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares. Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals. And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year. Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged. We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits. We are gaining share in Europe on healthy demand, and the U.S. replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021. In residential, we now anticipate high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half due largely to prior year comparisons. Now, let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid to high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from low to mid single-digit growth previously; mid to high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single-digit growth; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid single-digit growth. While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points. This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation. Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward. Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment. We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, and therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%. This includes high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low teens growth in Applied Water and mid-single digits growth in M&CS. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Xylem is clearly in a strong position coming out of Q1, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and beyond. Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth. Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion. And a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy. More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today. The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever. Not only it is critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity. From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future. In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term. We look forward to providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our next Investor Day, which is currently planned for September 30. It will most likely be a combined virtual and physical format, but we do hope to host as many of you as possible COVID restrictions permitting. Matt and the team will follow up with more details as soon as they're pinned down. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have. So operator, please lead us into Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Congrats on the incrementals. Good to see, for sure. I'm not sure, Sandy, if you mentioned anything about price. I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks. But is price generally up with your cost structure? Is there any color you can give us there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, sure, Scott. So I think you're asking specifically about the first quarter. If we look at our first quarter performance around price, it's basically flat. It's slightly positive and very much in line with our expectations. We did go out with a price increase, but that was back-end loaded in the quarter. It didn't take effect until the back half of March. As -- we're not unique. We're seeing increased inflation headwinds. And so we do expect to see more realization on the price front as the year unfolds. We do have a second price increase that will take effect later in the second quarter. And that actually was a higher price increase than what we went out with earlier in March. So.
Patrick Decker: And Scott, from our past experience, the teams are doing rather good job on making sure the pricing sticks. So we get pretty good realization when we go out with these price increases. And I think the market is clearly expecting something from us and our competitors.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then it sounds like this quarter, at least, you have a lot higher confidence on the meter deployments. Is it -- has visibility -- is it -- clearly site access is an issue kind of everywhere still. But is the increased confidence more around the efficacy of vaccines and some reopening in developed markets? Or is there other -- any other factors that you want to discuss?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think, Scott, I'll look at the data, right? So very encouraged about the projects that we have lined up from a deployment perspective. As we kind of track, we book an award. It goes into our backlog. The next phase is that we receive tangible orders from our customers. And then you start to see it reflected in our revenue. And so we're kind of at that middle stage now. If you look at our orders performance in the quarter, within M&CS, we're right about 20% orders growth year-over-year. And a big piece of that is the large project deployment starting to convert into tangible orders, so.
Patrick Decker: And we saw -- Scott, to your question, it absolutely is being driven largely by sites opening up, not everywhere. But part of that is, again, the vaccine being distributed. I think part of it is just growing confidence in the part of the utilities to move forward with these projects. And that's also what drove our strong order growth and backlog growth in dewatering that we're seeing at this point in time is site access.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I would like to talk about guidance and some of the embedded assumptions here. First of all, I fully recognize it's a first quarter, and you guys don't typically boost guidance. So that's for starter is different. And we certainly recognize there's lots of COVID uncertainty still. We're early in the year. But -- so it really does flag the just the questions about component shortages. And the second quarter guide looks fine. And just that looks perfectly fine. So you're probably pretty locked in, in terms of visibility on the component supply. So is this a second half component supply? Just a risk? And maybe you can give us some more details about what particular components? I know it's probably changes day-to-day, but just as it stands today, which ones are -- where the supply chains are more stretched in a meaningful way?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Sure, Dean. Let me start with some color. First of all, we think that our team did a really good job in the first quarter in meeting supply in what was a challenging supply chain environment. We feel like we're in good shape for Q2. And we're continuing to monitor the situation for the back half of the year. It's a fairly dynamic situation. And we have certain components, microchips that look good and then that can change and then we solve that problem. So it's a dynamic situation. Our team is on top of it, very focused on it. We've worked -- we work closely with our contract manufacturer partners, and they're very plugged in and larger than we are. And so we think that provides some protection. But having said that, it's a risk item for the second half of the year. And so we want to be measured and watch how this unfolds over the next 90 days. And next time together, we'll come back to you with an update.
Patrick Decker: And this is -- Dean, as you well know, this is happening across our sector, especially in the metrology piece of the business. But it's broad -- it's widespread across the sector. So it's not really creating any competitive pressure right now. It would be a matter of -- if we had shortage, things would move to the right in terms of installations, et cetera. So we're not seeing that as of yet. But it certainly -- if it's a risk, it would be a risk in the latter part of the year.
Deane Dray: That's good to hear. And so certainly, that's helpful in terms of the assumptions. And then the second question is a broader discussion around the ESRI partnership because it really looks like this has significant implications and expanding your offerings in smart water, especially applications using artificial intelligence in this -- the launch project with the utility that you cite, the water main feature. So just talk about specific applications? What does ESRI bring to the table? A little more color about this utility deal using AI for water main monitoring? And then any color on the economics of the partnership? Is this shared economics? And how is that structured?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So on the -- in terms of what problem are we trying to solve for here? Particularly with the utilities, we already had some of our businesses working with ESRI. That was our pipeline condition assessment business, the formalin is pure as well as was water, which does a lot of the kind of valve pipe replacement work for utilities. And so really building off of that long-term partnership, but really expanding now across the rest of our portfolio that is sold into the utility. So it really is about harnessing the power of the geographical data that ESRI has -- they've got a very large share base of utilities around the world. This is not limited to a U.S. opportunity. We think that the power of the collective. I know they are very, very excited about working with us because what they don't have right now -- we don't have access to the weather data they do. At the same time, they don't have the deep subject matter expertise of being able to advise the utility on how to use this data to go address pipeline issues or water treatment plan issues, whatever challenges that utility may be facing and that's what they're looking for us to really bring in. And they see it's the power and breadth of our portfolio since we're not limited on a few offerings in terms of equipment. The case study example of the 1 utility that we talked about in the Mid-Atlantic, we help them reduce their non-revenue water through a 4x reduction in pipe failures. And that 1 project is going to end up cutting their pipe replacement cost by $70 million. On the commercial side of the relationship, I'd rather not get into details on that right now. We can perhaps cover that maybe at our Investor Day later in the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Patrick, you mentioned that China was up 90%, I think, year-over-year. So while it's an easy comparison versus last year, I think you had a 36% drop. I do think you put your business there well over where it was pre-COVID. So can you talk about what is going on over there in terms of your penetration to that market? You mentioned strength in transport and treatment. But maybe you could talk about how much is just more awareness about water sustainability, your own sustainable growth strategy? How much that's helping you in emerging markets? And what it could mean for Xylem's underlying growth moving forward?
Patrick Decker: Yes, sure. Great question. I would say that -- you're right, part of the growth in Q1 is an easy comp, but we are expecting double-digit growth for the full year in China. It's really -- it's broad-based. It really is cutting across each one of our end markets. So it's not limited to treatment or transport or utilities even -- part of that is, again, there has been improvement in China in terms of side access, kind of an opening up more broadly of the economy. And so we see that investment flowing. From a long-term perspective, there really are -- we see a couple of key drivers here. The whole focus on sustainability and environmental impact by the central government there, which has been part of their long-range plan for a while now, is driving real investment, and we see that in our bidding pipeline and our project backlog. Secondly, it is really being driven also, from a competitive standpoint, by all of the work that we've done over the number of years to localize our supply chain as well as strengthening our engineering capabilities on the ground there and our selling capabilities. We've got a great team there, and we've got a quite strong brand name actually across China, especially on the utility side.
Andy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then, Sandy, just following up on Dean's question. It looks like your implied incremental margins in the second half of the year are quite a bit lower than Q1. We know you have more difficult comparisons in the second half. But is your second half guidance reflecting just conservatism regarding the component shortages we just talked about and price versus cost? And would you say -- would you just be careful about how we model M&CS margin improvement given those issues?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So good question, Andy. I think first of all, when we went out with our guidance for the full year of 2021, we did expect that the margin expansion would be stronger first half, second half. And there's multiple reasons for that. So starting with the restructuring actions that we took in 2020, we realized about $70 million of restructuring and structural cost benefit last year. About $50 million of that was in the back half of the year. And we're calling for about $60 million of restructuring savings in 2021, and that will be more front-end loaded. So 2/3 of that should come in the first half. So you have a little bit of a difference from a timing perspective on the restructuring side. And then the other thing is some of our discretionary costs. We took out about $60 million of discretionary costs last year. And in our plan, we have about 40% of that returning. That actually was a tailwind for us in Q1 because we've had travel and other items going on last year in Q1. That will start to flip in the second half of the year and become a headwind. And the other area, I think that it's really important is, we've strategically staggered the timing and phase, the timing of our investments. And so those are to support our growth platform. So things like building out our digital platform, continuing to -- we just talked about the emerging markets. We're expanding our channel in the emerging markets. We're continuing to focus on localization. And so those investments will come in higher in the second half of the year. And I think the new thing is that inflation and -- has continued to tick up. And while we're taking pricing actions, they don't always perfectly offset from a timing perspective. And certainly, we're watching the supply chain constraints closely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Patrick, I'd like to start off with a comment you made in your prepared remarks talking about network-as-a-service. I know you guys have been testing various business models around that area. Has there been some movement on potentially putting Xylem's balance sheet to work a little bit more to transform the business model around how some of those things work? Any comments you can give around that initiative there?
Patrick Decker: Yes. We do a combination of structures. And these are not actually for us, large-scale investments that are required. So I wouldn't want to spook anybody on the call thinking that when we say we'd be using our balance sheet, that we're talking about something larger than what it actually is. These are rather small investments in a network that we can make. And it oftentimes happens when maybe there's a consortium of utilities where on their own they can't really afford it, they don't need to have it, dedicated to them. So we will make the investment, and we'll lease it back to them. It does address the affordability issues for the utility for the customer. But that's not the only model we do. I mean there are customers that literally make the investment themselves. And so, two different models there. I would say we're still in early-stage of scaling. And again, we'll have -- we have much more to share there in Investor Day in September.
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. The next one -- my follow-up question then on productivity. I think productivity in the quarter was 510 basis points, which I don't think I've seen a number that high out of Xylem before in that category. Can you talk about what exactly goes into the productivity bucket? And what drove such good performance there in the first quarter?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So we've put a number of things in that bucket. And first of all, I need to give a shout out to the team because the performance in the first quarter was exceptional and stronger than what we had modeled. So we put things in there like our continuous improvement activities that take place in our manufacturing centers and within our supply chain. We also put our procurement negotiation upside that comes through productivity. That kind of offset some of the inflation headwinds that we're feeling as we're able to incorporate things like value engineering or better designs for existing products. Our restructuring savings were a contributor this quarter as well. That was about 100 basis points, purely restructuring and other structural cost savings, takeout was another 100, 150 basis points. So it's really a combination of a number of factors, and every -- all parts of it contributed this quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: I think you slides in Q&A, have been very comprehensive. So I just kind of have a couple of bigger picture questions. Patrick, you talked earlier about the sort of tech to M&CS side of the business. And I understand that smart water is sort of an irresistible theme. But M&CS, it's kind of lagged the growth and profitability relative to other parts of the portfolio. You're not alone in that. We've seen that from some other peers as well, where sort of the more boring business, if you will, actually outperforms some of the sexier stuff, if you will. And what are your thoughts on that? And to what extent can we conclude from that, that maybe boring is good in mature markets with good channels that are established or good? And how does that inform your M&A mindset going forward?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So obviously, we love all of our businesses. So I don't consider them being boring. But I know that's a bit tongue and shake on your part. The -- but if we think about our -- kind of our core businesses over the history of Xylem, we continue to invest organically in those businesses, and we've done some small tuck-in bolt-ons like in treatment, et cetera, as well. But we're increasing that investment in the second half of the year to where about 2/3 of the investment that we're going to be making in the second half is weighted towards kind of the core equipment product offerings that we need to do. The remainder really being in more the digital side. From an M&A standpoint, we are open. We evaluate opportunities across the spectrum for each one of our businesses in this segment because, hereby, it's really important that we maintain and extend our market share leadership in those businesses and not be purely fixated on just what's going on within M&CS. So that's a big theme across the company right now. In terms of the dynamics of slower ramp in top line growth and margin expansion in M&CS. I know we said this before, and you began to see that here in the first quarter. That really is a function of timing. I mean as these large deals begin to get deployed over the course of this year, second half and then next year and beyond, you're going to see that turn, especially when we look at it from an EBITDA standpoint relative to the rest of Xylem.
Ryan Connors: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second one was, again, another big picture question, Patrick. You're an important kind of voice in this industry. And I want to get your response to something as it relates to federal dollars, right? So we've seen some great progress in the last decade on full cost pricing by local water systems. We've seen great progress on consolidation and acquisitions by investor-owned players who are great customers for you, as you've demonstrated in your past Analyst Day's and so forth. So my question is, to what extent does a big infusion of sort of no strings attached to federal money into that sector put those sustainable drivers of full cost progress and consolidation at risk? In other words, you throw a lifeline, they don't have to increase price, they can even lower price, they don't have to sell through investor-owned. What are your thoughts on that and the risks associated with federal money coming in, in a big way?
Patrick Decker: Yes. It's a great question. And the answer right now is no one really knows because nothing has been approved yet. But I think directionally, as you well know, historically, CapEx in the U.S. water utility space, which is really what we're talking about is more on the CapEx side, has not been funded by federal legislation. And so if this pilot money comes through -- I mean quite frankly, on a relative basis, right now, the number is around $110 billion, I believe. That to me personally is underwhelming relative to the price tag of the rest of infrastructure was being kicked around. And so I think by the time you spread that out across the utilities in the states or at a local level, I don't think it's going to put as much pressure on utilities, as you pointed out. Moving away from otherwise progress they would be forced to make to protect their investments. So we'll see when we get there. That's not the rumbling that we're getting. I mean we stay close, for example, to NACA, which you will know is the North American Clean Water Association. And that's one of the questions we ask of those large utility players, is what do they think about the proposed bill? They're encouraged, but they're not making any plans based on it right now. I mean not at least widespread.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: I think we've spent a fair bit of time on the chip supply chain issues, but obviously, there's plenty of issues in sort of basic commodities as well. I was wondering if you could just discuss any sort of material pressure you're feeling from steel or copper or anything like that? What your sort of sourcing strategy is? And if we should expect any sort of impact on your margins from that?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So thanks for the question, Connor. We're feeling -- it's something that we're watching closely, both from an inflation perspective and a shortage perspective. Particularly from a shortage perspective around resins and plastics, we think that the storm that took place earlier in the year in Texas put some pressure on the global -- on the supply chain. And our teams have been working at that, and I think they've been making good progress. And so when it comes to plastic shortages, we feel good about the supply that we've secured for the second quarter. And I think we're in a good place from a momentum perspective. Still work to do, but those are kind of resolving themselves in a favorable way. We're seeing inflation in copper, aluminum and steel. And that's an important part of why we've gone out with the second price increase in the second quarter.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Understood. So I think in the bridge you provided, it seems like price-cost is pretty neutral thus far. I mean I think you were guiding the full year to be marginally dilutive. Any updated thoughts on that? Just how you're thinking about all those different moving parts there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think that hasn't changed. But when you incorporate the productivity that we're going to continue to drive out of our manufacturing sites and within our supply chain that will be on the positive side of that.
Patrick Decker: And I think partly what we're really suggesting here is the uncertainty continues around the supply chain, in areas that -- it's moving around, and we've just gone out with price increases, and we have another one being rolled out. So we really want to see how that sticks and how that plays out as we get through Q2. And then we'll have a better view on the second half at that point.
Connor Lynagh: Yes, understood. I guess where I'm ultimately driving with this is you're starting from a very nice place on margins, particularly in the Water Infrastructure and Applied Water businesses. It doesn't sound like you're seeing anything right now that would suggest we should assume an abnormal seasonal trend, which usually is a positive one. Correct?
Sandy Rowland: No. I think if you look at what we implied through our guide, you'll see margin expansion in the second half compared to the first half. So we are -- I think we're off to a great start. And we're -- on a quarter -- on a sequential basis, you should see margin expansion in the second half as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Just a follow-up on your pricing commentary. You talked about this other price increase in the second quarter. But given your strong orders and backlog, how do you think about when you actually see the benefit of this price increase?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. I think that's a good question. There have been some orders that have been placed to take advantage of pre-price, before the price increase takes effect. And so that's why what we've modeled is that we'll see greater price realization coming in Q3 and Q4 as we work through the existing orders that are in backlog.
Saree Boroditsky: And then it looks like the 25% order increase in Applied Water was partially attributed to extended lead times in North America. How should we think about the impact of this? And how is underlying demand trending?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So first of all, with 25% year-over-year growth, there is definitely an uptick in demand. And so we can't dismiss. We think that there was some placement of orders a little bit earlier than normal because many, many companies are dealing with the supply chain constraints and shortages. And so customers want to get -- they want to be first in line to protect their supply. But net-net, very good performance. We're seeing good recovery on the industrial side. Residential remains strong. And commercial is starting to come back, particularly outside of the U.S.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt.
Scott Graham: Sandy, complements on your handle over the details, just really impressive. I'm hoping to maybe tap into that a little bit more on the productivity. I know some questions have been asked around the productivity of 510 basis points. Certainly, we know that discretionary was a little bit additive within that. And so structural, you said 100 to 150. But or that still leaves a lot of just sort of core productivity improvement in the quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can kind of take us underneath that a little bit and what that would look like for the rest of the year?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. So if we look at Q1, what we're seeing is about 70 basis points from -- came from what we call continuous improvement. And that's hard work that takes place day after day in our manufacturing centers. And then our procurement organization delivered about 220 basis points of savings this quarter, which was a really good number. And so I think that's a high number. But net-net, this productivity element is a core part of our planned margin expansion for the year, and we're very glad to start seeing it right out of the gate.
Scott Graham: So you think that, that -- you just laid out, that 300 is sustainable for the rest of the year?
Sandy Rowland: The -- our full year projection around productivity is right around 300 basis points.
Scott Graham: Okay. So then that would imply that, that comes off a little bit in the second half. I understand.
Sandy Rowland: The first quarter was very strong.
Scott Graham: Yes, get it. This is one for you, Patrick. I didn't hear mention of AIA. Just maybe you can kind of -- assuming you still called that. But kind of give us sort of what was the sales growth? And what you've called AIA? And what is the thinking for the full year?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Matt, why don't you go through the numbers, and I'll talk about what we're seeing in terms of just momentum in the business. And we have -- I mean we still show it that from a reporting standpoint as AIA within the M&CS segment. But from a branding standpoint, we now refer a piece of that, which is the pure digital as Xylem view, which is our consultative business. And then we have the Pipeline Condition Assessment business, the artist formally known as Pure that's in there as well. So, those are two very different businesses, and they're now run separately. We saw nice momentum in both businesses. Matt can share the detailed numbers. But really good look at bidding activity on the digital side, order growth, backlog growth, margins, strong incremental margins on that business. So that team that we set up last year really is beginning to get some big traction now, not just with utilities in the U.S. but also across emerging markets in Europe.
Matt Latino: Yes, Scott. I would just say, looking at it in a whole, right, in terms of AIA, we've been down a little bit in the first quarter. Most of that is pure because seasonally, this is usually a slower period of time for them, doing a lot of that in-pipeline assessment service work. It's harder to do, as you know, in the lot colder freezing temperature. So down a little bit. That was expected. They both are kind of on target for what our plan was. That will ramp. We're seeing good activity, good interest, bidding around both of the businesses. Some good orders, good momentum on the BU side. And we'll have more to share about that digital strategy and the component that is view at Investor Day. But I think importantly, too, it's also their synergies with that view business into other parts of the business. And so for example, we highlighted that Greensboro win that we had this quarter. And that is an AMI deployment, but it also comes with some digital components in terms of pipeline condition assessment service, on the water piece. So it addresses nonrevenue water. And also our Valor analytics technology that goes at the meters that need to be replaced and targeted first to address. So both of those are in that deal. It's nice to see that bidding and scope work getting expanded.
Patrick Decker: And I would say, Scott, it was those digital capabilities that were, in some cases, the distinguishing competitive advantage that really kind of helped get it across the finishing line.
Scott Graham: Yes. That was something you've been talking about for a while, Patrick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I just wanted to maybe talk about M&CS for a second. It's the only segment that isn't getting a bump up in the outlook for the guidance. So just trying to understand how much of that is just project timing and visibility not having improved or changed much versus just building in more risk for supply chain issues? So maybe the puts and takes there as you thought about providing the updated guidance here? And if it is some of the latter. I know you talked about this a little bit, but what specific actions are you taking to mitigate? Are you adding new suppliers? Are you building inventory? I just want to better understand kind of what the situation is there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Good question. I think from the orders growth, if we did not have supply chain constraints, we would have likely increased the guidance there because the large project deployments, which is a core part of our plan, are coming through in line with our expectations, and our customers are ready to go, which we're very, very encouraged about. But the situation on the electronics components is very, very dynamic. And so we want to continue to monitor and see how that plays out over the next few months. And we've taken extra inventory where it was possible. It takes a little bit of time to substitute parts out and get those certified, but that's something that our team is also working on. And I think we're not alone here. So I think this is well understood in the industry that there's a shortage of microchips. And so far, we've kept everything up and going, and we're going to keep fighting.
Patrick Decker: Yes, we have been -- I mean we have been working to qualify additional suppliers. But the predominant work that's been done is to work closely with our largest contract manufacturer, which is Flextronics. And obviously, with their large procurement capabilities in the mass procurement they do, we've got a really nice partnership with them, and we've been able to make sure at this point that we're getting our fair share of the components that are out there despite the shortage. And we just got to stay close to them and keep working that through the year.
Brian Lee: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for you, Patrick, and I'll pass it on. Just a high level, big picture outlook for M&A. You guys obviously have a very healthy balance sheet, sticking to the free cash flow view here for the year. Generally, what are you seeing in terms of multiples out there? Are there -- is there anything more attractive in the context of your stock having done well over the past year? And then just what focus areas or holes you might be looking to address in the portfolio here?
Patrick Decker: Yes. No, thanks. M&A is clearly an important piece of our long-term strategy, and so we continue to actively cultivate the pipeline. It is a very robust pipeline. It's very active. We would really be focused on further strengthening our digital platform, really diversifying some of our end market concentration. So as we said before, perhaps something in the industrial water space. And then, of course, as I mentioned earlier, always look at opportunities to strengthen our core. In terms of valuation, we have seen some multiple inflation there, but really tends to be around things in the digital space of scale. We've not been actively participating in some of those deals have been announced here recently because we like the portfolio that we've got. But we're always in the game on those in terms of looking at it. But we do want to be disciplined on valuation. What I would say is I acknowledge your comment and that is we've got a strong balance sheet, our equity is a valuable currency right now and both of those give us, we think, relative advantage to bring some of these differentiated assets into our portfolio. There is a reminder that we've got this $600 million note that's due in early Q4. So we -- that's not going to constrain us. But as you all are modeling cash and balance sheet, just make sure that you keep that in mind.
Operator: We have reached the end of our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining and for your continued interest and engagement here. Really appreciate the support. Look forward to seeing you again on our next earnings call, but also at our Investor Day, September 30. Matt and the team will be reaching out and coordinating with all of you to make sure that we get that scheduled for you. And so in the meantime, again, have a great remainder of your spring and summer. Stay safe. Stay well. And all the best of your families and colleagues. We'll see you soon.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt and good morning everyone. As you'll see from our release this morning, the team delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum entering 2021. Every segment and every end market made considerable gains on a quarter sequential basis. And for Xylem overall, the team outperformed expectations across the major metrics, those being revenue, earnings, and cash. As the year came to a close, we took full advantage of stabilizing markets. Both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water Systems showed quicker resilience than anticipated, and we also affirmed our growth trajectory in Measurement & Control Solutions. Building on the large project wins we talked about last quarter by adding at headline AMI deal in Houston, Texas. We also gathered pace with our industry-leading digital portfolio, as the pandemic accelerated customer adoption of digital transformation. The revenue in orders trends both improved significantly. One caveat is that orders were still down slightly due to the scope reduction in a previous large win in India. Otherwise, orders grew in all three of our segments. Xylem's large installed base of core products and established markets provided exceptional resilience on underlying demand for essential services. At the same time, our global presence allowed us to capture the benefits of early recovery in places like China, which grew 18% in the quarter, and also in Europe where we grew 6%. As a result of that positioning on a large and resilient installed base combined with a vibrant growth platform, we enter 2021 with healthy backlogs. They are up 16% overall and up 30% shippable in 2022 and beyond. We know growth rarely happens in a straight line. And clearly the global challenges of 2020 put a hedge on year-on-year numbers including margin, but I am very pleased with how we respond to given these conditions. We took quick action on spending and on structural cost and we also made significant productivity improvements. As a result, we returned to progress on margins in the third and fourth quarters, although we didn't entirely offset COVID effects. Our supply chain execution in-store we cut customer served pandemic and we help them to deliver the central services their communities depend upon. Our operational discipline delivered favorable bottom line outcomes even in unfavorable market conditions strengthening our financial position through the year. The team corrected for the volatile conditions so quickly that in fact we delivered free cash flow conversion north of 180%. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by early signs of market recovery. The ramp up of vaccinations offers hope for an eventual return to normalcy. But we're not there yet. We are still in uncertain times, but we have nevertheless in our 2021 in a very strong position, and we are on course to capitalize on our increased competitiveness, financial strength, and commercial momentum. With that, I'll now want to hand it over to Sandy for more detail on how our segments performed.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically versus the same period last year. That performance exceeded our expectations with upside in all of our end markets and geographically strong growth in China and Europe. I will touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments, but in short, utilities and industrial were both down 3%, commercial was flat and residential was up 15%. We also saw a quarter sequential improvement in orders. Organic orders were down 1% in the quarter as we delivered a second consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. This result most notably reflects the return to growth in M&CS orders, which delivered double-digit gains, including the large win in Houston, which Patrick mentioned. Applied Water contributed solid mid-single-digit growth and Water Infrastructure orders grew mid-single digits excluding the scope production of a project in India. We're still negotiating with the customer, but felt it was most prudent to reflect the scope production now. Otherwise orders growth would have been high single digits for Xylem overall. With orders accelerating and several large contract wins contributing to double-digit growth in backlog, we have good visibility of future revenue streams heading into 2021. I'm very pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline. Fourth quarter operating margin and EBITDA margin of 13.8% and 18.8% respectively are above our forecasted range. Compared to the prior year, lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partly offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. I'll review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.81 due to higher than forecasted revenue and earnings and from a lower tax rate due to favorable jurisdictional mix. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 16% organically versus last year. As I mentioned a moment ago that decline was driven by the descoped India project, otherwise orders would have been up mid-single digits reflecting healthy momentum in the segment as a whole, particularly in the wastewater utility businesses. Notably treatment was up 10% as wastewater utility CapEx budgets continue to show resilience globally. Water infrastructure revenue was flat organically in the quarter. Modest growth in wastewater utilities was offset by modest declines in our industrial businesses. Geographically, results were mixed, the U.S. was down high single digits, while Europe and emerging markets were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. These results generally reflect the stage of COVID recovery in each region. Operating margin and EBITDA margin for the segment were down a modest 60 to 70 basis points respectively. Significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation, the recognition of reserves, and negative mix from declines in our U.S. dewatering rental business. Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 4% organically in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets, partly offset by modest softness in the U.S. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter, mid-teens growth in residential was offset by softness in industrial, commercial revenue was flat. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. was down mid single-digits as COVID impacts drove declines in the industrial and commercial businesses, offset by that strong residential growth that I just mentioned. Europe delivered high single-digit growth primarily driven by good pace in commercial and modest growth in residential. Emerging markets were down low-single digits. Softness in industrial markets in the Middle East were partially offset by strength in the residential and industrial markets in China. Segment operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 90 and 170 basis points respectively. Volume declines in the industrial end market and overall inflation more than offset solid productivity gains, favorable mix and some price realization in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS orders return to growth in the quarter, up 13% organically. This was largely driven by double-digit growth in both water and energy. Orders in our test business were up low single-digits. Revenue improved considerably on a sequential basis from the mid-teen declines we experienced in the second and third quarters. This quarter we finished the quarter, down 5%. While our core U.S. metrology business continued to experience COVID-19 related softness. The largest decline is related to the timing of project deployments. Large scale projects that were in process, pre-pandemic in both the U.S. and the Middle East have been completed. And new projects, which are part of our backlog have been temporarily delayed due to site access restrictions. We expect that large project deployments will resume towards the end of the second quarter and further accelerate in the back half of the year. These declines were partly offset by high single-digit growth in our analytics and advanced digital solutions businesses. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits for the reasons I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down double-digits due to the timing of prior year project deployments in the Middle East. And Europe grew double-digits from demand in the test business and from the start of the Anglian Water metrology project in the UK. Segment operating income and EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 330 and 350 basis points respectively. Lower volume inflation and favorable mix were partially offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. I was particularly pleased with our strong cash performance for the year. We grew free cash flow by 5% for the full year, exceeding our pre-pandemic free cash flow outlook and delivered free cash flow conversion of 181%. Our team has been focused on driving continuous improvement on working capital for a number of years. In the difficult operating environment of 2020, they took that work another step forward finishing at 17.6% of revenue. This is a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts and reflects the team's progress in managing inventories and driving solid improvements in accounts receivable collections. We benefited from favorable timing related to the settlement of restructuring tax interest and payroll liabilities, some of which will reverse in 2021. Our balance sheet is well positioned and includes a $1.9 billion cash balance. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. As a reminder, we'll take advantage of our cash position to repay one of our senior notes amounting to $600 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we announced an annual dividend increase of 8%. This is our 10th consecutive annual increase.  Please turn to Page 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to look forward at 2021.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. 2020 reminded us all that it's prudent to be humble about the fidelity of our foresight. When COVID first began to spread around the world, we said we would focus on managing what we could control. While maintaining our investment for growth and that's exactly what we've done. So with 2021 still presenting some uncertainty, we will apply the same kind of focus that guided us throughout 2020. In our earnings call almost exactly a year ago I said that I expected operational discipline would be a key capability for us. I couldn't have anticipated then how much we do benefit in that capability. When 2020’s big challenges arrived the team delivered on cost, on working capital, on free cash flow and on driving commercial value from our large installed base. We're still in a challenging environment. So we'll continue to face spending until we further see improvement in our markets. We'll keep executing the structural cost program begun in 2020 which is going to deliver savings through 2021. And given some of the inflationary headwinds, we're already seeing we are redoubling our efforts to manage the price cost dynamic. We're keeping a very close eye on our supply chains and proactively managing potential inflationary and logistics impacts. Despite varying by market and geography, there are clearly opportunities for growth in a recovering environment. In digital transformation, the pandemic demonstrated the imperative of operational and financial resilience for utilities which is precisely the value proposition of our advanced digital solutions. Pre-pandemic the business case was already very compelling. But as utility operators work heroically to keep essential services running the stresses of the pandemic made it clear that new approaches are required. Remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly, continue to see increased demand. Backlog in our advanced digital solutions grew 70% year-on-year. Although it's from a small base the trajectory is clear. It puts us in a very attractive position as we grow not only in software platforms, but in all of the digitally enabled parts of our portfolio. Geographically, India and China will continue to drive high growth. Despite experiencing COVID earliest impacts China actually grew last year. And in the three years leading up to 2020, India and China post a combined average annual growth rates in the double-digits. With localization strategies well advanced in both countries. Our China and India teams are set to continue delivering impressive growth. It's also worth mentioning a very solid financial foundation underpinning our growth with the current cash balance of nearly $1.9 billion capital deployment is clearly top of mind for us. Even with some debt repayment during the fourth quarter that number still offers a lot of capacity. Alongside organic investment M&A remains a top priority and we intend to be proactive in our deployment of capital wherever the investment case warrants. We remain disciplined about valuations, but we do see opportunity for additional investments over the next 18 months. Growth is also important to our creation of social value. We are in the very privileged position that sustainability is baked into our business model and strategy. Our portfolio of solutions has a net positive impact not only a water, but on a wide range of sustainability outcomes. We took several bold steps on sustainability in 2020 most notably, our Green Bond offering. And performance across these metrics continues to put us in unique leadership position both in the water sector and more broadly. The team's progress has strengthened our position on a number of sustainability indices. We were recently added to Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index. Despite that gratifying recognition, we have so much more work to do to achieve our 2025 sustainability goals and to deliver on our mission. I'm now going to turn it over to Sandy to provide end-market and segment outlook.
Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020 utilities have been reassuringly resilient down only mid single-digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still our outlook for 2021 reflects a tempered view that utilities have not seen the end of the pandemic impacts quite yet. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow in the low to mid single-digits in 2021. We expect that same growth rate on the wastewater side as utilities continue to focus on mission-critical applications. And we expect modest recovery and OpEx growth on a global basis through the year. In the U.S. wastewater CapEx is likely to be down modestly. However, the decline should reflect postponements rather than reductions in projects. As you would expect, we’ve kept close to our utility customers to understand how they are thinking about budgets and funding for this year. And while some uncertainty remains the deepest concerns have largely abated since the low point of the pandemic. On the clean water side, we anticipate mid single-digit growth as I mentioned, large project deployments should begin ramping again from the second quarter, accelerating through the end of the year. The large multiyear metrology deals that we won in 2020 set us up for solid growth this year and beyond. In industrial markets, we've seen good sequential improvement. Short cycle orders and project activity are definitely beginning to pick up, but are still likely to be limited by COVID impacts in the near term. We expect industrial to be flattish to up low single-digits. Our commercial end market outlook varies quite a bit by geography. The U.S. will continue to be sluggish. Europe on the other hand, should continue recovering although none at the double-digit pace we saw in the fourth quarter. And overall, we anticipate the commercial market to be flattish to down slightly for the year. On Slide 12, you will see that we are reinstating annual guidance. While uncertainty remains especially regarding the timing and cadence of recovery. We are confident our team will deliver results in line with the following framework. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows, low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in wastewater utilities being partially offset by flattish performance in the industrial markets predominantly in our dewatering business. Low single-digit growth in Applied Water, while we see pockets of recovery in this segment globally, particularly in residential, the outlook for growth in the commercial building end market is more muted. On top of that, our exposure to North America is heavier and the region has lagged on pandemic recovery. In measurement and control solutions, we expect mid-single digit growth. Customers indicate project deployments will likely resume late in the second quarter and further accelerate through the second half of the year. We also expect to see our test assessment services and advanced digital solutions businesses building on the momentum they delivered finishing 2020. While we have typically provided you with both the adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins in the past, you will notice that we are increasing our focus and reporting around adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this measure more accurately reflects the cash performance of our businesses and will enable us to more transparently report margin performance after M&A without purchase accounting impacts. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 40 to 140 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we expect to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% up 70 to 170 basis points. This predominantly reflects the benefits from our restructuring savings combined with volume leverage and favorable price mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.60, an increase of 14% to 26%. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be in the range of 80% to 90% following free cash flow conversion of 181% in 2020 and 124% in 2019. While we continue to drive continuous improvement, we expect to see increases in working capital as we returned to growth and some of the timing benefits we realized in 2020 related to the settlement of liabilities will reverse in 2021. We believe this is purely a dynamic related to 2021 and we expect to drive 100% cash conversion in 2022 and beyond. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. One key item that I do want to draw your attention to is foreign exchange. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. FX can be volatile and so and FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix, which will help you if we continue to see variations in the rates. Now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate that total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This includes low single-digit growth in Applied Water and low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure. M&CS is expected to decline low to mid single-digits as we anticipate continuing delays from COVID before projects begin deployment in Q2. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14% to 15% representing a 170 to 270 basis points of expansion versus the prior year with the largest expansion coming from M&CS due to operational improvements and a prior year warranty charge. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We recognize both the marketplace is stabilizing and that is still like would be unsettled for some time. But we come into the New Year, with good momentum and an even stronger position emerging from the pandemic then when we entered it. That position is built on a durable business model. We have vital products at the heart of essential services and we have differentiated technology that provides a multiyear runway for attractive growth. Our mission has perhaps never been more relevant and our underlying investment thesis remains robust. Our near-term performance is delivering results and we continue to invest for sustainable growth. That's in line with our long-term strategy to create both economic and social value for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We'll provide an update on our key strategic priorities and our long-term plans at a virtual Investor and Analyst Day planned for later this year, where I look forward to sharing more detail on our technology and solution capabilities and to discussing our growth strategies. So now operator with that, we'll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Let's start on the M&CS side, margins up a little bit as you work through the year here. I mean, as we get through next year, feels like there's a correlation with how margins are tracking in the deployment curve. So when you take all the cost efforts that you've done and you get towards some normalization as you get these deployments out? Is that point in time, you're thinking about, whether it's 2022 kind of timeframe getting back to that normal range, you've been in historically or are there other factors that will play that can move that around and just kind of latest greatest thoughts on that side?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Mike thanks for the question. Obviously, as we work through the pandemic, the M&CS segment was our segment that was most impacted. And we saw that with steeper revenue declines which also impacted the margins. The business team took strong action throughout 2020 to make structural cost saving changes that are permanent. And we think that as we move through 2021, that is a segment where you're going to see the largest part of our margin expansion. And Mike, you're going to see that right from the get go out of the gate. When we look at Q1 that's also the segment that's going to have greatest margin expansion. And that comes from operational efficiencies from the restructuring, as well as we did have a one-time item last year.
Patrick Decker: Yes, Mike, we've got a number of these large deal deployments. I think recently we've won as much as north of $300 million of large deals in 2020. Those are going to begin to ramp as site access returns and we just continue to have some really good commercial wins here. And when I say good meaning they come with very attractive accretive margins in those deals.
Mike Halloran: So basically what I'm hearing though is, as you get those deployments out and you get to a more normalized site access, there is no reason to think that normalized range for M&CS is back on the table, whenever that time period started?
Patrick Decker: That is correct.
Mike Halloran: Okay.
Sandy Rowland: Mike, the one thing that I would add as we look out through 2021, you're going to see the strongest performance in Q4 from a margin perspective. And at that point in time, we would expect that we will be back at 2021. I'm sorry, we are back at 19 margin levels, and will be on good pace for margin expansion.
Mike Halloran: Great, that's helpful there. And then second one on the capital deployment side, obviously highlighted M&A and focus on that, maybe just talk about the actionability of the supply - of the funnel right now, and if there is really any change to the focus in what you're interested in bringing in relative to what's in that funnel?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So Mike, no real change and our focus areas in the M&A funnel. I mean we've got a number of kind of smaller bolt-on tuck-ins that we'll be executing this year, but we are staying very close to a couple of larger actionable items as well. So again, we've got a keen eye on valuations and we do understand the value of organic growth, and again we're going to continue to remain disciplined. But we're optimistic.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with some of the dynamics within the business. And Patrick just give us some sense of that change in scope on the India pump order, things are changing really fast there. I get it there and basically crisis mode, but just what went on there and what's the outlook because there is still so much to do there in India. So start there and then some color on that Houston project please?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So I'll let Sandy take the Houston project question, I'll focus here on India. So, we still remain very positive on India, Deane. We've seen double-digit growth the last few years, we've got a great backlog there. Obviously the top policy mandate by Prime Minister, Modi continues to be the case there. This was a unique descoping on one project, where it was a little bit driven by an element of nationalism and so we are still going back and negotiating on that. We don't see that as part of a broader trend, it was very unique, very localized in one particular state, and again we just want to be appropriately conservative to reflect a reduction now in our orders. We'll see how it plays out, but no change in our view at all, Deane on India.
Deane Dray: Great. And I know - go ahead Sandy on Houston.
Sandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks Deane for the question. This is another project that we're very, very excited about, and it builds on the $250 million of awards that we announced earlier in the year. So this deal is about $40 million deal, it's primarily a water deal, and it's with a really powerful water utility. So it's one that we're quite pleased to bring into our backlog.
Deane Dray: How much of the digital offerings is embedded in this - the Houston project. I know its meters, but anything else that you would highlight?
Patrick Decker: Yes, Deane it's an AMI deal, it is new, it is a share gain for us and displacing someone that was there before. And so it will fit in that digital landscape as you think about the communications offering from FlexNet on the Sensus side.
Deane Dray: Great. Patrick, it looks like you're exiting the year with more momentum on your digital offerings, and this was the expectation that the reaction of the utilities and coal that was, they didn't need to do more remote monitoring, they didn't need to do more automation. And so just, your sense of that demand are we seeing what inning are we so far in this - what I think is a big conversion here on digital?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I think it's, we're still early innings here, Deane, I would say there are two dynamics at play. One is as you pointed out, the utilities are moving now from these things being nice to have, the must haves especially with remote monitoring, restricted labor deployment capabilities, but secondly, we are in the early innings still in terms of, we put new structure in place for the last year, we put new incentives in place to really drive synergies more broadly. So it's not just about the artist known as Xylem view our digital revenue. It's also the impact that has on pulling through other deals, yes, Houston being a good example of that. We talked about Columbus, Winston-Salem late last year. So we're taking a broader view on this Deane and then just the digital revenue component. It really is the impact it has on our broader portfolio.
Deane Dray: That's great. And just last one for me is for Sandy, you've had the opportunity to be in the role now for enough time to maybe you can share with us where do you see yourself making the biggest impact, the biggest focus and maybe you can comment on working capital to sales, because it's been improving, but my sense is, there is still lots more you can do there. But I would love to hear your thoughts.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, Deane. Thanks for the questions. I've been here now for four months, and it's been really interesting, I think I'm still very excited about the opportunity for growth particularly by scaling our digital portfolio, and that's a journey that I think we're making good progress on, and very encouraged about the collaboration across the organization that there are digital opportunities that span the full portfolio. Also think your work is never done around continuous improvement and so there certainly is opportunity for us to continue to drive margin expansion, whether it's through conversion cost projects, further optimizing our footprint, there is opportunity there. Turning to your question on working capital, I think that the team did a terrific job on that this year, in years where your revenue growth declines, it's difficult to make improvements on a percentage basis, and the team did a super job on collections, bringing down our past dues, and we need to shout out and recognize our operations team on how they effectively managed and controlled inventory. So as we return to growth next year, working capital will be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to continue to drive continuous improvement initiatives whether it's scaling some of our financing programs with our suppliers and other efforts. But I think we're exiting in a pretty good spot there.
Patrick Decker: And Deane not to belabor it, but just to remind all of our investors that our three primary annual incentive plan metrics, our organic revenue growth, it's operating margin, operating income, and it's free cash flow conversion of which the single biggest driver there is working capital as a percentage of revenue. And so I just want to make sure we reminded all of our investors that we're not taking our foot off of working capital in any way, shape or form.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Patrick, so I think we can all understand why Xylem is performing so well in China, given the relative strength in that economy. But what's a little more difficult to understand is why you are performing so much better consistently in Western Europe, then you are in the U.S. I mean COVID interruption is in some parts of Europe it's just as bad as here. So what is it about your business that's allowing you to outperform in Europe versus the U.S.
Patrick Decker: Yes, I think part of this is a timing issue for the U.S. We're in the early stages of recovery there. It also is as Europe traditionally has been more stable in terms of how utilities focus on their spending and how they plan their budgets accordingly. We also benefit from a very strong share position in Europe. And so when that's the case, the level of aftermarket recurring revenue benefits us quite significantly there, but I wouldn't read too much into the - I wouldn't suggest that Europe is going to outpace the U.S. over time. I think really just more a matter of timing right now.
Andy Kaplowitz: That’s helpful.
Sandy Rowland: I mean, I would add to that is a little bit is mix to. So in Europe, our concentration is heavier on the wastewater side, and that has been especially resilient during the pandemic. And as we move through 2021, we are expecting to see progress on clean water, especially as we can start rolling out those deployments.
Andy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then this is probably for Patrick or Sandy, you talked about $80 million I think of permanent cost savings in 2021. There is $60 million of temporary cost savings that would come back in some way. Maybe you could talk about the buckets of savings that are implied in that 2021 forecast that you now have? What are you assuming for inflation, because if I look at the incremental margin that you're forecasting doesn't look like it's equal to gross margin even. So, there must be a sizable inflation component in there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, so I think there is multiple elements to that question. Let me try to break it down for you in a couple of different - pieces. So I'll start with restructuring. This year, we did take aggressive restructuring actions and we realized about $70 million of savings from those structural programs. As we look forward into 2021, we're expecting a similar level. We have some further programs in Europe that haven’t been completed yet both related to footprint migration as well as overall efficiencies. But we do certainly expect to get those done in 2021 and that will help us from a year-over-year perspective. Discretionary costs is another bucket that we are focused on and as we look year-over-year we took about $60 million of costs out from discretionary categories like travel and entertainment, services, marketing et cetera. And our 2021 plan contemplates that about 40% of those costs will return. And then I would say that the third part of your question, you're starting to touch on inflation, which is probably the most challenging part of the equation. As you know we saw a very stable inflationary environment for most of 2020, did start to see that pick up at the end of 2020. And we're seeing that pressure continue in 2021. Our teams have gotten a little bit in front of that. So we have announced price actions that have been implemented in the first quarter, but the inflation around materials is something that we are watching very, very closely.
Patrick Decker: And I would just add that, we are clearly looking at the level of uncertainty here in terms of what inflation is likely to be. And we're trying to be appropriately kind of measured in how we are reflecting that in our guide for the year. This is not unchartered territory for us in terms of the whole price cost dynamic. We've been here before think back to the tariff timeframe. Our price realization we’re expecting that - along with productivity will offset material and labor inflation. We've got a very strong and proven procurement team and they are in lockstep with our commercial teams on making sure that we've got that that highlighted. So, again as Sandy said, we are already using pricing actions. The impact our different across each one of the segments based upon the impact on commodities. But we just thought it would be prudent to guidance we've done.
Andy Kaplowitz: And Patrick, you had 60 basis points in Q4. I would assume that you get a lot more price then that for 2021 there?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, I think that's a fair assumption.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Good, most of my questions have been asked, but if you look at your CapEx guide, looks like up about 20%. Where is the dollar - where is the money being prioritized maybe just some examples or projects or geographies or areas that you're focused on right now?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, thanks Scott. I think as we move through the pandemic, we certainly clamp down on our spending around CapEx in 2020 and our outlook for CapEx for 2021 is very much in line with our historical spend levels. I think that a lot of our CapEx deployment is tied to our growth strategies and we're making investments on the digital side. We're making investments in emerging markets. We're making some investments in our manufacturing centers to drive continuous in improvement. And so it's something that we're going to watch closely throughout the year and make sure we face that increase accordingly. As we see recovery will start to release incremental CapEx dollars to position us for growth in 2022 and beyond.
Patrick Decker: Yes, Scott I would say, I would just add to Sandy’s point we're going to continue to manage the phasing on CapEx. We’ll see how the year plays out in terms of market recovery. There is no one or two big bang CapEx projects that are in there. It's pretty well distributed and it very much is tied to growth. So, I would just reinforce what Sandy said it's localization within emerging markets. It's some upgrade in terms of continuous improvement in a few of our factories. But it also is a fair amount, tied to the work that has to be done to support some of the large deal wins that we have within M&CS.
Scott Davis: Okay, that's really helpful. And then I know working capital has been kind of beaten to death, but Sandy since you’re relatively new it's a fresh set of eyes on this stuff. Is there any kind of structural reason why? I always think of working capital being percent of sales kind of 14% or lower being, getting into the territory of the best run companies? Is there any structural reason why that number can be down towards kind of - as I said more best-in-class levels?
Sandy Rowland: I don't think there is any structural reason. I think, we're going to continue to work at this. And I think the company has made steady progress over the years. And it's definitely something that we're not losing focus on we're not satisfied, but we're going to continue to drive that journey.
Patrick Decker: Our biggest challenge Scott and it is kind of endemic within the water sector is. We still have work to do to simplify our supply chain and that has an impact on inventory levels. So I would say, if you look at our receivable performance. Our payable performance, we're pretty much in line there. There is some opportunity there, but it's not - that's not really going to move the needle. It really is structurally on the inventory side and that's work that Tony Milando and our supply chain team have been very much focused on it made good improvement but there still in my view a fair ways to go.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: A couple questions, follow-up really on the margin side of this. If I look at your guidance, the top end of revenue guidance and the top is about where you were in revenue in 2019, and the top end of the margin guidance is still about 100 basis points below where you were in 2019, $140 million of structural cost taken out of the business during that time, you said price and productivity offset inflation. So can you fill in the blanks there on where the gap is between where margins are expected to be in '21 versus where they were in '19 on roughly the same revenue level?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, I think Nate, you hit on a lot of the points there, and as we've modeled out 2021, we are modeling in good incremental margins through the portfolio. There is still some mix differences as we exit, M&CS has been a little bit delayed from a pandemic recovery perspective, and once we get that back on track and growing, you're going to see margin expansion ramp back up. I think the other thing is, we're continuing to make investments on the digital front, and those are prudent investments and we're phasing them throughout the year in line with the recovery, but I think that's probably the one piece that you may be overlooking in the model.
Patrick Decker: Yes, Nate, I think the other piece I would say is, it's really important to focus on and we can certainly get more clarity on this second half versus first half what the exit rates are in terms of both top line growth and margin. You're looking at the full-year or average.
Nathan Jones: I'll take that color then maybe you can talk about the differences in growth rates and margins in the first half and second half.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, let me take the first crack at that and then Patrick can chime in. I think as we think about the quarter sequential trends through 2021, yes, you almost have to think about how the pandemic impacted our businesses and regions throughout the year. And so I think right out of the gate in Q1, I think what's important is that we're going to return to growth and you're going to see meaningful margin expansion. From a margin perspective, the biggest growth happens in the first half of the year, because as you saw our margins were much stronger in Q3 and Q4 than they were in the earlier part of the year. And then I think as we focus and drill down on M&CS it's the deployments in the second half that from a dollar value perspective starts to accelerate, and as we exit 2021, again, I think our revenue and margin levels will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2019.
Nathan Jones: Do you think M&CS exit the year at double-digit operating margins?
Sandy Rowland: I would say it's probably more high-single digits.
Patrick Decker: Again we're talking operating margins.
Nathan Jones: Yes, yes, I think the lot of data in that one. Okay. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the previous question on margins for 2019 levels. I would have also thought you'd had FX benefit to margin. So you could just quantify how you're thinking about this?
Sandy Rowland: FX is one of our key variables and key assumptions and we've guided to a 1.22 euro to dollar conversion rate. I think the way that I think about FX in particular, is that the euro is the most important currency pair for us, and a 5% variation in the euro drives about $50 million of revenue and about $20 million of margin. So I think that's a good way to frame it.
Saree Boroditsky: Great, thanks, that's helpful. And then could you provide some color on what you saw in the dewatering business in the quarter and what is driving expectations for an acceleration through the year and should this drive improvement in the margin performance in Water Infrastructure as we go through the year as well?
Patrick Decker: Yes. We do expect the activity and dewatering to ramp in the second half of 2001. Part of that is we put some more sophisticated pricing models in place that are going to be driving high margin rental, because rental really is a key focus area there for us, it really also is tied to what we're expecting in terms of the North America, industrial and commercial business. We've seen quite encouraging performance in January with opportunities not only in the U.S. but also growing in Western and Southern markets. So we'd expect about flattish to low single-digit growth for '21 to your last point.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Yes, thanks for taking the question. You referenced the appetite for M&A, but you also said, you're going to be disciplined, and I suppose, as we're getting out of the crisis phase of the pandemic into a recovery, would it not all else being equal, make valuations in water tech even higher than they have been in recent years?
Patrick Decker: It depends on the sector within the water space. Obviously things that are of a higher digital nature that has more of a recurring revenue kind of SaaS nature of the model across any sector those are always going to have higher multiples and premiums. I think we're proud of the work the team has done in a number of these areas that we look at our relationships that we've built over a number of years. And so a number of these things don't actually go through an auction process. And that's really where I think the seller finds Xylem be an attractive partner because of our global breadth, our channels to market the breadth of our portfolio. And again, we tend to look at some of the smaller M&A to be really a proxy for R&D. And so, again we're going to be disciplined in this regard, but no, I'm still very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. But let me ask kind of a broader question. We're seeing or hearing lots of talk in Washington about infrastructure. And in Europe, the next generation EU has an infrastructure program as one of its components. Yes, I'm curious kind of - to what extent you expect as a company to benefit as these infrastructure stimulus initiatives begin to actually materialize?
Patrick Decker: Yes, so I mean we’re generally positive on the early indications from the new administration. Having said that, it's far too early to know anything beyond intentions and policy outlines we're not assuming. We're building into our forecast anything for an infrastructure bill, because we really need to see what ultimately is scoped in. But again discussions and indications on plans thus far do seem to include water as part of that focus, which we find obviously very encouraging. But our utility customers have also made it clear with us that they are not assuming or planning for it. And again they would say, we've seen that movie before with previous new administration that came in. But clearly, if and when we do see something on infrastructure that's going to be a big net positive for us. Given that our portfolio touches nearly all parts of the water cycle.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Patrick, you touched on M&A a couple of times. I'm just curious like MC&S is a business for you guys that you're trying to arguably make less complicated. And like how you feel about adding to that business and making it at least near-term more complicated?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I wouldn't look at it in terms of adding complexity to M&CS. I think - the way we think about it is, just adding to the portfolio of solutions that we can bring to most notably the clean water side of the utilities and so as we are in there and doing concentrated work. We continue to see areas of opportunity where we can bring more digital to the portfolio. So I wouldn't look at it is adding complexity, I take your point. Obviously, any time that we look at smaller start-ups that we add to the portfolio scaling them and getting channel to market. Obviously, is one of the big synergies that we bring, but we do that with great confidence.
Joe Giordano: And then last from me just on dewatering, can you just talk about what’s going on like underlying in that market. I know like there has been a lot of competition on the construction element, and you guys maybe trying to reposition out of that, maybe a little bit away from that into more like the mining and stuff like that? How is that playing out because I feel like they're - within energy and mining and you had to shutdown quarter with construction activity? So I thought the comps would be pretty good in that business just relative to like the flattish guide there?
Patrick Decker: Yes, yes I think you're right Joe. I think, we're expecting the business is going to start to come back and be positive for us this year. I think we're a little cautious on calling that. We have also seen that movie play out before. And so that's one that we'd like to see the activity really come back. I think - there is normal seasonality in some of the North America side in terms of weather and doing some of that construction and industrial activity. Part of its lagged a little bit because of COVID to Joe, because think about this as a very much a people-driven business, it's very much hand-to-hand out in construction yards and so forth. And so, as they're not able to get out onsite and do some of that work. Then there has been some noise there. We expect it's going to come back though here in 2021.
Joe Giordano: Yes.
Sandy Rowland: Yes, there still will be some pressure in Q1 from a COVID perspective, but in the second half of the year, we're expecting that it's more neutral.
Operator: Our final question is from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: A lot of ground covered obviously very strong cash performance in 2020. Just had a question about how to think about the absolute free cash flow for next year, you gave the conversion ratio. I think there, is usually some adjustments obviously to net income that you provide in the reconciliation? Is it as simple is doing the math on the adjusted net income or there are some items that we need to think about in terms of add backs when we do the conversion ratio?
Sandy Rowland: Yes, I think that we did give you an outlook on what we expect to spend from our restructuring and realignment perspective and we also provided you with the tax rate. So I think we've given you all the inputs to model. But I think big picture, if you look at 2019 through 2021. We expect free cash flow conversion to be 130% which is very healthy. I think there is - three discrete headwinds for 2021. The first one we talked about earlier on the call is as we return to growth there’ll be some add-back from working capital. We talked about resuming CapEx to be more in line with historical levels. And I think the third one is more unique to 2020 and 2021. And that is there were a number of liability categories that we benefited from the timing on. That benefit was about $75 million in 2020, two-thirds of that will reverse next year, but I think that's largely a one-time phenomenon. And so yes, 80 to 90 is lower than our historical target, but three years being at 130 I think is a good spot.
John Walsh: Great yes, no, that's very helpful color on those moving pieces, that's all I had. Appreciate you taking the question. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, John.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Thanks. So again I appreciate. We all appreciate the continued support and interest. Thanks for joining the call today. I want to wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. I know we’re already - it's hard to believe we're already more than a month into it. But again hopefully all your families and friends are safe and sound. Look forward to catching up with you and in our next earnings call. And as we said earlier, we'll be scheduling and planning an Investor and Analyst Day sometime later this year and we'll get back to you all on that. So, thank you all very much and have a great weekend.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-End 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope all of you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. As reflected in our release this morning, our third quarter performance was better than anticipated. The teams’ operational execution was strong right around the world. You’ll recall that after the low point of April, we saw sequential improvements in May and June. And we continue to build on that positive trajectory through the summer. Our team took advantage of the market regaining pace and exceeded our revenue and margin guidance for the quarter while generating very strong cash flow. This performance reflects the teams’ focus on serving our customers and managing what we can control, whatever the dynamics are of the macro environment. Through the quarter, we saw solid foundations of recovery in a number of places. And we’re well-positioned to further capitalize on that momentum. The pandemics impact hasn’t been uniform of course, conditions varied significantly both by geography and by end market. For example, China revenue returned to healthy growth of 17%. Western Europe overall was back to relative stability at 2% growth. The U.S. saw only slight recovery still dealing with pandemic response and coming in at down 11% although improving sequentially. In our end markets, we’ve seen ongoing resilience in the wastewater side of utilities and our wastewater solutions returned to solid growth in the quarter. On the clean water side, we’re delivering strong commercial momentum, including winning large long-term transformational metrology deals, leveraging our differentiated platform, particularly in advanced metering infrastructure. In addition to big wins with Anglian and in Winston-Salem, which we mentioned last quarter, the team recently won another marquee project in Columbus, Ohio worth $94 million. This customer is a combined utility meaning we will provide both water and electricity meters plus advanced software and services. It’s worth noting how compelling our value proposition is for combined utilities, addressing both water and energy applications with one portfolio and leveraging our unique FlexNet communication capability across both platforms to achieve economies of scale. The Columbus, Winston-Salem and Anglian deals have together added about $0.25 billion to Xylem’s backlog. Our metrology and communications offerings are clearly differentiated in their own right, but we also have the advantage of delivering unique value by combining infrastructure platforms with complimentary digital solutions. Each value proposition enhances the other. As anticipated COVID impacts are causing delays in some metrology projects where timelines have shifted to the right. And in parts of the U.S. replacement meter installations have been pushed out in the short-term. Pipeline assessment services of business that requires putting people on site has been affected by COVID driven restrictions on travel and field work. At the same time, the pace of interest in digital solutions for remote monitoring and automated operations have accelerated. The pandemic has not only spot lit essential services. It has also eliminated utilities need for much greater operational and financial resilience, which is now at the top of every utility operator’s agenda. Digital transformation has gone from being attractive to becoming an imperative and that’s reflected in strong quoting activity and our digital solutions business, which has also increased by 50% its number of revenue generating clients. The revenues are still a small part of our top line, but the acceleration of interest further strengthens our view on digital adoption in the sector. And as the number inside of this project growth, we are seeing a broadening scope of opportunities across software, services and infrastructure products. What we don’t expect this to be a straight line recovery Xylem is well-positioned irrespective of how the pandemic plays out. We anticipate quarter sequential improvements. Our financial health and liquidity are both strong. We’re successfully reigning in cost, executing the actions we announced earlier this year. And we’re shifting investment to adapt quickly to customer’s evolving needs and new ways of working. Our supply chain has been exceptionally resilient with the team keeping customer supplied even through the pandemics peaks. So we’re operating with discipline, strengthening our competitive position and helping our customers serve their communities with uninterrupted essential services, despite whatever macro uncertainty may persist. As Matt mentioned at the top of the call, both Mark and our new CFO, Sandy Rowland are with us today. Sandy joined us on October 1 and it’s been a great pleasure to welcome her to the team. But since Mark was in the chair through the end of the reporting period, he will carry the commentary on our third quarter performance. So Mark over to you.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5 and I’ll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue declined 7%, which was better than anticipated as we entered the third quarter. We had strong performance in our wastewater utility businesses in the residential end market both of which grew mid-single digits in the quarter. The return to growth in these markets was offset by the expected declines in our metrology project deployments and industrial and commercial businesses, which continue to be impacted by project delays and site restrictions. Geographically, as various countries have reopened and recovered, so has our business. In China for example, we saw very strong performance with double-digit year-over-year growth. Despite the China business returning to pre-pandemic growth rates, emerging markets overall declined 7%. India was down only modestly while the Middle East in Latin America declined double-digits, they continued to be impacted by shutdowns throughout the quarter. Across North America, recovery remains mixed. While revenues improved quarter sequentially, they were down year-over-year. While our wastewater business remained resilient, we continue to see timing effects on metrology deployments and softness in industrial markets. Western Europe grew 2% in the quarter as countries reopened in activity resumed with revenue growing in each of our end markets with the exception of industrial. We also saw operating margins expand quarter sequentially to 13%, which drove EPS of $0.62 both better than expected. I’ll cover the margin impacts by segment shortly. Overall, our teams maintained very sharp focus and executed well operationally by driving strong productivity and cost reductions. Please turn to Slide 6 and I’ll review third quarter results by segment. Water infrastructure orders declined 5%. Order trends in our wastewater utility businesses continued to be solid. Treatment orders were up 20%. Wastewater transport orders down 9% for the quarter would have been up mid-single digits, but for lapping the large deal we won last year in India. Orders in the industrial end market were soft due to double-digit declines in our de-watering business. Long-term backlog continues to build as we’re up over 30% for backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond. Segment revenues declined 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year. This was better than anticipated and reflects the resilience of utility spending to run and maintain their wastewater operations. Our wastewater transport business grew 4% in the quarter. And we saw continued strength in our treatment business, which grew 3% in the quarter. The growth in treatment reflects what has been to date, the relatively uninterrupted deployment of wastewater CapEx projects. The de-watering business experience continued softness. Revenues declined 14%, most of which was in the North American construction and industrial markets, which have seen – which have been significantly impacted by site closures and access restrictions. Operating margin in the quarter was 18.5% down modestly year-over-year from higher inflation, lower volumes and unfavorable mix. However, the margin performance exceeded our expectations as the team strong execution on cost reductions and productivity initiatives delivered 630 basis points of margin expansion. Now please turn to Slide 7. Orders in the Applied Water segment declined 1% in the quarter and revenues declined 4% as softness in the industrial and commercial markets continued, particularly in the United States and the Middle East. The commercial end market declined 5% in the quarter. As a reminder, this business is roughly two-thirds weighted towards repair and replacement work, which held up relatively well in the quarter despite shutdowns in some regions. Industrial was affected by similar regional dynamics, including site access restrictions and declined 7%. A bright spot in the quarter was residential, which grew 4%. We saw particularly strong growth across Western Europe and from China. Overall, emerging markets declined 8% in the quarter. China had a very strong performance growing 23% as the team executed well, delivering on pent-up demand. This was more than offset by the declines in the Middle East in Latin American regions due to the ongoing lockdowns. Revenue in the United States declined 6%, but improved quarter sequentially with some softness across end markets driven by continued virus impacts. Operating margin in the segment was 15.9%. Volume declines and inflation impacts reduced margins in the quarter, but were largely offset by 530 basis points of cost reduction and productivity benefits. Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 19% in the quarter and revenue declined 15%. We saw project timing significantly impact our metrology business. And COVID-19 restrictions push out our project revenues in our pipeline assessment services business. In metrology, we’ve seen relative stability in our OpEx replacement business from water metrology products. As a reminder, our OpEx exposure accounts for about 70% of our revenues. We’ve seen much more variability in the 30% of our metrology business that’s tied to large project deployments or CapEx, particularly in our gas segment, where project revenues were down 60% in the quarter. Here, we’ve been significantly impacted by project timing, particularly from lapping a large gas metrology project deployment, which was largely completed at the end of last year and delays in another large gas project this year due to home access restrictions. Despite, these challenges, our underlying North American water metrology book-and-bill business has remained relatively stable and commercial momentum in winning new projects remains robust. This is highlighted by the large contract wins we had in the first half of the year and continued into the third quarter with the Columbus, Ohio and Winston-Salem, North Carolina wins. Patrick already covered Columbus, but I’ll quickly highlight a couple of important points on the Winston-Salem win. This is a $60 million contract to provide water metrology products under our network as a service offering, leveraging our FlexNet communications network. Importantly, our teams differentiated the value of our offering by introducing several components from our digital solutions platform, enabling our customer to also seamlessly address critical needs around non-revenue water and their wastewater network. Our pipeline assessment services business has also been subject to significant near-term delays in project revenues, driven by COVID-19 travel restrictions and site closures. As a reminder, there are two businesses within AIA, digital solutions and pipeline assessment services. It’s in the latter business, where we’ve experienced deferrals pipe inspection work. And we expect those push outs to continue into early 2021. As a result, we booked an accounting charge reflect the impacts of those delays. We continue to strongly believe that the medium and long-term value proposition of this business is compelling. Particularly, as utilities move to address budget challenges by using pipeline assessment services to reduce future spend on pipe replacement. We expect the project timing for deploying new metrology projects and the COVID-19 related delays in pipeline assessment services to continue to impact us through the fourth quarter. This is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance, which Sandy will cover later, as shippable backlog for the fourth quarter is down roughly 25%. That said, it’s significant that we’ve not had any project cancellations. Rather, we’re seeing an acceleration of growth in our project pipelines and we continue to win large new contracts. As a result MCS shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up over 30%, which is a pretty good indication of the power we’re seeing with our digital platform. So while these projects aren’t currently reflected in the orders metric, they are the latest in a series of important wins that give us confidence in the medium and long-term growth profile of this segment. EBITDA margin in the segment was 14.8%. Year-over-year margin decline was driven by lower revenues of high margin North American metrology and pipeline assessment services, due to project timing and COVID-19. This impact was partially offset by 630 basis points of cost reduction in the quarter. Now please turn to Slide 9 and I’ll cover our cash flow performance for the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments and $2.4 billion of liquidity driven by a very successful green bond issuance last quarter, combined with our strong cash flow performance throughout the year. In the phase of substantial challenges presented by the pandemic, I’m very proud of the work of our teams in managing all aspects of our working capital performance. At quarter end, working capital was 20.3% of sales, representing an improvement of 30 basis points versus this time last year. The teams focus on working capital, disciplined CapEx spending and cost control through the quarter have continued to pay off, enabling us to generate free cash flow of $234 million. A conversion rate of over 200% in the quarter, which did see some benefit from favorable timing on payments, primarily related to taxes and interest. Before I turn it back over to Patrick, I’d like to take a moment to congratulate Sandy and welcome her as she steps into this new role. Having worked with Sandy previously, I wasn’t at all surprised by how quickly she’s come up to speed on our businesses in our markets and the pace with which she’s developed relationships, all virtually and taken on the leadership of the global finance team over the past month. I couldn’t be more confident about the future of Xylem or in Sandy’s capability to help Patrick and the team accomplish our mission and take the company’s performance to the next level. So with that, I’ll hand it back to Patrick for the last time.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. Before turning to our outlook, I just want to take a moment to reiterate two overall trends we’re saying, as we look forward. The first is the influence of regional differences around the world. As you’ve heard, we’ve already seen big distinctions between China, Europe and the U.S. in the third quarter. So long as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence demand, we believe those geographic effects will be considerable through at least the end of the year. Xylem’s global diversification puts us in a strong position as we serve the international markets that are farthest along in the recovery curve. It’s worth noting for example, that about 70% of our wastewater business is outside the U.S. The second overall trend to highlight is a shift of attention from reactive operational imperatives to medium and longer-term resilience. The pressures utility space at the beginning of the pandemic are well-known. You simply can’t stop providing an essential service, even if you’re struggling to [indiscernible] and more end users than usual or having trouble paying their bills. Our customers have come through the most intense part of the crisis, serving their communities heroically. It’s also been a wakeup call for the sector. Utilities leaders and operators have become acutely aware of the pressing need to invest in greater operational and financial resilience. Part of that investment will go to conventional infrastructure that will have to be combined with new approaches, if utilities are to address their overarching challenges, making the cost of infrastructure more affordable, extending asset life and dramatically increasing labor efficiencies while maintaining safety. So we’ve seen interest continued to ramp up in digital transformation, remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly. Of course, the implications of digitizing utility networks goes deeper than software platforms and our digital solutions business. Beyond software and end points, transformation also requires the digitally enabled pumps and drives that make up the backbone of a smarter network, which is why we are implementing an integrated digital strategy across our entire portfolio. We’re very excited about the opportunity of working with our customers to build the digital water and energy networks that will carry their communities into the future. Turning from those trends to outlook. In general, we have a much clearer view on Q4 than we had on Q3. We’re seeing stabilization in a number of markets. We have even greater supply chain confidence and we’re executing well on cost. All of which leads us to expect quarter sequential improvement in margins. So by end market, I’ll start with our outlook for utilities. The wastewater side has been exceptionally resilient. We expect OpEx to continue holding up well, given the need to serve as mission critical applications. And capital projects with secured funding continue to move forward. On the clean water side, as I mentioned, we have strong commercial momentum with multi-year projects like Anglian, Winston-Salem and Columbus, setting us up for healthy growth in 2021 and beyond. In the short-term, we expect performance trail wastewater due to more pronounced COVID impacts, but we’re not seeing structural changes in demand and the growth profile of the segment is expected to remain highly attractive. We simply anticipate some continuing COVID impacts on deployment timing. And standard meter replacements are likely to remain soft until physical distancing eases. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at industrial and commercial end markets, the accessibility of industrial sites varies widely by region, where COVID response has lagged. There have been site access restrictions and work has been deferred. So we’re still anticipating softness to the fourth quarter, especially North America construction and industrial markets affecting our dewatering business. And in commercial, it’s a mixed picture that varies by end customer. Demand and hospitals, data centers and apartment buildings, for example, is very different than for offices and hotels. But less building use overall and soft North America construction suggest continued softness in the near-term. Now I have the great pleasure of turning over to Sandy for the first time, so she can provide some more specifics on our Q4 guidance.
Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. I just want to kick off by expressing how excited I am to have joined the Xylem team. I joined Xylem because of the unique combination of strong commercial opportunities for growth and the compelling mission of the company. Xylem is also complimentary to my previous experiences, which has included bringing together cutting edge technologies with industrial products. I spent the last month getting up to speed with the team alongside Mark and I look forward to all we have ahead of us rounding out 2020 and beyond. With that, let’s get into a few more details on our fourth quarter guidance. On the top line, we expect organic revenues in the range of down 6% to down 8%. This is a modest improvement in sequential performance versus the third quarter. As we break it down by segment, we anticipate being down low single digits in Water Infrastructure, down mid single digits in Applied Water and down mid-teens in Measurement & Control Solutions. Reflecting the project deployment delays, we’ve continued to see through October. Operating margin in the quarter is expected to be in the range of 13% to 13.5% also a modest quarter sequential improvement. I also want to highlight a few full year items. We expect to end 2020 with free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for the full year. Restructuring and realignment costs are now expected to be between $75 million and $85 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, while structural annual cost savings remain unchanged at approximately $70 million. We’re lowering our estimated tax rate this year to 18.5% to reflect our updated mix of earnings. Before I hand it back to Patrick for some closing comments, I want to again, thank Mark for his guidance during this transition. Having worked with Mark before, I know he and I bring similar perspectives and share a common approach to operational excellence and driving investment in innovation to support sustainable growth. Mark has built a great team and I’m confident we have the organizational capability to focus to deliver. Now, please turn to Slide 13.
Patrick Decker: Thank you so much, Sandy. It’s great to have you on the team. Just to wrap up before turning the call over to your questions, the team continues to demonstrate strong operational delivery. And that will enable us to capitalize on recovery everywhere, it’s happening through the end of the year and beyond. And we will execute from a position of competitive strength, even in the more challenging environments. Our discipline on cost and cash will continue to pay off, both in the coming quarter and through 2021. Looking ahead, that quality of operational execution will enable us to continue driving sustainable margin expansion. Our robust financial health, which gives our customers confidence that they can rely on us in uncertain times is built on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation. Our leading market positions are paired with a differentiated product portfolio and a durable business model at the heart of essential services. And our strategy places Xylem and the lead as the water sector’s digital adoption curve accelerates, providing a multi-year runway of attractive growth. We will deploy capital to continue strengthening our portfolio, investing in the solutions and services that anticipate our customers’ needs. Both the economic and the social returns of those investments will be attractive over the medium and long-term. And our commitment, great value for all our stakeholders will continue to underpin the sustainability and resilience of our company, our customers and our communities. We’re now going to move to your questions, but first I need to mention that although Mark will be advising us through the end of the year, this is his last earnings call. So let me take this opportunity to say once again, as I’ve said before, that all of Xylem stakeholders have benefit profoundly from Mark’s leadership and tenure at Xylem, but none more than me. As I have benefited tremendously from his counsel. Thank you, Mark. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to your questions. So operator, please lead us into Q&A.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Okay. Yes, just a bit of a bad connection, perhaps, but anyways. Are you guys surprised if you can hear me, of course? Are you surprised by – okay, good. Are you surprised by the negative price the extent of it? I can’t remember a quarter or you had this big of a cost price dislocation. So perhaps maybe dig into that a little bit more.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Hey, Scott, it’s Mark. The price overall for the company in the quarter was 50 – up 50 basis points, so we continue to drive price. A lot of the inflation has been labor related and we had some very strong price increases over the past 18 months. And some of this is reflective of the demand profile in the market. So we continue to look to drive for price and get value for the products and services that we rendered, but it’s – we’re doing it all within the context of the current competitive environment.
Scott Davis: Does that mean, Mark, you’re seeing pretty our tougher price in the rental markets. Two, we’ve heard some competitors say, it’s actually been pretty stable this quarter. So I was curious to see what your view is…
Mark Rajkowski: It’s competitive in the rental market for sure. Again, some of that’s a function of the demand profile. And but that’s not – it’s not the only market. We’re seeing it in a number of areas, but our teams are out there being very thoughtful and certainly where there are opportunities to push on price, particularly where we’re differentiated they’re doing that.
Patrick Decker: Yes. I would say, Scott, this is Patrick. Price has not really been a concern of ours. It’s not really been a meaningful change in trajectory. Obviously, we’ve been thoughtful during the pandemic, but there’s no structural change here in terms of how we feel about price in the market. And I would say that, especially for us, we really focused in on engineered solutions versus commodity oriented offerings and where we have the more engineered solutions, we’ve built those into our base business, but also knew our contracts. And that pricing has remained a constant, in other words, we’ve not gone back and renegotiated contracts. We haven’t had people coming back to us asking for changes in pricing, given the pandemic that’s been very stable.
Scott Davis: Okay. That’s super helpful. Thanks. I’ll pass it on. Thank you. Good luck guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Wish Mark all the best and thanks for all your help.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Dean. Yes, you got cut off there a little bit. You’re a little choppy there, but I heard the last part of it [indiscernible] wanted to hear.
Deane Dray: Yeah, let me just say it, again. It just was also the welcome to Sandy. And appreciate all the color here this morning. This is the first question, and this is an important part of the theme for Xylem. Is this accelerated interest in smart water systems by the utilities? We also do water conference in September. We heard that directly from the utilities that we’re all saying this, you got to win in Columbus that’s impressive. So Patrick, the big question is how did this interest in quote activity start to translate into orders? We are seeing traction here, but if you can maybe give us some size, what the quote activity is, what the expectation is around the timing.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. Thanks Deane, and good morning. So yes, as we mentioned that at your conference, and I know many of the utility leaders spoke to this. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the utility leaders all that I’ve spoken to this. This has really been one of the silver linings of the pandemic as the amount of time that I’ve had with these leaders by Zoom and other platforms is they really – they have moved from a number of beads digital solutions being a nice to have to imperative. And just to reinforce, as I miss in my comments, the drivers behind that are the whole issue of them dealing with issues of how do they manage their assets remotely. How do they manage their workforces remotely? They are very much focused, especially, post-pandemic on this issue of portability. So and again, I remind everyone that only 30% of our utility exposure is in the U.S., it’s a very different kind of funding and economic dynamic outside of the U.S., whether it be in China and India or Europe. But here in the U.S., 70% of their funding comes from – 70% of their spending is on OpEx. And that comes from their existing rate base. When you think about the remaining 30%, which is CapEx that comes from new rate cases that need to be justified. So on the base case, on the OpEx, they’re looking for ways to reduce the operating expense, to extend the asset life of those assets, to do remote work. On the CapEx side, it really is about making those new projects affordable. So they can get rate cases approved. So anything that we’re able to do to reduce the cost of that new CapEx and make it more affordable is going to be even more important to them as they come out of the pandemic. In terms of – what we’re seeing in terms of proof points, we’re seeing that we’ve had a 50% increase in the number of clients. That’s one. We’ve seen in north of a 20% uptick in orders. So there is conversion there in terms of orders off of a small base, but a growing base. These typically are from the time that we get an expression of interest and we’ve seen a big uptick there, of course, with the 50% increase. It’s about a 12 to 18-month conversion on the digital side from – going from an expression of interest into – turning that into an order and then into revenue. But secondly, what I would say, most importantly here, Deane, is that it’s not just the digital component. It’s the broadening, it’s the opportunity that gives us to broaden the scope of deals that we would otherwise be negotiating. So some of the AMI deals on the metrology side, we would not have won them, if it were not for digital offering that we bring in compliment to AMI. That’s as important as actually going in and leading with digital and then pulling through AMI or also on the wastewater pumping side, the treatment side. So the synergies here from a pull through standpoint, go two different directions. It can be – we leave with digital, we help the utility, understand where their needs are. And then we bring in solutions behind that on the hardware and networking side, but it can also be where we’re already in there negotiating on the hardware side and the digital comes in over the top and differentiates us versus others. So that’s where we see the biggest opportunities going forward. And the expression of interest right now is absolutely accelerating based upon the economic challenges that the utilities are facing.
Deane Dray: That’s great to hear. And then just to clarify, I knew it was like a year ago, the focus was on pilot programs. And it sounds to me, some of those were revenue generating. But are you waiting for any of the pilot programs to convert to orders and where does that stand?
Patrick Decker: Sure, certainly. I mean, when we say that there is a 50% increase in client acquisition. Those are predominantly speaking to pilots. And so we continue to see pilots increasing now. I want to be clear, when we say pilots, these are revenue generating pilots. We’re not giving these things away. And I would say that again, that balance of interest is as much outside of the U.S. as it is inside of the U.S. So we’re seeing big uptick in China, India, Europe and then certainly equally as much in the U.S.
Deane Dray: Great. And I just had a follow-up question for Mark. Just didn’t want I think he was getting off easy. Decrementals were touch weaker than what we were expecting, and I’m just trying to bridge that difference. And did that include the charge that came through on the pipe inspection or just help us understand decrementals and then what you’re expecting for the fourth quarter?
Mark Rajkowski: No. That was on an operational basis. Now are you talking about Q3 or the Q4 outlook?
Deane Dray: Q4 outlook.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Yes. And so some of that is just a function of mix, okay, so we’re continuing to see impacts in several of our lines of business, whether it’s dewatering, whether it’s some of the pipeline assessment work or in senses that our metrology deployments that are higher margin that are most impacted from a mixed perspective in the fourth quarter.
Deane Dray: Got it. Much appreciated. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Welcome to the team, Sandy, and best of luck, Mark. It’s been a pleasure getting to know you over the last few years.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, same here. Thanks, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: I’d like to dig into MCS a little bit more here. You have a large domestic meter competitor, who put up some double-digit growth in the third quarter and was probably more bullish on the outlook. Less concerned about kind of project delays that you were talking about here today. I know you have other lines of business and a lot more international things going on in here. It sounds like the pipe inspection businesses is one of the worst ones. Could you may be digging a little bit more to the different pieces of MCS. What you’re seeing specifically on the domestic water meter business and how that outlook progresses
Patrick Decker: Nate, good morning. This is Patrick. So first of all, I think when you look at the – let’s take the metrology piece of the business first, which is opposite the lion’s share of M&CS. Because I think we can take digital solutions off the table. It’s trending very well, for the reasons that I expressed to Deane earlier. We’ll come back to pipeline assessment in a moment. Obviously, there we’ve had challenges in terms of site access. It’s not been an issue in terms of level of interest. The orders are there. The work is there. It really is literally a matter of getting access on the site, given the nature of the work that’s done there. So back to metrology, which is, obviously, the Sensus business there again on the, that kind of 70% to 80% of our business there of that revenue is again basically meter replacement. The day-to-day kind of installation of replacement meters. That business was down low to mid single digits in the quarter. And that largely was again, site access restriction, a big chunk of that and differentials between us and maybe others. Some are similar, some are different from a competitive standpoint. It really depends largely, where you are geographically. And so we’ve got a heavier presence in some of the larger metro areas, certainly here on the East Coast, where there’ve been tighter COVID restrictions and perhaps parts of other – the rest of the country. So we were down low to mid single digits in the Q3. We expect that business to be up low single digits in Q4 as site restrictions begin to ease, like, obviously, that depends upon this kind of next wave of the virus. So we keep our eyes closely on that. But right now in our assumptions, we expect that to begin to recover and see growth in Q4 and certainly into 2021, where it normalizes. It really the piece in Sensus that hit us in Q3 was the capital projects. These large deals that we won and executed last year, so one, we have a tough versus last year. Two, this year, we had some of the projects that we had already won. Think about fairly water, very large project, $100 million project. That has been shifted to the right. It’s not been canceled. It’s simply a matter of site access. And so we do see that coming back in Q4 and certainly into 2021. It’s also when you look at the – we had some delays in some of our gas project implementations, again, because of COVID. So a number of these projects that are pandemic related are still there. They’re going to be executed. They’re simply a matter of shifting out to the right, because of timing of being able to get people on site. When you look at, we also had – when you look at the backlog that we’ve got. Our shippable backlog for the metrology business for 2021 and beyond is up 30%. So this is not an issue of projects being canceled or projects being deferred with uncertainty, it’s simply a matter of site access. And so we’re very confident about that. When you think about the wins that we’ve got and Winston-Salem, Columbus, et cetera. That really speaks to the health of the market overall. The dynamic competitively is simply the fact that we have a larger project orientation of our business, because of the AMI deals that we’re winning versus a base meter replacement business.
Nathan Jones: I think that makes a lot of sense, and I would have expected you guys to have a higher share in more densely populated areas, where your site access could be different. All of the folks that we’ve talked to on the utility side have said that, the non-revenue water pipe assessment projects and the made a deployment are likely to really go unaffected. If you take it over a few quarter kind of timeframe, which would suggest to me that all this is doing here is really creating pent up demand. It’s going to be released here over the next couple of quarters. And should probably really all get caught up in 2021. This is not shifting permanently to the ride, it’s shifting the front end to the right, but the back end should be fixed.
Patrick Decker: That’s exactly what we’re seeing, Nate, and that’s exactly what I’m hearing from the utility leaders that I speak to is when you think about the long-term structural demands in the water sector around the issues of affordability of water, whether it be at the macro level, meaning at the rate case level, whether it be affordability at the end user, meaning a household owner. Those issues are becoming even more prominent, because of the pandemic, whether it be scarcity of water on the clean water side, whether it be the resilience of their infrastructure. What we’re hearing from the utility leaders is that it’s becoming even more prominent for them, coming out of the pandemic. The issue is simply depending upon where you’re looking around the country, because this really is more of U.S. phenomenon, the geographic differences are stark in terms of the approach to the pandemic.
Nathan Jones: I think that all makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the color.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Nate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks, Mark. And welcome, Sandy. My question, a bit of a bigger picture question. One of the kind of discuss the utility market from a different angle, in terms of the municipal utilities versus the investor owned utilities. I know, if you listen to the investor owned utilities, since this thing is a hit, they’re really now talking up the outlook for privatization, saying, that some of these more stressed local systems are really coming under financial strain, and that’s an opportunity for them to really accelerate their acquisitions and expand. And so I wanted to get your take on that theme, in terms of, A, remind us of your current customer mix between those two groups and how they compare in terms of pricing and margins and that sort of thing. And then B, are you seeing that, do you see that? And if so, would that be a good thing, a bad thing indifferent? What’s your take on that privatization angle here?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes. Great question. So certainly as you obviously will know the whole privatization debate has been going on for quite some time and it’s a quite contentious view within the utility space. And it’s always harder for the private utilities to do the consolidation than what they would certainly like. But we certainly see that has been a trend that is accelerating for the reasons that you mentioned in terms of some level of economic distress in the sector to be transparent. The private utility portion of our revenue is certainly far less than the public as you well know. And while we love our public owned utilities and we’ve got a great share there across the board. When – typically, we find that when utilities are privatized, it does become a slightly bit easier negotiation, because it’s then become – it comes down a bit more to basic fundamental economics, returns on investment. It’s easier to sell longer-term solutions into them, based upon the paybacks and financial benefits. That’s not to say that on the public side, it’s the exact opposite. That’s just – it’s a mix of utilities in terms of how they think about that. But we see that, Ryan, very much as a positive trend for us over time. But again, I wouldn’t want to parse between public and private as to whether one is good or the other one not. And I know you’re not suggesting that.
Ryan Connors: Sure. No, that’s understandable. But no, that is useful perspective. My other question is a little more tactical, but you mentioned residential as a tailwind in Applied Water and your release in your slides there, that’s not a market. You normally talk a lot about it and there was material enough that, that you did put it in there pretty prominently. Can you just remind us of what exactly you’re doing there and sort of the outlook and what the real materiality is there?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Hey Ryan, it’s Mark. And you’re right. That has not been a recent highlight. And but the business has done a really nice job in really upgrading, improving their product sets there. And the – what we’ve seen is that as more folks have spent more time at home, working from home. They’re spending more money on those homes, including well pumps and other products that, that they need to maintain them. So there’s been really strong growth, not just in Europe, but we’ve seen some pent-up demand in the Asia-Pacific region. And even in the U.S., we’re seeing improvements and expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. So it’s a function of just one of the impacts of the pandemic, but also importantly some nice improvements that our team has made to our product sets in that area.
Patrick Decker: Yes. So I would just add that, I think that again, this is Patrick, I would say to compliment what market indicated there, the team has done a great job of enhancing some of the product offerings. And we continue to build out that pipeline. But I would say this is a predominantly a short-term phenomenon. We don’t have a different look over long-term as to what you should expect from a growth standpoint in that business. I mean it really is kind of a low-single digit, kind of GDP, kind of business. In this quarter, it was predominantly driven by growth – outsize growth that we saw in Europe and in China that really spiked the numbers. And that was really the reason we called it out.
Ryan Connors: Got it, okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys.
Patrick Decker: Hey Joe.
Mark Rajkowski: Hey Joe.
Joe Giordano: Just wanted to keep going on the digital side here. I don’t think anyone’s really debating the how valuable those types of technologies are long-term to utilities. I think the value proposition is pretty clear. But when we were just recently serving utilities, we got a pretty clear response that like near-term those types of digital and technology investments were being de-prioritized, because of necessity and where they have to spend money. So like what are your thoughts on push outs or anything like for capital projects that are maybe signed, but not shows in the ground yet like, it seems like that stuff has more risk of being pushed like more meaningfully outward. Just kind of what are you seeing there?
Patrick Decker: Sure, Joe. So I – again I – as you know, I’m always prone to do here. Let’s first talk global. So again 30% of our utility exposures in the U.S. versus outside of the U.S., and so this is a global phenomenon, and we’re seeing even more, I’d say outsize interest in the emerging markets that’s the first point. Two would be in North America or specifically in the U.S., what we’re seeing there is, as we’ve indicated, we always view these projects as being, you do a pilot, it’s a 12 to 18-month conversion from the pilot into orders and revenue. And the way that we’ve structured these arrangements, where we’re leading with purely digital, where our team goes in, and they’re doing a diagnostic, a consultative diagnostic with the utility, that that whole thing, I mean it’s not a high cost venture for the utility. It’s to help them understand what are the needs they’ve got, where do they spend the next dollar of capital or OpEx going forward. And that helps inform them on how they can manage their OpEx and CapEx needs more effectively. And those situations, when we talk about pull through, that’s always going to be a 12 to 18-month kind of horizon. And we’ve got proof points of those already in hand. The other approach to selling is where a team is going in most notably when it’s an AMI metrology deal. And it’s a competitive bid and we’re able to overlay unique digital solutions, whether it be meter optimization, whether it be adding on leak detection where it’s a non-revenue water solution, these are the kinds of things that can oftentimes help us seal the deal. That’s the proof point there is the $0.25 billion of deals that we’ve gotten over the last quarter or two, where absolutely the digital piece of the offering was a proof point that helped secure that deal. So these are not high cost items for a utility as it relates to purely the digital component. It’s as much an enabler for them as they go forward. But no doubt in the immediate term, there are utilities that have had to make tough choices between the wastewater side, the clean water side is just a nice to have versus a need to have. We see that momentum accelerating. But as we said before, this is still a relatively small piece of our revenue and the opportunity is all in front of us.
Joe Giordano: Yes, I think that’s fair. Last question from me, just I’m pure and yes, I understand that this is like the most on, no one could have kind of budgeted or thought of what’s going on now. But we’ve had over the last few years write down to basically half the investment now. So just curious as to how that kind of informs the capital deployment decisions going forward and how you kind of evaluate new potential targets?
Patrick Decker: So I will – let me take that one first, Joe, and I’ll have Mark kind of walk through kind of the thinking behind the write down of additional goodwill, et cetera. Strategically our view on this business is we remain very bullish on this business. Again, when you think about the needs, the utility has around reducing their non-revenue water, a big part of that is leak detection. And so everything I’ve heard from the utilities I’ve spoken to is they absolutely see that as being essential, but right now again, it is site access. And when they have to – when you think about the nature of the crews that we deploy around basically brand name appear, the crews that we deploy there are traveling across state lines. They’re very technical. So we have to deploy them broadly. There are basic what’s – the requirements of being sequestered when you’re traveling state lines, I mean they’re very practical aspects of stalled of our workforce right now that nobody could have possibly imagine coming into this. But the fundamental needs remain the same. When you think about the fact that only – that market is only been penetrated by like 3% of the need, all that opportunity is in front of us. And it’s going to be even more essential coming out of the pandemic than it was before because of the whole affordability angle. I’ll let – so there’s no fundamental change in view on this business. In our view, in terms of how attractive it is. I’ll let Mark talk about kind of the accounting drivers behind why there was a second impairment on this.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, I mean – and I know you’re in a trained accountant by background. So you get all. This is really a function of as Patrick said, a significant temporary delay in the expected revenues to our pipeline assessment services business. So it’s more of a push out to the right by a couple of years. And when you look at this business, the margin – the gross margin profile of that business is greater than 50%. So really rich gross margins. So when those revenues push out, it’s – it has a big impact on the discounted cash flows used is determined the fair value of the business. And you’ll also – when we did our first write down last year about a year ago, you write that down to, you’ve reset the fair value and that’s fair value is based on these future forecasted revenues. So you really don’t have a lot of headaches. So when you see a shock like this from the pandemic, it has an impact in terms of the accounting. And as Patrick said long-term – medium-term, long-term opportunities in this business, we remain very positive.
Patrick Decker: And Joe, we take our nature on these things, whether it be from an accounting standpoint or an outlook perspective is we take a conservative approach on this. I mean we want to make sure that we’re write down the middle of fairway. We’re not going to move things around. And so we – the team felt it important at this point in time, given the shock of the pandemic on this particular business, most notably given its still based services aspect, that this was a – it was a responsible thing for us to do, but no change in strategic view on the assessment services business.
Joe Giordano: Two you, and Sandy look forward to it. Thanks guys.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.
Mark Rajkowski: Hi Andy.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Andy Kaplowitz: Patrick, you mentioned that your utility businesses more international than the U.S. So it was good to see Europe returned to growth and China was obviously very strong. But can you give us more color into your thinking about these regions going forward? Have you seen any curtailing of the momentum you recently had in Europe given the virus resurgence. Maybe any more color would be helpful.
Patrick Decker: Yes, it’s a great question. And thanks for the international thing given that the largest piece of that, that market for us. The – so we certainly – we just continue to see momentum building in Asia. And we feel, I mean, obviously who knows, I can’t prognosticate on the pandemic and where cases are going to resurge, et cetera. But certainly within Asia, we have no reason to have any concerns either in Q4 or going into 2021 based upon what we see right now, if anything, the pent-up demand, we got hit first earliest in Q1 and in Q2 because of our weighted exposure in China and India. And our teams have proven very resilient there as has the market. So that that’s agent, we would expect that to have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. With respect to Europe, obviously we like all of you are monitoring case count. We’re seeing what’s happening in the resurgence here for the last few days. There is uncertainty there. We feel that our guide for Q4 is a balanced guide, obviously, if there was disproportionate shock to the system that needs to be kind of factored in to our outlook for Q4. But our teams have been managing through this pandemic and the complexity of the pandemic for several months now. And one of the most important things that we’ve learned is really making sure that we have a resilient and robust supply chain. And it’s not just us, but the suppliers around us in the ecosystem. And so we don’t believe that there is a near-term meaningful impact on our business in the quarter around that. But there is uncertainty there. And so we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that, but it really is too early to tell at this stage. So we think we’ve taken a balanced approach to the quarter.
Andy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Patrick. And then just can you help us think about this probably for Mark or Sandy, the structural cost savings that you’re focused on and how that can manifest itself beyond Q4? I mean you already mentioned decrementals are still a little high in Q4 versus normal, but as you go into 2021, would you expect to see improved decrementals and/or incrementals given the level of cost out that’s ramping for you?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. And this is Mark. And the – for a couple reasons, one, we’ll see some ramping in terms of the structural costs into 2021.
Patrick Decker: Cost savings.
Mark Rajkowski: Cost savings, yes. And yes, cost savings. And then it’s early to call, but when you think about the costs that were going to be coming off and as we move through into 2021, that additional volume will certainly play well relative to the what will then be incrementals.
Andy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one final question. Your last question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.
Brett Linzey: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in guys. Hey just wanted to circle back to…
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: Yes. How you’re doing? And yes, Mark, congratulations on the retirement, and best of luck to Sandy. But just want to start with MCS.
Mark Rajkowski: Thank you.
Brett Linzey: Encouraging to see better engagement on the software and SaaS side, but just wanted to understand the profitability and monetization of that. Should we think of those opportunities as sort of an MCS average margin out the gate and then something that scales over time or does it kind of lower in the initial part of that contract? And any color you can give us in terms of how those contracts will work once they’re executed. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Sure. So I’ll take it first. This is Patrick. Yes, no, the projects that we’ve announced here, the deals that we’ve talked about these would be accretive. These would not be – this is not one of those where you make a big, huge investment of margin upfront and that it pays back later. These are accretive to the market – to the segment margins. And so and that’s a big part of the attractiveness of the deals is the value that we are selling to the utility. And the payback it gives to them in terms of immediate revenue generation gives up the ability to really price it appropriately and protect ourselves from a future pricing kind of pressure once they’re locked in, they’re locked in. And we start making really, really attractive margins in the very offset. Mark?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. I mean they’re all – those are – those recent wins are our water deals and they’re very profitable. And the service and software part on top of that makes them even more attractive in their longer-term.
Patrick Decker: Yes. So typically the way these contracts would work is there’s going to be depending upon the number of we call them end points, but then the number meters that are being installed. The metrology itself is very profitable. And then as those get installed, you layer on the ongoing monitoring piece of the contract, the data analytics piece of that contract, and the AI wrapped around that. Those are then kind of your SaaS margins that you would expect going forward. And those have a long tail again can be anywhere between 10, 15 years of revenue tied to these. It’s a smaller piece of the contract. But even the large piece of the contract, which is meters is very attractive.
Brett Linzey: Okay, got it. And then just one follow-up on the cost targets. Are we still thinking $80 million as structural for 2021? And then just trying to put a finer point on some of the moving cost items within 2020 in terms of temporary, the employee support costs and what that looks like in terms of the netting of kind of headwind or tailwind as we get into next year.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. And I’ll jump in. And the in terms of both the OpEx and the some of the costs that we’ve incurred this year, I mean listen, we’ve learned a lot in terms of working through the pandemic and we’re going to be driving hard to keep – we found ways to keep these costs out, right. And so we’d expect to be able to continue to maintain those efficiencies based on the learning. Secondly, the – in terms of the support costs in other payments that we’ve made this year, certainly assuming we move through this, that will be some tailwind as well.
Patrick Decker: Yes. I would just punctuate it by saying that, we’ve – so the permanent structural savings that, that Sandy alluded to in the prepared remarks, we don’t see any give back on that, that’s – that should be locked in for 2021. So again you’re talking about roughly $80 million of kind of ongoing savings there. And to Mark’s point on the discretionary items, yes, I mean we like pretty much every other company. We started early on the discretionary side. We have $60 million of discretionary savings that are there. How much of that comes back. We’re still in the planning process. But as Mark said, we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less, becoming more efficient, effective, whether it be travel, remote working, making sure that our service providers and suppliers are doing the same thing. So our teams have gone back and renegotiated contracts there. And lastly, making sure that our own approach to work is aligned with what our customers are doing. And they too are – have pulled back significantly on their own discretionary costs in terms of people working from home, et cetera. So we’re still working through that, but we’re leaning in in a big way. So I wouldn’t expect a lot of that to come back. There will be some, no doubt, because you always have some levels inflation on your wage and salaries, et cetera. We’re going to do the right thing by our workforce over time, because we did take some very swift and aggressive actions on our head count during this pandemic. So we’re going to remain disciplined and agile and what is otherwise an uncertain environment.
Brett Linzey: Great. And just to point of clarification on the structural cost savings, so that the $70 million in 2020 and the $80 million in 2021, that’s an incremental $80 million versus an incremental $10 million. Is that correct?
Patrick Decker: Yes, yes.
Brett Linzey: Okay, okay. Got it, all right. Thank you so much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for Q&A. I would like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. So again I want to reiterate where I started that is I really hope that all of you and the people close to you are safe and healthy. Make sure you stay such. Really appreciate your continued interest and support. Thanks for joining the call today. And we’ll be back in touch soon. Thank you all very much. And we won’t speak to many of you at least as a group until after the holidays. So have a very safe and happy holiday season.

Now, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and everyone close to you are keeping safe and well. As you've seen from our release this morning, and consistent with our preannouncement two weeks ago, our second quarter performance was better than we had expected. In hindsight, April turned out to be the low point of the quarter. We hope we’ll eventually look back and say, it was a low point for the pandemic. After April, we saw modest improvement in both May and June, as demand began to stabilize in our key markets. Because our business is global, we were exposed to the pandemic effects early, and so we've also benefited from our present with some markets that have already begun to recover. Back in April, it's fair to say that uncertainty overshadows both supply and demand outlooks as COVID spread from Asia to Europe and then North America. So, we felt it responsible to set our second quarter guidance range intentionally wide to bracket a broad set of scenarios for the macro environment. Today, we have far more insight and confidence on the supply side. That's because of one notably positive effect of feeling COVID’s impact early. It catalyzed early action by our teams. Fortunately, we were working from solid financial foundations and a strong position, so we were able to focus on adapting to the uncertainty and managing the things under our control. In addition to addressing the immediate need, those actions have built a more robust foundation for both the medium and long term. I want to make a point of giving credit for my colleagues across Xylem and all of our external partners who made that happen. They've shown incredible resolve and resilience to a time that has put excessive demands on everyone. I want to credit everyone around the world who's kept the water flowing and kept the central services running despite everything being thrown at them. Throughout this period of incredible challenge, they've focused on keeping Xylem safe and serving our communities. Within Xylem, I want to highlight the work of our supply chain, manufacturing, and our distribution team. They've kept our customers supplied and serviced with very few interruptions.  Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability. So, while demand side uncertainties continue, our outlook now reflects greater clarity and confidence about supply, putting us in a much better position to guide to the third quarter. I also want to recognize the dedication of our commercial teams despite the challenges of working remotely. They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness. You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India, and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to-date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years. And our smart networking deployment of the Anglian in the U.K., which combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90 million over the course of the project. These wins are further evidence of the durability of our business even in challenging times. Because of the differentiation of our portfolio and the resilience of our teams, we expect we will have more news to share about additional big wins when we deliver our third quarter results. Clearly, I'm very pleased that the team's hard work is evidenced both operationally and commercially. Having said that, the outlook for the second half is still not back to normal, therefore, we are not reinstating full year guidance. Conditions are improving in a number of our key markets, but the shape of the COVID curve overall is still unpredictable.  Now, I'd like a hand over to Mark to provide some detail on the second quarter, and then we'll come back to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period. Mark, over to you.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Our revenue in the quarter declined 12%, which was better than we anticipated coming out of the first quarter. As Patrick mentioned, our revenue in orders performance improved throughout the quarter with a very strong month in June. Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays. Emerging markets were down 15%, driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India. Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover. Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%. Western Europe, which is the majority of our European revenue base, was down mid-single digits. However, our business in Eastern Europe grew double digits. This has been a region we've been very focused on, and I want to highlight the tremendous work our team has done there. They've quietly but consistently delivered a revenue CAGR of mid-teens growth over the last five years. Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10% driven by the large signature deals Patrick mentioned earlier. Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%. However, backlog shippable after 2020 is up 23%, which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond. Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter, which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly. Based on our experience in China, we entered the second quarter cautious of COVID potential impacts on our supply chain. However, based on those learnings and the great work of our global supply chain teams, we successfully managed through the COVID challenges and turned those learnings into a competitive advantage. Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers, and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline, and a focus on what really matters. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review second quarter results by segment. Water Infrastructure orders grew 7% and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter. This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India, which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years. Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%. Segment revenue declined 8% in the quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial, and construction rental business.  As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining a critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. This was certainly true this past quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%. To date, we've seen wastewater capital projects continue with minimal delays. This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our treatment business, which grew 7%.  While US sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery especially with our utility customers. As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long term growth prospects for the water sector. The Chinese and Indian governments, for example, have expressed their ongoing commitment to continued investments in infrastructure for clean drinking water, waste water treatment and environmental protection. Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts from de-watering, partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price. Now, please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13%, as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets. As regions begin to reopen, we're seeing modest recovery in our book and ship business in both commercial and industrial markets. We also had a strong quarter in the North American ag business driven by dry weather conditions. Total segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter. Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets revenue declined 14%. However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter. Industrial and commercial end markets in China have been slower to recover than utilities. And our customers are indicating that it may take several months to fully recover in those end markets. Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%. Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and inflation, partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of price. Now, please turn to slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter, and revenue declined 17%, as the Metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and physical distancing requirements, including restrictions on approaching or entering residents homes. This is delaying both project deployments and installations of replacement meters. We expect order and revenue trends to normalize over the coming months, as utility workers are able to safely return to meter replacement and instillation. Importantly, our billing pipeline remained strong, and there have been no project cancellations. Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian Water in the UK. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital solutions to drive key international wins. This win in a robust pipeline of AMI opportunities highlight the continued commercial momentum and the differentiated value our offering bring through our combined digital platform, networking, data analytics and metrology capabilities. Total segment backlog grew 3% year-over-year, with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%. Segment margin performance was primarily driven by the impacts from volume declines on neither replacement activity and project deployment delays stemming from COVID-19, while we continue critical investments to support growth. Looking forward, we expect meaningful leverage on the upside as revenue growth drive increased incremental margins from recent large contract wins. With continued commercial momentum and growing project backlogs, our MCS segment will be a significant source of revenue growth and margin expansion for the company in 2021 and beyond. Now, please turn to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion, driven by the $1 billion Green Bond offering we issued in June, as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter. The Green Bond offering was opportunistic, enabling us to lock in longer maturities at historically low rates, while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%. This offering was also the latest example of the importance of linking our financing strategy to our sustainability goals. Given the strength of our financial position and liquidity, I'll take a moment to note that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Alongside funding organic investments in key strategic areas, M&A remains a top priority, and we maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which we closely monitor. Now, turning to cash flow. Our performance in the quarter was very strong. Operating cash flow improved roughly 50% year-over-year, and our free cash flow of $137 million more than doubled from the prior year. This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on taxes, and the prioritization of our capital spend, which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30% from the prior year.  Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms, while managing inventories in a very challenging demand environment. I'm pleased with our overall cash performance to the first half of the year and we now expect free cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Mark. The end market dynamics we anticipate going into the third quarter are consistent with what we saw in Q2. Utilities have remained relatively resilient as expected, however, there is significant divergence between wastewater and clean water. As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down only modestly. We're seeing continued OpEx spending to service mission-critical needs and continued execution of capital projects with approved funding. On the clean water side, the short term declines were steeper. They were in the mid-teens. We are seeing some project delays but not cancellations. And we do expect execution to pick back up when physical distancing requirements eased. And we've had some very impressive wins, reflective of healthier long term trends.  There was considerable discussion about the US utilities’ CapEx budgets going into 2021. We do expect modest CapEx softening in the US utilities, but as a leading indicator, we are not seeing a slowdown in our bidding pipeline for capital projects. It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our overall revenue is tied to US utilities’ CapEx. By contrast, OpEx represents 70% of our overall US utilities revenue, and it remains resilient. In addition, we see healthy multi-year trends in both OpEx and CapEx in emerging markets, Europe, and the rest of the world. Turning now to industrial and commercial end markets. Industrial didn't slow as much in the second quarter as originally feared, but it will remain soft while facilities continue to deal with restricted access. Commercial has lagged industrial, and the book and ship business will remain vulnerable in COVID-19 hotspots. Our backlog remains robust. Those distributors who destock in the face of uncertainty are beginning to rebuild their inventory. We see these end market trends fairly consistent across emerging and developing markets. But it's clear that China and Europe are showing more resilience than the US as they emerge sooner from the pandemic. China's recovery, which was up 6% in the second quarter, is a strong indicator. Conversely, as the US is still grappling with the pandemic’s impact, we remain appropriately cautious. Now, please turn ahead to Slide 12. It's worth noting a few trends that we're seeing more broadly across the sector. First, there are some fundamentals that COVID-19 has not changed. The most important is the role that water plays in society. There is perhaps no service more sensible than drinking water and wastewater. As a result, our strategy is as relevant as ever. The global challenges of water scarcity, affordability, and the resilience of our water systems remain front and center. Innovation of all kind is essential now more than ever to addressing those challenges. While the fundamentals are unchanged, other dynamics are accelerating. Interest in digital adoption has clearly gained pace as operators seek a step change in their operational and financial resilience. In a constrained budget environment, they are rethinking how they spend their money. It's become an operational and economic imperative to consider the benefits of remote monitoring, automated operations, and their decision support systems. It is absolutely front of mind for every utility executive I speak with, and we're seeing their interest reflected in accelerated quote activity. We're also seeing a shift in the way that we work with customers every day. The trends are away from face-to-face interaction and more towards virtual customer engagement across cells, commissioning, and servicing. Because of that, we're making changes to reinforce our competitive strength. First, as you know, we took a number of structural cost actions across Xylem during the quarter. Second, we've reprioritized our investments. We're focusing further on the projects that deepen the differentiation and the market leadership of our portfolio, things such as increasing connectivity and interoperability across our solutions. And we continue to invest in our highest-growth geographies.  Lastly, we are reorienting the way that we work within Xylem. We've accelerated deployment of the IP platforms that make remote engagement, different selling, and virtual servicing easier for both our customers and our colleagues. And we are, of course, assessing the permanent changes that we make to travel, facilities, and distance working, changes that no doubt will have a positive impact on cost and productivity and also on employee engagement and morale. We are focused through the pandemic on managing the things that we can control, and we're taking the actions now that will make us even a stronger competitor in both the near and longer term. Now, with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark for more specifics on our Q3 guidance.
Mark Rajkowski: Given the uncertainties related to the reemergence of COVID-19 across parts of the US and other geographies and its potential ramifications for the back half of the year, we're not re-instating full year guidance. However, we do have reasonable visibility through the third quarter which I'll briefly highlight. We expect revenue declines of 8% to 12%, and operating margins in the range of 11% to 11 .5%. This reflects approximately 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement and year-over-year decrementals of approximately 45%. The decremental margins are impacted by continued softness in our high margin de-watering in North American census water businesses, along with a tough prior year compared to last year's third quarter, where we had 90% incremental margins on revenue growth. While we've seen some positive trends in the second quarter, the global economic landscape remains uncertain, and we are, by no means, out of the woods. While Europe is showing positive trends towards recovery, we're closely monitoring the trajectory in the United States. The pandemics impact varies widely across emerging markets, from a return to normalcy in China, to ongoing shutdowns in India, and in parts of Latin America. Lastly, I want to provide a little more clarity on the structural cost the actions we announced in early June. In that announcement, we detailed our plans for permanent actions to simplify our operations and increase our ability to act as one company. These actions help us better serve our customers and afford us long-term financial resilience. This year, we expect to incur $80 million to $100 million in restructuring and realignment charges. This predominantly reflects the actions that we announced in early June, but also some carryover related to prior programs. We've also provided a summary table on the slide which details the total savings we expect to realize in 2020 and 2021 from our announced structural cost programs. As a reminder, that includes savings from restructuring and realignment actions we initiated before this year, as well as savings from actions we announced in June of this year. In total, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings this year, and an additional savings of approximately $80 million in 2021. Now, please turn to slide 14. And Patrick will close with some final remarks.
Patrick Decker: So, before we go to Q&A, there are a few other milestones that deserve a mention. The first, to touch on sustainability, we've released our most recent sustainability report in June, and I'm very proud of the work by the team, and it reflects the impact our colleagues have delivered across the company. It shows how we've delivered on our 2019 goals and establishes comprehensive 2025 targets. It also reinforces the relevance and the value of a strong sustainability approach even in these difficult times. We follow that up with a launch of our green financing framework which underpinned our research $1 billion green bond offering. In addition to showing up our financial strength and liquidity, it extended our commitment that sustainability is at the heart of our business strategy, something we've been doing and will continue to do. We recently announced that Mark will be retiring at the end of the year. I feel confident in saying he will take with him the gratitude of all Xylem stakeholders, but most of all, mine. His impact has been undisputable, and his commitment to both our principles and to delivering value has been constant and unwavering. We have appointed an outstanding CFO to succeed Mark. Sandy Rowland has been CFO of Harman International both while they were publicly traded and since becoming part of Samsung. And that experience has put her right at the intersection of innovation, technology, and disruption. And her board role at Oshkosh make her no stranger to capital goods, manufacturing and muni markets. We look forward to introducing her after she joins us on October 1. Mark is going to be with us through the end of the year, which will ensure an orderly and a smooth transition. And lastly, we also announced today that we've appointed two new members to our board of directors as part of our normal board success and process. The board has appointed Lila Tretikov, who's a Corporate Vice President at Microsoft and a globally renowned technologist. And we look forward to her bringing that perspective to the digital transformation of our sector. Our second board member is Uday Yadav, who's President and COO of Eaton’s electrical sector, and he brings a disciplined global operating perspective to our board. These appointments further deepen our board's diversity, our technology depth, and our global orientation. I'm very pleased that Xylem continues to attract this quality of talent to our purpose and to our mission as a company.  With that, let's open up to questions. And, operator, please lead us into Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: For Mark, I wish you all the best. And this is your second retirement, do I have that right? Is this going to be your last one?
Mark Rajkowski: That is correct, Deane, on both counts.
Deane Dray: Okay great. We're definitely going to miss you. 
Mark Rajkowski: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Absolutely.
Deane Dray: So first question, so the whole premise of the growth opportunity for Xylem really does hinge on this adoption of digital. And I love seeing this Anglian win that has a digital offering. So you just clarify what part of digital that they're taking? And then Patrick, you've also hinted that - front log of orders also has some digital component to it, and just if you could reflect on where you're seeing traction there.
Patrick Decker: Sure, yes thanks, Deane. So on the Anglian win, certainly the cornerstone of the deal is the smart network deployment which is really centered around AMI metering deployment. But when you look back and circle, what problem is Anglian and quite frankly other utilities across the UK that we are pursuing right now as part of the AMP7 cycle. Certainly, non-revenue water, and our storm water overflow and overall affordability are three major themes that each one of utility are dealing with. So beyond the AMI metering deployment, there's also a level of data analytics as well as remote monitoring that is built into that project. In terms of the front log, we do have a number of other deals in the pipeline. One that we just recently announced, literally live as we speak as we –we won a large deal just shy of $60 million then a Winston-Salem. And again, that's also a smart networking deployment. So, we feel good again, it's a big market, lots of activity. And I think right now, what I'm most encouraged by is, we're not seeing a slippage or a cancelation of projects as a result of pandemic. If anything, in some areas, it’s being accelerated based upon this need for operational results.
Deane Dray: Great, and then the second question is on the outlook and the guidance for the third quarter. And I appreciate all the detail on Page 13. If you can just clarify - the notion here is you've got a pretty similar revenue sequential ramp, but you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement. Is that all the cost saves reading through driving at 200 basis points? So, how much is coming through for the third quarter?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Deane, that's exactly what it is. It is, the benefit of - the ramp in some of those restructuring savings in Q3.
Patrick Decker: And then we also –Deane, hey Deane we didn't guide for obviously, the entire back half of the year. So, we didn't talk about Q4, but we also –we expect even a larger portion of those restructuring savings to roll through in Q4. And then also, we would expect improving mix as we do see, a return to some level of normality within the clean water side of the utility in terms of being able to do meter installs domestically here in the U.S.
Deane Dray: And just lastly, this doesn't count as a question, but Patrick, I think you undersold Page 12 that picture of the head of your India business that you were there in a hazmat suit. I think you should tell that story. And thank you.
Patrick Decker: Yes no, I appreciate that, Deane. And yes, Bala is our leader of our business in India. He actually just got recalled promoted to leader of Global Treatment business. And so, that's just one example of many where what our team has gone through to continue serving customers. And obviously, our customers are the ones who keep the resources flowing. So it's a joint effort. But we've had a number of - all these large deals have pretty much been negotiated on Zoom or some remote platform. We've got customer service locations where calls are being moved to people's homes. Again, we're not alone in this. But I do think it's worth calling out that these are not normal times, and our people are really climbing mountains here to contend to deliver. And really, I've never been more proud of them.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: We had a gentleman sitting in a car for eight hours waiting to get into a building to close the deal, and driving hours back and forth from home to get there so.
Mark Rajkowski: It was a $115 million deal, but it was still a heck of a sacrifice.
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: And I'll echo Deane's comments, Mark. Congrats.
Mark Rajkowski: Thank you.
Scott Davis: It was a great run. Sorry to see you go. But...
Mark Rajkowski: It is, it is more to come.
Scott Davis: Enjoy your?
Mark Rajkowski: More to come, Scott.
Scott Davis: But don’t disappear on us. Anyway, I have a couple of questions, if you entertain me a little bit. The first one is just Patrick can you help me understand what a green bond is? I mean, what’s - other than it sounds good, and I know obviously?
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Scott Davis: Optics matter too, but what does it mean? Let’s leave it at that?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I'll take it off, and then Mark can go through a little bit more of the granularity. But effectively, it's a financing structure that is tied to certain KPIs that we have to deliver on in order to be able to achieve that financing. And it really is tied to our sustainability goals and metrics as a company. But Mark, do you want to get that.
Mark Rajkowski: That’s right, Patrick, our 2025 goals and the way it works is, as we achieve those goals, we get credit. Those goals are audited, that performance is audited by Sustainalytics. And but it's interesting in addition to the benefit on the rate. What was fascinating was the amount of demand that we got from investors who are focused on sustainable missions. And - the offering was five times oversubscribed, in no small part to the fact that we had almost 50% of those investors as focused on sustainable mission. So, not only do we have an opportunity by executing against our very important sustainability goals to drive the rate down, but it was very helpful from a pricing perspective.
Scott Davis: Okay good color. And then Patrick, you commented on project delays, which I think everybody is seeing. But does that change the economics of the deal for you guys at all I mean, does it make it less attractive? Because you end up perhaps having lots of projects all having to be done at the same time because everybody restarts and - sake of argument January, and you're having to put in a lot of overtime wages. And - I mean how do you cadence that I guess, is another question to ask and not run into having all kinds of project challenges?
Patrick Decker: Yes and that's predominately Scott, that's predominately a U.S. issue. We've already begun to see - I don't want to call it return to normalcy, but if you follow the as I like to say follow the virus around the world, our businesses have been affected along that same line. So, China, Asia Pac, already seeing good growth, signs of recovery, so that's not creating a pinch in our supply chain as [indiscernible] before we’re back up north of 90% in terms of capacity. Europe is also already, beyond even Eastern Europe. Europe, broadly speaking, is already showing signs of recovery. So, we're kind of working through that demand rebuild as we speak. So, it really is centered around the U.S. It's predominately in the utility space, Scott, because, we've mainly deal through distribution and channel partners on industrial and commercial building. And they certainly, are close to the street. It's mainly and inventory replenishment. And so again, it’s going to be more on our supply chain just to be able to provide that inventory to them than it really - you’re back down to, quite frankly that roughly 8% of our revenue that is U.S. utility CapEx. And that's where you tend to see more of the bigger projects that we focus on. We don't see there being a big pinch in terms of workforce demand. Our people are still very much engaged. Our supply chain is very robust. So, it's a long way of saying we don't really see that being a major concern for ourselves. But I had to go through a bit of deduction Scott, to kind of help you get there on that piece.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Graham of Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: Again and actually, we don't hope to see you again. We hope you're just sort of ride off in the sunset.
Mark Rajkowski: Thank you very much.
Scott Graham: So just a couple of questions here, really regarding the access to sites on the water side. It looks like the access on the water infrastructure side is maybe coming a little bit more easily or just is less intensive than it is on the metering side. The third quarter metering guidance is up I guess a little bit less than what I would have thought. Could you talk about that sort of the intensity around the need to be at the site for that? Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Yes. It's a good question, Scott. So I think simply put, first of all, for utility, while all these services are essential, I would say that they would all agree that the wastewater side of utility is absolutely mission-critical. They have little choice but to continue keeping those operations running and deployments and expanding, etcetera. Two, I would say in our water infrastructure business and certainly wastewater is much more of a global business today than what we do through M&CS on the clean water side, which is still largely a North America or U.S. centric business. I mean, we're certainly working hard to change that. And obviously, some of these international deals will help in that regard. But I would say it's as much also the geographic focus of our M&CS business. So, you know, on the metering side, those are also critical and they will get done. You know, we're not seeing projects canceled at all. But right now, it really is a matter of site access at the home level as opposed to more of the outdoor and the treatment facilities that we serve on the Water Infrastructure side. But it really is just a - on the clean water side, it really is just the timing and safety dynamic.
Scott Graham: I guess my follow-up question would simply be, you know, in terms of the sales that you're seeing in Water Infrastructure, I know that a lot of that is, you know, to break and fix the OpEx. Is that a higher-margin business whereby two quarters from now, we could be looking at a mix issue or OpEx versus CapEx? Could you talk about the mix - the sales mix in water infrastructure, how that works?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Scott, roughly 70% of the revenue base is - and this is in the U.S. It's a little bit different as you move around the world. But in the U.S. 70% is OpEx-related, and you're right those - that the margins on that are a little richer for sure. And 30% would be CapEx. In the emerging markets, we have more of a mix towards the CapEx side as we build our position there and build our installed base. So, that continues to be the case. But as we've done that now over the years, we'll begin to see a shift more into the OpEx side. But it is a richer mix of margin.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. And the margins are typically about 1.5 times the size of a project when you get into, again, installed base in the aftermarket piece.
Scott Graham: And if I can just sneak one last one in here. The [indiscernible] business was actually not as down as I thought it would be. Have you won new placements there? What is the driver?
Patrick Decker: Yes. it was not as - not as hard hit as we expected, but it was down substantially. I mean, all in, it was close - over 20% down year-over-year. So, we were thinking it might be in the high 20s. So - and it was really, a lot of it was industrial driven, but it was down in most of [technical difficulty].
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. I mean, the good news was backlog was up, hopefully. But, again, the overall revenue was certainly down again considerably in the quarter.
Scott Graham: Yes. But not as good as - not as much as I thought, anyway. But, look, thank you...
Mark Rajkowski: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: So, Patrick, I appreciate your comments on the outlook for the intermediate term outlook for the utility market. But I wanted to probe on that a little bit just from the perspective of the history. So, Xylem wasn't a stand-alone public company when the last recession hit. But if we look at the earnings releases and the transcripts from your former parent and then Xylem later on, you know, we had similar talk about resiliency early on. But then, you know, Xylem was still seeing headwinds in utilities latest 2012, which was a good three, four years removed from the recession. So, I guess my question is, you know, what is it that's really different this time that would cause us to believe that that history is not going to repeat especially when that portfolio at least in Water Infrastructure still is relatively similar to what it looked like then? So, just looking for any kind of tangible thoughts you have on what's different this time?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, it's a very relevant question and, obviously, we are not taking anything for granted here. I mean, we're staying close to the markets, and the utility customers are really understanding how they are viewing the world right now from a funding standpoint. I would say a couple of things are different this time. First of all, the percentage of our total revenue that is tied to utilities in the U.S. again is roughly 8% on the CapEx side. And it really is the CapEx piece that is - tends to show that kind of fluctuation from a funding standpoint. Two, you know, we do have the M&CS platform on the clean water side. So, while we are absorbing some of those delays right now clearly. We're not seeing cancelations there. These are projects that are tied to issues of affordability, non-revenue water. And certainly, what we're hearing from utility leaders is that they don't see those projects being canceled, you know, or killed in any way. So, that's a different dynamic than we would have had back at the time in 2011 and 2012. Lastly, I would say it goes back to that overall percentage of revenue even tied to U.S. CapEx, is we've also got a much larger portion of our revenue today in emerging markets. And we see that demand continuing to increase considerably.
Ryan Connors: Okay. That's very helpful. And then related follow-up is so much right now seems to ride on the federal government across the economy. And I guess for Xylem, I wonder if you can comment on how you - that outlook you just described in utility, I mean how that differs under a scenario where Congress does bail out state or local governments versus a more laissez faire scenario where things are just sort of left to run their course and maybe you get some greater budget cuts? How do you handicap that and how does your outlook differ in those two scenarios?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So I - it’s a great question. I think certainly as we've mentioned before, and I don't think our view on that has changed, is we certainly are not counting or riding on any kind of federal bailout or federal funding along the way. As you well know, Ryan, the water sector generally speaking the U.S. has never really relied heavily on federal funding. It's always been at the state and local level. So any move there on the positive from the federal government would certainly be upside. But I wouldn't bake that into people's outlooks or forecast for the business because it'll be a while in the coming. But likewise, there's really no downside in that regard. Now, obviously, we're staying close to the law of utilities and munis to understand those parts of the country that are feeling more stressed at this point in time, but I would say we're kind of neutral on the whole federal funding aspect.
Operator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Just focusing on the cadence that you saw on Q2, because you didn't mention a very strong June. So can you elaborate on that in terms of the growth you saw as the quarter developed? And then, what are you seeing in July, especially considering, you know, you did mention that you're not receiving guidance given the recent resurgence in infections in the U.S.?
Mark Rajkowski: Sure. Andy, yes. The - you know, we started off the quarter down mid-single digits. And yes, its mid-single digits - I wish it was mid-single digits. Mid-teens. Matt is like flashing me, no. Mid-single digits. But, - and that was true for got a little bit better in May and then we had a really strong June. So, we ended up down low-double digits 12%. And as we mentioned, orders were still in the quarter down 9%. July, we're seeing some modest improvement, and that's encouraging. But, you know, as we look at the Q3 outlook, you know, the fact is we're - you know, shippable backlog for the quarter is less than 2%. And so, we're still going to need a strong, you know, orders performance in the next two months. And we think, all in, we're well aligned with - you know, with what we laid out in terms of the range, which obviously is tighter than we had last quarter because we have better – you know, some better visibility.
Andy Kaplowitz: That’s helpful, Mark. And I think in June when you announced sort of the bigger structural cost, you also talked about spending $40 million to $50 million to exit certain business activities. I think they seem to be focused on M&CS as that’s where it seems like you’re taking the bulk of your restructuring. So, could you just elaborate on what you’re now there, what you’re getting out of and why?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah. And it’s - and I think the numbers, it's not quite that large. It's probably in the 20s, and it's a number of smaller lines of business and just those that aren't as profitable nor it is core to our mission moving forward.
Patrick Decker: Yes. There's nothing - there was nothing in there that was strategic in terms of we’re deciding to exit something from a material perspective, we wouldn't have even called them out if it weren't for the fact that it did contribute to some of the cost action or the costs being taken. Therefore, we had to disclose that. But again, the amount of revenue is a rounding error. Yeah.
Operator: Your next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Just to start here, can we - Patrick, I know that the situation can change dramatically between now and obviously 2021. But just given where we're at right now with the macro and your view on developed market utilities, is like, the appropriate kind of benchmark for now to be, like, hopefully, overall budgets are kind of flattish, maybe CapEx is pressured and maybe OpEx is kind of stable but, like, with lower tax receipts we're kind of hoping for flat overall spending environment and utilities? Is that, like, a fair benchmark right now?
Patrick Decker: I think Joe, it's too early to tell. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty there. I mean, we're encouraged by the bidding pipeline. We're encouraged by lack of project cancellations. But I really wouldn't want to start guessing what overall muni budgets are going to be. Again, I go back to what portion of our total revenue that represents in the U.S. and the fact that we are already seeing some emerging strength in other parts of the globe. I think it's also - the focus we have right now with our teams is - this pandemic is clearly highlighted for the utilities, the need for greater operational resilience. And obviously, we're certainly learning a bit about the financial resilience, but we are really focusing in on, with the utilities, on helping them do more with a whole lot less. And so, that's where they are looking for alternative solutions, the whole digital dimension of things. And that's - really where we have our teams focused in taking share. Obviously, at the same time, I think it's important that everyone on this call understand that, I think what we're also seeing in our portfolio, and this goes back to maybe with the questions earlier around what's different this time versus before, it really speaks to the durability and critical nature of our traditional heritage product lines. That, we don't talk as much about over the last year or so because of the acquisitions we've done. But they are absolutely core right now and essential to what the utilities need.
Joe Giordano: And a couple of just related ones on MCS, well just one, are you confident that as in like the market deterioration we’re done with negative margins here? And then two, you guys have done a lot over the last several years building out portfolio. It's an interesting mix of applications there. There's been some issues, some Xylem issues, some market issues, but like, curious what you learned from this whole experience of building this out and how you feel about whether that business is ready for M&A incremental from here?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes so, I would say that the - your question of margins, we certainly expect to be, in the black and see positive margins. We’d expect second quarter to - the third quarter to be positive. We were just about, breakeven in Q2. So, with a little bit of a ramp in terms of some of the deployments, the installations and just cross actions, we're going to see improvement there. I think Patrick I'm sure out use that. I think in terms of lessons learned, I think the - what we've learned is, adoption of some of these new technologies is a little bit more challenging particularly in the developed markets. But I think in terms of the capabilities that we've built particularly what we're seeing through this pandemic in the discussions that we're having with customers. I think we're - very pleased with what we have done, the acquisitions we've made, and the capabilities we've built, you know, as we emerge from the pandemic - is that is going to provide us we believe, with a competitive advantage.
Patrick Decker: Yes so, real quick Joe, on the - I'll touch on both as well. On the margin comments or question, there, I think it's important that all understand the level of fixed cost base that we have within M&CS given the services profile in terms of the R&D investments and building out new partner development rollout et cetera. And so some of the restructuring actions we've taken do get at that overhead cost base And so, but our view on incremental rate is unchanged, very attractive incremental in that business. And so, as we see projects being deployed, return to work in the second half of the year, we would expect the incremental to be quite attractive in that business so no change in view there. On the lessons learned, I would also just throw in Joe, that I think that it does speak to adoption, but I think it's also the fact that the solutions and value proposition that we're bringing to the sector are disruptive. And any time that you are aiming to disrupt [technical difficulty] it's going to take longer than what anybody ever wanted to. It's always going to be a bit harder than what versus [technical difficulty]. But our views around the attractiveness and the need for the sector to get disrupted in a positive way, especially around the idea of making infrastructure more affordable, that issue remains unchanged. And so it's not going anywhere. And so, I think we want to be appropriately impatient in this regard. But we've got to keep in perspective as to the long-term journey that we're on here.
Operator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Congratulations Mark and Patrick, if you need somebody to wait in a car for eight hours for $115 million I’m available. I wanted to go back to the utility funding question here. So a lot of the utility leaders that we've talked to are far less focused on state and local government funding and much more focused on the ability to collect water rates, which as I understand it is a much bigger part of the funding equation for U.S. utilities anyway. And they're concerned about things like people not going into city going to work. We'll reduce the water consumption there? So places like D.C. or New York City are the areas where those water rates are going to be collected less and those budgets are going to be a little more challenged. So, I wonder if you could comment on that angle of it. I think people are a little bit too focused on state and local government and not focused enough on water rates. And then, could you contrast that with how utilities are funded outside of the U.S. versus inside the U.S.?
Patrick Decker: Yes so no I think you've hit it, Nate on the U.S. side. You're absolutely right. The biggest concern that the utility leaders have at this point in time, especially on the clean water side of the equation, is again their revenue sources in terms of rate cases, rate collection, et cetera. So I don't really have much to offer there other than again, it is a concern of theirs. They do look back at previous cycles and try to understand. It is a different dynamic now. And they're trying to get their hands around. Now, they're also letting me know that they're seeing increased consumption at the household level because people are staying home. So, some of that’s just jumped from one, kind of metering point to another. But I don't want to minimize that in terms that there will be some potential impact there. They are still generally speaking from the utility leaders that we’re engaging with. They're still pretty confident around their ability to weather this. And it really is a matter of getting through the second half of this year. I think we'll learn a lot more as they go through their budget approvals and that's not all. It's not all calendar as you know a lot of those are July 1, October 1, kind of fiscal budgets. And so we're keeping a very close eye on that, but again I want to keep it in perspective as to what percentage of our total revenue that represents across the company. Outside of the U.S. it tends to be and we saw this in the last downturn. It tends to be much more stable. And that's because a large majority of the funding certainly in emerging markets is at a federal or state level. I mean, it is much more of a kind of independent funding and much more - much less reliant on, the actual revenue collection.
Nathan Jones: Yes I think it's an important point that outside of the U.S. tends to be much more stable on the collection side. You guys have said in the last call that, a more normalized decremental level would be 35%, but you probably wouldn't say that until the second half of the year. Is that still the target that we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Nate absolutely - a couple of reasons. One, we're going to see a bigger ramp as Patrick mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost savings. And then secondly, we had some items that made to compare - some items last year that made to compare this year tougher so.
Nathan Jones: For Q2?
Patrick Decker: Yes, for Q2 and Q3.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes so, we do expect to see that normalize in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well again, thanks, everybody, for your interest and for your support. Really appreciate it. Again, I want everybody to stay safe. Stay strong. Have a great end to your summer, and we'll be back with you on our next earnings call. Thank you, all very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem’s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Xylem First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Now, please turn to Slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. Predictably this earnings call is going to be different than normal. The full team is not here with us. It's only Matt, Mark and I that are together and we're spread rather distantly around a big room. Given the times we're in, we're going to keep our prepared remarks brief. As it's especially important, we leave more of the call for Q&A. I'll start by sharing how we've guided our COVID-19 response around the world. As you know, we felt the impact of the outbreak early given our sizable business in China. Our anticipation of that impact in isolation turned out to be just about right. And our business there has recovered strongly. Having said that, as the impact spread across Europe, and then the US, we saw steeper declines in revenue than we expected. So we moved early to reduce spending and are now finalizing further structural cost actions. We're privileged to serve markets in which our products and technologies are vital to the continuity of essential services. And having entered this period in a very strong financial position, we've been able to maintain and even further enhance our liquidity since then. So looking ahead, economic conditions are evolving too quickly to forecast demand in the near term. So we consider it premature to reset guidance just now. We will however, share what we're seeing in our end markets and offer more detail about our outlook. We'll address how we see the marketplace responding to the pandemic, including a notable flight to quality, and we'll share how we're using that to shape our investments, as certain trends accelerate across the sector. In particular, we see COVID-19 shifting how our customers are thinking about sustaining their essential services. And that provides an opportunity to shape both our cost structure and our investment priorities to emerge in a strong position on the other side of the pandemic. Before we get into the results, it's important to provide some insight into how we've responded to the spread of COVID-19. I want to begin by expressing how deeply humbling it is to watch frontline utility operators all around the world step up to serve their communities. They are delivering essential services in extremely difficult circumstances. I'm also very proud of the Xylem team's response supporting these folks. When COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, our team activated our business continuity plan. Their first priority was to provide for the safety and well-being of our frontline colleagues, our customers and our partners. We then quickly moved to understand our customers' most urgent needs. It was clear that water, sanitation and hygiene were going to be essential to combating the spread of the disease. So we shored up our supply chains and we got critical equipment into our customers' hands so they could keep essential services flowing. We then acted to protect our financial and competitive position. With the China team's response underway, we activated our corporate pandemic plan to coordinate actions around the world. We put Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer in charge of the global response effort. Tony is with us on the call today to answer any specific questions you may have about that response. As COVID-19 spread beyond the initial outbreak to major supply hubs like Italy and Germany, and then we dealt with lockdowns across the US, India and elsewhere, we apply those same principles model first in China. We also significantly reduced our spending both in the areas of OpEx and CapEx. And we put in place a package of employee support to underpin the well-being of our workforce, and to make sure they could focus on serving our customers mission critical work. Before passing the Mark to talk about Q1, I also want to mention how rewarding it's been to partner with our customers to help communities around the world. Through Xylem Watermark, our corporate citizenship program, our employees have found ways both large and small, to support the sustainability of our communities, working side by side with our customers and our channel partners and I'm so proud of all of them. Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Mark to provide detail on the first quarter.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6. First, I'd like to give a big shout out on incredible teams working tirelessly to support our customers, whether working remotely, in our factories or in the field. Thanks to all of you. Now, let's turn to the first quarter results. Organic revenues declined 8% in the quarter, of that we believe COVID-19 ultimately had about a 5% impact on organic revenue growth for the quarter. The market softness we anticipated played out largely as expected until mid-March when we saw a sudden and broad impact as the pandemic spread from China to Europe and North America. From an end market perspective, industrial, commercial and residential markets each declined double digits, driven somewhat by expected underlying market softness, but more significantly by the impact of COVID-19 as factories, supply chains and customer operations were subject to shut down around the world. Utilities end market declined 5% as some project work was delayed, but operations and maintenance spending remain relatively steady. Geographically, all major regions declined in the quarter. Western Europe fared relatively well with growth in several countries in the first two months of the quarter. Emerging Markets declined double digits, including a 35% year-over-year decline in China due to mandatory shutdowns. US was down 7% on broad weakness with utilities showing the most resilience. Overall orders were down 2% with growth in utilities offset by declines in the other end markets. However excluding the estimated impact of the spreading pandemic, orders for the company would have grown low single digits in the quarter. Operating margins declined to 6.2%, driven mainly by COVID-19 related volume impacts, and warranty charge in the measurement and control solutions segment which I'll discuss shortly. Earnings per share is $0.23, this includes roughly $0.09 of impact from the pandemic and $0.07 from the warranty charge. Please turn to Slide 7 and I'll review Q1 results by segment. Water infrastructure orders in the first quarter were down 1% organically versus last year. We saw orders growth in the utilities markets more than offset by declines in the industrial side of the business. Organic revenues declined 7% in the quarter. The utilities end market was down 4% organically, while industrial was down double digits led by a 13% decline in the water, driven by volume declines in the oil and gas, construction and mining verticals. We consider the water infrastructure segment to be a proxy for the wastewater portion of the business with exposure to sewer collection networks and treatment processes. Historically, we've seen most utilities protect their operations and maintenance spending budgets during downturns, and we expect this behavior to continue. Please turn to Slide 8. The applied water segment had 5% organic orders decline despite very steady quote activity during the quarter. We're monitoring this metric very closely with our channel partners as well as order cancellations and project delivery delays. And while we haven't experienced any order cancellations, we are seeing some delays in project activity, as our customers were impacted by construction site closures and distancing mandates. Organic revenue declined 10% as the short cycle softness we had expected in our industrial and commercial end markets was exacerbated by the significant impact of project delays and construction site closures driven by COVID-19, most notably in China, which was down over 50% versus last year. Despite the significant impact of lower volumes and absorption from temporary factory closures on operating margins, the team was largely able to offset these impacts with an impressive 460 basis points of productivity and cost savings. Now, please turn to Slide 9. Measurement and control solution segment revenues were down 7% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by the effects of the pandemic, including water project deployment delays, and the impact from supply chain disruptions in our test business. Lower meter replacement demand was also affected beginning in March as physical distance requirements are impacting utilities ability and capacity to perform this work. Orders within the segment declined 3% organically, along with some softness in our recurring meter replacement revenue. We're also beginning to see some utilities choose to postpone project bidding, or delay issuing decisions on project awards. We're keeping in close communication with our utility customers and channel partners to understand their operational challenges. So we can best support them and effectively manage our supply chain. Segment margins in the quarter were significantly impacted by a $15 million warranty charge. This relates to a specific firmware issue and is contained to a limited number of our North American Water customers. The issue was quickly identified and is now being addressed in partnership with our customers. This charge impacted segment operating margins by roughly 430 basis points in the quarter. The impacts from COVID-19 related to lower demand and the availability of key components was approximately 110 basis points in the quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on the company's financial position and liquidity. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $739 million. During the quarter we invested $51 million in CapEx for critical projects and we returned $108 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to manage dilution. Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by lower net income and a higher use of cash for working capital. While working capital as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points over the first quarter of 2019, cash used for working capital in the first quarter this year reflects both the timing of accounts payable, as well as higher inventories due to lower than expected sales. We remain laser focused on cash flow performance and are tracking cash flows and working capital daily. That said we do expect increases in past due receivables as we support key customers and channel partners through this period. We continue to have a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion available. In this past week we signed two bilateral loan agreements providing $160 million of borrowing capacity at attractive rates. We're confident that our strong financial position, our liquidity and focus on cash flow will enable us to effectively manage through this crisis and support the critical investments needed to enable our long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll hand it back to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks Mark. Clearly, the impact of the pandemic is continuing. So we are being appropriately cautious, but we're also in a very strong position. We entered this period on firm foundations, and we are differentiated in ways that position us to outperform over the medium and long-term. We have a proven and durable business model that sits at the heart of essential services and critical infrastructure. And we've shown the strength of our supply chain to keep customers served. Our market leading portfolio of technology positions as well, both with customers and relative to competitors. And our financial strength enables us to deploy capital through the cycle to further differentiate our portfolio in markets that will provide sustainable growth. Our geographic breadth provides an intrinsic hedge and exposes us to the markets that will recover earliest, and the strongest. And we're privileged to have long standing relationships with our customers, built on a platform of brands they have trusted for decades. So while everyone is subject to the same unknowns about the pandemic in the economy, we're very well situated to benefit from the markets flight to quality and to emerge in an even stronger competitive position. So let's look ahead, our customers are already telling us what will be important to them on the other side of this pandemic. Let me take a few moments to share what we're hearing in our end markets and how we'll be helping enhance our customers' resilience. With our utility customers, the impacts will likely be somewhat different for OpEx and CapEx spending. We expect the majority of utility operators OpEx spending to be quite resilient in the short-term, as they focus on mission critical applications and maintaining their operational continuity. We're actually seeing increased opportunity because of their operational pressures. The leaders I speak to say their single biggest COVID-19 challenge is addressing their labor impacts, whether actual infections or quarantines. They struggle to keep their frontline operators in the field. Conventional modes of working have shown cracks under the strain on their networks and workforce creating an imperative to be more resilient. As a result of that, we're seeing new inquiries about remote sensing and automated operations. Anything that helps utilities keep delivering essential services, even when their networks are put under additional operational and financial pressure. On the CapEx side, we expect spending to hold up as it did in the period after the global financial crisis of '08 and '09. That view is also supported by the multiyear CapEx funding mechanisms that utilities can access and the government commitments to continued investment that we're seeing in a number of countries. For that reason, we're not seeing many project cancellations, we are seeing some projects being delayed momentarily, and that's likely to lead to the slowing in our order conversion rate in the near term. Turning to industrial, commercial and residential, we do expect to see a greater impact from slowed economy. So long as industrial cycles are closed, we will see impacts on demand. And specific verticals like marine and beverage dispensing are likely to continue to remain soft as long as stay at home orders are in place. Anticipating questions about the specific impact of the depressed oil and gas market, it is worth mentioning that oil and gas activity is less than 2% of our total revenue. Overall, we will expect to see an industrial recovery in line with the broader economy. Lastly, in commercial, the short-term is going to continue to see construction crews off the job or reduced, especially in COVID-19 hotspots, which will limit site activity and delivery of equipment. For now our backlog remains strong and we are not seeing cancellations. But we are monitoring quote order conversion very closely. With all that said, we anticipate organic revenues will slow further in the second quarter. Even with China showing early signs of recovery, and our factories now operating at near normal levels, we don't anticipate a quick global bounce back. Given the economic outlook, we expect to see organic revenue declines in the second quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. And we're estimating decremental margins at roughly 50%. Bad factors in the incremental cost related to our temporary COVID-19 workforce support pay, which are funded by overhead cost reductions. On cost, as it became clear that COVID-19 would have business impact beyond China. We quickly reduced OpEx and CapEx spending by roughly $100 million for the year. We are now also reducing compensation for myself and the senior leadership team on a temporary basis. We will shortly be implementing more permanent structural cost actions. This will enable our competitiveness in any scenario by applying three principles. First, we're simplifying our cost structure to be aligned with post pandemic ways of working, which includes accelerating the reduction of our overhead cost. Second, we're addressing our business models in the markets most affected by the impacts of COVID-19. And lastly, we're prioritizing our investments based upon the customer needs that will most likely emerge from the pandemic and we're reinforcing our position as a water technology leader. On that last point, as I mentioned above, it is already clear that our customers' needs will be different coming out of the pandemic. They will be adapting to new operation pressures and they will have new ways of working. As a technology leader, we bring the tools of adaptation, the solutions that will make our customers more resilient right away and for the future. So our plans prioritize the investment that will reinforce our competitiveness by focusing on the areas where customers will need us most as they adapt through this challenging period and on the other side. In summary, there's a reasonable view that in tough times critical infrastructure is a good business to be in. I would actually rather say it's a privilege to work in the water sector. Our customers have shown extraordinary resolve in delivering essential services in a time of need. Whether in good times or bad, solving water and natural resource challenges is work that always matters. It's just now. However, it's also work at the heart of the world's public health defense network. The same strings to give customers confidence in Xylem is their partner in that work. Also drive our medium and long-term investment thesis. Our leading market positions, our depth of install base and our differentiated portfolio underpin our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Our discipline delivery and execution enables us to drive sustainable margin expansion. Our financial strength, which customers depend on especially in difficult times, relies on our robust balance sheet and demonstrated cash flow. Our innovation, in anticipating customers' challenges is underpinned by investment in R&D and capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio. And lastly, our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders underpins the sustainability of this company, our customers and our communities. With that, I'd like to open up to questions. And just a quick reminder again that in addition to Matt and Mark we also have Tony Milando two on the line. As Tony has been leading our COVID-19 response team and he can provide more color on those specifics. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.
Matt Latino: Kristy?
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Good morning guys.
Patrick Decker: Hey, good morning Scott. Hope you're well.
Scott Davis: Thank you. I'm and I hope you are as well.
Mark Rajkowski: Thank you.
Scott Davis: There's a lot in here. Patrick and rough outlook you provided, but maybe we could start off with just the decrementals, the 50%. Not a surprise in the short-term, but would you expect that to moderate down once you get to 3Q, 4Q and any best guess of what it might moderate down to?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, so I'll take it first, Scott. Yes, we definitely expect the decrementals to moderate over the course of the back half of the year. Part of the abruptness here in Q2 is the temporary support pay that we've got for our folks and some of our communities and customer support. We do expect that will moderate as things return back to some semblance of normalcy. Two, it's also a mix of business within the quarter that we see. And then third, we'll have the benefit of the overhead cost reductions that we're implementing both temporary right now, but also the permanent structural reduction. In terms of what it will moderate to, that's yet to be determined, although historically we've talked about decremental margins somewhere more in that 35% kind of range over time. But we won't see that until more likely the second half of the year.
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, I think in Q2, what we're seeing based upon order trends, and what we're hearing from customers, the businesses that are being impacted unfortunately are some of the richest in terms of margin profile. So dewatering for example is certainly at the top of that list, in terms of margins and year-over-year impact. And we're seeing some of the same in our test business, which is very rich margins as well as in the North American Water side of the business for M&CS, so all of those are very rich in terms of the margin mix. But to Patrick's point, what it looks like going forward is a function of that mix volumes, but also, we will see benefit on the cost side that'll be reflected.
Scott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And then since we got Tony on the line, you commented, I think either Patrick or Mark commented on the supply chain disruptions in test. What was that specifically, maybe a little bit color there and thanks for the question.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Scott. Tony are you on?
Tony Milando: I am on. Are we talking about the supply chain disruption as a result of the warranty issue or just overall the –
Patrick Decker: No, specifically for analytics test, so that was –
Tony Milando: The virus – the virus you're talking –
Patrick Decker: Let me just hit the high – I mean, there were a number of components coming in from China Tony, maybe you can give a little bit more color.
Tony Milando: Yeah. Sure. Yeah, we did, we had a number of components, particularly in electronics that came in from China that were disrupted for a short period of time. We also had one COVID case there that shut the factory down for a couple of days. So now up and running and that person's back at work, and we're – that supply chain issue is behind us now.
Scott Davis: Okay, good luck, guys. Thank you,
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane. Hope you're well.
Deane Dray: Hey, thanks and same for the Xylem team.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Deane Dray: Hey, just – wonder if I understand some of the dynamics here on the municipal side. I appreciate some of the differences in the outlook for the second quarter within wastewater seems pretty steady. And it seems like the clean water side has had more the disruptions. I can only imagine if you can't put in any smart meters in homes because they can't get in, that must mean the Philadelphia project is must beyond hold. But can you size for us, what the whole disruption is on meter deployments and maybe we can start there?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah. Hey, Deane, it's Mark. There's a couple of pieces to it. One is you nailed it relative to the impact on some of the deployments. And you mentioned one specifically, but there are others out there. And it's also – to the point you made, having some impact relative to that just the ability to physically go in and do some of that work. And the utilities are really focused on critical repair issues at this point. So not that this isn't important work and won't continue. But it's certainly been pushed out as less essential. And some of the other things we need to deal with.
Patrick Decker: Yes, Deane, this is Patrick. And all the conversations I've had with many, many utility CEOs over the last month. Their single biggest challenge right now is obviously keeping their labor force out in the field, whether it be again inability to access residential meter repair installation, or again, just having the workforce available in general, given the impact of the virus on their workforce. But I do want to be clear, we've not seen project cancellations and if anything what the utility CEOs are saying is that they're actually looking to double down here in the latter half of the year on accelerating implementations, spinning out their CapEx budgets because of some uncertainty around what the next regulatory approval process might look like in terms of funding. So they're going to see a surge in their view here in the second half of the year. We've also continued to see some large international projects that we had been pursuing that are very much remaining on track. And even a bit of optimism there in terms of those moving forward again, nothing to share right now. So we'll have more on that later.
Deane Dray: Thanks. And just as a follow up to Scott's question on the decrementals and Mark in your answer, I certainly understand there are certain businesses like dewatering that you're going to see deeper decrementals and so helping us calibrate the second quarter decrementals, can you kind of size for us the segments and how they would shake out on decrementals?
Mark Rajkowski: I would say the – I think we really look at it on an end market basis and as we think about utilities, we're expecting to see on the top line down mid 20s including and that would include the clean water side with M&CS. In terms of industrial that's probably going to be down closer to 30%. And think of a big part of that that's going to be led by dewatering. Okay. And that's embedded in the transport, business in the water infrastructure business. And then commercial is going to be close to 20%, 20% plus and resi down about 30. But in terms of the margin by segment, I think water infrastructure will probably be the most resilient, I would say, followed by AWS and with some of the challenges we just talked about on the clean water side, probably M&CS a little bit more severe.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, directionally the detrimental margins for water infrastructure and for the applied water business are going to be pretty similar to what they've been historically. They're going to be in that kind of 30% plus range. I think we're going to see – what we're expecting in Q2, the largest decremental impact is going to be in M&CS. And that's because we've got a large labor and service piece there that we're going to hang on to because we don't want to let them go and we want to bring them back at this point and so we're going to absorb some overhead there. That will be impacting us in Q2. That gets a whole lot better in the second half of the year, although we're not guiding to that at this point in time. And then lastly you do have this kind of across the board temporary employee support package that we built in. That is also built into that 50% decrementals.
Deane Dray: Great, that's exactly what I was looking for that you're making that investment in MCNS and that carries into the second quarter.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, it's a pretty big cost base.
Deane Dray: Alright, thank you, best of luck to everyone.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great, thanks for taking my question. Hope everybody's well. I appreciate all the detail today.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, same here Ryan.
Ryan Connors: So I want to just probe a little further on the municipal outlook. I mean, obviously, that segment of the market's always been very late cycle in nature and there's a tendency now to talk about 2Q, 3Q even '21, but if you look at the last cycle, it really didn't even bottom out until four or five years out, 2012, 2013. So it's not the current generation of projects that's at risk, those are funded, but it's really the projects that are at a much earlier stage of exploration that would have been funded next year and beyond that don't end up happening. And obviously, now we got talked about the state and local bailout, which is a factor and we'll get your take on that as well. But, but what do you think about the real intermediate term outlook not 2Q, 3Q or even '21, but '22, '23 as we move through all this?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so it's a great question Ryan. I think the – what I'm hearing from the utility CEOs as we sit here today, and this is a global conversation, not just a North American conversation, is they're not calling that. They're not they're not making that judgment at this point in time that this is going to be like previous financial crises. Even during financial crisis in the past, as you well know that 70% of their spending that is OpEx remains quite resilient because it's again, basic essential services, it really is that 30% of CapEx that can move around. And right now, that's not what we're hearing from them. I mean, we're keeping a close eye on that obviously, we don't want to have deaf ears to that. But they're viewing this as a bit different from a financial crisis, given the human and health nature of this one. They're not calling for a snapback immediately, but they're also not calling for a depression situation in terms of not being able to get projects funded because of a number of the bailouts that are being discussed at this point in time provided at the state local level. So that's the best view we have on it right now.
Ryan Connors: Got it, okay. And my other one had to do with – and you touched on this –
Patrick Decker: I mean I'll just add also there – I would also add there that again, the reason I bring up the global component of that is, we've actually seen a pretty strong snapback already in China and India in terms of building up critical infrastructure there on the waterside.
Ryan Connors: Okay, good. Now, then my other one had to do with – you touched on this in some of your prepared remarks, but innovation is so core to your strategy or identity as a company, 100 million is a big number. So presumably nothing's immune to the cuts that are going on, but how do you make sure that you continue to maintain that position in terms of not only the dollar spent on R&D, but how disrupted is your ability to sort of feel what the customer is needing in terms of all these trade shows being cancelled? I mean, in theory, those are – you have people out there with their ears to the ground that they're not out there. So talk about how all this is impacting that project or that innovation funnel?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, that's a great point. You can be rest assured that we are absolutely committed to preserving our innovation investments. And what I would say is this has allowed us to – there's – it's oftentimes said that it's not usually brand new innovations or trends that pop up coming out of a crisis, it accelerates trends that were already there. And that's certainly what we're seeing right now, especially within the utility space, but quite frankly, across each one of the verticals. And let me take it in a couple parts. So we are staying very close to our customers directly. But also, this has afforded us the opportunity to get even closer in discussions with organizations like Wes the owners of WesTech. They're talking about how they're going to be doing things remotely in terms of a trade show. And that led us to having great conversations with them around also how we use them as a conduit for feedback they're getting from various constituents on innovation themes coming out of this. And so we're in regular interaction with them in those conversations, so there are themes like, again, remote asset management, again, supporting remote workforce along the way, the issue of affordability in terms of how they become more productive in their OpEx, but also how they make their CapEx more affordable going forward has allowed us to actually accelerate the conversations that we had in place on our digital offerings. And we've actually had a significant increase in activity in that type of conversation and request for bids. A number of utilities are now able to action, what they refer to as their emergency procurement protocols to be able to move on with that activity that they were otherwise struggling to be able to do. So there are a number of these areas that we actually see as a silver lining as we get through the other side of this pandemic.
Ryan Connors: Got it, well, thanks for your time this morning.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning. Hope you're well.
Nathan Jones: I am. Thank you, hope you guys are too. I'd like to go back to some of the cost actions here. You guys talked about $100 million of reduction in spend. Can you break that out between CapEx and P&L cost? And then you talked about some structural cost reductions going forward. Can you give us any idea of what the magnitude of those might be when they might be implemented when we might start seeing the benefits from this?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, Nathan, let me let me start and give you a little bit of color on the 100 million. That breaks down roughly $40 million of reductions in CapEx, both was critical as well as just less need for certain capacity because of the demand. But also, we're focused on taking out roughly $60 million of OpEx spend and it's not so much focused on employees, it's focused on spending that we're doing outside, consultants, professional services, et cetera.
Nathan Jones: So we've seen a lot of a lot of company, following workers, reducing work weeks from 40 to 32 hours in order to increase these temporary cost reductions, which are impacting the decrementals in the second quarter. It sounds like you guys have taken a decision not to do that. Can you talk about that decision and what led you to that?
Patrick Decker: No, actually, just to clarify, Nate, we are going to be taking those actions. And so those – some of those are underway, some more of those will be coming here in the immediate term. I don't want to get into the details on the call here as to what that is. We are going to be taking those temporary actions, but it's really in service to – we're all on this together. So the faster that we're able to move on to more permanent structural changes, obviously, the less deep we have to go in the temporary, but we – these are all going to be done in service to each other that we're all on this together as one company. We are – to the latter part of your first question, which was on the permanent structural side, what the size of that is and when would we begin to see the benefits of that? We're being very purposeful and thoughtful in our approach to those structural actions. We're not just in a rush to cut, we really have been working feverishly on making sure we have a good understanding as best we can as to what are the structural changes in our customer sets coming out of this pandemic and align ourselves accordingly. I think we all recognize in this world that we've learned the hard way, all of us, to be able to do a lot more with less. And that's all factoring into our thinking on what the permanent structural changes will be, so more of that to come in our next earnings call. We are going to be taking those actions here in the immediate term. We will see benefits as I mentioned earlier, it will improve the decremental margins in the second half of the year. It will obviously have an even larger impact and benefit in 2021 just given the fact that we do have approvals we have to get and works councils and things like that in various parts of the world.
Nathan Jones: Thanks for that. And if I could just slip one in on the industrial side of the business, I would think that is probably the area where you've seen the most impact from broad lockdowns and businesses that you would normally service actually being shut down. Do you guys have any visibility into what the impact of the shutdown specifically rather than just general lower industrial activity is being. And I would think you would expect to see that snap back relatively quickly as we start to get global economies open here, just any commentary you have on that?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, I think you've read it right Nate. It is where we've seen the single biggest impact in the immediate term both in Q1 as well as in what we're looking at in terms of Q2. And I would say they're – the impact, really is that you've got sites that have simply been shut down on the industrial side of the equation and therefore if they're not up and running and they're not going to be at our pumps, and other ancillary services along the way. We've also had some impact within our indirect channel. We sell to distribution largely into that area. And so they've also had their lockdown and kind of work at home policies. So it's as simple as that. You're right. I mean, we definitely expect that as things open up, and that might be a little better in Q2 than what we're calling for. Who knows? We think we're being prudent right now and cautionary on Q2. But certainly as things begin to reopen in the second half of the year, then there will be – we would expect to be a meaningful snapback. And there will probably be some pent up demand at that point in time that we can benefit from, but it's too early for us to call that.
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. Thanks for all the detail. I'll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Halloran of Baird.
Michael Halloran: Good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Halloran: So just first on the offence, defense side on the capital deployment, how are you guys thinking about balancing the liquidity needs in the short-term. In fact, the cash flow is probably going to be a little softer in the short-term with that that you have a lot of liquidity and the environment might create a lot of opportunity for you guys on the M&A side over time and any other things you're thinking about from a capital usage perspective.
Mark Rajkowski: Sure, yeah. Morning, but I would start by saying, we do enter this with a very, very strong both cash position, but liquidity broadly. We are going to continue focusing on those areas that – our highest returning which is continuing to fund the investments we need to grow the business. We talked about that earlier, in response to Deane's question, that it's important that we maintain those critical investments to grow over the long-term. Secondly, given our liquidity position, and there's not – let's face it, I mean, deals are not going to get done in the near term, but we are going to be focused on keep – our ear to the ground. We know where we want to play. We know we want to participate. And we have our list out there and at the right time, we think we'll be well positioned to take advantage.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, and I would just add to Mike is that as you and the others will know, I mean, in these times the strong gets stronger through this. And we're going to be strategic and continue to be appropriately aggressive to support our long-term strategies that we laid out before those remain unchanged. Perhaps maybe some of the things that we invest in from an R&D standpoint get differentiated a little bit more based upon what we learned through the pandemic. And again, that's just part of the strong getting stronger. Again, I don't want to over use the phrase of flight to quality, but there's clearly going to be a flight to quality here. And we're confident that that's the position that we're in and we're not going to waver from our original commitments.
Michael Halloran: It makes a lot of sense and agree. And the second one, just from lessons learned from China and what you're seeing there more specifically, maybe just talk a little bit about the production ramp versus what you're seeing in the demand side qualitatively. Obviously, production seems to be coming back online, how is demand tracking relative to that and what kind of cadence do you see? Sure, yeah. So Tony, if Tony is still on the line, I'm going to hand over to you, Tony just in one second. I would say on the demand side, we have seen a bounce back in demand in China and India. Again, we're being prudent and cautious there as to where that's happening, which product lines, which verticals it's coming through, but we have seen the snapback in demand. But Tony, do you want to talk about lessons learned on the supply chain and the resilience there.
Tony Milando: Sure, yeah. So our current capacity globally is about 90%. Our China facility was – facilities were down for about 10 days after Chinese New Year before they came back. In the first week, they were back at about half capacity. And now they're back up to 100%. And they're fully loaded right now. A lot of pent up demand, as Patrick mentioned, is coming back into some of the China facilities right now. Some of the lessons that we've learned were around communication, around safety and safety has been a stronghold for us for many years now. We've cut our incident rate down by 50% over the last four or five years and this has really been elevated. So temperature checks, PPE, social distancing and we've learned quite a bit from that model. And we're able to deploy that a lot quicker. In Italy, for instance, where we saw really no production downtime, we got low, but we never shut down the facility. And in fact, in our 50 facilities around the world, only one of those is shut down right now, which is in India. In fact the other Indian facilities are actually up and running from last week. So putting those safety measures in place, that communication measures in place have really helped us keep our employees healthy and the fact that we're all in deemed essential services almost everywhere as allowed our facilities to stay up and running.
Patrick Decker: And I would just add to that. Tony mentioned communications. And I know it may be a little salty for this call, but on the communications front, really, for the past several weeks, since things really began to spread and it was deemed a pandemic. We've leveraged our own internal platforms to – every Tuesday I do an all hands call with all of our folks around the world and it just kind of ask me anything kind of what's on their mind. And then every Thursday, I have a call with our top 400 leaders to hear what's on their mind and just to kind of pass along critical elements communications, so I do think all it seems soft. There's a lot that comes out of that that keeps us in touch with what's actually happening. And that further informs what our overall response plan is good.
Mark Rajkowski: I would say Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in terms of the supply chain, making sure we've got good visibility into critical components and supply from Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers as well. So that's been very helpful.
Michael Halloran: I appreciate everyone, thank you so much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Just switching to free cash flow here for a second, just want to see if you can expand on your expectations for the rest of the year. How does the cadence look? And then as volume goes down, do you think you can translate that into better cash and release some working capital from that and turn that into cash?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, that would certainly be the plan. With some of the impact on volume we'll release some working capital, but we're also mindful of the fact that it's some of our customers are under stress. So we need to be on top of collecting our receivable. Some of our key customers and channel partners are under stress, so we're going to look to support them, but on the whole, as volumes decline, you'd see some release of working capital for sure.
Patrick Decker: And just a bunch of weight that I want to make sure we're clear here that what we're talking about in terms of any relief for customers, that's a very targeted and it's very temporary. Key cost it's very temporary and we would expect that to normalize and course correct in the second half of the year, so that really is more of a comment on here in the immediate term. That's not a comment on the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that helps, thank you. And then just the follow up would be, just kind of looking at tensions between the US and China and how political tensions are rising there, is this something that you're worried about in kind of the longer term, medium term and can you just provide a little color about how you're thinking about that situation is certain to kind of emerge and become something that's being talked about.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, sure, I'll – yeah, I'll – this is Patrick. So it's certainly something that – I mean, given that China is now our second largest market around the world, although, it still doesn't come close to the size of the of the US market for us. The reality is that we've been dealing with these tensions between the US and China for quite some time now. And even though they may be heating up again now and maybe get worse, who knows? The reality is we are seeing it's such a multiple company in China. We don't have a single expat, the look and feel for any of those of you that have been there know that we are very much seen as a local company there. That is high quality. Secondly, the fact that roughly two thirds or 70% of our business goes into the water, infrastructure space, most notably utilities, its critical essential services. And we've to this point, not seeing any disruption even through the previous trade tensions and other discussions along the way. So we feel we're pretty immune to that. I think the third of our business that is commercial and industrial, that's tied more to the broader macroeconomic outlook for China. And we actually see that part of the business is improving right now because there is a return to some level of normality in China, the economy along the way. So we – I don't want to say we're down to it, but we're not concerned about the tensions between the US and China from a business standpoint.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great. Thank you very much for taking my questions and stay safe everyone. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Saree Boroditsky: I appreciate your COVID-19 impact on organic growth in the quarter. Could you provide some color on how you derive that? Was it operational issues or demand impact?
Matt Latino: Yeah, it was it was really a combination in terms of just customers not being able to continue on with certain project work, particularly in China because things were shut down. We saw in the US, in Europe, the demand slowed down on certain order and shipments at the end of the second half of March. But we also were impacted on the supply chain side. And I mentioned earlier in our test business, not solely in our test business, but largely there in terms of components that we were not able to get, which impacted our ability to ship.
Patrick Decker: I would just add that the – I want to go back to comments we made in the prepared remarks and that is, I think it's important for everyone to understand the reason why we were down further in Q1 and at least we're guiding right now to be down steeper in Q2 is, one really needs to follow the virus. It hit first in China. We've got a disproportionate amount of business in China relative to other companies in our space. It really didn't hit fully until really in late March into April, coming out of it now. It then moved to Italy, to Spain, to Germany, where we've got major supply points and hubs for not just Europe, but also for some of the product lines that we sell into the US. We're now coming out on the other side of the curve of that, but we're already halfway through or almost halfway through the quarter. Then it moves to the US. And that's where we find ourselves in similar situation to competitors and peer companies that have a larger US concentration. And so one really just doesn't need to overcomplicate it, you follow the virus in terms of the impact that had on shutdowns, job sites, factories, et cetera. And that really is how it's flowing through our impact for Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and then we recover in the second half of the year.
Saree Boroditsky: That's helpful. And I guess on that line, can you provide the cadence of the improvements you saw on demand in China and what the product lines were that bounced back? And is there anything there that you think will apply to the regions as – the other regions as lockdowns get lifted?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, Saree, so we saw it in the utilities, certainly we saw a pretty broad base across China. As mentioned in the prepared remarks 50%, more than 50% in applied water, but we saw it in water infrastructure too. You're now seeing us return to utility activity and quoting – bidding activity that's returned to pre-COVID levels in China. So that's an encouraging sign that our teams have seen. Albeit they're working through what life looks like after the pandemic where those meetings have changed, a lot of it is virtual, a lot of it is less people than previously done. So we're getting back that. We're starting to learn what that's going to look like for even our European and US businesses, but there's a bit of learning that we've had from the China side.
Saree Boroditsky: Great, thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi?
Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Andy Kaplowitz: Patrick, maybe you could give us some more color on your commercial business. You said the backlog remains robust. But obviously the US, non-US cycle looks like it could be under pressure for a little while. So do you expect the relatively quick snap back in that business as shutdowns end? Or do you worry about a bit of a longer term overhang in that business?
Patrick Decker: It's a great question. I think the – so what we've already seen and again, I step back globally. I'll come to the US here in a second. As Matt mentioned, we're already seeing recovery in China. It is lagging the utility side because it's less essential and critical, but it is returning to normality there. And we expect that to be the case, certainly following in Europe and then eventually here in the US. The part of our business right now that's been most heavily impacted is the bucket ship business in the US that was especially hard hit in the northeast in California, where you had the hot spots of COVID-19. The rest of the business is actually held up fairly well in that regard, but it's been very steep in those COVID-19 hotspots. So we do expect and again, as I mentioned earlier, it's not necessarily in all cases where we go direct, it's also the impact it's had on our channel partners, and their ability to be at work. And the feedback that we get from them is that they do still see quoting activity continuing on jobs, it is happening remotely similar to what we see in China. I think we all can kind of relate to that. So that always slows things down a little bit in terms of jobs getting completed, in terms of bid. But we do expect there to be a reasonably strong recovery. But I do think it's going to be prolonged for some period, as things just take a little bit longer to get done as people are working remotely. So I don't think it's going to be a big snapback, it's not going to be a V shape. At least we're not guiding that way at this point. But I just want to make sure everybody understands. It is very much isolated to certain hot spots around the US. It's not a broad based commentary on commercial channel.
Andy Kaplowitz: That's very helpful.
Matt Latino: And backlogs are up.
Patrick Decker: And backlogs are up.
Andy Kaplowitz: Got it and then Patrick or Mark, maybe can you just give us a little more color on the MCS warranty charge. I mean, you addressed it in the prepared remarks. But what happened and is there any risk of further issues moving forward?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, it's, as I said, it's a firmware issue, it's very contained. It's really in a relatively small part of our business. It's in our AMR side, which is the vast majority of our businesses, AMI, FlexNet and other things. So it does not impact FlexNet customers' international business, it's not electric or gas, so fairly contained. They've identified the issue and they're working through with customers right now. So it's very much contained.
Patrick Decker: And we – the approach we took on this was to get on it – as soon as we heard about it, get on it now, like get it behind us, do what we got to do to take care of those customers and move on and that's why we took the charge in the quarter and we're confident that as Mark said, it's very contained. It's an isolated piece of the business, certain number of endpoints. And our customers have responded very positively in terms of the way that we've gotten on it.
Operator: And thank you. Your next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. First on your in-house manufacturing, you referenced India. I think that's the strictest lockdown that you have direct exposure to. As India begins to reopen, I believe this week. What's the latest on that manufacturing site?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. Tony are you still on?
Tony Milando: Yeah. So first of all, we have two facilities in India. One of the facilities is – we've been able to get it deemed in essential service and that actually opened up last week. I think the latest lockdown actually has pushed it out to May 15 and so our other facility will remain shut down through May 15. But the first facility, our larger facility actually was opened up last week.
Pavel Molchanov: Got it.
Patrick Decker: And one of the things – and one of the learnings that we had coming out of China that I think we didn't mention in our prepared remarks, and I don't think Tony mentioned earlier was, as we saw, again, following the viruses, we saw things moving around the world, one of the things that we did was go ahead and begin to build up inventory in certain factories to get ahead of it, to make sure that we could at least try to minimize supply disruption and just absorb demand flowing, but be able to be prepared for that. And that certainly was also the case in our India factories, the two that we have there.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks. My follow up question is on the M&A, you said that no one's going to be doing deals in the near term by playing devil's advocate, if there are some distressed M&A situations in water tech, which we have not seen for years and years, given how hot the space has been, would you opportunistically look at those?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Yeah. I mean, I think our comment there really – I think the intention of Mark's comment was not that there wouldn't be deals to be done or there won't be activity at all. I think it just – it always moves things out a little bit more to the right, as people will try to figure out kind of what is the appropriate valuation for their asset and then you can take the time to do the diligence, as Mark pointed. So we're not rushing out, but at the same time, we are very open. Again, our strategy remains unchanged there. We'll be smart about it, both in terms of the pace and the valuations, but you're absolutely right, again, there's a flight to quality and again the strong get stronger in these timeframes.
Pavel Molchanov: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. Thanks, everybody for joining. Again, as we like to say here, stay safe, stay strong, stay focused. We appreciate your time here with us today. I look forward to getting back in touch with you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. Let me start with some reflections on 2019 full year results and our progress as a company. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for additional detail on the fourth quarter and we'll round back to offer our 2020 outlook before taking questions. Focusing first on 2019, in the first half we delivered solid growth, mid-single digits or better across our segments and end markets, but the year presented a dynamic market environment and second half conditions were clearly more challenging. I was pleased with the agility of our teams in adapting to those changing conditions and we were able to deliver full year organic revenue growth of almost 4%. Solid performances and utilities and in our U.S. and emerging markets offset some of the second half softness in industrial and commercial end markets. Our full year margin expansion was 20 basis points and we closed 2019 with an operating margin of 13.9%. Earnings per share were up 5% year-over-year and up 9% excluding the effects of foreign exchange.  The fourth quarter unfolded much as we foresaw in our October earnings call and the team's agility and discipline delivered over performance on cash with free cash flow conversion of 124% against the target of 105% driven by significant working capital improvements. That kind of solid operational execution was also essential to delivering our earnings commitment in the quarter. Because we focused on managing the things we can control, while also maintaining our investment for growth. We are well positioned for 2020 and beyond. We have good visibility of our pipeline of business and we built strong fundamentals over the last few years that give us confidence about continuing to deliver significant value creation from near term and long-term growth, margin expansion, and cash generation. So let's focus on those fundamentals for a moment. We were a very different company today than we were just a few years ago. We laid out our key initiatives to lift the growth profile of the company back at our original Investor Day in 2015. At the time, the company was delivering low-single-digit growth, emerging markets contributed roughly $750 million in total revenue. Our vitality index, which is the proportion of sales comprised of the new products launched in the last five years stood at just 18% and we weren't yet in the metrology or digital solutions businesses at all.  So, now five years on, emerging markets are now well over $1 billion with China growing more than 50% and India more than doubling over that timeframe. We've also placed Xylem at the cutting edge of innovation. Our investments have brought many of the industries leading technologies into our portfolio and the M&CS business exposes us to market segments with higher growth rates. Our vitality index has risen from 18% to 25%. The digital transformation of water networks, which was until recently a fragmented proposition is now an executable reality for our customers. AIA's double-digit orders growth in 2019 shows the customer enthusiasm and demand. Our job in 2020 is now to deliver on that reality and leave the sector in helping customers catch the latent value in their networks. Our annual revenue is now $5.25 billion and we have set a consistent pace of mid-single digit organic growth over the last three years. Of course, our emphasis on growth would be a double-edged sword if we had diluted margins along the way, but we've done the work to become more profitable as we invested to ensure sustainable growth and margin expansion. We clearly have more work to do here. Margin expansion continues to be one of our top priorities, but we have so far delivered approximately 250 basis points of EBITDA expansion in the last five years, even as we invested the reach in the new geographies and new product segments. And we've been able to deliver an average 13% compound annual growth in EPS over the last five years, significantly improved versus the previous four years. EBITDA has increased by 65% over the same period. As we digest the large deals at the front-end of new growth and as CapEx shifts to aftermarket and recurring revenue streams in the next several years, we do expect the margin profile of our growth to become even more attractive. At the same time, we brought focus and rigor to operational execution, developing the capability I mentioned a moment ago to deliver favorable bottom-line outcomes even in unfavorable market conditions. Just one example of that is their increased discipline in cash generation. We delivered average free cash flow conversion of 108% over the last five years, largely by driving down working capital from 23% to 17.5%, I expect focused operational execution to continue being a key capability for us.  Any reflection on what we've been building over the last few years would be incomplete without considering sustainability, which is at the center of Xylem's business strategy. Not that long ago, our sustainability goals were sincere and ambitious, but they were largely about reducing our own environmental footprint. Today, we're equally focused on the sustainability outcomes we create with our customers and in the communities in which they operate. Because of the positive impact of our products and solutions, this is a much bigger opportunity. So we built aggressive, industry-leading commitments into our sustainability strategy, targeting the downstream impact of the solutions we provide. This is a far more meaningful approach to sustainability and one we believe is a clear differentiator. The fundamentals we built and the trajectory we've established give us a balanced view towards 2020 and beyond. We're cautious in the face of near-term uncertainty but we are also well-grounded and able to deliver sustained growth.  We do see continuing softness in some of our short cycle revenues in the first half. In the second half, we expect that to moderate in parallel with an increasingly solid position in our backlog. We expect to be delivering mid-single-digit growth in the back half of the year and into 2021. We'll talk about that overview shortly including some more detailed guidance on 2020 I review the drivers of our 2019 for your results, it's on slide 5, I'm happy to address any of that in more detail in the latter part of the call during Q&A, but now I want to turn over to Mark to provide a deeper level of detail on how our segments ended up 
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Revenue growth was flat in the fourth quarter as the market softness we began to experience in the third quarter persisted and slightly worse than we expected. Top-line growth continued to be affected by weakness in the shorter cycle industrial market as well as some softness related to timing of sales in the commercial end market. Organic orders in the quarter also came in soft down 6% versus the prior year. We did see some deceleration of order rates in the quarter, although it is worth noting that we were lapping a 10% organic orders growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. The soft orders intake at the end of the year certainly influences our view on top-line growth for the first half of 2020. As we look at revenue performance across the end markets, we saw strength in utilities continue up 4% in the quarter with growth reflected across most major geographies. Industrial end markets were down 3% weaker than expected and primarily impacted by the same short cycle dynamics we experienced at the end of the third quarter. Our commercial end market was down 5% with declines across most major geographies and the residential end-market was down 2% which was slightly better than expected. I will cover end market dynamics in more detail as we move through the segment discussion. Operating margin was 15% down 10 basis points versus the prior year. I will review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. But, as we look across the businesses, weaker than expected volumes and unfavorable mix particularly from the double-digit declines in our high margin dewatering business negatively impacted the quarters margin performance compared to our expectations. I'm disappointed in our revenue growth and margin performance in the quarter. I am pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline to deliver strong cash flow and meet our commitment on earnings per share of $0.89. Please turn to Slide 7 and I will review our segment performance for the quarter. Water infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 8% versus last year driven by declines in our dewatering business as well as timing on large project wins. Total shippable backlog in the segment exiting 2019 is up 7%  Backlog shippable within 2020 is down 1% or shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up double digits reflecting the near term softness expected in the first half of 2020 along with a strong backlog of large projects in hand to be delivered beginning in 2021. Water infrastructure revenue grew 1% organically in the quarter as the 11% decline in our North American dewatering business largely offset mid single digit growth in the rest of the segment  While we had expected the dewatering business to be down in the quarter. Rental revenues in North America declined 17%. This was softer than expected due to a sharp decline in rentals to oil and gas customers as well as lower year over year rentals related to storm events. We expect this cycle to persist at least through the first half of the year.  Operating margin for the segment remained flat versus last year at 20.7% in the quarter. Significant savings from net productivity and cost reductions were offset by volume declines and the negative mix impact from our North American dewatering business. The segment delivered 70 basis points of margin expansion for the full year ending at 18.2% this reflects continued gains across the year in price realization in productivity more than offsetting the second half volume declines and weaker revenue. Next, please turn to slide 8, applied water revenue declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower sales in commercial building services as well as the modest declines in residential. Segment orders and backlog were each down 1% in the fourth quarter. Shippable backlog within 2020 is down 4% versus last year.  Both of these indicators are pointing to what we expect to be a softer first half of 2020 for segment revenues. From an end market perspective, commercial declined 5% in the quarter with tough compares, driven by the timing of prior shipments related to price increases for tariffs in the U.S. as well as some slowing demand in Western Europe. Residential was down low single digits in the quarter, driven by economic softness in Europe and U.S. residential market was a bright spot up 6% in the fourth quarter and up 10% for the full year driven by modest share gains and some improvement in housing market activity. Operating margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter to 16.6%. Volume declines in the commercial business, geographic mix and overall inflation. We're not fully offset by strong productivity and price realization in the quarter. Despite the challenging fourth quarter for the year, the team was able to deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion, amid market headwinds and tariff impacts by driving 250 basis points of price realization in 400 basis points of productivity across the business. Now let's turn to slide 9, and I'll cover M&CS. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 7% organically in the quarter, which primarily reflected a tough compare to 18% orders growth in the prior year, which included a large Middle East metrology order in the timing of large North American energy orders. Revenue increased 2% driven by mid-single digit growth in Sensus and partially offset by modest weakness in the analytics business and project timing in AIA. Segment backlog exiting 2019 is up 8%. Shippable backlogs in 2020 are down 4% reflecting the impact of the timing of large project deployments with most of the decline in the first half of the year. However, shippable backlogs for 2021 and beyond are up double digits providing confidence on revenue growth momentum in the back half of 2020 and into 2021. Sensus revenues in the quarter grew 4% driven by growth in water and energy metrology deployments in emerging markets. While lapping a tough compare of 13% revenue growth last year. Advanced infrastructure analytics revenues declined 3% in the quarter with several project push outs. Orders were also down in the quarter, although it's worth noting that this is coming off the third quarter with nearly 85% organic orders growth. Full year orders revenue and backlog were up double digits. We expect to continue to see relatively lumpy revenue in orders growth on a quarterly basis as we scale this project driven business  Segment EBITDA margins in the quarter are up 80 basis points to 18.1% and segment operating margin increased 20 basis points to 7.7%. Net productivity benefits and price realization were partially offset by weaker revenue mix. From a full year perspective, EBITDA margins declined 100 basis points to 18.2% and operating margins declined 90 basis points to 8.5% unfavorable mix in the impact of strategic investments ahead of a slower than expected ramp of digital solutions revenues were partially offset by 390 basis points of productivity, volume leverage and 80 basis points of price realization. Well, let's turn to Slide 10 for an overview of cash flows in the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $724 million. We invested $51 million in CapEx in the quarter and returned $43 million to shareholders through dividends. Working capital also improved significantly versus 2018, ending at 17.5% sales. This is 150 basis point improvement from last year, driven by the team's focus on operational efficiency, significant reduction in inventories and solid improvements in accounts receivable, collections and payables. Our cash conversion cycle improved by five days in 2019 with a strong second half push, which enabled us to grow free cash flow 75% for the full year and deliver free cash flow conversion of 124%  Lastly, we also announced an annual dividend increase of 8% representing our ninth consecutive annual dividend increase. Please turn to slide 11 and Patrick will cover our 2020 outlook.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. Given the slow revenue growth and mixed outcomes in the second half of 2019, we took an extremely close look at the forward profile of our business based on what we saw as we exited the year. One of the lessons of 2019, it's a reminder of how much the short cycle business still impacts our revenues and margins. So we're being appropriately attentive to uncertainty in short cycle market conditions as we guide for 2020. We are also taking into account the revenue profile of our highest growth businesses including treatment, Sensus and AIA, and our two fastest growing emerging markets, India and China. because these businesses deliver a higher proportion of a large CapEx intensive projects. We've been careful to account for timing effects in our guidance. Several of you have heard me say that growth rarely happens in a straight line this year is going to provide good evidence of that. It's very much a story of two halves. In the first half we see flat to down organic growth and utilities. This is primarily due to tough year-over-year comparisons. You may recall U.S. utilities was up mid-teens in the same half last year and we're also lapping several large projects in the same period. In industrial end markets, the muted conditions experienced in the second half of 2019 are expected to constrain our short cycle book and ship business at least through the second quarter. Although we anticipated this continued softness as we exited the year, since then events in China have further tempered our short-term outlook. The impact of the Corona virus has for the time being essentially halted deliveries within China, which is our second largest and fastest growing market and its slowing trade in Asia more generally. As of today, our best view is that the first quarter impact of the Corona virus to the company is likely to be approximately one to two points of revenue in the quarter and $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS. It's obviously a dynamic situation and we are monitoring it very closely. In light of this first half challenges, we are being cautious and further managing costs down in 2020 on top of realizing savings from the restructuring actions we took in 2019. Those actions combined with the operational discipline we demonstrated in the second half will enable us to maintain our investments for growth through this period of market headwinds. We see a return to momentum in the second half and into 2021. In utilities, we have clear visibility of significant growth from deals in hand in the second half of the year including a half dozen large Sensus AMI deployments. We also expect double-digit growth in the second half of the year in both China and India, driven by project deployments. And based on the information we're receiving from our customers and distributors, we foresee a moderate recovery in industrial and commercial end markets and a return to modest revenue growth in the second half. For good measure, the third and fourth quarters will also be lapping the soft second half we've just experienced getting both quarters the opportunity to build on favorable year-on-year comparisons. In short, in the second half of 2020, we anticipate returning to mid-single-digit growth overall. Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year, we anticipate utilities will end 2020 with low-single-digit organic growth benefiting from a recovery in the second half of the year as U.S. OpEx spending normalizes to healthy levels and smart meter deployments continue to ramp up. Industrial is expected to come in flattish despite modest recovery in the second half. And we anticipate the first half softness in commercial will be largely offset in the second half and the market to be up low single digits for the year. For Xylem, overall, we foresee a combined picture of full year 2020 organic revenue growth in the low-single digits. And we expect to exit 2020 with momentum and increased visibility of committed revenues given the strong backlog position heading into 2021. It's a dynamic environment, so we will continue to manage through elements of uncertainty by focusing on the things we can influence, effectively controlling our costs and driving productivity, so we can continue to invest to ensure sustainable growth over the long-term.  We are fortunate to be well positioned with a balanced global portfolio that we expect to continue delivering healthy cash generation through the year. By the end of the year, we foresee having approximately $1 billion in cash on hand. Given the growth in our cash balance, there has been understandable interest in our stance on capital allocation. Alongside organic investment M&A remains a top priority and we do see opportunity for some investments this year. Having said that, we are considering all options for capital deployment including additional returns to shareholders in 2020 under existing share repurchase authorizations which have a remaining capacity of more than $300 million. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a bit more detail on both the first quarter and the full year.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. On Slide 13, we've provided our 2020 planning assumptions as well as the profile, the first and second half market dynamic which Patrick just reviewed. In the first half of 2020, we expect revenues to be down low single digits and then return to mid single digit growth in the second half. We're guiding to 1% to 3% organic revenue growth for 2020 this breaks down by segment as follows. We expect flat to 2% growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in utilities being partially offset by continued weakness in our North American dewatering business, which will be lapping double-digit growth compares through the first half of the year. In applied water, we expect flat to 2% growth through the full year as the segment enters 2020 with weak order trends and lower shippable backlogs. In the measurement and control solutions, we expect 4% to 6% growth with strong second half revenues related to project deployments offsetting lower first half growth against tough prior year compares a 15% growth in North America driven by double-digit growth in water as well as large energy project climates. We're assuming a Euro rate of [1.11] [ph] which was the average for the month of January. Our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. Our estimated tax rate for 2020 is 19.5%. Non-cash pension income is expected to decline by $15 million or $0.07 per share due to the planned buy out of our U.K. pension plan. Expected 2020 EPS of $2.96 to $3.16 is an increase of 1% to 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the reduction in non-cash pension income. Moving to the first quarter, with shippable backlogs down 3% and at least one to two points of revenue growth impact from the Corona virus in the quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will declined in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect first quarter adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 8% to 9% representing 180 to 280 basis points of contraction versus the prior year. At the Xylem level, this will be driven by unfavorable mix and lower volumes, largely in our North American dewatering business, the Sensus North American metering business and in China. EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 14.1% to 15%. We see EBITDA margins breaking down by segment as follows. We expect water infrastructure to be in the range of 13% to 13.9%, applied water to be in the range of 16.2% to 17.1% and M&CS has to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.5%. With that, please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. The transition from 2019 to 2020 sees us emerging from one year of two halves and entering another year of two halves. Despite near term uncertainty, 2020 presents a balanced picture. There are still some good market conditions in the short-term, but as we look toward the second half of the year, our backlog and our line of sight to the timing of major projects provide a high degree of competence both about our guidance for 2020 and about the momentum to which we will return as we exit this year. And both now and over the longer term, we remain grounded in the tenants of our investment thesis. We expect to continue to deliver attractive top-line growth, more investments in the capabilities and solutions that enable our customers to transform their businesses. We remain committed to ongoing margin expansion while maintaining our investments in future growth by pursuing the productivity, costs and simplification initiatives that will make those margin gains sustainable. And we will continue driving disciplined cash generation to enhance our capacity for attractive capital deployment, including investment in organic and inorganic growth and increase returns to shareholders. We'll provide an update on our strategic priorities and our long-term plans at our upcoming investor and Analyst Day on March 31st. We'll look forward to sharing more detail on our technology and solution capabilities, discussing our growth plans and hearing directly from some of our business leaders and customers. I'm hoping to host as many of you as possible then at our Data Analytics Center of Excellence in Atlanta, Georgia. Now operator, we'll turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you covered a lot of the details pretty well. I had a couple of bigger picture questions actually. The first one is, just strategically, obviously you're transitioning here to a bit of a different period. Headwinds may in fact be transitory, but what cost control and restructuring becoming a more important part of the story right now, especially in the near term. So obviously you've said in the past you don't want to cut into bone, but can you just talk about how you look at the things you're doing in cost control and restructuring relative to R&D investments and other things. You talk about the vitality index and how you ensure that you don't lose that momentum on innovation and R&D and product development as you kind of rationalize things. 
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Ryan. Good morning. It's Mark. I mean it's a, it's a great point and it's certainly something that we pay close attention to at the end of the day. We're going to create the most value by growing. We need to continue to maintain our investments in R&D. We are continuing to invest to grow our digital solutions platform. So we're really focused on, those areas of spend where, we've got too much complexity where we've got redundancy in the organization. And last year, we launched a series of restructuring efforts to get after that very thing. And the savings coming from those programs, all in are going to be roughly $40 million. We're continuing to look at opportunities. We continue to drive cost out through great work that all of the teams are doing through Tony Milando's leadership under continuous improvement.  There's savings that while a little bit late in GBS this past year will provide opportunities to reduce complexity and take out costs as well. So we're not looking at cutting back on investment at all.
Patrick Decker: Yes, right. I think it's a great point. And I think that, first of all, we still see there'd be a high level of continuous improvement opportunities across the company as we've deployed lean six Sigma starting handful of years ago. But we're still in the early stages quite frankly from my perspective on where the opportunities are, especially beyond the four walls of the factory, but across the rest of our P&L. But, we are definitely going to be investing through this near term noise. We adopted a handful of years ago will be called a productivity for growth mindset and where, a meaningful portion of our productivity has been invested for growth because we believe this is a long-term game to your point.
Ryan Connors: Okay. And then my other was -- my follow-on was related in that, if you look across the industrial landscape the last few years, it seems that this sort of portfolio pruning, kind of targeted divestitures have become a popular strategy for companies facing, tougher times, lots of peer companies going that route, whether they call it realignment or pruning. Is that something that's on your radar or are there any lower margin brands or businesses that you would consider offloading? Or is everything you have considered kind of core?
Patrick Decker: Yes, right. And so, we take at least an annual review, if not even more frequent than that, of the growth profile, but also the returns on capital, economic value creation is the criteria that we apply across, each of our business lines. As we sit here today, there really are, well there are some businesses that might be dilutive at times in cycles to growth. There's nothing right now that is, anywhere close to not delivering its return on capital above the cost of capital. So, everything clears the hurdle at this point in time. It is something that we look at on an annual basis at a minimum.
Ryan Connors: Okay, great. Thanks for your time.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Ryan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Patrick, I was hoping you could give us some high level thoughts on guidance here. I think you've done a good job explaining the dynamics first half, second half, but I'd be interested in hearing if you've taken any different approach this year to setting guidance maybe along the lines of embedding some more conservatism, maybe some implied contingency because there is variability to your earning stream, especially with a short cycle dewatering business, but has there been any change in terms of how you're approaching guidance?
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think that Deane as we look back and reflect on, kind of what we learned in 2019. I mean, as I mentioned before, and you just reiterated a meaningful portion of our business is still short cycle. Heading into 2019, we were still feeling pretty bullish based on what we were seeing in the marketplace. But quite frankly, we should have built in more contingency, into that view. We think this guide is a balanced view. We clearly see near-term headwinds that we laid out, orders softened in Q4, lower shippable backlogs coming into the year, clearly the uncertainty with the China Corona virus and some tough comps. But what gives us confidence about the second half of the year is the projects and backlog that we have already in hand for second half. And just assuming a modest return to growth in the short cycle, again, not a miracle is required in the second half year. So we do feel it's achievable, but it's a properly risk adjusted.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, you are one of the only companies in the industrials and certainly ones that we follow that have actually embedded revenue and EPS impact from the Corona virus. We appreciate the fact that you've taken this approach. Maybe just give us some real-time color in terms of how your businesses are being impacted. You've got $0.03 or $0.04 negative impact, but is there any other lasting affects that you see in terms of relationships or the types of demand fall-off that you're seeing today?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Great question, Deane. Appreciate that you appreciate that we've tried to be transparent here. We felt it would be disingenuous not to lay out real-time as of what we see right now impacts in the business given that it is, our second largest business outside of U.S. So, first, as you all appreciate, the safety of our people is absolutely paramount. Secondly, we are -- although we're not advertising it, we are heavily involved in the humanitarian response. In Wuhan, we have been delivering pumps, and offering to build water towers there at some of the pop up hospitals. So that's been very important. As you said, this is very fluid and so what we do know right now is that, there would be impact on the shutdown of our factories, because right now we have halted deliveries, again. We don't know how much of that is simply delays versus it would get recovered, either in the quarter or in Q2. So we're monitoring that very closely. There clearly is an impact on our supply chain, in terms of our suppliers being down as well. And so there's that kind of knock on effect that again, we think would be recovered over the course of the year. But we're trying to keep a handle on what that is for certainly Q1. And that's really the basis on which we laid out the impact on revenue and earnings per share. Again, we're going to keep monitoring this very closely and certainly in a position to give you all updates no later than Investor Day.
Deane Dray: Appreciate that. And then, can I also ask some questions on the free cash flow guide? So, first of all, great work this year, so that was a vindication year if you will Mark for the team, the cash flow performance. So we appreciate that. Is there any other color you can give us on the guide of 95%? Is that also a conservative cut? We look at -- I see CapEx is up, so that explains some of it, but I'm concerned there might be some give back in the working capital improvements that you did especially in the fourth quarter. So give us some context there, please.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Dean. And thanks for that note. We were certainly looking to vindicate ourselves after last year, but a chunk of that was timing as we discussed, we had built up inventories, we had a big ramp up in sales at the end of the year, high single digit growth. And to some extent, the teams did a great job driving down inventories. There was a lot of inventory to drive down. We had softer volumes and we maintained a good discipline around our inventory build. We've done a better job on collecting cash, managing payables and I would say that, we're certainly expecting as we took you through in prepared comments, a ramping up of revenues in the second half. So there will be instead of working capital being a source, it won't be as big as source of cash flow in 2020. However, we're still looking at improving our cash -- cash conversion cycle and reducing days both in inventories, receivables and pay outs.
Patrick Decker: Adding to that Deane, I think, we think it's a very balanced view on working capital. There's really no major movement built into our guide here on working capital. Obviously, we'll have some of the pressure that Mark alluded to here, but there's still opportunities to try to mitigate that as well. We feel much better about the spot that we're in with working capital now than we were a few years ago. I think to your question also on conversion, you picked up on the CapEx, the modest increase there and that really is driven predominantly by some expansion plans that we've laid out for India to support the -- really breakout growth there as well as continued an investment in some of the software, the MCS, but also where other segments, where much of that gets capitalized. And so those are really the two big drivers for CapEx increase in 2020.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone. I'd like to go back to some of the guidance, specifically the mid-single-digit expectation in the second half. I mean clearly you're going to have eight year comps. It sounds like you have some shippable backlog there primarily around the M&CS kind of stuff. But I mean I think there clearly has to be an expectation here that you're going to see short cycle improvement. You probably need to see the orders start rolling in and about second quarter. But, to ship those in the back half, can you talk about, for that mid-single-digit growth rate in the back half, what you have in hand, what's in backlog in terms of these projects versus what kind of improvement you need to see in the underlying environment. What kind of growth you need to see in orders rate over the next couple of quarters to support that outlook in the back half?
Mark Rajkowski: Sure. Yes. Nathan, its Mark. I think it starts with the confidence that we've got certainly in the utility space broadly, but accentuated in our M&CS business. There are the way the projects work in terms of deliveries year-over-year, the backlogs are much stronger in the second half of the year. We also, we're not looking, as Patrick said, for a miracle and in terms of recovery in the short cycle businesses, but they are going up against much tougher comparison. I mean or easier comparison. I would say what really gives us confidence is more in terms of projects in hand in the back half of the year versus a strong recovery in our short cycle business.
Patrick Decker: And we've been hearing as we stay close to our channel partners as well Nate, especially here in the U.S. that they feel quite good right now about bidding and quoting activity that they are involved in. And part of the softness they saw in the second half was working down some of their inventory that they bought in ahead of the price increases that we had done. So there's a bit of that. So more of the -- more of the pressure that will linger in the second half would be in the industrial business. And that's the one that we're staying closest to in terms of seeing what that order rate looks like in Q2.
Nathan Jones: Okay, fair enough. I'd love to then talk a little bit about mix both here in 2020 and longer term. I mean, clearly you've got some headwinds for stuff like dewatering. It's very high margin. You're going to have some mix headwinds on these M&CS projects as you roll out the hardware initially. Can you talk about, what you anticipate the impact of mix, whether it's, basis points of margin or however you want to couch it in 2020. And then, if you look forward, I would think, let's say dewatering recovers and these M&CS projects, get the hardware installed and move to software. You should see any improving mixes we go forward over the next few years. Can you talk a little bit more about, what kinds of impacts we should expect to see that have on margins as you go forward qualitatively or quantitatively?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Nate, it's Mark. We're going to lay out a lot more of this when we get together in March, but clearly it gets back to the -- it is a story of two halves, right? And our mix, it's really tough given compares in our dewatering business in the first half of the year. And also certainly in the first quarter plus that compares with our Sensus North American water growth. But, that does turn around, in the second half given, the project deployments that we see in M&CS, just an easier set of compares in our short cycle businesses, a little bit more robust growth as Patrick mentioned, given some of the timing and commercial business services. And we are expecting to see a better ramp in our digital solutions business. So first half tough, second half better, but all in it's probably not a big contributor to overall margin expansion. 
Patrick Decker: So Nate, this is Patrick. You've raised a very important point here I think for investors to look at and understand, and we will go into much more detail on this at Investor Day is the impact that we see from the shift in growth profile of the company to the higher margin. We will see a recovery in dewatering. It is very high incremental margins. But on top of that, we will see the adoption of AIA and M&CS overall, which will have very nice accretive margins, higher growth profile. So that mix is going to be a part of our story in Investor Day, but that does not remove us from focusing on what we control. And that is productivity cost in our investments.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Mr. David, your line is open.
Patrick Decker: Lisa, maybe we will come back to him and go to the next one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: Thanks for all that detail in the prepared remarks. I guess following on the last question, just wondering if we could have a conversation about how some of the restructuring and realignment savings flow through. I'm just trying to put everything together and looking at what your implied Q1 detrimentals are? And then, how we get positive. Obviously you highlighted a lot of stuff already around volume, et cetera, but maybe you can talk about how the savings flow through into 2020, and I'm assuming some of that stuff has a tail into 2021 as well.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. So, the 2020 restructuring and realignment is primarily around business simplification. It's GBS-related. So we are seeing benefits coming from our procurement tower finance as we've talked about is going to be delayed into later into 2020. But we did initiate some programs last year in terms of simplification in Europe additional actions in North America. And as we look at those benefits, we're certainly expecting them to ramp up through the year, particularly those actions in Europe, which were just take longer to work through the works council.
John Walsh: Good. And I mean, any way to kind of quantify in an H1 versus an H2 benefit, just so we can kind of help for the modeling purposes?
Patrick Decker: It's about 6 million of restructuring savings in Q1 John.
John Walsh: Okay. And then, obviously appreciate, you gave the details around the backlog shippable into 2020 and also visibility in the 2021. Can you just remind us how firm those orders are like, once a customer decides to place an order, are there, either progress payments or cancellation fees? Just wanted to understand that a little bit better.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, John. And these are commitments. Now, in some cases, particularly in some of our larger infrastructure projects, particularly in emerging markets but not limited to emerging markets, we do look to get advanced payments. While the orders are in hand, as long as there's a commitment, some of these -- the timing of them can move out from quarter-to- quarter. So that's always something that we need to pay close attention to. But these are certainly -- these are things that are commitments for but timing can shift in any given quarter.
Patrick Decker: Yes. Very rarely. This is Patrick. Very rarely would they be canceled. And when you think about even our metrology deals that we do, especially on the AMI side, the economics on these things, the returns on capital for utility. Once they'd gotten these things approved in their rate case by the regulator are so attractive for them that they, it would be rare for them to ever cancel one of these. And that's a big part of what we see in the shippable backlog beyond 2020.
John Walsh: Great. Thank you for the color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. You guys alluded to the hefty cash balance that you're expecting by the end of the year and in that context, let me ask you about the M&A landscape. You guys are seeing the headwinds, presumably many smaller players in the water tech space are seeing as much, if not more. Is the kind of valuation opportunity becoming more interesting from a consolidation angle?
Patrick Decker: I would say we've not seen any meaningful change in valuations to-date. Obviously, that could change based upon the volatility you alluded to. And so, we are always evaluating. We think we have a very attractive pipeline of opportunities. We will always remain discipline on valuations. And again, make sure that these things are critical to really enabling the strategic growth of the portfolio. So again, we mentioned earlier, we think there are some opportunities out there this year. But again, we'll have more of an update on that at Investor Day in terms of what that pipeline looks like, at least directionally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.
Francisco Amador: Good morning guys. This is Francisco Amador in for Joe. Could you explain why you expect M&CS margins, it is so low to the start of the year and just what your longer term margin target is for M&CS and how you get there?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Francisco. It's Mark. There's a couple of things. One, new volumes are down and we'll see some impact on that relative to leverage. But also mix as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our North American dewatering business have a really tough compare year-over-year, very high margins. And also, just given some of the timing we see in our high margin digital solutions business, there's some mixed impact there as well. And the last point is, and Patrick mentioned this, despite the soft patch in terms of volumes and mix in Q1, we are continuing to invest. We've got customer commitments we need to meet. We're excited about the opportunities in the digital side. So we're actually increasing our investment year-over-year.
Patrick Decker: And I would say just to punctuate the investment comment, the couple of areas that are really our priority to invest in that segment right now are predominantly, again, meeting, some of the customer commitments on some product modification for some of the large deals. We do have some new products that we're looking to roll out this year in the metrology space that we think are going to be very exciting. And then lastly, continuing to invest in building out the go-to-market infrastructure for the digital solutions capabilities that we've got. And that's not just in the U.S. that's on a global scale.
Francisco Amador: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, are you seeing any aggressive pricing by competitors in the dewatering market, having an impact on margins? And do you have any color just on the competitive landscape here?
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think the dewatering space, it has always been quite competitive from a pricing standpoint, although obviously the margins are very attractive. I'd probably rather not comment too much on competitive pricing at this stage. But I would say we don't really, I don't think we see a major sea change in that area, but it's always been a competitive market that we -- and what really helps lift margins in that business is just the emergency nature of it and how critical the services are to customers when they are in need.
Mark Rajkowski: And obviously as volumes are softer, it's even more competitive.
Francisco Amador: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.
Brett Linzey: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the second half guide. Could you just put a finer point on the size of those specific M&CS deployments that you expect? And then thinking about the delivery timetables there, is it pretty balanced between Q3 and Q4? Or is it pretty loaded up in the tail end of the year?
Mark Rajkowski: No. It's fairly balanced. It is certainly a component, but we have a global business and we see continued improvement in just recurring revenue in replacement of meters as well. So, but the thing that really makes the difference is a little bit easier compare and more robust backlogs that are pretty much evenly expected to deploy across Q3 and then Q4.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Is there any way you could quantify the size of the projects and just call it, points to the year or absolute dollars?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. The growth in the deployment of these larger projects is, it's mid single digit plus impact.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just shifting back to the restructuring question, go ahead. Shifting back to the restructuring question and I am a bit surprised given the softness and some catch-up on the simplification efforts here and doing more from a restructuring standpoint this year. Maybe, just the thought process there and then, how you're thinking about the, the drop through on savings and payback timing.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. The savings we discussed have always been phased. It doesn't happen all at once. The programs that we undertook from a simplification perspective last year in Europe and North America, we're really rolled out as we saw things moving in the back half of the year. So we start to see that ramp up throughout this year. We saw some benefits at the end of last year, but we'll see more this year.
Patrick Decker: This is Patrick. Again, you think about anytime you've got restructuring programs, you've got some that are rolling off as you're laughing. And so, we had taken restructuring in the first half of last year that we had announced that really began to benefit second half of the year and trails a little bit into this year. That phase was done. That was kind of phase one in Europe. We had a phase two in Europe that we launched in the second half of last year. And just given the lead times involved in getting things like work's council approval, there's some factory implications. So these things have to be managed. We expect those to happen in the second half of the year. So, there's always a bit of phase in here in terms of when a program gets launched versus when it gets rolled out and deliver savings.
Brett Linzey: Got it. I appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just first stuff on the margin front. I know this has been something you guys have obviously been highly focused on a couple of moving parts here. But if you could just help us, you had been talking about I believe a 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in 2020 originally. Now the target mid point is more like 30 to 40 basis points a year-on-year. Appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here. But to the extent that you can -- any sense that you can provide of kind of the bridge between the old and new views, how much is a lower volume, how much is mix operational savings, maybe falling short and then any other items as we think about how you can again, kind of bridge back to the faster margin expansion trajectory you had been targeting before.
Patrick Decker: Yes. This is Patrick. I mean, I would say, first of all, clearly we plan to spend a fair amount of time on this at Investor Day to really kind of lay out how we're thinking about margin expansion. Clearly, we are still deeply committed to margin expansion through productivity, shifting mix in our revenue portfolio and still some other costs take that opportunity. So we'll walk through that certainly at Investor Day in a bit more depth. I think the biggest drivers here dramatically are the challenges in our two highest margin businesses that being dewatering and simply the slower ramp up of conversion of orders to revenue on digital solutions. We believe those are simply transitory, but we'll walk you through that at Investor Day. Mark talked about some execution delays that we talked about last year as it related to the finance tower. We're still deeply committed to that. We're moving that forward, but there -- it has been a shift in the right. And that's certainly impacting part to 2020. We've also continued to invest for growth so we've not pulled back on R&D or other investments to grow these faster growing businesses. But again, we'll walk you through in more depth on that in terms of how we're thinking about longer term margin expansion and how we're going to guide to that each year.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. I'll look forward to that. And then maybe just a housekeeping question for Mark. I noticed the interest expense assumption for 2020, it's coming down about, close to $10 million a year-on-year. Any assumptions there embedded on refinancing or paying down debt through the year or what else might be driving that year-on-year change outside of just additional cash on the balance sheet?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, well, part of it is, we manage our interest rate risk through swaps and other programs that are certainly benefiting us a little bit this year in the back part of the year as well as a full year benefit into 2020. So that's just the effects of that interest rate risk management program.
Brian Lee: All right, I got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys. Your rental business was starting to weaken when you reported last October, I think you said it was down 17% in Q4. You mentioned tough storm comparisons, weakness in oil and gas. Have you seen the rate of decline in rentals stabilize at all yet? And what are your rental teams telling you about the incremental weakness in that market and when it might subside?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So, if I follow your question correctly, you have to really break dewatering out between the rental piece of the business and our equipment sell. And actually, we did see a growth in our rental business by mid single digits. It was really the equipment sales that we saw the big drop there. And that was largely driven by reaction on the part of our distributors. They were seeing -- what they saw, CapEx uncertainty, they run to cash, they're small distributors typically. And so they got skittish understandably and pulled back. Our rental piece continued to grow modestly during that timeframe. Now we have again, seen that a weakness continue and that part of dewatering for heading into this year. That's why we're trying to be cautious in terms of how we guide that business. At this point in time, we are still seeing a broad based industrial weakness. And so that does temper our view on how we view this and because it has such a large detrimental impact when it goes the wrong way. We want to be cautious in terms of how we guide here.
Mark Rajkowski: I'll just add a little more color in terms of, so what changed in the fourth quarter? We expected some rental weakness just based upon what we were seeing in our distributor channels. And on the sales side in the fourth quarter, it was weaker than we expected. And really for two reasons; one, our shipments into customers in the oil and gas space are down more than we expected. And some of that had to do with bankruptcies and oil refinery explosions. And then there was a big year-over-year decline in rentals related to storm events. So both of those were more than we expected. But, to Patrick's point, we do expect some of the weakness in rental to persist, particularly as we sell into the oil and gas. And other heavy industry in the first half of 2020, but some normalization as we get out of that period, particularly when you look at the tough comparison that we had to the first half of 2019.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Great. Thanks for that color guys. And then, just I wanted to ask you about, M&CS in the context of timing. Revenue growth in Q4 was up 2%, I think you said shippable backlog in the 2020 was down 4%, but up double digits for 2021. So, you mentioned difficult comparisons, but as something been happening either in the quarter, over the last couple of quarters to sort of further slow down decision-making or customers just more hesitant to take on these digital projects given they're worried about the economy, is that what it is? Is it labor availability? What is it that's slowing it down?
Patrick Decker: Yes. Well, I think we have to break it down between -- it's hard to talk about M&CS as one, it's not one business line. So the projects -- they're very different kind of projects. So, the digital solutions piece where we're talking about those kinds of projects, these are things that typically start off in a pilot phase. Then they move into orders. And then, they're always subject to weather events. It's not a reflection of there being a lack of funding or a lack of interest or they're pulling off on those. It's simply a matter of timing in that regard based upon the orders that we had on hand coming out of Q3 and Q4. And then for the -- for the census for metrology piece of M&CS, we've not really seen any change in dynamics in terms of decision-making, length of time it takes, that's not really been a driver here in terms of why we stepped backlog. It's just -- these are large -- several large implementations that it takes a while for those utilities to get their case approved and get the specs finalized and get the RFPs out and finalized. And so there's always going to be a level of lumpiness there. And that's why it's important in our view that we look at these things over a longer timeframe than a couple of quarters or even from one year to the next.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Q4 2019 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. As you will have seen from our release this morning, we delivered a solid quarter of earnings performance and continued margin expansion. Year-over-year earnings-per-share growth, excluding FX impact, was in line with our expectation and represented an attractive year-on-year increase. Margin expansion was quite strong at the top-end of our guidance – reflecting discipline cost management, productivity gains and pricing, and free cash flow conversion was particularly strong in the quarter. However, in our end markets, we saw softer conditions than anticipated, and that's clearly reflected in the quarter's revenue performance – which came in below expectations. Utilities demand remains solid globally, and we saw good performance across the portfolio which delivered organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, as expected. However, we also saw a quicker-than-expected softening in our industrial and commercial demand, reflecting some uncertainties in these markets. In particular, there was a deceleration in the short-cycle part of our U.S. business. That slowed-down was both more sudden and deeper than expected pulling overall revenue growth below our expectations for the quarter. We expect this softness will persist through Q4 as a tight labor market continues to push back project timings and uncertainty around some industrial markets impact CapEx spend. Therefore, weaker near-term market outlooks have caused us to lower our full year guidance. Despite that moderation in industrial and commercial demand, we have nevertheless continued to make progress on both productivity and price. And that operational discipline enabled us to deliver on earnings and bring in margins at the higher end of our guidance. Exiting Q3, we had strong bidding pipelines and shippable backlogs beyond 2019. So, we continued to see solid growth and margin expansion potential through 2020 and into the long-term. Looking at our regional mix, we saw strong North American utilities performance and robust emerging market growth. In the U.S., the short-cycle softness I just mentioned held back our growth here overall, but growth in utilities was steady at 5%. Our investments in emerging markets continue to bear fruit. India, one of our fastest growing markets, delivered 28% organic revenue growth year-to-date. China also turned in a performance of double-digits orders growth in the quarter, giving a year-to-date orders and revenue growth in the double-digits. And Europe grew slightly better than expectations in the quarter in the low-single-digits. Mark will take us into the segment detail shortly, but I want to take a moment to provide an update on our AIA business, where we took a non-cash impairment charge in the quarter. AIA's recent commercial momentum has been quite robust. Orders grew more than 80% in the quarter, and organic revenue grew by double-digits. The size and incremental margin profile of this business continues to be extremely attractive and accretive to Xylem. All of which is a say that our growth thesis to the business has not changed. That said, the revenue ramp we are now seeing has taken longer to accelerate than we originally anticipated. As we continue to invest in the business, orders to sales conversion has been slower than expected, moving cash returns at the right – something we discussed in detail last quarter. That extended timing of cash returns required an impairment charge against goodwill, in accordance with the accounting guidelines. However, while the early phase of revenue growth lagged expectations, the orders, sales and backlog growth we are now seeing is strong evidence of a utilities market embracing digital transformation at an increasing pace. We are now beginning to see customers adapt several disruptive technologies at once, in order to get the full benefit of transformation, which creates pull-through across our entire portfolio. In India for example, we are deploying AIA's applications together with pumping solutions, sensor and measurement technologies, and other Xylem services, working across the portfolio to deliver our largest digital transformation project in India to-date. Increasingly, we are also seeing the benefit of integrating our AIA expertise with our commercial teams to take these solutions into customers. In Kansas, for example, AIA collaborated with our dewatering sales team to win a large robotic condition assessment project, which will provide data driven insights to reduce our customers' capital investment requirements. These are just two of many examples of the kinds of deals we're seeing as the market embraces digital transformation. Now with that, I'll turn over to Mark who will review our results by segment on slide 6.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Water Infrastructure organic revenue grew 1% in the quarter, and was below our expectations due to a sudden and sharp decline in our short-cycle dewatering business. The decline in this business impacted segment growth by more than 200 basis points in the quarter. Organic orders grew 12%, and our total segment backlog continued to grow. It was also up 12% year-over-year. The strength in orders and backlog was driven by project winds in our utilities business. Q4 shippable backlogs are up 3% year-over-year despite the order declines in our industrial markets. Geographically, the U.S. Water Infrastructure business was up 1%. This was below expectations, with solid utilities growth being largely offset by the unexpected mid-single-digit declines we saw in our dewatering business. The Dewatering business was most significantly impacted by a double-digit decline in equipment sales to our distributors, who largely serve the oil and gas, mining and construction markets. These declines were partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in our rental services business. Based on feedback we're getting from our distributors and direct customers, we expect the softness in equipment sales into these industrial verticals to continue into the fourth quarter. In this month, we've seen some slowing in our higher-margin rental business serving these industrial verticals, as well. These recent trends are having a significant impact on the segment’s outlook for fourth quarter revenue growth in margins. Our Water Infrastructure business in U.S. utilities continues to perform well, growing 4% in the quarter. However, we are seeing some delays in projects due to labor shortages and inflation in some markets. While emerging markets growth in Water Infrastructure was flat in Q3, it was lapping 23% organic revenue growth in last year's third quarter. The segment’s emerging markets business continues to perform very well overall, and grew orders by double-digits. Western Europe was up 2% overall and slightly better than our expectations. We continue to experience mixed performance across Europe with utilities fairly stable, but with some softness in industrial markets. Segment operating margins grew 40 basis points to 19.6%, driven by our team's continued good work on price realization in productivity. This more than offset the impact of inflation, lower volumes and a weaker mix of higher margin dewatering revenues. Please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water Systems segment delivered 1% organic revenue and orders growth in the quarter. This was below our expectations due to softer demand leading to volume declines in both the industrial and commercial building services markets. Higher price realization more than offset lower volumes in these markets. This also reduced the segment’s total backlog which declined 3% percent year-over-year. Growth in the segment was led by continuing strength in emerging markets, with double-digit growth in China, India and Eastern Europe. This was largely driven by strong growth in the commercial building services market. The U.S. was flat with softening demand in the short-cycle portions of the segment’s industrial end-markets. Also, commercial building services revenues declined mid-single-digits against a tough comparison of 12% growth in 2018. And while we continue to see good pace in quoting activity in our commercial business, we experienced a number of project delays in the quarter largely due to construction labor shortages in several markets – which we see as a sign of improving demand over the medium term. Residential had a good quarter, with 4% growth overall, led by 8% growth in the U.S. Western European revenues declined 6% in the quarter as demand further softened in the commercial and residential markets. Our teams did a nice job of managing through tougher-than-anticipated market conditions, and were able to expand margins 90 basis points in the quarter to 17%. Execution and productivity programs and continued price realization more than offset inflation and a weaker revenue mix due to lower U.S. commercial and industrial volumes. Now please turn to slide 8. The Measurement and Control Solutions segment delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Organic orders growth declined 11%, but that's against a tough comparison to last year's third quarter when we had 31% organic orders growth driven by a few large project wins. Total M&CS segment backlog grew 10% giving us continued confidence in the segments outlook from next year and beyond. The M&CS water business continue to be the primary growth driver for the segment up 15% in the quarter, energy grew 3% and the test business grew low-single-digits. Sensus in particular had a strong quarter growing organic revenue 10% led by double-digit growth in its water business. Sensus delivered 5% growth in the U.S., led by 9% growth in water, partially moderated by lower growth in energy applications as we lap the large Alliant electric meter deployment. Our teams have done excellent work expanding our metrology business internationally, where the water business grew roughly 30% in the quarter. We are clearly seeing the benefits of leveraging the global Xylem network, and this will be an increasing source of revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We're also pleased with the strong commercial momentum we saw during the quarter across our AIA platform. In addition to double-digit revenue growth, we had a meaningful acceleration in the conversion of pipeline opportunities, resulting in year-over-year orders growth of more than 80%, while also replenishing the pipeline, which continued to grow strong double-digits in the quarter. For the segment overall, operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 10%, which is in line with our expectations. Volume and price gains plus 340 basis points in productivity more than offset moderating inflation and growth investments. Please turn to Slide 9. Our cash balance grew to over $450 million in Q3. During the quarter, we returned $44 million to our shareholders through dividends. We invested $46 million in CapEx, reflecting the expected moderating spend in the second half of the year, and tracking to our full year CapEx forecast of $235 million to $240 million. Our working capital in the third quarter increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 20.6%, reflecting both the impact of last year's fourth quarter inventory build, which we will burn off in this year's fourth quarter as well as timing of receivables collections. Free cash flow increased almost 60% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 162% improving substantially over the prior year and quarter sequentially. This was primarily driven by an improvement in working capital levels due to better inventory management, lower CapEx spend and lower contributions to our pension plans. We remain fully committed to meeting our target of 105% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Please turn to Slide 10 and Patrick will cover our 2019 and market outlook.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. So, based on some of the market dynamics we discussed earlier, we've updated our full-year end-market guidance. In the Utilities market, we're tightening our outlook to mid-single-digit growth. Our backlogs are healthy, indicating steady underlying demand growth, but that is offset somewhat by project timing effects. In Industrial, we now expect flattish growth versus last year, down slightly from our previous low-single-digit expectations. We foresee the acceleration we experienced in the third quarter persisting into the fourth. We're also still seeing mixed economic conditions across geographies, including areas of Western Europe and parts of Emerging Markets. Our outlook for the Commercial market is low- to mid-single-digit growth. The U.S. Commercial market in particular is likely to continue showing moderation to the fourth quarter due to project delays caused by a tight labor market. Our Residential outlook remains at flat to low-single-digit growth. Please turn to Slide 11 and we'll provide guidance for the remainder of 2019. Despite steady top-line growth in utility sector, we are lowering our overall organic revenue guidance to between 3% and 4% for the full year. And we're adjusting our operating margin expectations downward. Two factors are driving this change in outlook. First, the impact of lower-than-expected volumes in our high-margin short cycle businesses, particularly in industrial and commercial. And second, the impact of project timing and our high margin AIA digital solutions business. For these reasons, we are adjusting our operating margin expectations to a range of between 13.8% and 14%. This represents an operating margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points and EBITDA margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points for the year. Moving on to earnings-per-share, we're adjusting our outlook to a range of $3.01 to $3.03 representing year-over-year growth of between 7% and 8% excluding FX translation. Let me now turn it back over to Mark to walk through some of the detail on that guidance.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Slide 12, typically includes a seasonal profile of revenues and earnings by quarter. However, given the expected slowdown in our Q4 revenue growth outlook, we've seen a meaningful change this year in the historical profile of our quarterly revenue and earnings. So, I'll take a moment to walk through the changes in our revenue expectation from our last earnings call to our current outlook and the impact on our fourth quarter implied margins in EPS. At the end of last quarter, we expected approximately 5% organic revenue growth roughly 180 basis points margin expansion and earnings-per-share of approximately $1.02. Given significant changes in the market dynamic we saw in Q3 and continuing into Q4, we've moderated our expectations for revenue growth. And therefore, margin expansion in EPS as well. There are two factors impacting our new guidance. First, the softer-than-expected demand in our short-cycle businesses in the U.S. has significantly impacted our volume growth. And while we're entering the fourth quarter with healthy shippable backlog, based on current order trends, we expect to book and ship revenues for our short cycle businesses in the U.S. to decline in the quarter. Overall, we expect this will have a 300 basis point impact on organic revenue growth and a 90 basis point impact on margin, applying our typical fourth quarter incremental margin rate of 35%. Second, we're being impacted by weaker margin mix as we expect to have lower revenues from our highest margin businesses, which deliver well above our average Xylem incremental margins, particularly our dewatering rental and AIA businesses. This mix effect further impacts margins by about 60 basis points. Together, these changes have lowered our margin expectations to a range of 15.3% to 15.5% representing a 20 to 40 basis point expansion versus the prior year. While there is modest negative impact expected from foreign exchange headwind, this is largely offset by lower interest expense bringing our updated earnings per share expectations to a range of $0.88 to $0.90 for the fourth quarter. These changes in our full year revenue outlook for the company are also broken down by segment as shown on the slide. Just a couple of other items to note, we're maintaining our full year estimated effective tax rate at 19%. And we are adjusting our full-year Euro rate slightly downward to $1.11. Our FX sensitivity table is located in the appendix. Finally, we're increasing the full-year estimate for restructuring and realignment cost to a range of $75 million to $85 million. This reflects the cost of additional actions we took during the third quarter to optimize the Sensus European manufacturing and commercial operations to better support our customers and improve profitability. Savings from these actions will begin to materialize in 2020, with a long-term run rate benefit of $13 million. Now please turn to Slide 13, and I will turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: So, to wrap-up, clearly the sudden and pronounced slowing in our industrial and commercial end-markets has presented some near-term challenges putting pressure on margins in our short-cycle businesses. And based on our current assessment, we expect some of that market uncertainty to continue through the balance of this year. But, our teams have responded to those challenges with disciplined operational execution, enabling us to deliver both earnings and margin expansion. Their actions in the face of evolving market conditions enabled us to meet some of our most important commitments. We have the advantage of an extremely strong portfolio of market-leading products. And we built on that foundation with genuinely disruptive digital technologies – giving us momentum as the sector embraces digital transformation. That strong market position is particularly reflected in our utilities growth, which continues at a steady pace across both Water Infrastructure and Measurement and Control Solutions. Notably, our Sensus business is delivering very healthy growth and our AIA portfolio is ramping quickly, creating a leadership position for Xylem as digital adoption accelerates across both the clean water and wastewater sides of our utility customers. And our investments in emerging markets are also delivering impressive growth in both orders and revenues, all of which gets competence in the medium and longer term growth profile of our business despite near term headwind. We have a resilient business that will continue to expand margins at attractive rate and will deliver strong cash generation alongside sustainable mid-single-digit growth over the long-term. We look forward to you joining us at our 2020 Investor Day to hear more about our strategy, our long-term targets and growth profile. And I'm pleased to announce the date of our Investor Day will be in the spring on March 31, when we’ll gather in Atlanta, Georgia at our Data Analytics Center of Excellence. And I look forward to hosting as many of you there as possible then. With that operator, we're now happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.  Hey. Maybe we start with the making sure we've calibrated which businesses are feeling most of the slowdown, and then -- frankly, we're just seeing this everywhere across the industrials – with industrial, commercial short-cycle weakness including oil and gas. So, Godwin, by our calculations, that's about 8% of total revenues and last calibrated their total Xylem oil and gas was about 5%. So, what else within Godwin – maybe it's the construction markets are soft there. So just – are those the right numbers, and then what kinds of end markets and activities are you seeing reduced in terms of demand here?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. So, Godwin would be a little bit more – a little bit higher percentage, maybe 10%. And, to your point, Deane, oil and gas is – it's not a big piece of it, maybe 4%, 5%. But what we saw in the quarter was a big slowdown in sales into our distributors, and they are heavily oriented towards oil and gas, but also mining, construction. So, that was really where we felt it the most. Rental was still pretty solid, up mid-single-digits. But as we work through the first part here of October, we have seen downward trends in our rental business as well. And it's – a lot of it is – we believe just a function of what is some slowing CapEx spend in the broader industrial space.
Deane Dray: On the distributors -- and this is again common with other industrial levered companies -- are your distributors destocking as near as you can tell? Do you have a sense of the sell-in versus sell-through?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah. Our sense, Deane, in speaking with the distributors is it's less of a destocking, and it's really more of just holding back on further investment. Just given the uncertainty and the CapEx budget they're selling into. They're still somewhat confident around bidding activity and things that are out there, but it's such a short-cycle business for them that there has been… They're being conservative right now. It's hard to tell how long that lasts through the quarter. Right now, we're saying we assume it last that Q4. We'll know more about how far it goes into 2020 I'd say over the next couple months.
Patrick Decker: Early results in October are fairly consistent with what we saw in the third quarter as well on the distributor side.
Deane Dray: Got it. That's really helpful. And then on the AIA, does new orders at more than 80%, that's impressive. And it just seems so, yeah, the timing of this seems a little inconsistent that you're also taking an impairment -- and I know the impairment is more backward looking-- but the idea here, is that on the impairment… is that related to the pure technologies? And just give us a sense is it – was it the timing, cash was the factor but some more color there would be helpful.
Patrick Decker: Yes. So Dean, this is Patrick. So, it is largely Pure, and it is largely a function of us having had more aggressive assumptions around how quickly: one, we would get some of the synergy benefits of that integration. It is also some of the other digital solutions that we brought onboard because the goodwill had to be looked at across the entire platform. And the reality is even though we are seeing good momentum here, it was short of what our original assumptions were. Even though we're now gaining the momentum that we had originally expected, the timing was delayed of what was originally assumed in the deal financials. And so, following accounting guidelines, we were required to take an impairment in the quarter, but I think it's important for people to read through and pick up on the comment you're making, and that is what we're seeing in terms of the bidding activity at this point in time. We talked about 60% increase in the bidding pipeline last quarter. We saw continued growth in the pipeline this past quarter. And then it really is punctuated with the nearly 85% orders growth in the quarter and double-digit revenue growth. So, look, we… disappointing, it took longer to get ramped up than we expected, but we feel we're in a much stronger position now than we were even a quarter ago.
Deane Dray: Great. Just last question for me, just if we could get some more context or color within that 85% order growth. I just want to make sure those are just like pilot programs, but is there some real substance around them? And then related, there was news that you all had a successful non-revenue water project in China – in Shanghai. We learned about that at the WEFTEC Program Trade Show, and can you give us some color around that as well? Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. Sure, Deane. So, yeah, the orders in Q3 of north of 80% are not just a whole bunch of pilots. I mean this is substantive business that we're getting. We still do pilots. Many times, utilities in order to get through their procurement processes which is three bids and a buy, and oftentimes there aren't two other bids to be had. Given the newness of the technology, they need to go through a pilot to be able to demonstrate proprietary nature of what we're doing. And so, the reality is we do see some of that pilot activity, but the large majority of the orders that we had here were actually in the Pure piece of AIA. The second part of your question -- which was the non-revenue water win in China. We're now seeing a number of these tenders coming out where the utilities are -- especially the more thought-leading utilities -- are not looking at this as: Well, let's do a leak detection project, or Let's do a metering project. They're looking at and saying: We don't necessarily know which of these levers are going to improve our non-revenue water issue the most. And so, the reality is, they're going out now and saying: Let's do a tender to bring someone in to look at our pipeline overall and determine where are the losses coming from. And, therefore, how do we optimize that deployment. So, this was… the one specifically in China was driven, predominantly, by our Visenti leak detection capabilities, but it pulls through other parts of the business. And it was a non-revenue water project that we're doing across several districts in Shanghai. And so, we're very encouraged by that because the more we get these, Deane -- as you can appreciate -- the more reference wins we have for other utilities around the world, and that's what we're seeing happening right now. It just takes momentum.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Good morning guys. I imagine you guys and Deane would be a lot of fun at a cocktail party talking about… 
Mark Rajkowski: …we would.
Scott Davis: Yeah. I love you both. But yes, it's fun. Anyways, I had to pick on him. I love Deane.  Anyways, I want to take a step backwards because I'm not really in the nitty-gritty here, but the… how much visibility do you guys have when you look out to like 2020 on the China infrastructure spend? I mean given the five-year planning cycles -- did they give you pretty good visibility on that kind of stuff, or you walking into each quarter just kind of waiting for the phone to ring. How does that work?
Patrick Decker: Yes. It's a great question, Scott. I think let me start from the top and say roughly two-thirds… a little more than two-thirds of our business in China is in the utility sector, and the remainder is in commercial buildings and industrial for the most part. I would say on the commercial and industrial piece: that is a short cycle business, not very much different from what we see in the rest of world. But for that little north of two-thirds of our business in China, it is very much long visibility... It's long lead time… It's heavy CapEx. It's very heavily oriented towards treatment. And so we have good visibility into that bidding pipeline and our conversion and win rate so… and that very much is tied to the fact that this is a central government led kind of mandate around clean water and environmental pickup and it is part of a kind of rolling five-year plan. So, that part, I would say, of our business, we've got some of the greatest visibility going into 2020. And of course, we're also now seeing the increased appetite to implement some of these digital solutions that we're talking about around non-revenue water, etcetera, which gives us greater confidence.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's really helpful. And I'm fascinated by this whole labor shortage thing and it just seems so strange… the Fed’s cutting rates and everybody is starting to worry about the macro in such an extreme, but is it skilled labor or non-skilled labor? Is there some sort of dynamic that's changed meaningfully in the last years as it relates to people that can actually execute on these projects?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. We're seeing it largely as non-skilled labor, particularly in the construction areas and kind of short project businesses, where a lot of this, also, is where they oftentimes rely on temporary labor. And the temporary labor market has really tightened up at this point in time. And I know even yesterday, I think the Fed chair talked about tightening labor markets despite the discussion around softening or lessening interest rates. So, we saw that on the commercial side of the business. We think it's transitory because we still see strong quoting activity. And this is feedback we're getting from our channel partners where we rely heavily on our indirect channel for this market in the U.S. It is a US-specific issue that we're seeing. And what we're also seeing is show up, Scott, to a lesser extent, but we talk about project delays and utilities even though we've got strong growth there. We are seeing some projects being delayed through our engineering consulting firms whereby their initial budgetary quotes are coming in well above what the utilities have been expecting. So, they're pushing back on them to go back and reengineer the quote. The projects will still go through. We still see them as bidding pipeline, but we're also seeing that little bit of an air pocket as people go back and have to kind of redo their budget assumptions on some of these projects due to higher labor cost.
Scott Davis: That's amazing. Okay. Thanks for color guys. Good luck to you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to follow up on the goodwill write-down first in Pure. I think you've explained pretty thoroughly that things haven't ramped up here as fast as you'd anticipated. You've had Pure for about a year-and-a-half now. Maybe you could comment on the changes in your view of where you end up in the long term rather than whatever happened here in the short term. After a year-and-a-half of having that and putting together this AIA platform, have your expectations for the long-term revenue potential out of this platform increased, decreased, stayed the same?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. I would say, Nate, a very good question and appropriate one obviously. Our view over the long term -- and I would even say now over the near and medium term, as we stand here today -- things remain unchanged from our original assumption. It just took us longer to get the ramp going than what was originally assumed. And so, if I look at what parts or what aspects of AIA broadly -- because we really are looking now at its AIA broadly rather than just Pure, and quite frankly, we're now looking at it in terms of the broader impact and pull-through potential for Xylem in terms of really deploying these digital solutions and new technologies, hence, the reference to the win in China, the win in India, the win in Kansas, these are pull-through opportunities for also the rest of the company. I would say we feel as good if not better about that potential and opportunity than we did at the time that we built this platform. I would say… what have we learned? I think what we've learned -- and what I certainly personally learned -- is that the conversion cycle for the utilities has simply been longer than we had originally anticipated. In some cases, the sale cycle has been up to a year on the digital solutions because of the need to run pilots, the procurement process that I talked about earlier. And just the fact that this is… we're bringing disruptive solutions to a sector, and what I've certainly learned, as well, is that this is not going to be a straight line. Disruption is never a straight line. So, it's taken longer than we had originally anticipated. But we feel very good about where we are now, and I'm very proud of what the team's doing.
Nathan Jones: Water utilities are well known for their pace of adoption of new technologies. Maybe just talking a little bit more about this China project. You said it was largely Visenti that won that project. Visenti has been a pretty small business, and you talked there about the ability to pull through technologies from the other parts of the business. So, maybe you could talk about whether it's just this specific project or a more general… kind of what are the content non-revenue water project won by Visenti can pull through for the rest of Xylem?
Patrick Decker: Sure, yeah, it's a great question. And China is just one example, we've got a number of these examples around the world. And what we're really talking about here is… Visenti just happened to be one of our number of digital solutions whereby, in this case, it happens to be a specific type of leak detection capability. They were able to go in and -- in this but other examples as well… India, Australia, we've got an example here in the US -- where they were able to go in and start off. They were the ones that opened the door… where the customer looks at this as my non-revenue water issue is: I’ve got to solve leaks. But as the team goes in and assesses the situation, they see a bigger opportunity than just doing a leak detection opportunity. It can flow into the fact that there may be a metering need… a metering opportunity. There may be a metering replacement opportunity that we pull through one of our other capabilities. It could be… it can be of a range of things that happen. It's no different than whenever, our EmNet team goes in and our team applies that EmNet technology around storm water overflow or combined sewer overflows. There's the project around doing… getting the data and doing the analysis. And that might be an ongoing SaaS contract. But there are just as many opportunities to then go in and say: Hey, there's a problem in the treatment plan.There's a problem in the wastewater pumping network.  That can then pull through our Flygt submersible wastewater pumps into that. So, there are a number of examples where one of our digital solutions are applied. They get the signature win, but they pull through the rest of the business. And then other revenues not showing up in AIA. It's showing up in our other… at our other segments.
Nathan Jones: Yeah. One quick one on industrial. We talked a lot about the drop in industrial demand here related a lot to de- watering, related to heavy industry oil and gas that kind of stuff. The light industrial business is supposed to be a lot more stable and a lot less subject to these kinds of rapid fluctuations. Can you talk about light industrial during 3Q and your outlook for light industrial in 4Q?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah. Nate, we… you're right with that observation. Nevertheless, we did see decelerating order growth in our lighter industrial applications. A lot of that being in our Applied Water segment. So just like we're seeing in general CapEx spend, OEMs are just a little bit more cautious in some of their spend, and we're… our order trends are down and we expect it to be flattish, maybe down low-single digit, going into the fourth quarter. It's… and I think some of it is just general… just general concerns and then managing their operating budgets.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. I mean I think Nate the… our comments in the past, I wouldn't want them to be interpreted as a “every single quarter”. I think our view is over the course of any given year. That whole sector of light industrial typically is in that low single digit. That's what we're seeing. Certainly when the year said and done as we look ahead to next year, we still expect that to be generally in line with GDP growth. But there can't be a quarter here or there where you get some skittishness on the part of our distributors to hold back a little bit. We also… in the quarter and even to the second half we had a pretty tough comp versus last year. I mean we were up I think close to 9% last year in the quarter so that we didn't kind of call that out and our comments but that's an important point to make here.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I'll pass it on.
Operator: The next question comes from line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to kind of go back to thinking about calibrating the forward look here and obviously, you remain very confident in your mid-single-digit organic growth going forward. This sounds cyclical on some of these pressures that you're feeling. So, there'll be transitory and I think, as Deane alluded to, most companies are feeling this, but consensus does have 5%. I know it's early to kind of be putting point estimates down for next year, but how would you think given this kind of short cycle pressure feeling in the backlog, what kind of visibility do you have to actually put a potential range out there for next year?
Mark Rajkowski: Sure, John. So, yeah, I'm into your point. Obviously, it's early for us to really be giving any specific guide -- and we will give a full guide with our Q4 earnings report early next year. I would say we look at it really in a few different dimensions. First of all, and I think to your point most importantly here, we feel good about the steady growth in utilities, most notably within our MC&S segment as well as that part of the Water Infrastructure business where shippable backlog in 2020 is up high-single-digits in both of those segments. We think China and India still have a lot of runway based upon building activity of backlog we see there, and we are seeing our AMI metering project deployments ramping up in 2020. And then, lastly, the conversion of the AIA funnel we expect to be ramping up in 2020 and beyond as well. Having said all that to your point, we do have a somewhat of a cyclical downturn here right now in our commercial and industrial businesses, and we're not going to try to prognosticate here in terms of what… how long that's going to roll. We'll have a better feel for that, I'm sure, as we get through the end of Q4. But that uncertainly in my view probably will linger through certainly the first half of the year and the fact that we had some tough comps that we're going to be lapping. I mean again first half of this year, Industrial was up 3%. Not a lot to write home about, but… about where it normally is, but Commercial was up 9% in the first half. So, we're going to have a little bit of tough comp in the first half. The last thing I would say is… but we continue to be confident in our margin expansion, and we still have meaningful productivity opportunities out there. We've talked before about the mix of MC&S coming to our favor now given the heavy water project rollout there, and also the continued strong performance in Water Infrastructure from a margin standpoint.
Matt Latino: Can we have the next question please?
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey guys. Good morning. Maybe to jump off of that topic, Patrick, since you bring up the productivity, 400 basis points, or so, I think it was the best you've seen year-to-date. And then on the flipside, volume mix was maybe a bit worse than you've been tracking at. So, two questions here. Can you maybe talk to the puts and takes here you know this is the near-term trend we should be expecting going forward for these margin drivers. And then second question, just given the additional reset in operating margins here for fiscal 2019. I'm wondering if the 100 basis point expansion view that you outlined earlier in the year for 2020. Is that still intact or should we be anticipating an update to that as well? Thanks, guys.
Patrick Decker: Let me let me take the first part of that question relative to some of what we saw on third quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks the teams really did a nice job continuing to drive productivity. We continue to find places to take out our costs in our manufacturing supply chain operations. And as you'll recall, we did take some restructuring actions as well in the first part of this year that's really starting to ramp up in Q3. We expect that to continue into Q4 as well. And we've seen, as we expected, some moderating inflation in the third quarter as well, certainly in our M&CS segment as expected as we lap some of those component shortages and some of the higher costs. We have to deal with some of the moves that we've made on addressed tariffs and also we saw a lower inflation in Applied Water for the third quarter as well, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter also.
Mark Rajkowski: And on your question around kind of looking at 2020 and the 100 basis points of margin expansion, I would say, Brian, of our view on that, as we sit here today, is that the productivity, the pricing piece, all the levers that we have in our control remain intact. And I think the big question in terms of what any kind of delta might be versus that is it all going to come down to what we believe our volume growth profile is going to be in 2020 relative to what we said before in terms of a mid- single digit. I'm not signaling anything there. I'm simply saying that will be the one factor that will make sure we get comfortable with it as we give a guide for 2020.
Brian Lee: Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Good morning. So, you remained pretty positive on the outlook for 2020 for MCS. And I guess, could you just comment on the visibility that you have into the project timing, and is there any risk that some of these projects get pushed out?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, we've got… we've got pretty good visibility into the MCS segment based on our shippable backlog in 2020 and beyond. The shippable backlog in 2020 and beyond is quite healthy. I think we're looking at like 7% growth versus last year which is that was coming out of the quarter. We've got… there is a portion of that business that is day-to-day replacement meters. And so, I wouldn't want anybody to think that everything is locked in the bag base. It's not all large projects, but there is a meaningful piece of that business that definitely is. It's probably about half of the revenue for the segment is sitting in backlog right now, and that's pretty solid for any one of our businesses going in. I think secondly, what we're seeing there is just again good, healthy conversion to AMI, and those projects have very good returns on them economically, not just for us but for the utilities. That's why they make the investment. I'd say there's always a risk that depending up on what the broader economy was to do. If we were to go into a recessionary environment, then, of course, there's always some risk there that project can move to the right. But that's not historically been the case based upon the diligence that we've done. Lastly, although again it's only… it's right now only $120 million of business. Again, we were seeing good ramp up now in AIA which is very helpful in terms of helping spike that growth rate for the segment. And then the… lastly, what I would say is: we've integrated the AIA business and the Sensus business now into our commercial teams in Europe and emerging markets. And that's given the team already a bump up in increase in bidding pipeline and visibility into the market in terms of opportunities. And so, I do expect there to be opportunity there as well.
Saree Boroditsky: That's helpful. And considering your growth in Western Europe picked up slightly from last quarter just a little different from some of the macro trends. So, could you provide some color like on what you're seeing in that market?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, it did actually. It was actually a little bit better than we had seen in the first part of the year. A lot of that was driven by utilities and it was… we saw a relative strength low-single-digits plus in some parts of Europe. But it was it was fairly broad based and where we… where it wasn't as strong was on the industrial side but that was in the quarter probably one of the good surprises we had. And we expect… we are expecting that to continue into Q4.
Saree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the questions. Given the industrial headwinds that we've been talking about for the past hour, I'm curious if the smaller more focused private players in your value chain are presumably feeling this to a greater extent. And if so, does this perhaps create an opportunity for you guys to kind of reaccelerate the M&A trend from several years ago?
Patrick Decker: That's a good question. I mean I think you know we remain disciplined on our approach to M&A. We do have a healthy pipeline right now of targets that we look at all different shapes and sizes. We haven't seen a meaningful move as of yet in terms of valuation expectations. But I do believe that could certainly change depending upon how prolonged the industrial commercial thing could be. But we'll play that by ear, we'll remain disciplined and our priorities remain unchanged. We've talked about before we think we have a really good platform in utilities at this point in time. So anything we do there would be more likely to continue tuck-ins and bolt-ons of digital solutions. And then the second – not even our second – our other biggest priority is building out a more robust industrial franchise. And so, we continue to look those opportunities, and, hopefully, some things will come along here, but we're going to be disciplined.
Pavel Molchanov: And then a follow-up on the balance sheet, your net-debt-to-cap went below 40% this quarter, the lowest level since before the Sensus acquisition. Are you pretty happy with where the leverage is at the moment?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah, we are. I mean we had, post the Pure acquisition, gotten a little bit ahead of our target, but we knew we'd be able to bring that down relatively quickly. We have. And it was just this quarter, really, where we've seen really strong cash flow that we were pleased with. So, we're now moving it into our targeted range which is 2.5 to 3 times Moody's.
Pavel Molchanov: Got. Okay. Understood. Appreciate it guys.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys. So, look, it's hard to give guidance. I think we all appreciate that. So, we've seen a couple cuts in a row. If you're looking at it just optically, it could look like it's a bit reactionary rather than anticipatory. So, I was wondering if you can kind of reconcile that with how you're actually learning the business internally. Like getting ahead of slowdowns in terms of restructuring actions and looking at cost structures. And have you feel like you've been a little bit faster to react on that part rather than maybe the publicly discussed numbers that are out there?
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think so Joe. It's a good and fair point to make. I mean, we do have – we do still have a meaningful part of our business, which is roughly somewhere probably between 40%, 45% especially non-utility that is short cycle business. And so, to your point that there are things obviously that we will get, we don't just kind of wing it and take a guess on outlooks and forecasts. The point is things can change quickly within a quarter. And that's what we saw in this quarter was things really change late in the quarter. And it happened pretty suddenly and through distribution, et cetera. So, I would say, had we not been anticipatory around that being a possibility then we would not have been able to pull the levers that we did to deliver on our EPS and at high end of our margin guidance in range for the quarter. Obviously, we're looking into Q4, and now even in 2020, there are other actions that we've taken both from a cost out, but also just leaning in even harder on productivity than otherwise anticipated. Lastly, I would say though we are… it's important that everyone knows that we have been focused also on preserving investments and the key elements of our portfolio, and will do so both in Q4, as well as going into 2020. That's an area that we do not want to be seen as being purely reactive to the near-term.
Mark Rajkowski: And we've talked about this as a team going into the beginning of this year relative to at some point the cycle will turn, we need to be prepared for that, and we... as every business has, there are opportunities for us to get more streamlined and leaner, and we've been doing that throughout the course of the year.
Patrick Decker: So, I think, Joe, the challenge that we've been facing near the end of this last quarter and through Q4, it's again really just getting as much visibility as possible into: Is this an air pocket commercial and industrial in the US?... for… and How long does that pocket run before you see some return to normalization? Because if it were not for this softness that we saw in this particular part of the business -- which does tend to be more cyclical, but it does rebound -- we saw very solid and strong growth in the rest of our portfolio in line with what we've been talking about both in the near-term and longer term.
Joe Giordano: Sure that makes sense. On AIA on the impairment, look, I get the… I think the portfolio that you're building there is interesting and it's unique and it's almost by definition going to take a long time to kind of figure this out with the market. But does this kind of development kind of change the way you think about how much to pay for smaller bolt-ons or maybe not real small bolt-ons but ones that have, like, some heft to them? Does it… do you have to like recalibrate what the appropriate multiple in some of those businesses are as you go forward?
Patrick Decker: I think it's… I think the most important thing, Joe, the way we look at it is I would say first of all I certainly wouldn't want to have any of these businesses in somebody else's hands. They need to be with Xylem. Okay. And as we… and I think that as we have integrated the ones that we now have over the course of the past number of months here – because, you know, we've only had the non-pure businesses, we've only had those over the course of the last year -- and so we've been integrating those as we speak. We've learned a lot during that timeframe. I've learned a lot by being out with a lot of customers and understanding even better kind of how they think now that we have C-suite level conversations because we have the credibility to go in and talk to customers at a broad enterprise level. That will certainly inform and educate as we look at any future bolt-on acquisitions both from evaluation standpoint. You're never going be able to perfectly time an acquisition and perfectly layer the price on what you're paying. It… you don't want to over pay, of course, and we'll always be discipline in that regard. So, those are our learning but no, we're not… we're not gun shy about going on and continue to build out this portfolio. Not at all.
Joe Giordano: That's fair. And just last one, I just want to sneak a last one here. As we get into like a slower kind of pocket in some of your cyclical businesses, your infrastructure segment has done a really nice job on margins. It's been a definitely a bright spot. What's the potential there? It's expanded a lot over the last couple of years. You've had good volume to help drive that. If you get into like a slower growth market, how much more potential is in that segment?
Mark Rajkowski: Yeah. Listen, the… there's always opportunity in it. It doesn't come just from cost cutting and more productivity. That's important and that we do that, and we'll continue to do that months in and months out. I think the other part of it is also continuing to innovate and bringing new leading edge products, solutions, into that form, to Patrick's point earlier. This whole notion of opening the door with our AIA platform and digital solutions in the pool and bringing new higher end pumps and equipment in aftermarket is… there's a lot of potential there relative to the margin profile.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. I think the.. I think the… beyond just normal volume-driven leverage and productivity that we get in any one of our businesses -- and certainly most notably in Water Infrastructure given our strong market position there in terms of leadership. That, by definition, draws through very strong incrementals when you've got growth even if it's slower growth. But I think the really big deal here is on the innovation side. The new product development pipeline, by definition, as we continue to grow that pipeline. I think right now, as a company, we're up to 25% in our vitality index. That's up from 22% in the first quarter. And so, there's a continued ramp there that we're seeing and that pipeline drove through it. In our experience, these products that not only grow faster or technology grow faster than the average but they bring with them higher margins than the average. And so, that's a very meaningful part here of the story across each one of the three segments including Water Infrastructure.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: The final question will come from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Good morning. So, my question is pretty quick and easy. I just wanted to drill into the M&CS business. You mentioned that the visibility is good. You've had nice backlogs, but I wonder if you could delineate that between water, gas and electric because it sounds like the water was strong this quarter and you've got some tough comps in some of the others. I wonder about the visibility for 2020 with that funnel for gas and electric.
Mark Rajkowski: Well, we had some big wins a year-and-a-half-ago that were electric, gas and they're starting to roll off and where we've seen good success recently both domestically and internationally is in our water business. So, most of that is on the water side.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. The good news is also we just launched a brand-new product in the energy side as well. So, we expect that to get momentum in the market. I think we just announced that a few days ago publicly. So, we still feel good about the electric-and-gas side of the market, but certainly we're very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing on the water side which brings with higher margins.
Walter Liptak: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. With no further questions, I'll hand the floor back to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Great. Thank you.  So, thanks everybody for your time and attention this morning and patience – as we ran a little bit long here. Thanks for your continued support and interest and we look forward to seeing many of you out in the field. Otherwise, we'll be back in touch for our Q4 earnings call. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem third quarter earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 11:00:00) =====

Now, please turn to slide four, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter which reflect a continued strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Our organic topline growth was broad based driven by solid demand across our end markets and with orders and revenue growth tracking in the mid-single digits. This result marks our eighth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. This reflects the results of our focused investments that are bringing new solutions to the water sector and we believe will drive sustainable attractive margins. We also delivered solid margin expansion of 50 basis points in line with our guidance. In addition, we delivered earnings per share of $0.79 which was also in line with our expectations. That represented a 10% year-over-year increase excluding foreign exchange translation. As a result of sustained continuing healthy growth, we are narrowing our organic revenue guide and raising the midpoint to the upper end of the range. As a result of near-term mix and targeted investments to accelerate and sustain our growth, we are narrowing our EPS guide to the lower end of the range. We'll get into each of them in a bit more detail. Looking at the composition of our top line, our regional end-market mix is robust. We turn in solid performance in each of our end markets led by high single digit growth in both utilities and commercial. Regionally, we delivered particularly strong momentum in the US and in our largest emerging markets China and India, each of which grew double digits organically. The high growth in China and India is very pleasing, given we've invested considerably in product localization and our investments there are clearly paying off. Europe has seen some softening in certain markets, most considerably Italy and Germany driven by broad based industrial weakness. Generally, the rest of Europe shows a steadier picture. Mark will take us into the segment detail in a moment, but I would like to quickly point out that all three segments of our business have turned in solid performances. However, there is a more dynamic picture in MCS. We're very happy with the progress and growth of our Sensus business. Its revenue growth is outpacing Xylem overall, turning a 9% global growth in the quarter and solid double digits in North America. Our new AIA platform in MCS is in an earlier phase with growth ramp. The acceleration of customer interest is reflected in a 60% expansion of the total AIA deal pipeline over the past 12 months, led by a doubling of opportunities within the new digital solutions portion of that platform. Moreover, the size and incremental margin profile of that pipeline is very attractive and will be highly accretive to Xylem. The conversion of project to revenue has been slower than expected however. As with any new disruptive technology, our digital platform represents a new approach for customers. So many are prudently taking time to validate the solutions and savings. As that validation progresses, we are in fact seeing expansions of project scope. Despite slower conversion, the expanding market opportunity we are uncovering continues to affirm our long-term investment thesis. Our approach is to invest just ahead of the adoption curve in order to be positioned to realize the benefit of our first mover advantage and bringing digital intelligence to the water sector. To that end, we are scaling our sales and marketing capacity and continuing to add incremental capabilities to the AIA platform both organically and through M&A as we build out and integrate the portfolio. Lastly, before turning over to Mark, I do want to take this opportunity to shine a light on our commitment to sustainability. In developing our new 2025 goals, we took a bold aspirational approach in many industries and business models positive sustainability outcomes are a cost of doing business. For Xylem positive sustainability outcomes are a result of doing business. The technology that we sell address water scarcity, water affordability and resilience to climate change, all while dramatically reducing our customer's energy consumption. So the more business we do, the more technology we deploy, the more sustainability benefit we generate for the customers and the communities that we serve. The complete list of our commitments is in our sustainability report and a summary of our five signature goals is in the appendix of this earnings package. They are commitments to our shareholders and stakeholders alike, every bit as strong is our commitment to deliver robust growth and financial returns. Now let me turn over to Mark.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide five and I'll begin with our second quarter results. Our overall growth momentum continued in the second quarter with organic revenues up 5% Organic orders were also solid up 4% on a tough comparison of 8% growth last year. Most geographies saw healthy revenue growth led by the US, China, India and Australia which each grew double digits. However, we did have some specific pockets of slowing within Europe and Latin America due to negative prevailing economic conditions which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. All end markets saw positive organic revenue growth led by 8% in utilities, which was on top of a tough comparison of 11% growth in 2018. This was supported by mid-teens growth in the US where we saw robust growth across both the OpEx and CapEx sides of our utilities business. Industrial market was up 2%. Healthy project business and price realization in the U.S. combined with the continuation of strong construction and mining activity in our dewatering business was partially offset by moderating industrial demand in several regions. Continued strength in the US and double-digit growth in emerging markets drove commercial market revenues up 7% year-over-year. The residential market grew 1% which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter expanded 50 basis points to 14.3%. This was primarily driven by 280 basis points of cost savings from our productivity programs and 200 basis points of price realization which more than offset inflation, unfavorable mix and provided funding for our growth investments. Earnings per share was $0.79 in the quarter up 10% versus the prior year excluding foreign currency translations. Please turn to slide six, and I'll review our segment results. Water infrastructure maintained its top line growth momentum with 4% organic orders and 6% organic revenue growth in the quarter. It's worth noting this performance was on top of a tough comparison of an 11% revenue increase last year. Segment backlog was up 2% to $684 million at the end of the quarter with $449 million shippable this year. While our shippable backlog for the remainder of 2019 is flat, for 2020 and beyond it is up 10% organically, a very positive sign for future growth momentum in the segment. The US market was up mid-teens in both the utility and industrial end markets. Several large CapEx treatment projects and steady OpEx spending drove our strong utilities performance. Industrial was driven by another strong quarter from dewatering which continues to benefit from a healthy construction and rental market. Emerging markets were up 3% driven primarily by double digit growth in China more than offsetting declining demand due to economic weakness in Latin America and project timing in the Middle East. Western Europe declined 1% overall, reflecting low-single-digit growth in utilities, which was more than offset by softness in the industrial market. Segment operating margins grew 130 basis points to 19.1% driven by productivity savings price realization and volume leverage. I'm very pleased with the work the teams have been doing to continue to drive cost savings capture further price and share to fund our growth investments and expand margins. Please turn to slide seven, the applied water systems segment delivered 4% organic revenue growth and 1% organic orders growth in the quarter. Steady order activity in North America and Asia was largely offset by slowing orders in Europe. Overall backlog was $216 million at the end of the quarter, $175 million is expected to ship this year which is up 5% organically year-over-year. Geographically, Applied Water results were led by the U.S., up 7%, with growth across all end markets. Results were mixed in emerging markets, which were up 2% overall, led by double-digit growth in China, partially offset by declines in Latin America and the Middle East. Western Europe was down 4%, primarily from lower market demand, reflecting economic weakness in certain countries. End market revenue growth was led by commercial which was up 7%, while industrial revenues increased 1%. Growth in both end markets was driven primarily by delivering on a healthy project pipeline and price realization in the U.S. Segment operating margins were 16.8%. Inflation negatively impacted the segment's margins by 450 basis points, which included roughly 100 basis points of tariff-related cost. However, the team did an outstanding job capturing 350 basis points of price realization and driving 320 basis points of productivity to deliver 60 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Now please turn to slide eight. Measurement & Control Solutions grew orders 7% in the quarter and delivered 6% organic revenue growth. Segment backlog grew double digits year-over-year to $964 million, with $340 million expected to ship this year. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum within Sensus, especially the North American water business, which grew nearly 20% in the quarter. Software and services revenues were down 9%, primarily due to the lapping of a large high-margin software sale in Europe last year. The energy business grew 4% despite lapping last year's large Alliant project deployment and our test business revenues were up 1%. Segment operating margins were 8.7%, 40 basis points below the previous year and modestly below our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margins were down 30 basis points to 18.2%. Higher volume, price realization and productivity were more than offset by unfavorable mix in investments to grow our new AIA platform as well as pursue large AMI deployments. There are few moving parts to the MCS margins story that are important to unpack to understand the dynamics and relevant trajectory of the components within the segment. Our Sensus business had a terrific quarter. Organic revenues grew 9% and orders grew 13%. Sensus EBITDA margins of 20% expanded 180 basis points driven by volume leverage, price realization and productivity savings. Revenues across the AIA platform were down low single digits primarily due to delays in converting several large projects. This also had a meaningful impact on segment margins compared to our expectations as the digital solution revenues have a very attractive margin profile. Despite the delay in converting projects to revenues in the quarter, we continue to invest to scale our digital solutions business globally to position us to leverage our first-mover advantage. Year-over-year investments to build out our digital intelligence solutions as well as global commercial and service capabilities reduced segment margins by about 100 basis points in the quarter. Importantly, we see very strong customer engagement and growing interest in our expanding digital solutions project pipeline. And we continue to expect this business will be an important source of revenue growth in margin expansion for the future. Please turn to slide nine for an overview of the company's financial position. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $383 million. We returned $43 million to our shareholders in the quarter through dividends. $60 million was invested in CapEx, which is in line with our plan, and we continue to expect our full year CapEx spend to be between $230 million and $240 million. Our working capital in the second quarter increased 160 basis points year-over-year to 21.1%. This primarily reflects timing as we continue to be impacted by inventory price at the end of the prior year as well as inventory build in the first quarter related to tariffs and Brexit. This will be worked down through the back half of this year. Free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 45%, which improved the quarter sequentially but is below the prior year, largely reflecting the year-over-year timing related to working capital in CapEx investments as well as higher cash tax payments we made in the second quarter of 2019. Keep in mind, that the first half of the year is a seasonally weaker cash flow period than the second half, where we have historically generated between 75% and 90% of our full year cash flow. We continue to forecast improvement as the year progresses, and we remain committed to our target of 105% cash conversion for the year. Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover our 2019 end market outlook.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. Our view on end markets for the remainder of the year include some small changes in the guidance we provided last quarter, and we will now be narrowing to the upper end of our original growth guidance range. Our healthy orders and backlog support confidence in our growth expectations for the balance of the year and beyond. In the utilities market, we now expect mid to high single-digit growth, led by a solid U.S. where a healthy aftermarket environment and our project and deal pipeline and water infrastructure in Sensus provide confidence in our outlook. The regulatory mandates and core infrastructure investments in China and India are also expected to continue. In industrial, we now believe our growth outlook is closer to the low single digits. While the U.S. market continues to be steady and our Applied Water project pipeline remains robust, we do expect there to be some moderation in the second half. We're also seeing weaker economic conditions in certain European countries, which we believe will impact us through the balance of the year. Our outlook for the commercial market remains unchanged at mid-single digits. Our residential outlook is now flat to low single-digit growth. Please turn to slide 11, and we will provide guidance for the remainder of 2019. We started in the first half of the year with strong top line growth of 6% and continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits of 4% to 5% in the second half and 5% to 6% for the full year. We're adjusting our operating margin outlook to a range of 14.3% to 14.5%. This represents healthy expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of 20% to 20.2%. This updated outlook takes into account our performance to date and also reflect the softer growth in Europe and project conversion timing in our AIA business. Having said that, we will continue to drive healthy margin expansion across our entire platform so that we deliver our commitments for this year and beyond. Moving on to adjusted earnings per share. We're narrowing our outlook to a range of $3.12 to $3.22, which reflects the items I just mentioned regarding margin. This represents year-over-year growth of between 8% and 12%. Finally, we continue to expect 105% free cash flow conversion, and we're executing on our plans. Let me now turn it back over to Mark to walk through some of our other full year and third quarter details.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Slide 12 includes a seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our planning assumptions. By segment, we are narrowing our full year organic revenue growth guidance as follows: we expect 6% to 7% organic growth in Water Infrastructure; 3% to 4% in Applied Water; and 5% to 6% growth in Measurement & Control Solutions. We have lowered our full year estimated effective tax rate from 19.5% to 19%. We continue to assume a euro rate of 1.12, and as usual, our FX sensitivity table is located in the appendix. Our restructuring and realignment costs of $60 million to $70 million remain unchanged for the full year. In the third quarter, we expect an overall company growth rate of 4% to 5%, led by steady U.S. utility market and continued growth in China and India. Our expected growth rates for the third quarter by segment are 4% to 5% in Water Infrastructure; 3% to 4% in Applied Water; and 5% to 6% for Measurement & Control Solutions. Third quarter adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.1%, representing 40 or 50 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Measurement & Control Solutions is expected to expand segment margins 20 to 40 basis points in the quarter. We expect 40 to 60 basis points of margin expansion in Water Infrastructure and 30 to 50 basis points of improvement in Applied Water systems. Now please turn to slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: So to wrap up, we are demonstrating solid and consistent growth with healthy margin expansion. We're pleased that our teams are working hard to outperform the market, enabling us to meet our financial commitments, while also continuing to invest in future growth. We have healthy top line momentum and strong project backlog, which gives confidence in continuing mid-single-digits revenue growth through the second half into 2020 and beyond as we continue to drive solid margin expansion. In that regard, we also look forward to providing you with an updated view of our long-term targets and strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, which we are targeting to be sometime early next year. We will have more details to come on this in our third quarter earnings update. So with that, operator, we are happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Nate.
Mark Rajkowski: Good morning, Nate.
Nathan Jones: I'd like to talk a little bit more about the reduction in the margin guidance here. There's no change to the restructuring and realignment costs that the revenue numbers here is still pretty strong. So, it doesn't look like you see anything structurally that needs to be addressed in the business. So maybe if we could start with AIA because you guys called out mix and investments as the two main causes for the reduction here. Can you talk about the investment trajectory in AIA? I think it was supposed to begin to ramp down as we went into the back half of the year. Is this related to delays in the projects ramping up? Or is it because you see more opportunities to go off that? Just some color around that.
Patrick Decker: Sure. I'll take that first, Nate. I think it might be helpful for folks to understand kind of what's the waterfall and bridge on the net EPS reduction in terms of lowering the lower end of the guidance range. You're really looking at about $0.04 is coming from, again, the weaker Europe, just given how rich that margin is on our businesses, so we are reflecting that into our guide right now. Secondly, probably about $0.04 attributable to AIA, and that is a combination of the slower ramp in terms of converting projects to revenue than we expected, although we are seeing scoped increase and we're seeing the funnel, as I mentioned before, has more than doubled in the digital solutions piece of that platform, so we're very encouraged. And based upon that, we are holding our investments. So, there's a little bit more in there, but we have four investment that we had originally talked about. And then the way we have been mitigating that $0.08 of kind of impact is about $0.03 coming from stronger performance, most notably in the U.S. utility market that we expect to continue through the balance of the year.
Mark Rajkowski: I mean, we've talked about that on our last call and we have a number of actions that are well underway related to simplifying the organization, improving our speed and agility. And those are tracking to our expectations.
Nathan Jones: Maybe another one on AIA here. I think the anticipation from these projects is that they began to ramp-up kind of later in 2019 and really started to hit stride in 2020, and drove some pretty good growth, potentially double-digit growth in the MCS segment next year. Does that push this out a little bit? Do you still see those ramping up later in the year? Is that kind of number in 2020 still in play? Or has it shifted to the right a little bit here?
Patrick Decker: No. I'd say it's still in play for 2020. And what we also see, we step back and I think you've done a good job, Nate, in kind of parsing. There are two pieces of this MCS segment, and I think folks oftentimes lump them all together. Two very different pieces. There's Sensus, which is really being driven by good core North America water growth, which is a combination of day-to-day business but also we are seeing -- we're winning a number of AMI, large AMI deals in that space. And so that's certainly going to drive very strong growth late this year in MCS, but also certainly in 2020 and beyond. The second piece is AIA, and even with an AIA, there is the traditional core, the pure business that we acquired. But there are also a number of these smaller, about 7 of this smaller technology we've acquired in the last few years that we build out to be our digital solutions platform in that business. And that's really the -- and our core pure business actually continue to grow nicely and pretty much on plan or above plan in the quarter and for the full year. Really, that new digital solutions platform that we're seeing tremendous uptick in the funnel, but converting those from a concept into orders and revenue has taken a little longer than we had anticipated. So net-net, to your answer, we see no change in kind of outlook for 2020. If anything, this further strengthens our view on that based upon the quality and the degree of uptake in terms of customer interest.
Nathan Jones: That’s useful color. Thanks very much. I’ll pass it on.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Nate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane.
Mark Rajkowski: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: I'd like to pick it up right there where you ended off with Nate. So on MCS, broadly, thank you for emphasizing that distinction between Sensus and AIA. Sensus is executing really well from our perspective, and we did note that one of Sensus' competitors negatively preannounced this quarter, it looks like they're losing share and you all seem to be outgrowing the market nicely. So that's good news.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Deane.
Deane Dray: So on AIA, so not too surprised that it's taking time for this from project wins into revenue. You all have disruptive technologies and the water industry is notoriously slow to adopt. So the way I look at it, and just would love to hear your comments on how each of these factors might be at play, but there's three factors. So do you have the right -- I will take you all three. Do you have the right pricing model yet on these? Because are customers are balking at the price, the Network as a Service contingency kind of payments, so do you have the right model? Or are customers just notoriously slow to adopt and are just taking their time? Or is it macro worries before a little nervous about throwing the switch and committing to the capital? So how do these three factors play out?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Now you've laid it out well, Deane. I would -- the two factors I would pretty much -- I would certainly eliminate the last which is any kind of macro fiscal concerns, we're not seeing that. And if anything, what we're seeing, part of the reasons why there's as much excitement as there is and we are seeing scope expansion in a number of these areas is because what we're really hitting at in a big way here is the affordability issue. And so these technologies, as you well know, and others may or may not know, are getting at the affordability issue in terms of how do you take large-scale CapEx projects and make them more affordable. And secondly, how do you extend the life and performance of the existing assets. So all of those play very well into the whole affordability equation. What that literally leads to is there is still some work that we're doing around making sure that we got the optimal revenue model here in terms of how we share value in that given how much we're able to disrupt. But I would say right now the predominant issue is that these are breakthrough technologies. Utilities are conservative, as they should be, and so they want to make sure that they validate the savings, the functionality of this, and it is new and disruptive. And so what we're seeing though is the reason why there is such an increase in this funnel at this point in time, is word is spreading. Utilities are talking to each other and sharing the pilots that they're looking at getting involved in. And so I really think that this is simply a matter of timing of ramp. The margins that we see in terms of incremental margins are extremely attractive, very accretive to the overall Xylem, so there's no change in outlook there. And so that's why we're still so encouraged and that's why we said we'd still need to continue our investments in this slightly ahead of the adoption curve. We're not going to go crazy about it we don't need to, but we're still very, very encouraged by what we see.
Deane Dray: That's great to hear. And I really do like seeing the additional investments, even though there's a margin hit associated with it, that's, from our perspective, it's the right thing to do. And just second unrelated question. Lots of anxiety about trade tensions, but it looks like your China business continues to turn very nicely. Maybe just characterize the tone of business, the funnel in China where there are opportunities?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Thanks, Deane. So I think Mark may have mentioned, we expect to note double-digit growth in 2019, which is down from 23% in 2018, so moderate slightly. But -- so two-thirds of business in China is tied to utilities and is relatively well protected. You'll recall that even during the last downturn in China, that part of our business didn't actually decline. It actually held pretty steady and strong. And what's really driving that is, again, water environment quality continues to be a top policy mandate for the Chinese government, as driven by the citizens of the country. And so we still consider to see very strong pipeline on the bidding site, et cetera. The area that we do keep a close eye on as well as the other third that is tied to industrial and commercial building. We've not seen any downturn in that business, we don't see any signs of such there. So we remain still quite bullish on China. One of the questions we also get is given that we're servicing kind of critical government infrastructure, is there any risk that we could be targeted at some point in time? And we don't see that. And we keep a close eye on that. We don't see it right now because, as you've seen, Deane, when you visited our facilities there in China, we are a Chinese company in China. I mean there's -- we have the total look and feel of a Chinese company. It just happens that access to global leading technologies along the way, and so we don't really see that we have a threat there.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Trying to get a sense of -- I know it's very different by business for you guys on inventory levels and such, but some of the declines you saw in Western Europe, would you attribute a certain percentage of that inventory destock? Or is it -- do you already have line of sight sell-through that is pretty consistent?
Mark Rajkowski: Our view on that, Scott, is that there is clearly a slowing in economic conditions. Certainly, we've seen that in Italy, we've seen that in Germany and a couple of other countries. And so, it's really not an overstocked position relative to what's been sold into the channels, but just more of a slowing in the broader economies in some of these countries.
Patrick Decker: Yes, we would say, Scott, that we certainly don't see really anything being attributed to a destocking of inventories. And we've got quite a good line of sight on the businesses there in Europe, which tend to be more of a direct channel. We do have some indirect but we got a healthy direct channel as well.
Scott Davis: Yes. I know that's tough. There's a lot of nuances there, and this is just a follow-up. I know, pure is a really cool asset, but you also paid a pretty good price for it too, it wasn't free.
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Scott Davis: So how is it tracking versus the deal model? And are you getting the kind of revenue take rates that you expected? Or should I say it a different way, with you guys as the owner, have you been able to really drive that model to your liking?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Scott, I think there's still plenty of demand. One of the things that we've been working on and investing in is growing out our international business. And there's a lot of activity. This is all new to our teams. We're leveraging the existing commercial capabilities that we have there. Frankly, that's one of the areas that we need to continue to invest in so we can accelerate some of the growth for opportunities that are clearly there. There's a lot of demand. But as we've talked about it, it's a very different value proposition, it's a different set of selling skills, there is solutions. And so we're migrating up that curve as well. That's probably a little bit slower than we would have liked at this point, but it's not for lack of underlying customer excitement and demand.
Patrick Decker: Yes, the way I'd characterize is, Scott, is there's the pure, the DS and pure technology that we acquired. And that certainly has always been intended to serve as the kind of fundamental platform of some of these new digital solutions that we have acquired through other startups. So the pure business is delivering as we expect this year. It's on plan. The plan's obviously driven by deal model, so that piece is there. I think what you're seeing right now and you hear us talking about the pushing out of some of the AIA demand is really being driven by the other small startups that we put together and are integrating into the new digital solutions platform. So, when we talk about some of the validation of savings and these delays and some of the adoption in terms of getting the procurement at the utility, we're really talking about the digital solutions part of the AIA platform, not really the pure piece.
Scott Davis: Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Good luck, guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
John Walsh: I guess the first question around the margin bridge implied in Q4, can you kind of help unpackage what swings in terms of mix, in terms of restructuring savings, just to kind of get comfortable with the ramp there year-on-year. I think a bunch of it probably comes from leveraging the better organic sales growth in Q4, but anyway to help unpackage that natural buckets would be helpful.
Mark Rajkowski: Sure, John. No doubt, nice ramp there in Q4. Typically, that is our highest margin quarter and you hit on one of the drivers. It's just there's really good volume leverage. The other thing is that I think you touched on also, and we talked earlier one of the questions related to cost reductions from some of the restructuring actions that we've put in place that really ramped significantly in Q4 relative to the timing of when folks are leaving. And I would also mention that the inflation comp starts to get a lot easier than what we've been living with in the first half of the year as some of these tariffs lap, our component shortages are lapping. And we're going to see better mix too. We're going to see better mix in a number of our businesses, including M&CS. I mean, we had a lot of volume last year that had low margins related to some of these large deployments where it was installation-related. So those are really the key drivers that gives us confidence that we will see that ramp in Q4.
Patrick Decker: The other thing I would add is on that mix comment, just to make a finer point there is last year's project revenue was heavily oriented towards the energy side of the equation with heavy install and lower margin on that whereas the mix this quarter in Q4 is going to be heavily water, which carries a much larger incremental margin on it than it does on I think the energy side.
John Walsh: Got you. And then thinking about the current order growth, I mean, obviously, you've been 4% now the last two quarters on very tough comps. You still have very difficult comps here in the back half. But you know, as we think about the mid-single-digit growth construct kind of going forward and into next year, what do you need to see in terms of margins? I mean in orders? What are you guys looking for in terms of order acceleration potentially in the back half? And what drives that?
Patrick Decker: Yes. So I'd lay it out this way, if you look at our three segments are going to be behaving, I think, or going to probably diverge a little bit here in ways that you haven't seen over the last, I'd say, 1.5 to 2 years, where they've all -- they've each kind of been running in that mid-single-digit growth in terms of both revenues and orders. That begins to diverge a little bit so we do expect that Applied Water will likely moderate back to more of a GDP level growth. We hope to outperform that, but that would be in that kind of low single-digit range. And we're seeing some of that right now play out, as you saw in the orders in Mark's commentary. Water Infrastructure has historically been in that mid-single-digit growth, both in terms of orders as well as organic revenue. And as we mentioned in the quarter, it was up 4% orders, it was against an 8% comp last year in Water Infrastructure. We don't see that changing so we feel good about that. And really what you begin to see happening here is MCS begins to ramp, and so we do expect those order growths to continue to grow, increase in terms of the rate as well as the organic revenue growth both back half of this year, but also certainly in 2020 and beyond. So you're going to see a little divergence there amongst the three segments that give us confidence around that mid-single-digit organic growth continuing.
John Walsh: Great. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning and Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you could actually talk a little bit more about the order book from a pricing perspective. And just give us some take on the success you're having in getting price in this environment? And if so, where?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Ryan, we've seen really good success in terms of pricing. We continue to get price in U.S. They actually led the way and worked early to drive good price realization. You saw that particularly this quarter in AWS, which had 350 basis points of price. Europe got on board a little bit later. And even Emerging Markets now is driving for price. And I think most encouraging is what we saw in M&CS, particularly around the Sensus business, where they are not only driving very strong volumes but also driving good price as well. So when you think about backlogs, I mean our strongest backlogs are in M&CS. A lot of that is Sensus and we feel pretty good about that.
Ryan Connors: Okay. And then my other one is just you've talked a lot about the utility and Sensus and AIA but you haven't really gone as much into the industrial side and you didn't have kind of a negative revision to your outlook there. If you can just kind of unpack the different pieces within industrial? And what's -- where the outlook is? Is it still better? And where the headwinds are coming from.
Mark Rajkowski: Sure. Yes, on the industrial side, let me comment on the full year rather than give you a headache quarter-by-quarter. On the full year, we continue to see solid growth in the U.S., And really there, it's the fact that we're really tied to more of a general light industry. Most of the products resolve there are on a periphery of an industrial complex. And so as long as these complexes are up and running, they're going to burn through our pumps and our treatment needs. And so we see that continuing to grow in a healthy clip. We also see positives in dewatering on the rental side. We continue to see a very healthy market there. I would say, outside of the U.S., its mixed. You see strength in parts of Asia, and we also see depth of softness in Europe and across the Middle East. And in Europe, it's not entirely broad based, I mean, it's really concentrated on a certain number of markets. We do see some divergence there in Europe. But right now, we're just calling that. We're trying to be prim here. It's a very short cycle business, as you all know, for us in the industrial side.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Thanks for all the color.
Mark Rajkowski: No worries.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Walter Liptak: I wanted to ask what about the AIA investment. Considering the delays, is that changing anything about your M&A pipeline or your thoughts about timing of deals or other technologies that you might need?
Patrick Decker: Not at all. Not at all. As I mentioned before, but it's worth reiterating, when we think about M&A and utilities, we do think about this predominantly by end-market or vertical, not exclusively. But that's certainly one lens we look at it through. I'd say on the utility side, we do have a very robust platform now of solution sets that we can bring to the utility customers both on the clean water side, the wastewater side and the outdoor water side, but that's not to say we don't still have -- as we're in there talking to these leaders and learning even more about what some of the other pain points are, there's still a few things out there that we would like to bring into the portfolio. They'll again be smaller tuck-in type acquisitions. So no, it doesn't change our view on that. It, quite frankly, makes it more robust. But having said that, there really aren't that many more things out there that we really have led a site to that we're interested in at this point of time. We're really focus on executing on the platform that we've built.
Walter Liptak: Okay. Great. And then just a couple on the sector outlooks. You mentioned in industrial the second half in the U.S. being a little bit weaker. Is that just related to some of the PMIs that have come down and generally slower industrial? Or is there something else going on?
Mark Rajkowski: It's -- we think it's solid to up slightly. It's really what's driving the industrial change in our outlook is what Patrick mentioned before which is really some of the softening conditions and some of what appear to be recessionary trends in parts of Europe. But U.S. we think will remain pretty solid.
Patrick Decker: Yes. I think it's in the U.S. If anything, it's more of a tough comp -- tougher comp in the second half of the year. Kind of mid-single digit last year, that will probably moderate back down to low-single digit in the U.S. It's not, I think, maybe a little bit behind your question, is there any going on in the channel the inventory levels, we're not seeing that, at least in our business.
Walter Liptak: Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Small residential, you talked about the U.S. flattening but I think there is some other companies out there they're saying there's signs of strengthening going on in residential. Are you seeing any hope that the low interest rates in good U.S. economy might be turning residential around finally?
Patrick Decker: We certainly, we always hope so, but I guess it is not a large piece of our business and so we, at this point in time, we just kind of call it based on what we see right now. We haven't seen that kind of recovery so we didn't feel it was prudent to going to bake that into an outlook.
Walter Liptak: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Hey, Joe.
Mark Rajkowski: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Giordano: So I just wanted to go back to the kind of ramp as we go through the year here. Just standing check my math. If we're looking at 3Q margins of like roughly 15 and you have a pretty narrow range for the full year expectation on adjusted Op, are we talking like comfortably over 17 for 4Q? I know Mark talked through some of the things hitting in 4Q, but we've seen kind of modest year-on-year expansion through the year, a decline in 1Q and then we're talking like 200-plus basis points in 4Q, so I just really want to make sure I understand how that plays out.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Joe, I'd say I wouldn't say it's way over -- comfortably over 17. I think upwards of 200 basis points is certainly what our expectations would be.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. Is that including any of the benefits from the back-office stuff that was kind of getting pushed out? Or is that still a 2020 phenomenon?
Mark Rajkowski: It's limited. I mean, we just launched our latest wave in July, but we're -- there are benefits there. Well behind the track from where we expect to be as we enter the year. And that still pushes out into 2020. And so there's certainly more benefits ahead of us in the fourth quarter.
Patrick Decker: I mean you're looking roughly, Joe, the right math. It is about 180 basis points of margin expansion in Q4 and as Mark mentioned earlier, really is being driven by we do have other restructuring that we announced last quarter that is cost takeout, most notably within our European business but also within our Water Infrastructure, the MCS businesses, MCS have little bit there as well that really ramps in Q4. You definitely have the attractive volume leverage given a mix of revenues are going to be heavily skewed towards Water Infrastructure and MCS which are going to be higher margins for us. And then as Mark pointed out earlier, we have some easier comps on the inflationary side which is noteworthy when you look at the quarter sequential. That's about 50 bps itself.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Is the big failure order you have got, is that in orders already? Is it in backlog?
Mark Rajkowski: Joe, it's in backlog. It's not in orders yet.
Joseph Giordano: It's not in orders yet? Okay. So when do you expect that to start hitting? And can you maybe talk through the timing of one that deploys into revenue and what the margin kind of -- is that accretive to MCS? How do we think about that?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. Joe, it's certainly our expectation is to see that start to hit in the back half of this year, probably more in fourth quarter. And it's full-bore into 2020. It's a water deal and so the margins are certainly attractive relative to the energy side of the business.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. And maybe last for me, just more high-level. If I think through bolt-on technologies that makes sense for MCS, is there an obvious thing missing right now like some of the stuff that you bolted on recently seems like it fit pretty very clearly into what you're doing. But I guess as we fill out that portfolio, finding obvious holes is a little more challenging. So is there anything that strikes you as we can put a proxy out instead of doing R&D and figuring something out internally if we can go buy something there a piece that is interesting to you Patrick?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I mean there are still few things out there. I probably prefer, Joe, not to come on them publicly because to the extent they are M&A, I don't want to drive the piece up. There is not -- it's not a long list. There are probably a few to a handful of things that are out there that would be, I don’t say -- just kind of nice to have, but they would address some other pain points. As you think about what we're really bringing to bear here is the capability with our digital solutions platform to be able to go to the utility and work with their operating folks. And better understand how they can drive and improve performance of their existing assets and bring down the costs of the new capital that they are putting in place and get with what they already have. So, when you think about the landscape of the utility, what their operating budgets are driven by, both CapEx and OpEx, there's a myriad of things that one can do by mining the data for them. And that's, in a simple way, what we're looking to doing in addition to others. And so we'll keep you guys abreast of acquisitions as they come along. They’re not going to be large acquisitions. They’re going to be tuck-ins and bolt-ons. And I think as we get into Investor Day early next year, that will be a good form for us to kind of paint the picture for everyone as to what are the gaps that we filled out here and what's the landscape that we are operating in.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Back on your comments regarding M&A, the fact that it's not a priority as you see it right now. Given the amount of free cash flow that you're generating above and beyond the dividend, what are your latest thoughts on buyback as a way of deploying that surplus cash?
Patrick Decker: Sure, this is Patrick. Just to clarify, my comment was not that we're not interested in M&A, I am specifically talking about the utility space and the bolt-on kind of digital solutions. So we continue to see M&A as an appropriate enabler of our long-term growth in the company. And I mentioned on other calls that some of the other areas that we're focused on whether that be, again, continuing to look at areas in the industrial water landscape is one example, and there are others that are out there. There's nothing -- I'm not foreshadowing anything here, all I'm saying is we continue to see that as our priority to deploy cash but only for smart disciplined transactions that are out there. So we would certainly be looking to do that before we would be talking about doing share repurchase.
Mark Rajkowski: But we also recognize that unduly large amounts of cash on the balance sheet -- they're not sustainable. So we look at if we see there's nothing out there that we expect to need it for, we certainly look at repurchasing shares.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. Let me follow-up on what you referenced at the very beginning of the call which is your ESG targets. As I look at your set of targets, separate from some of the kind of philanthropic or charity stuff, do you look at these as margin enhancers? Or are they actually a cost of doing?
Patrick Decker: No. We view these things as very much -- we try to be very clear when we speak externally as well as internally to our folks. And we actually had a great kind of podcast here internally just last week between myself and the executive sponsor of our sustainability program who happens to be our general council. And she and I did a terrific event here I think with our colleagues, really reinforcing to them that we don't have a sustainability strategy that sits separate from our business strategy, they go hand-in-hand. And so the more that we are able to deliver on the signature goals that we laid out here, no doubt that's also good for business. But that's not the only reason we're doing it. We're doing it because we really believe that we have the responsibility here to really make a positive big impact for communities and for our customers and for our suppliers, but it's also all about making sure that we attract, retain the top talent across the landscape. And people nowadays, as you all know, they want to believe something larger than themselves and they want to work for a company as a purpose. And we're not the only one out there, I realized that. But that's what's really driving these sustainability goals. It's good for business, it's good for the planet, it's good for everyone involved and we have a unique opportunity and a role to play here and we're doing so. And so that's why you want to move well beyond kind of motherhood and apple pie on just a few things that most companies talk about, in sustainability, we have an opportunity to make a much broader impact than just a few key areas.
Pavel Molchanov: I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Patrick Decker: Hey, Brian.
Mark Rajkowski: Hey, Brian.
Brian Lee: Maybe two quick ones and then I'll let us all wrap here. In China, it sounded like results were pretty good but then you did make a little bit of pullout around slowing growth as part of the update for the industrial end market outlook here. Maybe can you elaborate on that? Is that a general flowing in the macro? Tougher comps? Or is there something else going on there?
Patrick Decker: We wouldn't want to overstate any commentary around softness in the industrial in China. We had some tough comps there. It's rather a small piece of our overall business in China. So, we're not probably in the best position to make a call on broader China industrial landscape. We're not seeing anything noteworthy there. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add any commentary?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. As you said, the comps are tough and it's solid, it's steady, but we grew over 20% in the prior year. So there is no underlying fundamental issue that we see.
Patrick Decker: The primary driver of our growth in China is really the utility side, and it's really the investments being made by the government there across-the-board. So that kind of masks what we see in the industrial space, which again, is just really -- it's a tough comp. So no big read through there on our part.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on pricing, I know, I think you had mentioned maybe last quarter that MCS may see more of a tailwind in the second half due to some of the later pricing actions that played out for that segment. So with some of the mixed commentary and the AIA conversion delays, is there any change in that view around pricing trends for that particular segment as we move through the back half?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, Brian. One of the encouraging things that we did see, team really got after it this year and we had, it was 100 basis points, maybe a little bit more of price improvement. And we'd expect that to continue through the remainder of this year.
Patrick Decker: And I think a big driver of that, Brian, as we mentioned before, I believe, is more so in the MCS business and certainly Sensus than other segments. These are oftentimes long lead time projects that we would have been locked in. So until new projects have been executed, it's hard to get prices. So team has done a great job on some recent projects on implementing those price increases and that's why you see it really ramp from the first half to the second half of the year.
Mark Rajkowski: And on replacement, the year's end points being sold into their channels as well
Brian Lee: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. I'd now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Well, thank you. And thanks for all your time, interest and support. We appreciate your involvement this morning. Thanks for the questions. I'm sure we'll see many of you at conferences and other places in between, so enjoy the balance of your summer, and safe travels, and we'll be in touch on our Q3 earnings call. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem's second quarter earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Xylem First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open a few questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions].

Patrick Decker: Thanks Matt, Good morning everyone, thanks for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. We continue to see strong top line growth and healthy demand in the first quarter but frankly we were disappointed with missing our guidance for margin and earnings. Lower margin performance was driven by the mix of products that we sold and operational factors that we should have identified and planned for, most notably in our sales and operations planning process. We take our commitments very seriously and we care deeply about doing what we say we are going to do as our track record has shown over the past five plus years and we have taken corrective actions to address these shortfalls. We are pleased with our continued growth momentum, remain very excited about our ongoing growth prospects and an achieving healthy margin expansion for the remainder of this year and well beyond. Now, let me review some of the other key details. We once again delivered solid organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. We saw gains across all of our end markets, highlighted by the continued mid single digit growth in our largest sector utilities. This continues to represent above market growth in a healthy market. From a geographical standpoint, the U.S. market produced strong revenue growth with an 11% increase year-over-year. This included double digit growth in utilities and at least mid single digit growth in our other end markets. The emerging markets continue to be healthy and build momentum as well up 12% overall with particularly, strong performance in Asia and Latin America. India and China saw strong gains once again. India increased 58% with growth in transport and treatment, as well as the beginning of our deployment of a large Sensus metrology project, China was up 14%. And looking forward, we remain very confident about long-term growth opportunities in these markets. Turning to orders, we saw 4% increase in the quarter this is on top of 10% orders growth in the first quarter of last year. And there are clear signs of continued strength with a 10% growth in backlog. Another important achievement, which is reflected in our backlog growth, is our recent deal with Philadelphia Water, announced in early February. This project focuses on smart metering infrastructure that incorporates our FlexNet communications technology. It is an example of the synergistic deals since the acquisition of Sensus that we are now uniquely positioned to secure and execute by leveraging strength from across our portfolio. It is also a key milestone because with this award, we have now won contracts that represent nearly $200 million of revenue synergies, which exceeds our previously stated revenue synergy goal from the 2017 Investor Day of between $150 million to $175 million. It further highlights the power and sustainable long-term growth profile of our portfolio. Based on the strategy we have executed and acquisitions made, we are now positioned to offer solutions that target the most crucial issues facing our customers, challenges by water affordability, water scarcity and resilience, this is accelerating demand for our solutions. Our advanced infrastructure analytics or AIA platform is a clear example of this. That platform saw accelerated market momentum in the quarter with orders growth of over 30%. We are building a robust pipeline with increasing interest of utilities in U.S. and a growing presence in Europe and Asia. Now, let me turn now to our margin performance, which was impacted by two primary factors. The first was unfavorable revenue mix that was an expected test and European aftermarket and service revenues. The second was unfavorable overhead absorption in a couple of about key factories, due to some demand planning decisions we made to optimize our inventory levels. Simply put, we still had a better process in place to align forecasted demand with production, we have taken steps to address our sales and operating planning process and we are confident that these margin effects are largely behind us. I am now going to hand it over to Mark, who is going to give additional detail on the quarter, Mark?
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5 and I will begin with our first quarter results. I am pleased with the continued market momentum we saw throughout the first quarter. Organic orders growth of 4% was in line with our expectations, very solid considering the tough comparison to last year's 10% growth. Revenues were up 6% in the quarter in at the high end of our revenue guidance. We had strong revenue growth across the majority of our geographic regions, led by the 12% growth in emerging markets and the 11% growth in the U.S. China continued its strong growth trend with revenues up 14% with growth across each segment. Western Europe declined 2%, which was in line with our forecast and driven by a tough comparison to last year's first quarter, where we had significant software sale in several large treatment project deliveries. Each of our end markets grew in the quarter with continued strength in utilities market up 6% and 12% growth in commercial building services, which benefited from strong price realization, better than expected market conditions, end products. Industrial and residential end markets both delivered solid growth of 4%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, down 30 basis points from the prior year. Cost reductions from our productivity programs in accelerating price realizations of 170 basis points where more than offset by inflation, growth investments and weaker sales mix. Part of the weaker mix of revenue was driven by lower than expected sales in a high margin test in service and aftermarket businesses in Europe. We also had lower than expected overhead cost absorption in our applied water and water infrastructure segments. This was driven by lower production levels during the quarter to better align inventory to our market demand to optimize working capital. As Patrick mentioned, we have taken actions to better align our sales and operating planning processes and put this operational issues behind us. Earnings per share in the quarter were 52 cents, up 12% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency translation. Please turn to Slide 7 and I will review our segment results. Water infrastructure; organic orders grew 2% in the quarter. This growth is on top of a tough comparison with 13% orders growth last year, where treatment orders grew 27% from several large project wins. Segment backlog was $700 million at the end of the quarter with $525 billion shippable in 2019. This is up 5% over last year. Our treatment bidding pipeline, which we view as a bellwether of the health of the underlying utilities market, grew mid single digits this quarter, driven by growing project work in India and new opportunities in North America. Water infrastructure revenues grew 7% in the quarter. Transport application revenues were up 7% benefiting from high single-digit growth in both the utility and industrial end markets. The strength in utilities was fueled by strong aftermarket sales in storm water resilience work in the US and may change growth in China from wastewater project deliveries. Industrial revenues were driven by our dewatering business, which was up 12% in the quarter with good growth in the mining and construction workers. Treatment application revenues grew 4% in the quarter from project deliveries in the US in emerging markets where momentum remains strong. Emerging market revenue growth was 10% driven by India, which grew 19%, in China, which grew 21% in the quarter. With many of the major utilities in China, now completing projects to comply with water regulations, we are turning our focus to smaller and medium sized utilities to build or upgrade their treatment facilities to meet these regulations. We see a significant opportunity for growth in this segment of the China market in a pipeline for these projects is expanding. In Western Europe, revenues were down as expected from lapping large treatment project deliveries last year. However, sales from our aftermarket and service business was softer than expected, which negatively impacted our mix of revenues in March. Operating margin for the segment increased to 110 basis points,12.4% compared to last year. Cost reductions, strong price realization, volume leverage more than offset inflation, a weaker sales mix investments to grow our business and lower overhead absorption. Please turn to Slide 7. The applied water systems segment delivered 6% organic orders growth over the prior year. Segment backlog was $222 million at the end of the quarter, with $194 million due to ship in 2019. This is up 12% over last year. Segment revenues in the quarter grew 7% versus the prior year and we saw solid growth across each end market led by commercial business services. Geographically, we saw broad-based organic growth with the U.S., up 7%, Western Europe growing 4% and we had very strong growth of 16% in the emerging markets led by China which grew more than 30% driven by new project activity. Segment operating margin for the quarter was 15.6%, which reflects 110 basis points of improvement compared to last year. Cost reduction is 300 basis points of price realization more than offset higher inflation, lower overhead absorption and foreign exchange headwinds. Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement and control solutions had 5% organic orders growth in the quarter, which is on top of 12% orders growth in last year's first quarter. Total backlog for this segment was $980 million at the end of the quarter, up 16%, with $400 million shippable in 2019, which is up 19% year-over-year. We continue to gain momentum in the segment with new contract wins. We expect growth in margins to ramp throughout the year as previously announced contract wins, including our recent win with Philadelphia Water will begin to deploy later in the second half of this year. Segment revenues grew 5% organically in the quarter. The water business grew 15% driven by strength in the North American market from continued demand for a iPerl meters and AMI deployments for smaller and mid-sized utility customers. SaaS and other service revenues were down 3% as expected as the segment lapse the large software sales in Europe during the first half of last year. Energy, which is a combination of our electric and gas offering so, revenues declined 7% due to low lapping of the Alliant project deployment from last year. Test application revenues were flat in the quarter and below our expectations as the shipment of a large project was delayed by customer into the second quarter. AIA organic revenues grew 10% in the quarter with growth across multiple regions. Strong customer interest continues for these new solutions and we are penetrating new markets as we leverage existing Xylem channels in customer relationships. Segment operating margins contracted 420 basis points to 7.4%. Benefits from volume growth and cost reductions were more than offset by inflation, in favorable mix impact from last year, high-margin software sale and investments to accelerate the growth of our AIA platform. We were also impacted by lower than expected revenues in our high margin test business. The good news is that we saw some improvement in the availability of components and expect that challenge to be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. We continue to outlook strong margin expenditures for the second half of 2019, driven by improving mix, the scaling of our AIA platform in buying market. One new challenge we were working through all of our order processing delays that we are experiencing in getting product from our Mexican supplier into the U.S. The team is managing this well to minimize impacts to our customers. Now let us turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flow in the Company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $275 million. We returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. We invested $69 million in CapEx during the quarter, which is modestly higher than our full-year run rate and primarily related to timing. Investing in the business remains an important driver of growth for us. That said, we will remain disciplined and continue to forecast full-year capital spending between $230 million and $240 million. Our working capital increased [Technical Difficulty]. This is in line with our expectations and driven by the inventory build during the second half of 2018 to address tariff and component issues. These inventories will be worked down over the next two quarters and we expect our working capital and free cash flow conversion to continue to improve each quarter. Cash flow from operations improved over 30% from last year's first quarter and free cash flow conversion improved substantially. As a reminder, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest cash flow period as we build inventory for the back half of the year. We continue on track to meet our full year target of 105% free cash flow conversion. On a final note, earlier this quarter we announced a new credit revolver tied to our sustainability performance. This is the first of it's in our sector, and we are pleased to be able to align the interest of our shareholders for more efficient financing with our focus on sustainability and social value creation. Please turn to Slide 10 and Patrick will cover our 2019 end market outlook.
Patrick Decker: The view of our end markets for the full year remains largely unchanged from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. While relapse some tougher year-over-year comparisons, the growth that we saw in the first quarter combined with healthy orders and backlog reinforces our confidence in our growth momentum for 2019. I will quickly run through some key points for each one of our end markets. In the utilities market, we still expect solid growth in the U.S. where we continue to see strong project backlog and a very healthy aftermarket business. Even with tough comparisons through the balance of the year, we still expect mid-single digit growth in the U.S. We are moderating our outlook for Europe slightly as we saw some softening from uncertainty in the UK. In the emerging markets, China and India continue to lead the way, regulation is expanding in both countries and adoption of our advanced treatment technology and other core infrastructure work is accelerating. We therefore, maintain mid single digit growth expectations in the overall utilities market. In industrial, we continue to expect low to mid single digit growth as we foresee moderation in the second half of the year. While mining and construction boosted first quarter growth, we do expect general slowing consistent with our last outlook. In commercial, we saw another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by the activity in the US and China. We do expect that the market will moderate in the back half of the year and we will also face challenging comparisons. However, our performance in the first quarter and outlook based on order demand gives us confidence to raise the outlook for commercial for the full year slightly to mid-single digits. Our residential outlook remains at low-single digit growth. Signs of a flattening U.S. housing market, low single-digit growth in Europe and a mixed outlook across emerging markets all remain unchanged from our guidance at last quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 11 and we will provide an update on the rest of our guidance for 2019. As we just discussed, we started the year with solid top line growth and continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%. We are adjusting our operating margin outlook to a range of 14.5% to 14.9%. This represents healthy expansion of 80 to 120 basis points. We expect similar improvement on an adjusted EBITDA basis which would bring it to a range of 20.3% to 20.6%. This updated outlook takes into account our performance last quarter and stronger dollar for the remainder of the year. Let me pause for a moment and talk about other actions we are taking to improve our margin profile. We first talked at our 2017 Investor day about our overall approach to business simplification, which included two primary components. First, the implementation of a global business services platform, which represents the simplification of a number of our back office functions; I will come back to this in a moment. Second, broader organizational opportunities to do further management de-layering and elimination of other duplicate support functions; since that time, we have advanced this effort to reduce complexity, within the organization, allowing us to be faster and more agile, so we can serve our customers better. These actions are being taken as we speak and we expect to see modest savings this year with the bulk of the savings being realized in 2020. Now, turning back to our full year guidance, we are revising the adjusted EPS to a range of $3.12 to $3.32 cents, which reflects a reduction of $0.04 for the stronger dollar and $0.04 for the shortfall in the first quarter. This represents solid growth year-over-year of between 8% and 13%. And finally, we continue to expect at least 105% free cash flow conversion in a long track to do so. Let me now turn it back over to Mark to work in summary other full-year and second quarter details.
Mark Rajkowski: On Slide 12, we are providing the seasonal profile of our business, as well as highlights of our updated 2019 planning assumptions. We continue to expect 4% to 6% organic growth for 2019, which brings down by segment as follows. We expect 5% to 7% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in applied water systems and 4% to 6% growth in measurement and control solutions. We are now assuming a year rate 1.12, which was the average for the month of April and we have included that in our FX sensitivity table in the appendix. We are increasing our forecast for restructuring and realignment costs for the year to $60 million to $70 million. The increase relates to the actions Patrick covered earlier related to organization simplification. The increase in estimated restructuring charges will largely be recorded in the back half of this year with the majority of savings being realized in 2020. Our estimated tax rate for 2019 remains at 19.5%. Now moving to the second quarter. We expect total company growth in the range of 4% to 6%, led by continued strength in the U.S. municipal market, as well as broad-based growth in China and India. We expect second quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, representing 50 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion over the prior year. We expect continued strong margin expansion in both our water infrastructure and applied water system segments, driven by cost reductions, volume leverage and improved price realization. We expect margin expansion of about 20 to 60 basis points from our MCS segment, which reflects moderating impacts from the component supply mix challenges [Technical Difficulty]…
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold till the conference is restarted. And you are live and you may resume.
Patrick Decker: Yes, so this is Patrick and sorry we have had some technical difficulties that I can assure you were not planned. So, we are going to go back to Slide 13. I realized that some of my comments may be redundant here, but it is important as we talk about this section of the call that you hear it in its entirety. A little over two years ago, we laid out our financial targets through 2020 at our Investor Day, we continue to make solid progress and are on track for the high end of our organic growth target of 4% to 6%, notably, having delivered 8% growth in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin target is on track as well having finished last year at 19.5% and an outlook for this year between 20.3% and 20.6%. This is clearly indicative of the strong operational expansion and volume leverage from growth that we've seen, which also stripped out the noise from purchase accounting amortization. Our adjusted EPS is also tracking at the high end of our target of mid-teens growth as we delivered 20% growth last year and 18% growth year before. Our outlook for this year is at roughly 12% growth at the midpoint of our range. In the next year, adjusted operating margin. I realize there may be some questions about our ability to achieve our target in the 2020 time frame, while continuing to support our growth objectives. And while we have made significant progress, there are a couple of things have changed as we laid out those targets back in 2017. First, earlier this month we made the decision to delay the next phase of actions related to our global business services initiative. We decided to do this in order to optimize its implementation and minimize any potential disruption to revenue growth. Having said that, we remain fully committed this opportunity and we expect these savings to be realized but delayed now into late 2020 and 2021; second, the target for set before we acquired few technologies and the other businesses that we have acquired to build our new AIA platform. This platform and the growing demand for our digital solutions across the entire company is helping us set the pace for innovation in the sector. This is reflected in the strong growth we are seeing and the excitement around are integrated offerings. As a result, we remain confident in the longer term margin expansion potential of this portfolio and expect margins to expand at least 100 basis points in 2020 with further healthy margin expansion in 2021 beyond as we scale the capabilities we have been building in our new platform. With that, let us turn to Slide 14 to wrap up before questions. So in closing, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions and we are in the early stage of our digital journey, which is already reshaping the way water is managed for communities around the globe. While we had a disappointing quarter in regards to our margin performance, we have taken actions to ensure that we deliver our 2019 commitments, while investing in our business to realize the very attractive growth opportunities in front of us as well as longer-term margin expansion opportunities. We are firmly committed to executing and creating value for our stakeholders, which includes enabling our customers to harness the power of technology to solve their toughest challenges and helping them transform the future. So with that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with the, the first quarter and the margin miss here and Patrick I apologize I missed like the first a minute or so of your opening remarks, but the next layer of detail when you talked about your lower factory absorption and demand planning decisions that said we need more help there and are seeing what actually went wrong oftentimes that's an ERP decision or just in the chain of linking the demand with the actual factory deployment and inventory commitments and so what went wrong and how the degree of confidence that it's fixed?
Patrick Decker: I'll speak first then, Mark, add some color here as well. So you have to be very clear what we're targeting here is, as you recall, we built up inventories at the end of December ahead of the expected tariff increases and some component shortages. So we came into the year, knowing we had higher inventory levels and you recall that actually had led to some of the bullet and free cash flow conversion last quarter. So we made the conscious decision to work down those inventories are in the factory. The disconnect was in terms of that getting translated by couple of factories into a financial forecast that we would have built into our guidance originally as we came out of the quarter. That's where the miss occurred and we've taken the actions now within our supply chain organization and the finance team at the factory level, make sure that disconnect was resolved and does not reoccur.
Mark Rajkowski: I want to add anything. And part of it is making sure we have the right folks involved in those conversations at the right levels. Also as we work through this beginning of April and the team working on to make sure that we've completely through where some of the gaps were so we make sure that does not happen again.
Deane Dray: And can you size for us between those three factors, mix factory absorption. I understand the mix had to abandon that order pushout at AIA but size for us the mix of the 3 including FX?
Mark Rajkowski: In terms of the mix and it wasn't AIA, that was our analytics business or test business and also we saw softer than expected revenues in our aftermarket service business in Europe. And that impact in the quarter was roughly 25-30 basis points. And then on the absorption and just on this absorption point I want to make sure that you understand that investors. This is an isolated incident in a couple of our factories, it is across all of our factories and we do have our hands on it, but it did impact both AWS in Water Infrastructure by approximately, 45 to 50 basis points in the quarter.
Deane Dray: And then the second question on the push-out of the margin target, the 17% to 18% by 2020. It sounds as though one of the tripping factors was this slower roll out in the global business services. So, yeah, what was its contribution expected to be, was it 100 basis points there and why was it not ready. So maybe start there?
Patrick Decker: We had, yes. So if we go back to Investor Day in 2017 and we laid out, the various drivers of the margin walk to that expansion target of that are 100 basis points was going to come from what we called broader business simplification of which part of that was global business services, which is all about the back office simplification, what we are talking about finance, IT, HR, work implementation etc. The other piece of that 100 basis points was be with broader organization simplification, which are the actions that we just announced here in the call today and foreshadowed back in the last earnings call. So those are the two big drivers. We are still going forward with both, but what we said I have said in the past that doing a global business services implementation. We have the experience in doing this and we understand the importance of getting it right and not letting it become a distraction or disrupt the front end of the business in terms of top line demand. We are in the midst of that implementation, we have learned some things in the first couple of phases of roll out that caused us early this month to say, we are not putting a hold on it. We simply spreading of the time frame to make sure that we do not rush and then we get it right, and that is the single biggest driver too why we are pushing out the margin target expectations beyond 2020. And then as you can also see, we have been making other investments behind this new AIA platform that was not in the original 2017 Investor Day discussion.
Mark Rajkowski: So maybe just a little bit of color in terms of where we're at. We had our initial wave implementations in January of this year in the U.S., so it's a meaningful part of our revenues and that included new ledger, new master data, new processes for quarter-to-cash quarter with floors procure to pay and parts of the implementation are going well, other parts are not where we want them to be and it is taking a little bit more effort and time then we like relative to getting our financial information. So, we have work to do to optimize these processes and as Patrick said, we are going to get this done, we are going to get savings, but we are going to do it right and so we push the waves out that we had scheduled for currently to later in the back of the year and that is going to push out the entire implementation.
Patrick Decker: So Deane, one other thing I would add, and this is I am sure on the minds of others on the call. I would not be clear we could have made the decision to take a bunch of other additional cost out including cutting some investment to make our '17 and '18 margin targets that is not our approach, because of the growth in the health that we see in the portfolio and the attractive margin accretion from this growth over time. So, I just want to be clear, there is not as if we did not have areas as we could go back, but that is not going to be our approach here.
Deane Dray: And just one last clarification and then that will be all from me, but the clarification on the delayed implementation on global business services. Patrick, you said in the prepared remarks, I was one to make sure I understand where the timing of the initiatives starts and when the savings start coming into the P&L, just to clarify that?
Patrick Decker: So we had very modest amount of savings in 2019, big part of the savings in the original timeline in 2020 with the remainder flowing through in 2021 and now that has moved out, almost a year.
Mark Rajkowski: Effectively, about three quarters is the phasing out being so, as to why we would not get nearly as much as we would expected in '20, we will get that in '21 at a larger scale being at originally planned.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jonson, Stifel.
Nathan Jonson: I guess we can stop endlessly talking about the 17%, 18% percent margin target now, just a question on the miss and the internal part of that in 1Q, you guys are certainly have a reputation for not making those internal errors. Maybe Mark, you can talk a little bit more about what was behind that, how isolated you think it is, have you reevaluated the internal FP & A process to make sure that this thing does not come up again. It is pretty unusual for you guys to have this thing?
Mark Rajkowski: It is a really good question. And as I mentioned just a moment ago, we have got a lot of factories, a few dozen or more around the Company and it was really in 3 factories and we all gets down to this sales and operations planning process right signals into from our commercial teams into the factories and then translating that into financial outlook and we had, missed there were communication around that process needs to be really, really tight particularly, as you are going through some changes in as you trying to balance inventories and making sure that we, do what we say we are trying to do and not more, but also making sure we are getting good signals from the commercial teams into the factory. So there, as a whole line of communications, including finance that is required and quite frankly they innovate, they were not as tight as they needed to be. And part of that is making sure we have got the right leadership in that process to make those calls. So it is isolated, we know where the breakdown occurred and I can assure you this is a hot topic with our Senior leadership team and Senior finance folks to make sure that it does not happen again. And it boils down to really good communication.
Nathan Jonson: I think our net all I would offer up here is not to further pile up on the [Technical Difficulty]…
Operator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator, today's conference will resume momentarily.
Patrick Decker: Okay, sorry about that, Nate. I don’t know how much of the answer you heard.
Nathan Jonson: We cut out right as you started talking, Patrick.
Patrick Decker: You missed some good stuff. You missed the best part of the call. So your comments around -- this is very much unlike us. As I said, we take these things very seriously and we own this, we were on it. I think the thing that was unique here not to so much explained, but why this time around, I think it is the first time in a long while that we have been in a situation where we were purposely working off so much inventory toward our working capital numbers in a couple of our factories and it was net in terms of the hand off and communication, in terms of what the absorption impact would be on the back as a result of that. So that is the piece that mark in the finance team are all over and we got the right leaders involved in the commercial side in the factories to make sure those things it incorrectly do not happen again.
Nathan Jonson: So I guess my second question here is going to be back to the fundamentals of the business now, order rate in the quarter still pretty healthy 4% against a pretty tough comp of 10% last year. Are there any markets where you are seeing any slowdown in order growth? I thought maybe Europe Industrial. Yeah, I mean, I thought maybe commercial but you are taking guidance for that up, just any color you have around the order trends you are seeing?
Patrick Decker: So really the only area that we have seen some level of order softness and it impacted in the quarter, we think it will be for the balance of the year is some softness in Europe, which is really driven by the uncertainty in the UK. And so again, the UK was down 3% on its own in first quarter and we are expecting to be down, mid single digits or so in Q2, and maybe low single digit for the full year, so that would be the one area I would say we are seeing some softness, we think it is still just purely a timing issue as we work through the uncertainty there in the UK. Other than that we saw strength across the board, I will also give color on the 4%. Not only is that against a harder compare from last year, 10. But we also had a large treatment project that we would expected to win and we expect to win, did not get awarded in March. It is likely to get awarded here in Q2 that would have normalized back up to probably mid-single digit, so in order growth. So, we still feel quite confident about the momentum behind the business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital.
Scott Graham: The MCS margin was obviously pretty difficult in the quarter, and I know you explained some things that you are expecting from at least what I heard before you cut off that you are expecting the margin to be up in the second quarter and maybe just a wreck that bridge for us is that is a big swing.
Patrick Decker: Unfortunately, you cut out. I think what I heard, Scott was a bridge in terms of how things get better in Q2 for MCS.
Scott Graham: So there is a couple of things, one is the fact that the, we will continue to scale our AIA platform and there is good margin drop there. We will also seen improvement in mix as well as we will start to see some moderation of the impacts on tariffs, but it is really a combination and component shortages, but it is really mix better mix, better scaling around our AIA platform in a little bit less challenge, if you will in our supply chain.
Mark Rajkowski: Are you still there, Scott?
Scott Graham: When you say you expecting better mix, mix is always difficult to predict. I know that you gave some explanation, but you are seeing in your delivery book, a better mix for the second quarters, is that…
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, a couple of pieces to that nature pieces are the lapping of the alignment installation, which had low margins on the installed because subcontract in a work out, so that is a big chunk. And then we expect a much better mix and a higher mix of water and that carries higher margins than in the energy, electric and those are really the two big factors.
Patrick Decker: So in this business, we have got really good visibility into backlog, because of these large deals that we won in the margin profile of those, and when the installs are expected to occur. And then we have got good insight into what the day to day replacement businesses and so in that regard. That is what gives us great confidence that we are going to see the margin expansion in the second half of the year relative to Q1.
Mark Rajkowski: The other thing too, we got off to a late start in price driving price in the business, and really did not have much, if any, last year we had a little bit in Q1. We have gone out and raise some prices and that those rent bump in Q2 in the second half of the year, so that will be some help as well.
Scott Graham: So, the preponderance of the guide down on the margin is MCS largely…
Mark Rajkowski: First, let me make sure I understand that question we see the guide.
Patrick Decker: Now that you are actually the guide down. Scott is really tied to two specific thing, but I know with the call dropping here a few times it made invest the guide down specifically $0.04 for currency and that just is actually re-striking it at the latest Euro rate and then the second is just the in Q1 we recover, maybe a candidate. We are basically saying right now, we are not counting on recovering that we are not going to go slash cost just to recover that it would come back on other investments we need to maintain.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: I guess maybe the first question, just thinking about the strong order growth. The strong sales, I think you guys have done a very good job explaining what is happened with the margin, but it does lead to the question what is actually in the backlog in terms of the margin and if that still relatively healthy, if you are seeing margin backlog still expand year-over-year. Any color around that would be helpful.
Patrick Decker: We do feel good about margins and backlog. We have got good visibility on that, I would say is, again it is a function of the mix between project work and day-to-day book and ship business is healthy. Two; we have seen very good pricing traction. Again, as you will recall over the course of last year and that continues as we go forward here. When you look at the mix of MCS business that Mark alluded to, where it is going to be much heavier water business, which is substantially higher margin than electric and gas. Those are the projects that we see in backlog in the second half.
John Walsh: So is it fair to say that the margin in the backlog is actually up year-on-year. And then maybe just a question around the pipeline as you think around what is out there in the market in terms of acquisition opportunity?
Patrick Decker: I think as we have said before, we maybe just reiterate the key focus areas for us. We have talked before about we do think that there continue to see opportunities, if I think about it first from the utility space perspective we think we have got a great platform here. We do think there are opportunities as we continue to build out our AIA platform that there are both opportunities there to build out an even stronger decisions intelligence type offering to utilities. We just did a small acquisition in Germany, it is very, very small, but it is a terrific artificial intelligence capability for inside the treatment plant and we closed that deal just about a month or so back small deal, but really excited about leveraging that on a global scale. So, in the utility space, I think it will largely be just a series of tuck-ins and bolt-ons that will not be material from a financial perspective, but be material in terms of strength in the solution to the customer. Beyond that, again, we continue to look at opportunities across the industrial water space. It is a fairly fragmented area, we do see there being some interesting ideas out there, not foreshadowing or signaling anything there. We will continue to be disciplined there from a valuation standpoint, I do not see anything in the immediate term, but that is an area we continue to keep our eyes and ears close to the ground on.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.
Joe Giordano: So, I just wanted to start on free cash flow. So you guys are maintaining your target for 2019 here, but you are also doubling our percent effectively the restructuring for the year. So, talk us through given the some of the issues you faced here in 1Q, how conservative is that target to get incrementally more aggressive by keeping it flat.
Mark Rajkowski: Joe, that is a good question relative to the impact of restructuring, a lot of that was that really gets at is the timing of the accounting impact and not necessarily all of the cash flows. So, we think that in terms of the cash flow related to restructuring, it may be up a little bit, but we are not expecting that to have material negative impact on that free cash flow conversion.
Joe Giordano: So you went from 30 something to 60 to 70 in restructuring, but you are saying most of that incremental increase the cash impact of that is next year.
Mark Rajkowski: And most of that is will be late in the year and not all of that is going to be paid out in cash. And I would say, Joe. What also gives us confidence around that cash conversion is literally just be the decisions and working with made in Q1 to work at inventories, and so that will have a conversion benefit in terms of helping to get to our working capital numbers.
Patrick Decker: And I would say that there is still inventory built up there, related to tariffs that will continue to warrant down through the course of the year.
Joe Giordano: And then next, I know so we are not supposed to talk about 2020 targets anymore, but I am going to ask one. So you pushed the operating target which I think our people are hoping to see you kept the EBITDA target. So I am just curious now. Are you effectively just pushing out the amortization and not the simplification benefit because like the EBITDA target staying the same, so just curious as to how that how you square that?
Mark Rajkowski: Our EBITDA has been running ahead of it more in line with our targets been than our operating margin. Obviously, a chunk of that is related to the related to the amortization. So, we are still expecting to be within the range of the EBITDA target that we put out there for 2020.
Joe Giordano: But effectively, like the operating margin change was because of amortization and because of the push-out of the global business areas and the simplification…
Mark Rajkowski: So obviously the global business services impact is going to impact both operating margin and in EBITDA margin. The amortization related to our acquisitions continues to be part of that calculation is also in others taxes there is interest, all of those are components of the EBITDA.
Patrick Decker: Joe, we will finish this year, roughly around 20.5% EBIT in EBITDA. So, we are committed to a 100 basis points for next year that will be on both, right. So we will finish roughly in that target was about 21.5 to 22.5 on EBITDA from the Investor day.
Operator: And your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: You maybe if I could just squeeze one last one in my maybe hopefully the last one in for you guys on the, in the long-term margin targets. Is this effectively just a one-year push out? Are you committing to those original targets in the 2021 time frame or where we might be to finite in China pigeonhole you guys.
Mark Rajkowski: I mean I think what we are committing to here Brian is we confident around 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. We think that trend line can continue in terms of just continued healthy progression on margins for some time to come, not in a position here today to declare new targets for '21 and beyond, will do that obviously later this year as we are get closer within the year and we are talking only about 20, but we are getting new longer-term target to that point.
Brian Lee: And then just second question, you mentioned a couple of times throughout the call, this Philadelphia win, which is encouraging, especially in the context of the water business that part of the mix picking up, so it could you guys give us some frame of reference in terms of how big this deployment is in relation to other water deployments in your backlog and then maybe related to that. I noticed the SaaS business was a bit weaker in the quarter, I know there were some tougher comps, but does that reverse in the second half with this Philadelphia deployment or are there other deployments that drive that part of the business and MCS back to double-digit growth later in the year. Thanks guys.
Patrick Decker: So the Philly water deal, it is sizable and it is in our backlog now and it really, it is not yet in orders. So, we secure the contract, but we have got the orders as they place them on us and we expect that really to be happening later this year mainly into 2020. The general size that we have here is similar to other deals we have been out the, you can take somewhere between roughly $60 to $90 million is the ballpark out if it moves around a bit, depending upon the final specs, etc., but it is a meaningful size deal. We do still see a number of other large deals out there in the pipeline with the team is going after both in North America, but also we are still pursuing a number of them on the international side, there are also both the combination of AMI metering deployments, but also broader link between that in our new AIA platform around things like water losses, non revenue water, etc. So, those would likely be announced either late this year, early next and so and those would certainly be an attractive margins to the current portfolio.
Brian Lee: And just quickly on the SaaS. The SaaS makes any any views into when those trends pick back up moving through the year.
Patrick Decker: We think certainly we are already. We saw a little bit of, I mean the issue in the quarter was simply specifically a compare of a large software sale that we did in Europe last year was one project, again we do not want to get into spend two quarters and so that will be behind us. If you look at the rest of our SaaS offering, which is predominantly coming out of our AI platform, as well as my side of the business with Sensus, we continue to see very good growth in healthcare. We talked about the 30% orders growth in AIA in the quarter. We see that accelerating based upon the market demand and the deployment that we are doing and expect that to be in converting into organic revenue really in Q2 through the end of the year and onward.
Operator: And your next question comes from Brett Lindsay with Vertical Research.
Brett Lindsay: I wanted to go back to the margin bridge and specifically, the cost inflation bucket that actually worsened relative to Q4 and just wondering what some of the moving parts are in terms of the underlying components there. And then just on the strategic investments that was actually a positive swing in water infrastructure applied with delta of about 150 bps relative to last Q4 just timing on investments you throttle back a little bit. Any color would be good.
Mark Rajkowski: In terms of inflation is that is, it is largely in line, it might be up a little bit I mean there really was not any incremental impact related to tariffs we been seeing that already in the fourth quarter same thing with components, maybe a little bit in freight, but nothing material, and certainly, as we look out over the course of this year, we would expect that to trend down as we lap some of those tougher comparisons in the back half of last year, so that will decrease. Now, the second part of your question related to investments with AWS…
Brett Lindsay: No, specific to water infrastructure and applied, just looking at the delta that was a drag it all of 2018 in Q4, but it was actually a tailwind here in the Q1.
Mark Rajkowski: Well, we still have some investments in Water Infrastructure. So, we certainly did throughout on an enterprise-wide basis, most notably when you look at MNCS. So we are continuing to invest, particularly in that segment, but in other parts of our business as well.
Brett Lindsay: And then just shifting to the restructuring, up about $35 billion at the midpoint, I know it is back-end loaded, but where are the targeted opportunities by the at the segment level?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes. So, all refrain from getting into too much of the Inside Baseball on details of the work moves as we are in the midst of doing those as we speak. It is broad based, it is not really targeted, I would say on any one segment. Each one of our three segments have opportunities here that we are going to streamlining and it is a broader de-layering and elimination some of the duplicate support from we got so, I probably would not want to go into more caller than that right now and if you could share more with you on the next call.
Brett Lindsay: And then maybe just one follow-up on the U.S. growth, it has been very strong across the board. What is your sense of the underlying market rate or run rate here in those pieces of the business. And then as you examine those out growth factors, what the big drivers the channel products in any color would be good.
Patrick Decker: So, I would say the predominant drivers that we are seeing are really I would say threefold. First is because that U.S. number is a companywide number. So, in the U.S. you see first of all, a continued healthy utility market and we believe the utility market is growing really a mid-single digit level and what we are seeing there in terms of faster growth in that we do believe is market share gain and that is predominantly within our transport business, but also treatment. Second driver is we again continue to see accelerated growth of especially in orders on the new AIA platform, which is heavily concentrated right now in the U.S., as well as some of the project wins within piece of the organization. I think in those in both areas we see those as being sustainable. The one that I would say we are expecting to see some moderation of growth would be within our applied Water business on the industrial side in the U.S. where we have been running pretty hot there for the past year, year and a half all of that has come from a couple of things. One, we made at the organization move about a year and a half ago, where we integrated the commercial teams around our applied water and in our water infrastructure businesses and we have been getting a large amount of revenue synergies there that reflects share gains by expanding channel, streamlining our distribution channels and just incentivizing people to go out and sell the portfolio. And so, there comes a point where you start lapping that and so, we would say that part of the business would begin to moderate down to probably more low-mid single digits at the back half of this year. So, when you do the math on all that that is why we are saying for the full year while we did 11% in Q1. We do expect that to be more medium to high-single digits in Q2 and then blends out for the full year at somewhere in that high-single digit level for the full year aggregated.
Operator: And your next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Just have a quick follow-up, the first quarter margin issue, I just want to clarify that was a problem they get taken care of and that is behind us now.
Mark Rajkowski: As both Patrick and I mentioned and there is a couple of follow-ups on that you may not have been on online at that point, but yeah, we have done quite a bit of work around that in terms of our sales and operations planning process, we know what the root causes are and we have taken corrective action, so we do believe that is fully behind us.
Walter Liptak: And then it sounds like despite some of the macro international things that are going on that your order intake internationally, still looks pretty stable for this year, and I wonder if you could just talk about that especially on the larger systems side.
Patrick Decker: So yes, we definitely are seeing continued robust demand pretty much consistently across outside of North America. I would say the one exception to that would be I did mention earlier some softness in the UK that affected our European results. So, we are guiding Europe and the low-single digits for the full year. But the rest of international certainly across Asia, we see continued very robust growth there in terms of orders and bidding pipeline. The same is the case within Latin America. We see some great results there. We see strength continuing in Eastern Europe. And I would say the Middle East has moderated but is healthier now for us than it was last year and so, it feels pretty good, right now touch wood. And again the things we look at our things like line and backlog and that is where we have our comments.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew, your line is open. Please state your question. Andrew, your line may be on mute.
Andrew Buscaglia: Just wanted to just delve into your guidance. Obviously that is come out a few times on the call. Just given, it is still implies a big, I am questioning you how conservative if there is any contingency in place for some of the issues that occurred in Q1 and then you are talking about moderation in a number of areas, Industrial, Commercial talked about softness in the UK, Middle East moderating, Applied Water even, so why, so your guidance is only reduced by the mix and the FX, but where do you get this confidence, are you being conservative enough to meet your expectations for the year.
Patrick Decker: Obviously, we go through a lot of analysis and digging into these things before we put together a guidance for the full year. And certainly as we look to do adjusted downward, by definition, we make sure that we build in appropriate [Technical difficulty] to be able to cover for a rainy day, obviously we are not proud and missed that in Q1 for the reasons that we described. But we feel confident that we have got an appropriate range there and the issues around the words moderation that I used, those are all embedded in the 4% to 6% organic revenue guide, which still gives us some room in the case of things or soften, it also addresses that the top of some the comps do get tougher in the second half of the year from a growth standpoint, but we feel we have got all that reflected in embedded in our guidance.
Mark Rajkowski: Well, I would point out big certainly a big part of that is also our MCS segment. We had -- the comps are certainly much easier there and we know we have a ramp big ramp in higher margin water business scaling up AIA, so we have good confidence in that. We continue to drive productivity and we expect that to ramp in throughout the course of the year. So, as Patrick said, particularly after not hitting your numbers. We were particularly focused on making sure that we identified all of the potential risks out there and we had sufficient contingencies address.
Andrew Buscaglia: And maybe just one more on your MCS side, that disappointing this quarter, but where some of the things get like the energy applications due to lapping a volume project, the softness, it sounds like you had a tough comp in the SaaS piece what maybe where did it, we would not have expected or where you missed in that in your guidance or your steering us to where that margin would be this quarter.
Mark Rajkowski: The miss in the quarter, we were a little bit below what we had out and that was primarily a function of mix and just, we expected better sales growth in our high margin test business, that is our analytics equipment sensors and it was flat. And that was really the difference between what we outlook and what we delivered from a margin perspective.
Patrick Decker: And just be clear, again we are not talking about the AIA platform, we are talking about the traditional analytics piece of the MCS segment, which is very high gross margins for us and it was a specific project in Europe that got pushed out. And that drove the shortfall there, it hit margin hard just because the gross margins in that business.
Operator: Thank you. And your final question will come from Shereen Undavia with Raymond James.
Shereen Undavia: This is Shereen on for Paul. If I'm not mistaken, it's been over a year since your last acquisition announcement. That as a pretty long M&A hiatus for you, so I was wondering if there is an indication of private company valuation that have gone to rich or should we read anything else into that?
Patrick Decker: I would not read anything into our year passing in terms of not doing M&A to do anything with valuations. I mean obviously, valuations move around and they vary depending upon the target that you are exploring. But I think, we just important to pause on anything of significance, over the last year, while we continue to focus in on the successful integration of both as well as pure and building up this new platform, this new AIA platform. And so since, then we have done a few small tuck-ins and bolt-ons that are not material from a financial standpoint that are strategically. We continue to explore and we will continue to be active in terms of M&A, win the right opportunities present themselves are strategically and financially. But no, I would not read anything into it being a commentary on valuation.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any closing remarks or any additional remarks.
Patrick Decker: Sure will again thank you all for bearing with this here this morning on the technical difficulties. I know it was painful on this end and so, appreciate your patience and for this and also by hanging on the phone a bit longer than we normally planned. Appreciate the ongoing support. Look forward to get back to you after our Q2 results. We appreciate your support. Safe travels and we will be in touch soon. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. This does conclude today's first quarter earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker : Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. We have a lot to cover, so I’m going to hit on a few highlights from our 2018 results, then I’ll turn it over to Mark to provide some additional details. As I reflect on this past year, one of the things that stood out to me is the momentum that we built on the topline. We delivered our strongest growth to-date as a public company with 8% organic revenue growth. We saw healthy advances in each of our businesses, with a number of important achievements, including several successful new product launches and strategic project wins.  We also saw 9% organic orders growth this past year. Fourth quarter orders were up double digits and showed strength across all of our businesses. We see continued strength in our bidding pipelines across the entire company. We see strength across our transport and Applied Water businesses, and it’s worth noting that a growing portion of our orders and recent wins are for longer lead time projects in our treatment, Sensus and AIA businesses. This tells us that our markets appear to be very healthy over the near and long term, and it further strengthens our conviction around our 2019 and longer term growth prospects.  For Adjusted EBITDA, we saw an improvement of 80 basis points, which was in line with our guidance of 19.5% for the year. Operating margins were slightly short of our guidance for the year at 13.7%, up 60 basis points excluding purchase accounting year-over-year. We saw benefits from productivity, volume leverage and price realization which accelerated throughout the year. Partially offsetting these gains were inflationary pressures, sales mix and funding our strategic investments. Much of that investment has been focused on our measurement and control solutions segment. This is aimed at capturing significant revenue opportunities across our businesses. The investment also capitalizes on our first mover advantage in providing new digital and analytics solutions. We expect this to moderate as we enter the second half of the year.  I’m very pleased with the benefits that we are already realizing from this strategy. Since the Sensus acquisition we won more than $100 million in contracts that will provide revenue synergies and we expect to announce another exciting and significant deal this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were up 20%. Our full year free cash flow conversion was below our expectations. We took measures in late Q4 to maintain customer service levels impacted by component shortages by building inventory of critical items and we made strategic purchases to manage tariff impacts. We remain confident in our ability to deliver free cash flow conversion at or above 100% in 2019 and beyond. So in summary, while there is certainly areas for us to work on, I am pleased with our strong momentum as we head into 2019.  Let me now spend a few minutes on the progress we are making our top strategic priorities that enable us to meet our long term financial commitments and maintain the company on a path of sustainable growth and margin expansion. The first is accelerating profitable growth, which encompasses our initiative to drive commercial excellence, grow in emerging markets and further strengthen innovation and technology.  First commercial excellence: I’m encouraged by market share gains across a number of our business lines. I also want to expand upon our team’s execution on price. We can attribute about one point of the organic growth we saw this past year to our commercial teams pricing efforts, and we see continuing strength throughout 2019. I am very proud of what our sales and marketing teams have demonstrated here in terms of commercial leadership. In emerging markets we delivered 11% revenue growth and orders momentum continued in our key focus markets of China, India and the Middle East.  Advancing innovation is another core element of our longer term growth strategy. Our team delivered 120 basis point increase and our vitality indexed over 25% and we are pleased by the accretive growth rates and margin profile of these new offerings.  We’re also excited about a number of new technologies that will bring the market in 2019. These offerings combine our data, analytics and software capabilities with our installed base and this is enabling us to bring in entirely new solutions to our customers and we aim to help them address their biggest challenges or water scarcity, affordability and resilience.  As I already mentioned, we remain sharply focused on our continuous improvement program. In 2018 we achieved $157 million in savings, a 6% increase in the previous year. We saw plenty of runway on our CI journey and see more efficiency opportunities as we penetrate deeper in the company and across our functions.  To that end, we are now planning the next stage of our business simplification efforts which we spoke about at our last Investor Day. This is the next progression in our plan, which we timed to avoid disrupting our focus on growth and the integration of new businesses over the last 18 months. This work will now further simplify our business structure, eliminate waste and bureaucracy and allow us to move faster and with greater agility to better serve our customers.  We will also focus on future manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies, from footprint optimization, SKU rationalization and improvements to our cost of quality. We expect the execution of the majority of these actions to begin in the second half of 2019.  We estimate up to 100 basis points of savings on a run rate basis, with most of the benefits in 2020 and the balance in 2021. This work reinforces our confidence in achieving our 2020 targets, and it positions us to be more efficient and focused for the long term.  We continue to put our capital to work in smart disciplined ways. This allows us to develop organically, as well as acquire the solutions we need to best address our customers’ challenges. These investments have focused on disruptive technologies and solutions and we will continue to remain steadfast in our approach in that area.  We continue to return capital to shareholders, today announcing a 14% increase in the dividend, consistent with our commitment to growing our dividend in line with earnings growth. We are very proud of our talent and we continue to strengthen our team to a number of investments and development programs, strategic hires and the talent that joins us through acquisitions.  And finally we are a purpose driven company. In 2018 we advanced our commitment to be a company that crates both significant economic and social value. We’ve achieved our original five year sustainability goals one year ahead of schedule, and we are set to release ambitious new goals this spring.  We’re honored to have been recognized by a number of external organizations for these efforts, yet we can and we will do more. In terms of the solutions we provide, our social impact in areas like disaster relief and our environmental footprint. Sustainability is increasingly important to our people, our customers, our investors and the community and it’s a key priority for Xylem.  So now let me turn it over Mark. 
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to slide five and I’ll begin with our full year results. First I’m very pleased with our top line performance this year as we beat the high end of our revenue guidance with 8% organic growth. This reflects strong growth across all of our end markets.  We also saw robust organic growth in all major regions with emerging markets in the U.S. leading the way at 11% and 9% growth respectively. Our revenue performance benefited from solid underlying market growth, but also from the outstanding work of our commercial teams to gain share and ramp-up our price realization.  Operating margins for the year were 13.7% up 60 basis points from the prior year excluding purchase accounting impacts. This reflects continued traction in our productivity initiatives which delivered $157 million in savings, as well as volume leverage and exhilarating price realization. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher levels of inflation, higher investments to drive longer term growth, unfavorable mix and negative currency impacts. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 19.5%. We reported adjusted earnings per share this year of $2.88, an increase of 20% and at the higher end of our original 2018 guidance. Our free cash flow conversion finished below our expectations this year at 64%. Our cash conversion metrics in both 2017 and 2018 were impacted by large non-cash tax items. Excluding these fourth quarter items, our cash conversion was 75% this year, which was below our target. As Patrick mentioned, the primary driver of this miss was our working capital performance. The timing of our strong sales growth late in the fourth quarter and the impacts of higher raw material inflation and strategic pre-buys of inventory to manage tariffs and component stocks drove working capital higher by $140 million in the quarter. As a result, year-end working capital increased 50 basis points over last year to 19% of sales.  To give you perspective on the impact that the timing of our Q4 sales and strategic inventory build had on our year-end working capital, our 12 month average cash conversion actually improved by over four days from December 2017. So I’m confident in both the improvements we are making to our working capital processes and that working capital improvement will once again become a source of cash for Xylem in 2019.  So please turn to slide six, and I’ll review the fourth quarter results. We were pleased and a bit surprised by the strength of the acceleration in demand through the fourth quarter which drove sales above the high end of our outlook. Organic orders were up 10% with high single digit growth in both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and 18% organic growth in Measurement and Control Solutions.  Revenues were up 9% organically in the fourth quarter, which was on top of 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Acquisitions contributed 2% growth and foreign exchange was a 3% headwind.  From an end market perspective, the utility segment was up 10% organically. This growth reflects strength across nearly all regions and applications globally, and is encouraging given the tough compare to the double digit organic growth in last year’s fourth quarter.  Industrial Markets were up 8%, driven by continued strength in North America, Europe and Latin America. Commercial Markets had a very strong quarter growing 17% with double digit growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. Certainly some of the strong demand in the U.S. was driven by the timing of announced price increases. As a result we expect to see solid but moderating demand in our commercial business for Q1.  Our residential business was flat in the quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.1%, which was up 30 basis points versus the prior year excluding purchase account. This was lower than our expectations as continued margin expansion in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water were muted by margin contraction in the MCS segment. I’ll review the details of each segment’s margin performance in a minute.  Against the backdrop of supply chain challenges from tariffs and constrained electronic components supply, I am very pleased with our team’s performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of 16% year-over-year.  Please turn to slide seven and I’ll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders grew 7% organically year-over-year. This growth was driven by sustained strong demand in North America and emerging markets, particularly in treatment. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $620 million, up approximately 7% organically year-over-year. Of this amount $480 million is due to ship in 2019, which is up 6% on an organic basis.  Our Treatment Bidding Pipeline group 10% this year, driven heavily by U.S. activity and large projects in India. The Treatment Pipeline remains a strong barometer for us as to the health of the Water Utility market. Water Infrastructure revenues grew 9% year-over-year on an organic basis and foreign exchange was a $24 million headwind.  Revenue in the emerging markets was up 18% with much of the growth coming from our Treatment business. Particularly noteworthy was the 37% growth in China. We saw more than 40% growth in treatment and more than 30% growth in Transport as we’ve continued to see demand for our products benefit from both the new regulations around water quality, as well as our investments in product localization.  India was down slightly in the quarter due to the lapping of large custom pump project deliveries in the prior year. With our current backlog in growing project pipeline from new Wastewater Treatment Regulations, we expect India to be our fastest growing market in 2019 with over 30% organic growth.  Western Europe was up 7% led by high single digit growth in transport, where we saw strong OpEx activity across several countries. This segment grew 4% in the U.S. with solid growth in both the Waste Water Transport market and Industrial Dewatering business.  Treatment growth was impacted by project delays that moved into the first quarter. We are also encouraged by the high single digit organic orders growth during the quarter. Operating margin for the segment increased 80 basis points to 20.7%, the highest level in our history. This reflects our continued progress in driving the productivity, as well as volume leverage and accelerating price realization.  Please turn to slide eight. Applied Water orders grew 8% organically over the prior year. Overall we exited the quarter with backlog of $200 million, up 5% organically compared to last year. Our shippable backlog for 2019 is about $185 million, which is up approximately 15% on an organic basis.  Revenue in the quarter grew 10% organically versus the prior year. The growth was driven by the commercial and industrial end markets, which were up 17% and 7% respectively over the prior year.  In the U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year with growth across all three end markets. Most of that growth was driven by strong project activity and price realization in both our industrial and commercial applications, both of which grew double digits.  Emerging markets revenue grew 13%, reflecting strong commercial growth in China and India, as well as for industrial applications in Latin America. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 17.2% year-over-year. Strong productivity of 390 basis points and price realization of 220 basis points more than offset increased inflation, which was impacted by tariffs and currency impacts.  Now let’s turn to slide nine. Measurement and Control Solutions orders grew 18% organically over the prior year and revenue grew 11% on an organic basis. For Sensus, revenue in our Water business increased 16% driven by growth in the North American market.  Our Gas business grew 23% mostly from large North American project deployments. Electric was down 5% in the quarter due to the lapping of project deployments in North America. And our advanced infrastructure analytics business grew high single digits on a pro-forma basis driven by the delivery of projects in the U.S. and Europe.  We continue to see success in bringing the AIA platform solutions to new markets through existing Xylem channels and relationships, including first time wins in several countries. We are also encouraged by the strong consumer interest in these new solutions and the order growth we saw this past year.  Now moving to margins, adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 160 basis points year-over-year to 17.3%. Adjusted operating margin for the segment decreased 280 basis points to 7.5%. We’ve been accelerating our investments in these businesses to drive market share gains with our Sensus solutions and capitalize on our first mover advantage in our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics business. Our investments impacted margins by 270 basis points year-over-year in the quarter and were largely in line with our expectations. During the quarter and despite the tremendous efforts of our supply chain team, we saw increased supply constraints for electronic components. This impacted both our material costs by an additional 100 basis points and revenue mix by over 100 basis points in the quarter and put more downward pressure on operating margin than expected.  We will continue to aggressively manage the electronic component pressures to minimize impact to our customers and expect supply constraints the ease after the first half of 2019. We expect component shortages and project mix to continue to impact margins primarily through the first quarter of 2019 with improving mix, moderating investment levels and volume leverage driving strong margin expansion for the second half of 2019 and 100 basis points of improvement for the full year.  Now let’s turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company’s financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of about $300 million. We invested $66 million in capital in the quarter and returned $38 million to our shareholders through dividends. We repaid $200 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our leverage down to 2.7x. This represents the midpoint of our target leverage range which we achieved as planned and for the first time since the Sensus acquisition in 2016, and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating.  I’ve already discussed our working capital performance and my confidence that working capital will be a source of cash flow in 2019 enabling us to deliver cash conversion of at least 105%.  Please turn to slide 11 and Patrick will cover our 2019 outlook. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks Mark. As we discussed, we ended the year with solid topline momentum and we are confident in our trajectory and focus on achieving our 2019 targets and long term strategic goals. For 2019 we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%. Our adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 100 to 150 basis points to the range of 14.7% to 15.2%.  Let me pause and acknowledge that we realize one of the keys to achieving our margin expansion in 2019 and staying on track to our 2020 targets is to now begin delivering accretive margin improvement in the MCS segment.  We expect to drive 100 basis points to margin expansion despite continued investment and component supply cost pressure in the first half of 2019. Now back to the outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to improve by 100 to 150 basis points, which will bring it to a range of 20.5% to 21%.  At the bottom line we expect to generate adjusted full year earnings per share in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. This excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $30 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 11% to 18% for the year. Finally as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations and this will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 105% in 2019.  Please turn to slide 12. Now let’s review the expected end market growth for 2019. First Utilities, which make up about 50% of our revenue, are expected to grow in the mid-single digits. As we saw in 2018, we expect water and wastewater spending to remain healthy, particularly in the U.S. and emerging markets. This includes mid to high single digit growth in our Water Infrastructure business, as well as mid-single digit growth in the MCS business reflecting timing of project deployments.  In Europe the outlook is mixed and we expect low single digit growth there in total. We are encouraged by the continued infrastructure investments and locations like India, where wastewater regulations are leading our healthy treatment backlog. In both India and China, we expect to grow double digit.  Our industrial end market which represents roughly 35% of our revenue is expected to be up low to mid-single digits. Growth in the U.S. is expected to moderate slightly in the second half of the year compared to the last two years, however still up mid-single digits. We expect the emerging markets to continue to gain strength in India and Latin America.  Industrial Applications in the Middle East are expected to soften a bit and we expect China growth to moderate slightly to low to mid-single digits. Our commercial end market which constitutes about 10% of our revenue saw considerable growth in 2017 and 2018. We expect this to remain healthy in 2019. The U.S. and Western Europe will provide low to mid-single digit growth and overall we expect the commercial end market to grow low to mid-single digits in 2019.  And finally in our smallest end market, Residential, which is about 5% of our revenue, we anticipate low single digit growth. With a flattening U.S. housing market and a highly competitive replacement market, U.S. and European growth is expected at flat to low single digit levels. Emerging markets growth remains healthy as secondary clean water demand continues in China and Greater Asian.  Now Mark will give you a few additional details on the 2019 outlook. 
Mark Rajkowski : As we’ve done in prior years, we’re providing the seasonal profile of our business, as well as highlights of our 2019 planning assumptions on slide 13.  As Patrick discussed, we are guiding to 4% to 6% organic growth for 2019. This breaks down by segment as follows: We expect 5% to 7% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in Applied Water Solutions and 4% to 6% growth in Measurement and Control Solutions. We’re assuming a euro rate of 114 which was the average for the month of January. We’ve included our FX sensitivity table in the appendix and our estimated tax rate for 2019 is 19.5%.  Moving to the first quarter, we expect total company growth in the range of 5% to 6% led by continuing strength in the U.S. municipal market and emerging markets growth. We expect first quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.6%, representing 20 to 50 basis points expansion over the prior year.  While we do expect modest margin expansion for the MCS segment on a quarter sequential basis, we also expect the impacts of the component constraints and mix to continue through the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile we expect strong margin expansion in both our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments, driven by continued cost reductions, volume leverage and improved price realization.  With that, please turn to slide 14 and I’ll turn the call back over the Patrick for closing comments. 
Patrick Decker : Thanks Mark. 2018 was a year of solid momentum. We are very encouraged by the health of our end markets, as well as the growth in the organic and inorganic investments that we’ve made. We are also very pleased about the integration of our recent acquisitions, which are allowing us to provide new disrupted solutions.  We are managing through near term challenges and supply chain disruptions in the marketplace and we are confident in our near and longer term targets based on growth and accretive margins in large deals, as well as the additional opportunity we have to remove cost and inefficiency. We are guiding in 2019 to what we believe is healthy topline growth and margin expansion to execute on our 2020 financial targets.  Now with that operator, let’s open it up to Q&A. 
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone. 
Patrick Decker: Good morning Nathan. 
Nathan Jones: Let’s just start on the 2020 financial targets. I guess the big one is that17% to 18% operating margin goal, which clearly requires a big ramp-up in margins in 2020. So maybe if you could just give us a little more color on how you get there, what the buckets are that get you from you know ‘19 guidance here to at least at the bottom end of that range in 2020?
Patrick Decker: Sure, so this is Patrick. So I’d say Nate, you know first things first. I mean we believe we have a highly credible 2019 plan that we’ve gotten to hear to get at least 100 basis points expansion this year. Beyond that, let me give you some of the large bucket that we see for 2020.  First which is the biggest bucket is our savings from continuous improvement and cost take out, and that’s all net of inflations. So that’s our biggest bucket. That’s again continued productivity on our procurement and lean journey. We also have savings that began to wrap late ‘19 into ‘20 from our global business services initiatives, as well as the broader simplification that I outlined in my prepared remarks.  The second area is again the core volume and price leverage that we expect to get. You know even at the low end of our long term revenue growth guide of 4% to 6%, we expect to see very good margin accretion and leverage flow though there. And then third, is the large deals that we’re getting right now from the Sensus synergies and AIA and those deployments start later this year and really layer on in full fold in 2020.  Additionally as we commented earlier, our investments in the MCS segment do begin to moderate later in ‘19 and then moderate once again in 2020 from our 2019 levels. So those are the four really big buckets that give us the confidence to be able to hit our marking guidance. 
Nathan Jones: That’s helpful, thanks. Maybe on the MCS investments here, I mean you guys have obviously been investing heavily to drive growth there and demonstrating very good growth all across the portfolio, so I don’t think anybody will have a lot of problems with that. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about the things that have been achieved with those investments, what’s in the pot to come to market, maybe later in ‘19 and into ‘20 to continue to drive growth. 
Mark Rajkowski : Sure, I’d say with respect to – first I’d say we continue to invest in all aspects of our portfolio. So we are investing certainly in our Water Infrastructure and our Applied Water businesses as well, especially about bringing new products to market. But specifically within MCS, I think we’re in the early stages of building out our offerings and embedded software and networking services, and really looking to take full advantage of that first mover advantage. And I’d say, given the strength and productivity we’ve had across the entire company. It also affords us the opportunity to accelerate growth and investments in four really areas.  First is, again building out this new Advanced Infrastructure Analytics Platform; second is, building out new offerings in electric and gas to support some of the large deals that we’ve secured in one there. We are investing in designing specific products and specs for some of the international deals that you’ve heard me talk before about that, we’re pursuing and then again lastly building out a much broader networking and software solution capability.  Beyond that and in terms of getting any more specifics, I’d probably hold back from there at this point time. There’ll be more to come in that regard, but again, we feel very good about the pipeline of deals that are out there that we are pursuing right now, that really are a result of these new offerings. 
Nathan Jones: Okay, and just one more on CapEx and Mark thanks for the explanation on working capital, that helps a lot on free cash flow. CapEx has increased pretty significantly over the last couple years. I know a lot of that is growth CapEx, localizing production, CapEx for 2019, looks like it staying at about the same level as 2018. Where do you see that shaking out in the long run once you get through kind of this investment cycle to localize and drive growth? 
Mark Rajkowski : Yeah, I mean that’s a good question and certainly one that we talk about with the team and the Board. I think we are at the upper end when you think about you know capital as a percent of revenue. We have ramped that up. That that has been a function of the investments we make – we’ve been making. So some of those investments that Patrick talked about just a moment ago is for new products, so there is tooling that we are building; we’ve got a lot invested in engineering and software some of which gets capitalized.  So clearly when you look at those components and then even dewatering this year. We had a huge ramp-up in demand and we had to build capital in some capacity to meet demand. We are building out our smart hubs in AIA and that requires not only P&L related investment around on the ground support in sales and engineering, but also you need tools, you need PipeDivers, you know SmartBalls, you need trucks and so we’ve really hit a point I think this year and into next year where you are going to see a higher level of investment as a percent to sales and that starts to moderate back to where we’ve been. 
Patrick Decker: You know I would just add Nate, I would say – again this is Patrick. I would say much like Mark talked about in his prepared comments around working capital and cash conversion I would say the same thing around CapEx and that is there is no structural change here in the capital intensity of this business. It really is the timing around the things that Mark eluded to here and we would expect that to moderate back to kind of normal levels. So nothing that we are particularly concerned about here. 
Nathan Jones: Okay, thanks very much for the help. I’ll pass it on. 
Patrick Decker: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. 
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone. 
Patrick Decker: Good morning. 
Mark Rajkowski: Good morning. 
Mike Halloran: So let’s just start on the orders side and the pipeline. Obviously underlying trends remain healthy. It doesn’t sound like there is any sign of slowdown. Maybe you could give a little color on how customers are looking at the world right now. Any hesitancy in in pipeline conversion from their perspective, and any color around that would be great?
Patrick Decker: Sure Mike, this is Patrick. So we are saying you know we are keeping our areas close to the ground obviously on each one of our end marks, so let’s start with utilities. We really aren’t saying or hearing any indications of a slowdown. Again, if you think about the 10% increase in our bidding pipeline and treatment which is a really good indicator and that’s you know, that’s on a very big pipeline. So you know at some point in time you’ll expect that to kind of be tough in terms of year over year compares, but it continues to expand there, and that is consistent whether it be in North America and certainly in the emerging markets as we indicated.  We think Europe is next. You know it will moderate to kind of low single digit growth in 2019, but we’re not seeing any change in trajectory here, which is quite encouraging. Now we also feel that a fair amount of that is share gains, but again the overall market seem to be healthy.  On the industrial side, again you know 35% of our total revenue, you know there are channel partners; we go heavily through distribution. They again continue to see strength in the market. Again, we are calling for some moderation here in the second half of this year. We are not seeing that yet, but we are calling it. We are expecting that there will be some tough comps year-over-year that are out there. And so not sure if that’s helpful, but you know we’re not seeing it right now in terms of any slowdown. 
Mark Rajkowski: Just one comment. Yeah, and it’s all good but we are also mindful that you know there’s a chunk of our business that’s short cycled, right and when these things hit, they hit quickly and we are sober to that fact. But as Patrick said we have our antennae up. We are talking to our teams and customers constantly. We are all over the pipeline, so right now we are not seeing those signs. 
Mike Halloran: Sounds good and then another customer question, what’s the receptivity been as you are trying to bring some of these MCS solutions, you know the technology connectivity, analytics to the broader platform, particularly in the infrastructure side. Seems like its good receptive, I know you referenced in the prepared remarks and incremental product offerings coming this year, but love to hear some early thoughts there. 
A - Patrick Decker: Yeah, so we’ve been very encouraged. I think where I start Mike is we are able to have very different kinds of conversations today at different levels of the organization, more senior levels of the organization than we’ve had before, because if you think about any company going in and speaking to, let’s take utility, irrespective of what the utilities biggest challenges are, if you’ve only got one or two products to offer or a couple of pain point you are going to address, you spend your time trying to convince them those are the pain points they need to be addressing. We are able now to go in with confidence and first have a conversation around what are the biggest challenges that you believe you have or that the data shows that you have. With a pretty high likelihood we also then have the product, the technology, the offering to solve that problem and so we’re able to be seen as even more objective and consultative in the conversation.  Now that’s early days. You know we’re not – we don’t have that selling capability across the board. I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves, but that’s certainly where we’re going, and so I see a high degree of receptivity from the utility operators and CEO’s, because they want to be able to have that open candid objective conversation.  You know where we see a lot of the opportunities here, where we see a lot of synergies is new wins and interests across the emerging markets, where you know if they are building new infrastructure, they don’t want to build dominant infrastructure, they want to build smart infrastructure and so they need the help to be able to know how to best optimize that and that’s why we are seeing a lot of the receptivity there.  And then, you know when you think about the fact that previously Pure and the other advance infrastructure analytic businesses that we’ve acquired were pretty much largely North America and to some extent you know European businesses. Not a lot of presence in the emerging markets and that’s where we’re seeing a lot of the excitement from customers. 
Mike Halloran: That’s helpful, and then last one just the water infrastructure margins, obviously really robust in the quarter. Anything in there that you don’t think is sustainable relative to revenue levels in normal seasonality? 
A - Mark Rajkowski: No, it’s pretty clean. What we saw as a real push on productivity and savings and really kind of a catch up on pricing to offset what had been you know a little bit of a headwind from inflation and really good progress on that, so nothing unusual and we expect to continue to see that, you know those trends in 2019 with more pick up on price. 
Patrick Decker: And I would also just add there that I think it’s important that we know that you know we’re managing a portfolio here and so we’re allocating capital you know every day, every quarter, each year. And so you know we continue to invest in water infrastructure, we continue to invest in applied water. Obviously as we begin to see the ramp up in MCS margins here, that affords us the opportunity to further invest in those two pieces of our portfolio, because there’s a lot in the pipeline from a new product development standpoint and sales and marketing efforts that we’d like to be able to do here, but you know we’ll continue to manage that as a portfolio over time. 
Mike Halloran: Thanks gentlemen. I appreciate it.
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. 
Patrick Decker: Good morning Deane. 
Deane Dray: Hey, I’d like to start with the free cash flow guidance for 2019, the 105% or better and maybe could you just clarify whether you are baking in any of these working capital inefficiencies at the start of the year or any other tax noise, you know the component shortages that are requiring you to add a bit more to inventories. So any of those dynamics affecting the cash flow outlook? 
Patrick Decker: Yeah, absolutely Deane. We definitely took it on the chin in the quarter relative to some of these strategic you know pre buys, as well as and whether that was for the tariffs or around the component shortages, and you know we also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks saw a big ramp up in volume and quite frankly it was higher than certainly the – we had forecasted, above the top end of the range and the timing of that in the quarter was such that there were you know – that was $90 million of cash just in terms of volume.  And that is going to normalize in both of those items, along with continued progress on improving our processes and efficiency, whether it’s in receivables we’ve got a lot of opportunity on the inventories side of things with supply chain in our S&OP and payables, but those will reverse out in 2019. 
Deane Dray: That’s good. And just sticking around the cash flow side, a couple of points. One is, you all talking about at higher volume at year. You’re right, on the good side of being an outlier, because we’ve heard a number of the industrial companies that aside, just the opposite that there was a lot of fall off in December, so you’ve got that high quality problem of handling that $90 million, so that’s a positive. What about CapEx? How much for this year? Any particular projects that you would highlight in terms of investment? 
Mark Rajkowski: Right, I think you know we really pushed hard and we did spend capital to grow out our AIA platform as I mentioned. We’ve been running hard in terms of our engineering development around a number of software components and products that ended up as capitalized software.  And back to your point about nice problem to have, the demand in our dewatering business has really been running high, so we’ve had to add capacity to the fleet as well. So those are nice problems to have, but certainly things that we needed to respond to. As we look out in 2019 though Deane, we will – the investment level, we expect to remain flat. Part of that is a function of getting that ahead of the curve, which we did in you know the back part of 2018.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, and I think to your question Deane around, you know are there any specific projects to be called out in 2019, one of the reasons why you know we’re not able to say that it’s moderating or declining is because we also need to absorb and it’s not a big ticket item, but you know we’re going to be you know likely kicking off another greenfield expansion in India in terms of manufacturing capacity.  Now that won’t all hit in ‘19, but we’re certainly going to be starting that in ‘19. It’s not a big ticket item in and of itself, but it’s enough to kind of hold these numbers flat year-over-year and that’s just really again to get ahead of the incredible demand we’re seeing in India. 
Deane Dray: That’s great to hear about those investment opportunities and if we were looking at that free cash flow target for the year of that, it feels to us that there is further upside to that 105%, but we’ll see how this develops. And then as a follow-up… 
Patrick Decker: I can assure you Deane, we’re working at it. So you know it will…
Deane Dray: I hear that.
Patrick Decker: We were disappointed in Q4, right, so it got our attention on the working capital side. 
Deane Dray: Good, and then in terms of the organic revenue guidance, everything looked pretty much as expected if not a little bit better. The one that kind of jumps out at me is MCS. The four to six seems like they could be doing better and maybe it’s because we’re all excited about the opportunities in AIA. Maybe that they don’t move the needle enough yet, but what is that upside at MCS that could potentially do better than what you’re forecasting today? 
Patrick Decker: Yes, so the AIA platform is still a you know relatively small chunk of revenue for us at you know north of $100 million of revenue and that is going to be growing a very healthy double digit and is accelerating in 2019 versus ‘18, both orders and revenue. It really is the centerpiece of the platform and really Deane, it’s just very straight forward; its assumptions around timing on project deployments.  So you know we’ve got some very large deals that we’ve won. We have some that we are likely going to be announcing here in very short order. It just comes down to when those things hit. Most of them we believe will hit in 2020, which is what gives us great confidence around our margin expansion and growth in 2020. So obviously the timing of those things could move this around, but we are giving you our view kind of right down the middle of fairway right now. 
Deane Dray: Great, thank you. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning. 
A - Patrick Decker: Good morning John. 
John Walsh: So maybe just following back to that 2020 margin question, if I could ask it a little bit differently. So since you provided those targets, you’ve had FX tariffs, you’ve been getting some deals done. I believe that was an organic number and didn’t contemplate deal dilution at that time. Just wondering if you are filling this bridge with things that would have been sitting in a contingency bucket or if you are filling it by kind of over executing on other parts of the plan to you know think about this as not really an end point, but you know as the step to drive margins you know higher beyond, you know that kind of range over time. 
Patrick Decker: Yeah, and I’d say – sorry, this is Patrick. Sorry for that. No, it’s a great angle on the question John. The way I would articulate it would be, yes there are things that have created – leveled the dilution on their own, that being deals and things of that nature from an on margin standpoint, and this is a journey over time you know. It doesn’t end in 2020 and obviously it won’t be long and we’ll be giving you targets beyond 2020. What I would say has changed here are a couple of things that give us the confidence. One is that, we do see further opportunities to drive simplification and efficiency across the organization. Part of that obviously is by way of some of the integration synergies from the deals that we’ve done, part of that is just simplification of our heritage businesses by further integration there and simplification. So certainly we are leaning on that level harder than we had necessarily laid out at our original Investor Day, but it’s based on opportunity. Two, as we’ve added other you know assets to the portfolio and we are getting more mature on our own continuous improvement, you know the whole lean deployment journey, we are now able to deploy those capabilities across those new assets and so you now we’ve got a bigger pie to play with here in terms of driving efficiency, both on the lean sig sigma side, but also on the procurement side.  So those are the area that I would say that we are feeling even more confident about. And then, you know what we indicated at Investor Day was that as we integrated Sensus, we would get a better feel over time as to what the investment profile would look like on a year-by-year basis and so that moderates now that we are getting traction and you know seeing the benefits of what we’ve already spent on. 
Mark Rajkowski: And I’d just add to that, yeah we – you know in terms of the investments, if you look at the model, we’ve run heavier, sooner because of some of these opportunities and let those moderate. Also in the model we didn’t have as much inflation built in and we really – you know we really got hit hard this year and we’ve ramped up price and we’re going to be continuing to drive that into 2019. So there’s more there than we anticipated in the model as well, yeah. 
John Walsh: Got you, and then maybe just to follow on that, you know when you think about price, there’s obviously what you can get because of you know inflation where you are kind of passing through these costs, but you know there’s been a big kind of concerted effort to increase you know your pricing entitlement right, from what you are doing from a technology perspective, value based pricing. Can you talk about how – you know if you had to deconstruct the price, you know where – what’s more kind of value added, Xylem price versus you know kind of material or inflation related. 
A - Patrick Decker: Yeah, I would say you know it’s obviously hard to put a specific number on that, but I would say that directionally if I use the 80/20 rule here, yeah I’d say it’s still 80% is just you know brute force, get out there, leverage the fact that we got to drive price to cover inflation, cover the tariffs, you know those kinds of issues.  While at the same time certainly in each one of our businesses, at least the three segments, what I’ve been really encouraged by is the highly accretive margin profile of the new products that we’ve been bringing to market, whether they be products for different business models and that’s more of a big criteria and our new product development pipeline is, it’s got to be accretive in terms of growth rate, but also margin for the company. So I’d say that’s the kind of 20% if I picked a number to say that it’s been more value based pricing capability. 
Mark Rajkowski: And also the opportunity I think.
Patrick Decker: Yes.
John Walsh: Great, thank you. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. 
Ryan Connors: Great, thank you. I want to actually stick with that very theme you were just talking about there and then talk about the flipside of price costs, and get your thoughts on you know if we do go into an environment of where raw material costs are more moderating than ramping up, you know how does that impact your guidance assumption around margin. You are talking 100 and 150 basis points of margin upside, you know if pricing – to what extent can pricing be sticky and if raw materials come down is there upside to that? 
Mark Rajkowski : Yes, so Ryan I think historically in these businesses as we’ve gone back and looked at it, pricing has been pretty sticky. You know when you’ve gone to an inflationary period and you’ve gotten price, its unusual then been seen as giving it away. Obviously there’s probably someone that fringed the margin, but it’s not a step function change.  So if we were to see an auto moderating inflation or slowing down of cost pressures there, we would expect that to be sum of that level of benefit; hard to put a number on it. At this point in time it obviously depends on how much that price cost dynamic moves, but it should be a net positive for us. 
Ryan Connors: Got it. And then my other question, just wanted to probe on China a little bit and we buy the story there of the new regulations and whatnot, but just wanted to kind of play devil’s advocate and get your response to the fact that you know the strength is coming from treatment which is generally a longer cycle business, and might it – what would you say to the argument that you know maybe it’s going to stay stronger for a little longer, it will roll slower than you know some of the shorter cycle industrial businesses out there. And then so just want to get your thoughts on that dynamic?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, so to you know kind of breakdown China a bit here. So again we are expecting double digit growth in 2019, which dose moderate slightly from the 23% growth that we had in ‘18, but it’s still going to be – we expect strong double digit growth.  Now as you as you probably recall, we actually – two-thirds of our revenue in China is in the utility space, and that’s historically been pretty well protected. So when you think back what two, three years ago when companies were going through the shock in China and the downturn, we in the aggregate were down slightly, but even within that our utility business never declined, you know it grew throughout that cycle. It slowed, but it grew. It was the industrial and commercial piece of the business, the other third that took the big hit like our other industrial peers.  So your thesis is absolute correct in that one, the long lead time nature of the treatment orders and pipeline is what gives us great confidence that you know we don’t see an overall slowdown impacting us in China in ‘19 certainly on the utility side of the business. Secondly, we’re seeing very good growth in transport, you know on the pumping, on the waste water pumping side, which is very good margin business. That is more near term, short cycle business that remains strong.  We are not prognosticating here, but we are building into our guide some slowdown in the industrial and commercial building piece of the market in the second half of the year, which is what really kind of helps moderate our growth from 2018. I shouldn’t say help, but leads to that along the way. But the other lever we got there is this new AIA platform. I mean we’ve got tremendous adoption across the Chinese customer base in terms of excitement in that area. Again, a small piece of business, but very promising for ‘19 and beyond. 
Ryan Connors: Okay, great stuff. Thanks for your time. 
Patrick Decker: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning. 
Patrick Decker: Good morning Joe. 
Joe Giordano: Hey, so I don’t want to keep talking about margins, but I’m going to, so apologies here. If I look at ‘19 right, so the operating guide, I think at the mid-point it’s something like 60% incrementals and then to get from there to 20 is another roughly 250 just to the bottom end of that where you’d have infrastructure already at a pretty high level.  I fully appreciate the comments about MCS and the spending and things like that, that will moderate and lapping some of the big comps. But I guess I’m getting to – it seems a lot easier to get there on EBITDA and if you were in a situation where you hit EBITDA guidance – EBITDA 2020 guidance, but are a little light on the operating side. Internally in the way that you’re running your business, is that a win, is that something that you’re driving towards in that way or you are meeting it but optically on the operating side it’s a little different. 
Patrick Decker: No, we’re going after the operating peace. I mean we lay out the EBITDA just because there is noise in there and you know deal accounting and things of that nature, but no we are measured on operating income, that’s a third of our annual incentive plan. The other third is organic revenue growth and the other third is working capital. And so you know we’re – that’s the way we are playing it Joe. 
Mark Rajkowski:
’: We continue to drive productivity and we’ve got the actions and opportunities that Patrick talked about. We haven’t seen the ramp yet from global business services. So, there is a number of levers that we have that are going to be driving our operating margin expansion, which will play through to EBITDA as well.
Jo Giordano: Fair enough. When you talk about China, you guys just kind of guiding to it, can you size the China and India business for you guys right now?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so China has now become our second largest market outside of the U.S., albeit still relatively small. So our revenue in China is roughly about $300 million and that was about $170 million just a few years ago, just to give you a feel. So again, still not large numbers in the absolute, but growing very nicely.  India is just under $100 million of revenue, with an order book that is well above that here in 2019, but India is still a relatively small piece of our overall revenue, but just again going to be our fastest growing market in ‘19 and ‘20.
Operator: The next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. On the M&A front you’ve obviously been quite active this past year. As you’re looking at valuations of prospective deals across the three segments, two kind of inter-linked questions. Number one, are those deal multiples higher than what perhaps they have been over the past year and secondly, among the three segments which in your judgment present the most attractive M&A prospectivity today?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes, so we’ve not seen – I guess first of all the kind of deals that we do, you know I’m very proud of our M&A team and our folks in the businesses as to how they cultivate these deal opportunities and relationships, which has proven over time to help keep the multiples either in a really attractive spot or in a manageable spot, and so we’ve not seen any big move or expansion in multiples. By having said that, not for those reasons you also though haven’t seen us do a deal in the last 12 months, and so it’s kind of hard to say at this point in time, as to what there maybe is a gap between seller and buyer expectations. But we’re not seeing any big move there at this point in time.  In terms of the question around the three segments, first of all we like all three, they each have interesting opportunities, but they play different roles, and so I would say that if you look at our Water Infrastructure space and you look at our MCS space, that’s largely around the utility and I think there you will continue to see us do smaller bolt on tuck-ins to build out this new analytics platform, as well as strengthen the digital offerings of our product lines along the way, but they are not going to move the needle in terms of capital outlet, based on what we have line of sight to today.  But then when I turn to the Applied Water segment, and you think about our industrial water business there, we see potentially attractive opportunities in that space to further move that business up the technology curve and round out our solutions offering in that set. So there are opportunities across the board. Obviously we are prioritizing the digital and software component, but that’s not at the exclusion of also defending our core product offerings when the opportunity presents itself.
Pavel Molchanov: Alright. I appreciate it, guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: The final question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee: Good morning. Maybe a couple of modeling questions here. First on MCS, it does look like the growth derating here near-term in Q1 and then you did mention some of the bigger deployments later this year, but maybe more fully materializing in 2020. So is it fair to say 2019 is a bit of a normalization year in terms of MCS growth and you’d see acceleration in 2020 or do you actually think you can do better growth second half versus first half, even this year with the comps being tougher as you move into the back half?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes Brian, this is Mark and Patrick had mentioned it I think briefly in the opening remarks, but also in response to a question. I wouldn’t call 5% to 6% normalization. It really reflects timing of some of the large deployments we’ve had and you’ve seen some of the big wins, the orders growth and what’s happening here is really just the timing of when those projects get deployed. And so we do expect a little better growth rate in the back half of 2019 and certainly into 2020. We expect to see significant acceleration of revenue growth.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough and then second question just on the free cash flow topic, I know there’s been a number of questions here, but if you just look through the first nine months of the year for ‘18, you were at 60% conversion and that was already tracking well below the levels that you were at the past two years at the same points in each of those respective years.  So wondering, you know why was 4Q shaping up to be such a swing factor for free cash flow conversion this year, and was it all timing related or was there something else at play in ‘18 and then maybe just to round it out, why doesn’t that repeat in ‘19? Thank you.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, sure Brian, good question. Typically, we generate a lot of cash in Q4. I mean it’s our best quarter and so what happened this year, a couple of things and one is timing around the very strong growth we saw later in the fourth quarter, and that was a $90 million impact on its own in terms of cash related to sales and receivables.  And then as things got a little bit more pressured in terms of the component shortages, we – the teams got aggressive and we made some strategic buys there, as well as some more on the – you know related to tariffs to lock in better pricing. And both of those factors will work through. It will be a source of cash in 2019, and we do expect – we don’t expect those to be recurring, and we expect a more normalized picture around our cash flow profile in 2019.
Patrick Decker: Yes Brian, I would just maybe wrap up that question with an additional view. Your question around maybe tracking below the previous year through the first nine months, that was really being driven by a couple of things.  So we were tracking very well from a working capital improvement year-over-year standpoint through the first nine months of the year, and so as a result of that, we were also confident in our ability to fund some of the CapEx that Mark alluded to around the dewatering fleet, the cap software in Sensus, smart hubs in AIA and then that’s what drove some of the year-over-year declines in the first nine months.  But we were expecting before we had these issues that Mark laid out around the supply chain constraints and just a big pop in receivables in December because of a heavy revenue month, we were expecting to be able to claw that back and be at or above 100% free cash flow conversion. , and that really was the surprise for us.  So, that’s on us, we own it. We are rectifying it and we’re highly confident we’re going to be at or above the 100% in ‘19 and well beyond. There is no structural change here.
Operator: At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Decker for any closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Alright, well again, thank you everybody. Safe travels. I appreciate your continued interest and support. See you out on the road, and we’ll talk to you again after our Q1 earnings call. Thank you all.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. Overall, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings in the quarter. The markets we operate in remain robust and our team is leveraging that strength to win more and larger orders. Year-to-date, we've delivered an 8% increase in orders, which sets us up well for continued strong growth. And I continue to be pleased with the price realization that we're achieving. This reflects both the underlying strength in our markets, but also the quality and the breadth of our portfolio. Our ability to deliver even more comprehensive solutions to address our customers' needs has strengthened and we've expanded the value we're bringing to them in meaningful ways. We also continue to deliver on our productivity initiatives, which enabled us to mitigate the inflationary pressures that we've seen throughout the year. I'm very pleased with the discipline that our teams are demonstrating, truly embedding the continuous improvement mindset into our daily work. That, once again, contributed to our margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in the quarter. So let me review a few of the details. In the third quarter, we again delivered strong broad-based orders and revenue growth. As I just mentioned, orders increased 8% in the third quarter, which brings us to four consecutive quarters of high single to double-digit orders growth, a strong indicator of sustained growth ahead. We had strong orders growth across our emerging markets, including a more than 40% increase in India and 10% increase in China. We also saw notable strength in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment, where orders exceeded 30%. It's great to see the momentum building in our Sensus business as well as across the businesses and our new advanced infrastructure analytics platform. In addition, we're continuing to make progress in the area of revenue synergies. With more significant wins finalized during the third quarter, we've now secured about $100 million in revenue synergy wins year-to-date. Our most recent wins include a large metrology project in India, where we were able to leverage the strong relationship that Xylem already have with the customer to open the door to Sensus solutions. Likewise, we were also able to sell a comprehensive Sensus solution to a Xylem combo utility in Latin America. These two wins alone were worth about $70 million. Now, these latest wins will largely not start to materialize into revenue until late 2019 and beyond as our teams work with the customers to develop appropriate implementation plans, but these wins further validate our thesis about utilizing the strength of Xylem's global presence to create new opportunities for all of our new solutions across Sensus and our AIA platform and drive growth. We see further opportunities in our larger international deal pipeline, which we're continuing to develop. Revenue in the quarter grew 8% organically with strength across every end market and region. Revenue in Emerging Markets increased 13% in the quarter with a couple of standout results. Our business in China grew more than 20% in the quarter. There, we continue to see strong investment by utilities to upgrade their facilities to meet new regulatory requirements, particularly those around sewage discharge standards. We also saw strong growth in Latin America, up 20% in the quarter. Our business in this region is smaller relative to our other Emerging Markets, but our team there is building very good momentum with a focus on the most promising opportunities, such as strength in public utilities and mining. Last quarter, I discussed the strong progress we've made in our price realization efforts. That work has progressed even further as we stay ahead of inflation pressure. In the third and fourth quarters, we announced additional pricing actions and we're already achieving good traction in the marketplace. Again, the health of our end market certainly plays a role in our progress to-date, but our success also reflects the strength of our offering, the value we provide to our customers and the discipline of our sales teams. As I already mentioned, we continue to deliver on our continuous improvement initiatives. This quarter, we generated $38 million in savings through our productivity and lean initiatives. This helped us drive a 110 basis point increase year-over-year in our adjusted EBITDA margin and 70 basis point expansion of our adjusted operating margin, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. And finally, we delivered an 18% increase in our adjusted earnings per share; so, across the board, another strong quarter. I'll address our outlook for the year later in the call, but I do want to remind you of the expectations we shared with you at the beginning of the year. We began with an outlook of 4% to 6% organic top line growth and adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 to $2.97. Since that discussion, we have faced inflationary pressures and tariffs, but through the execution of strong productivity initiatives, price realization as well as execution in the marketplace, we have mitigated those challenges. Furthermore, we have been managing the impact of a strengthening dollar, which has also weighed modestly on our earnings. Our outlook today, nine months later, is for higher organic revenue growth, now up 7% to 8%, and nearly the same EPS midpoint despite absorbing about $0.05 of negative foreign exchange impact. So I'm very pleased with our team's performance, and we will remain focused on closing out the year strong and delivering on our long-term commitments. Before I turn over to Mark, I want to touch on a couple of other items of interest; first, the strength of the utilities market. This is a topic that I'm asked about in just about every meeting I have with investors, so let me share my observations. Utilities remain our largest end market at roughly 50% of our revenue, and we see continued strength here across all of the regions in which we operate. There are a number of drivers which differ by region, from regulatory compliance pressures to the need to strengthen the resiliency of their operations, to the realities of dealing with aging or overstressed infrastructure. Utilities are investing in their operations, and we have the essential solutions they need. In the U.S., we had a few big projects slip into the fourth quarter, but the market remains strong. Year-to-date, our revenue in the U.S. utilities is up 10%, and our backlog is up double-digits. And globally, our treatment bidding pipeline, a metric we often point to as a leading indicator, increased 11% in the third quarter; so, a very healthy market from our perspective. Next is innovation; strengthening and accelerating our innovation pipeline has been one of our key strategic priorities. We are progressing this work organically and through acquisitions. As a result, we've made steady progress in growing our vitality index, which now stands at just under 25%. As a reminder, our vitality index is calculated as the sum of new product revenue in the first five years from launch. And over the past three years, our vitality index has increased 600 basis points. Our new product portfolio is performing well. In fact, the revenue from these products is growing at faster rates and they're generating accretive margins. We are well on track to meeting our 2020 target of a 30% vitality index. We're in the early stages of building out our offerings in embedded software and network services. We've created an enterprise-wide software center of excellence that's focusing on increasing the value that software and data analytics will provide to future Xylem innovation. This group is integral to developing the strategy and governance of Xylem-wide software and data analytics. Importantly, it's partnering closely with our businesses to ensure that all solutions are developed in alignment with our customers' needs and expectations, and are scalable globally. As I mentioned on our last call, our customers are looking for us to move faster in the development of these new software-enabled solutions. This new center of excellence will help us accelerate this work, capitalizing on our first-mover advantage to bring these margin-accretive solutions to the marketplace. So now, please turn to slide 5 and Mark will review the quarter results in more detail.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I'm very proud of our team's performance in the third quarter. Overall, revenues were up 8% year-over-year. This also reflects 8% organic growth as the 2 points of growth we generated from acquisitions were offset by 2 points of foreign exchange headwind. From an organic perspective, this strength in revenue was broad-based across all of our end markets and in all key geographies. We continue to see good momentum in the utilities end market with 9% growth. This was in line with our expectations and driven by strong performance in our Water Infrastructure segment, from transport strength and treatment project deliveries, as well as project deployments in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. The highest growth was in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions, which were up 8% and 25%, respectively. The industrial end market, with growth of 5% year-over-year, continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Market conditions remain healthy in our dewatering and Applied Water businesses, where saw strength in North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our commercial end market also had a very strong quarter with 13% growth. This was above our expectations and driven by robust project activity in the U.S. and China markets. Finally, in residential, we were up 4% from growth in Western Europe and the U.S. Shifting to operational performance, adjusted EBITDA increased 110 basis points to 20.3% in the quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased productivity savings, volume leverage from strong organic growth, and price realization, and partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix, investments (12:55) and foreign exchange impacts. Price realization continued to accelerate and improved to 100 basis points in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the strong execution from our commercial teams to mitigate the higher inflation we saw in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 14.6%, which includes 20 basis points of non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions in our advanced infrastructure analytics platform. Our teams continue to execute on our productivity programs and we delivered $38 million in cost savings during the quarter. This 300-basis-point improvement offset inflation, including tariff impacts of about $5 million. Through our strong revenue performance, improving price realization and solid operational execution, we delivered earnings per share of $0.77, an increase of 18% year-over-year, which was at the high end of our expectations. Please turn to slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $537 million in the quarter, which was down 1% organically year-over-year. This was primarily due to timing of several large custom transport and treatment orders that we expect to shift into the fourth quarter. Our orders for the year are up mid-single digits, reflective of the overall healthy demand in the utility and industrial markets, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter and into 2019. We exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $659 million, up 10% organically year-over-year. Water Infrastructure revenue, up $541 million, grew 8% year-over-year on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was an $18 million headwind. Emerging Markets were up 23%, including more than 40% growth in China and roughly 30% growth in Latin America. The majority of the outsized growth we saw in Emerging Markets came from our treatment business, which was up more than 40%, driven both by project deliveries and strong underlying demand. Canada was a notable pocket of strength this quarter with 24% growth driven by solid demand in our wastewater transport business and increased industrial activity in the construction and oil and gas markets for our dewatering business. We saw modest growth of 2% in Western Europe, which reflected strength in our wastewater transport and dewatering businesses, partly offset by softer treatment performance as we lapped several large project deliveries in the prior year. The U.S. was flat in the quarter, primarily due to a tough prior-year comparison of 9% growth and the timing of utility project deliveries. We expect U.S. utility growth to be up in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter with full year growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range. U.S. industrial revenues were up mid-single digits in the third quarter from Water Infrastructure. Operating margin for the segment increased 110 basis points to 19.2% driven by cost savings from productivity programs, higher volumes and accelerating price realization. This more than offset inflation, growth investments, and unfavorable mix from higher treatment in emerging market projects this year versus last year. Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment also had a very good quarter. Orders of $377 million were up 3%, organically. We exited the quarter with backlog of $216 million, which is up 6% organically compared to last year. Revenue for Applied Water was $378 million, up 8% organically versus the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange was a $4 million headwind. Revenues in the U.S. grew 9% driven by strength across each of the segment's verticals. Commercial and industrial were standouts, up 12% and 10%, respectively. In commercial, we continue to see strength in the institutional building sector from project activity and modest share gains. Industrial growth was driven by strong project demand as well as growth in our specialty flow business. Residential was up 4% and in line with our expectations. In Western Europe, we saw growth of 7%, which was also driven by broad-based strength across all verticals. And finally, in the Emerging Markets revenue grew 8%, which primarily reflects strong growth in China in the commercial building sector. There were also pockets of strength in Latin America from industrial activity. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 60 basis points to 16.1% year-over-year. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by cost savings from productivity programs, excellent price realization and higher volume leverage. This more than offset inflation, foreign exchange and unfavorable mix. Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of Measurement & Control Solutions. Our Measurement & Control Solutions segment continues to build upon its growing momentum in the marketplace. Orders of $442 million in the quarter were up 31%, organically, and were driven primarily by the North American water business. This strong growth increases our confidence in the health of the clean water market and growing opportunities from our broad offerings across this segment. Segment revenues were $368 million, up 8% on an organic year-over-year basis. Foreign exchange was a $2 million headwind, and the net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added $24 million. U.S. revenues grew 14%. This was due to strength in our water business, which was up 12% in the quarter, and the deployment of the Nicor Gas contract. The segment's European and Emerging Markets businesses were each down low-single digits in the quarter due to difficult compares against prior-year project deployments. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points to 19%. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter declined 50 basis points to 9.5% year-over-year. The benefits of higher volumes, cost savings and improved price realization were offset by the unfavorable mix from the large gas project deployment, inflation and our investments in strategic growth initiatives. Those investments include our efforts in the areas of networking and software development to support the sizable synergy opportunities we have across our Xylem pipeline, such as the two deals we won this past quarter that Patrick mentioned, as well as investing in commercial resources and capabilities to capture share in the fast-growing infrastructure analytics market, where orders grew 27% in the quarter. Increased investments, along with purchase accounting amortization, impacted operating margins by 280 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. During the quarter, we also saw ramp-up in the cost of certain electronic component parts, which increased year-over-year inflation on a quarter sequential basis by 70 basis points. Now, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $400 million (sic) [$404 million]. Despite higher cash earnings and improved working capital efficiency, free cash flow conversion declined to about 100% (sic) [99%] in the quarter. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily driven by the timing of certain capital projects year-over-year as well as higher levels of working capital reflecting the timing of shipments and inventory levels to support higher fourth quarter sales. This quarter also reflected an accelerated pension contribution to optimize our U.S. tax benefit. We anticipate capital spending and working capital investment to normalize in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect to deliver our full year target of more than 115% free cash flow conversion. While the amount of working capital investment is higher year-over-year, I'm pleased with our progress on working capital efficiency. Our teams drove a 170 basis point reduction as we continue to improve our processes and discipline. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and continue to repay the short term debt we use to fund the Pure acquisition, which we expect to completely pay down by the end of this year. Now, please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover our updated outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Let me begin with a look at our end markets. Overall, our end market view for the full year is largely unchanged from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. We do continue to deliver above our growth expectations in the commercial end market, so we've updated that projection to reflect continued strength. Let me quickly run through our projections. As I stated earlier, our utility end market continues to show strength, particularly in the U.S. and key Emerging Markets. For full-year 2018, we continue to expect revenue to grow in the high-single-digit range, overall. Our businesses have performed well in the industrial end market year-to-date. We see continued solid growth in the U.S. and Europe. The heavy industrials in North America have continued to strengthen. In the Emerging Markets, we continue to see stronger conditions in China, India and Latin America, with somewhat softer conditions in parts of the Middle East. We expect industrials to be up mid-single digits for the full year. Organic growth in the commercial end market has been strong all year. We see continued solid growth in the U.S. and do expect some moderation to occur in Europe. Emerging Markets should continue to benefit from increased government spending, particularly in India and China. We've raised our full-year growth outlook to the high-single-digit range. Finally, in residential, we had somewhat softer results in the first half of the year, but we're back up 4% in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate full-year 2018 revenue growth in the low-single digit range. Competition in the U.S. market remains high, where demand tends to be replacement-driven. We also anticipate solid demand to continue in China and other Asia Pacific countries as well as Western Europe. Now, please turn to slide 11 and I'll address our updated outlook. We're well positioned to deliver on our full-year commitments while continuing to invest in our longer-term growth initiatives. With strong revenue growth year-to-date, we now expect our full-year organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. We expect to continue to generate significant cost savings, which are at $115 million for the third quarter, and to drive price actions to enable us to meet our operating margin expansion targets of 60 basis points to 70 basis points. That results in an adjusted operating margin of 13.9% to 14%. This expansion excludes about 20 basis points of margin dilution from purchase accounting for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve by 110 basis points to 130 basis points, which brings the full-year range to between 19.8% to 20%. At the bottom line, we've narrowed the range of expected adjusted full-year earnings per share to $2.87 to $2.89 after absorbing $0.05 in negative foreign exchange impacts over the course of the year. This excludes integration, restructuring and realignment costs of about $45 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be approximately 20% for the year. Now, please turn to slide 12 and I'll quickly review our planning assumptions for the fourth quarter. We anticipate overall organic revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, reflecting the benefits of continued strength in our underlying markets, our solid commercial performance, and strong backlog entering the fourth quarter. And lastly, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter is expected to be in the range of 15.9% to 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% to 21.4%. Now, please turn to slide 13. So to wrap up, we've had another strong quarter and the team continues to execute at a high level. This performance is driving our strong revenue growth, productivity initiatives, and our solid price realization. That's enabling us to continue to expand margins in the near term while also investing in strategically important initiatives that will accelerate our growth and margin expansion in the longer term. I'm very pleased with the momentum that has been building in the business over the course of the year and will continue to propel us forward. So with that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And your first question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to discuss the channel story in industrial a little bit. There's, I guess, a theory out there making the rounds that a lot of the strength we're seeing in industrial represents sort of a combination of channel stuffing and order pull forward ahead of price increases related to tariffs and et cetera. So – and I guess the implication being that there's a hangover or a pullback at some point. Can you give us your take on that as it relates to your business?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Ryan. So we're not really seeing that. I mean, there might have been a tad of that in the last quarter, but we don't really see tariffs having a big impact on our offering and our channels in the market. Having met with – spoken to a number of our channel partners at both WEFTEC as well as other events, recently, and they certainly were not pointing to any of that activity happening in their channel. So that's not something that we are seeing in our business.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. Great.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: And then, my other one is somewhat bigger picture in nature. You mentioned that Sensus had a nice combo utility sale in the quarter. We seem to be seeing an increased trend of these multi-utility formats; big announcement on that front last week and some talk out there that there might be more to come in the U.S. in terms of multi-utility. How does Sensus view that trend? Is that a positive, a negative? Does it not really matter? What's the view there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, we see it very much as a positive trend. And the reason we see that is because we feel that we're even stronger from a competitive position when it's a combo utility because the economics around our FlexNet offering make that much more sense for them; that many more endpoints that they're able to leverage off of that fixed network. And so, we do see that trend continuing and we consider it to be very positive.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And do you have any – I mean, this is – probably not, but do you have any rough number in terms of what percentage – what portion of Sensus business today is combo utility type formats globally?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have – and it would be predominately here in the U.S. I don't have that number off the top of my head, Ryan. We can certainly get it back to you, guys.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. Sure. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. It's interesting that this quarter there's, across the industrials, lots of hand-wringing about China slowing and you all put up better than 20% growth in China. So, just spend a moment, if you could, about that demand. I know there's really tighter regulatory enforcement about wastewater discharge, but how's that translating into your book of business? What kind of mix are you seeing? Where's backlog and pricing?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, you're absolutely right, Deane. The drivers there, for the most part, are the fact that water quality and connected treatment continues to be a top policy mandate of the central government there, and we've seen that flow really over the last years. Even whenever people were talking about China being down overall, because two-thirds of our revenue there in China is in the utilities space, we were able to absorb the softness a few years ago on the commercial building industrial side; but, it really is the regulatory drivers. In terms of mix for us, that's always a favorable mix from a margin standpoint. We've long said that, as we also are building more of a replacement business in China, we're seeing the aftermarket coming through at very attractive margin rates, similar to what we would see around the rest of the world.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then, swing over to the advanced infrastructure analytics business, and as you've built out that platform, there were all kinds of discussions about developing a pricing model. And there was some hopes that maybe you'd try to get a percent of savings from non-revenue water, but that didn't look like that was something the market was going to be interested in. But it sounds like you're focusing more, now, on a Network as a Service model. And maybe – I know it's still early, but if you could share for us how that translates into what kind of margin, what kind of growth rate, and then customer acceptance?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So you're right, Deane. So we are still in the early stages of a number of the pilots that we've talked about before where we are trying different pricing models and – whether it be performance-based contracting, value sharing, or strictly subscription-based businesses. And so, we'll have more to say on that as we move along here. I'd like to keep a little bit close to the chest on competitive dynamics, but nevertheless, the margins we see on that business are very attractive and very accretive, overall, both from a gross margin standpoint and a net operating margin standpoint. We've seen a big pocket in orders here. There are some delays in that converting into revenues, so you will see more of that lift here later in the fourth quarter and into Q1 and Q2 of next year.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then, just one last clarification. I like how you didn't use this as an excuse whatsoever about some customer order deliveries going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but if you could just size for us those orders, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So we came in – the orders for Water Infrastructure, overall, came in down 1%. The effect of those order delays – if we would have had those in the quarter, we'd have been about probably 5% to 6% orders growth. So it was about that big of an impact, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Terrific. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just start with a higher level question here for you, Patrick. You came into this year saying that you thought the utility cycle was in a multiyear upswing. Has there been anything that's happened this year that has changed your outlook for that, either positively or negatively?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So I – not really much has changed in our mind, Nate. When I look at it, I would say, so kind of where are we in the cycle? I mean, I can't give a specific prognosis on where we are, but I can certainly look at leading indicators. I mean, our orders, again, were up 8% through the year. Our backlog is up 10%. Our bid pipeline is up 11% on the treatment side, which is a leading indicator for the rest of the infrastructure business. And we still think that there is a lot of room for continued convergence in the markets that we serve because of the integrated technology that we're providing here and the whole idea of connected products and software solutions. So we see there being a different dynamic emerging here that we think is going to buoy the growth and the health of this market for some time to come. Also, as you know, on the wastewater side of the cycle, that historically has grown mid-single digits over a long period of time, just given the nature and the criticality of what the utilities are dealing with there and very hard for them to kick can down the road and neglect spending. So we see that continuing for a long time. On the clean water side of the market, that can be a little bit lumpier. That's where the utilities can tend to defer projects and spending. We're not seeing that right now because we are continuing to see this heavy conversion towards AMI on metrology and the communications and Software as a Service offering that backs that up. So we still feel that we're in a prolonged healthy cycle here.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Then on price cost, looking at your overall slide there, you have price up 100 basis points, cost up 300 basis points, and then your productivity restructuring bucket up 300 basis points. If I just look at price cost, your 200 basis points difference there, is it your intention really to neutralize cost with price and productivity? Is there an opportunity to be going a little more aggressively off the price here? I mean, I don't view 100 basis points of price increase in this environment as being particularly aggressive. Is there potential for you to see some margin expansion from maybe being a little more aggressive on price here or do you need to balance that with competitive dynamics?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes. So, I'll share a few words here, and then I'd – Mark – like to have Mark jump in here. So we – as we indicated in our commentary, we have just gone back out, again, with another round of price increases across the businesses and, I would say, that will be globally. But I would say we're probably playing a little bit of catch-up in Europe where, again, the whole inflation discussion hasn't been as prominent across Europe. But we believe there's an equal opportunity there to be aggressive on price, so we plan to do so. But – so yeah, we do think we're going to be able to narrow some of that gap, but – Mark, you want to jump in?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. No. I – Nate, we definitely would agree with that view in terms of the ability to be more aggressive on price, particularly, as you mentioned, we saw a ramp up in terms of the material component of that. That's really what drove the quarter sequential increase, and a lot of it was material; a little bit of freight as well. But when we think about the model, it is really important for us to continue to drive productivity around procurement, but also Lean Six Sigma, continuous improvement. But we need to and we can do a better job in terms of margin expansion by offsetting material cost increases with more price, no doubt.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And we're encouraged, Nate, by the moves that we've seen our competitors make to follow us on price. I'd be more concerned if they weren't. But we have acted like the leader, and we'll continue to act like the leader; and presumably, they will follow as well.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Does the amount of inflation you've seen in the system over the last year or two, and potentially going forward here, have any impact on your 17% to 18% operating margin targets in 2020?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No impact.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah...
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: ...just because – Nate, on that, our original assumption when we looked at – when we laid out our target was zero-price, okay? So, yes – and we did expect higher levels of inflation. That's ticked up, certainly, a little bit more material, but we are – that's the whole point about driving harder on price to offset that.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. And Scott, your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Can you hear me now?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes, we can.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yes, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'm sorry. I had myself muted, of course. Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: How are you?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Nathan asked a couple of my questions, so I'm going to follow up with a couple different ones. I was just kind of wondering – I know your resi business is not that large, but I was just kind of wondering what you were seeing trend-wise, really, as recently as possible with rates higher and some of these housing-related stocks showing like zero resilience (39:08) and a lot of numbers coming down. Could you talk about, from your perspective, where you see your residential business really both now and like over the next, let's say, six months, if you would?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, Scott, our resi business is really much more of a replacement business, and so we're not really exposed too much or relying too much on resi expansion because of the installed base we have there. So we've historically called that to be a low-single-digit growth. It bounces around if you get a pop here or there in terms of a distributor buy-in or something of that sort, but we're still calling it for low-single digits and don't see any kind of real snap in that trajectory.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. But nothing has materially changed in the last couple of months with higher rates, from what you see?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, not that we've seen; and that's the same in discussion with our distributors.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Thank you. The next question really is about some of the things that you're doing in industrial, which we've talked about recently. I was just maybe wondering if you could kind of tell us, on the industrial water side, maybe the two or three big opportunities that you're pursuing right now.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Are you – you mean from a commercial standpoint, Scott?
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'm sorry. Yes, commercial, in the commercial line, yes please.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So I'd say, again there, one of the benefits we've gotten this year and, certainly, last year was some of the revenue synergies that we've gotten from having finalized the integration of our commercial team in the Americas. That was the last region to come together and act as one integrated commercial team. We'd already done that in Europe and had done that in Emerging Markets. And we're seeing a sizable amount of revenue synergies there across all of the Americas commercial team, and certainly a meaningful piece of that is in the industrial space. I would say, secondly, you have also seen that we are getting the benefits of some of our NPD pipeline and new product that we've launched in the marketplace, and have a number of those that are scheduled here for the fourth quarter and Q1 of next year that we think is going to help us continue to gain some share there. I would say we're seeing some more industrial treatment opportunities as well as we grow our Wedeco offering because of some of this integration together.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. And if I can just sneak in a third – a final one here and it's a piggyback on the prior question. Are you in a position to give us what you think will be the pricing exit rate for fourth quarter?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We're not going to try to predict that. A lot of it is a function of negotiations and ultimate realization. What I would tell you, Scott, is that we've got good acceleration. And just to give you the ramp in the quarter and as a reminder, we got 20 basis points in Q1, 60 basis points in Q2, and then in July ramped up to 80 basis points. We were at 100 basis points in August, 110 basis points in September. So, we've got good momentum moving into the fourth quarter. But it is a function of not just the price increases, but also what you realize; but, we feel that there's good momentum there.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's hugely helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And you kind of touched on this already, but like in your 2020 bridge, I mean, there's obviously a lot built in on sourcing and that part of the business. And if we kind of extrapolate what's happening now, forward a couple of years and we talk about an inflationary environment, like what's your confidence that prices – is it just prices you offset or are there other areas that you target to kind of offset that impact?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, Joe, the – so certainly, price is a big piece of this and we're going to continue to be driving hard on that, but it's not the only lever that we're focusing on. So we do still have – obviously, we're benefiting in the procurement space from higher volumes, so we get more volume leverage there in terms of our purchasing power negotiation. Two, we're also doing a lot of work right now in what we call value optimized design. Some people call it VAVE, but value optimized design is really about taking products that are a little bit longer in the tooth in terms of age, maybe slower growth rates, margins that may be challenged. We don't have a lot of those in the portfolio, but those that we do, we're doing a lot of work to redesign those products to spur the growth rate and improve the margins; and, we see that being a substantial contributor to our margin expansion from a gross margin standpoint. And then, of course, the third lever that we've talked about is the introduction of Global Business Services, which we're in the early phases of right now. That really is about simplifying our back office and a number of those functions. We're working with Cognizant as our outside partner, and we don't really expect those benefits to start ramping in until 2019 and 2020. And that's predominantly going to be hitting the G&A line where we still – we think we're still about 200 basis points, at least, above where we need and can be at the end of that GBS implementation.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's fair. And then, can you give us a little bit more color on the electronics tightness for Sensus? Has that mitigated a little bit over the last couple of months, or is that accelerating, and what kind of – are you buying, double ordering to kind of take care of that? How are you guys dealing with it?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Joe, it's Mark. Yeah. This has been a challenge for us throughout the course of the year. The team has been managing it extremely well. We do benefit from having a really good partner in terms of contract manufacturer that brings their scale to the play. But nevertheless, the demand for these components has continued to increase. And what we've done is, really, we tried to get out ahead of it where we can in terms of bringing on inventory to make sure we have enough to meet our demand. But also, where we need to, we get more aggressive on price so we can get more of our fair share of those components in. And that's really what you saw in the third quarter with that ramp up in inflation in M&CS.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I think, Joe, that really the only reason we highlighted it in our commentary was really just the impact it had on the Measurement & Control Solutions margin, which was 70 basis points. It's not really significant overall Xylem. But as we're going through segment-by-segment commentary, we felt the need to kind of call that out. It's not that we're downplaying them. The teams are all over this. And as Mark commented, we have a great contract manufacturing partner that's able to really leverage their scale to make sure we get access to supply. So the teams continue to work it. We're having to pay a little extra to get it, but we're going hard on the price angle in other areas to offset.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then, last from me, we're starting to see some, at least on the public side, valuations come in. As you look at your balance sheet and you've already kind of delineated key areas that you look for more strategic deployment, how the – are you guys sharpening pencils a little bit here, or are you getting a little bit more aggressive with wanting to deploy as valuations come down?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I think – I mean, certainly, Joe, to your point, I mean, we do have a really attractive, healthy pipeline. And so, we will continue to deploy capital on what we think is a great pipeline of assets. Certainly, we keep an eye on valuations that are out there, whether it be public or privately held. But I wouldn't foreshadow anything here in the near-term that we're going to go jump on something just because of valuations being where they are. While valuations matter, of course, there's also the discussions around what cost of capital is. And we always take a long-term view on cost of capital as opposed to where it may be at any point in the cycle. So we're going to continue to be disciplined on how we evaluate these opportunities, and evaluate and monitor.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from John Walsh of Credit Suisse.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse: Hi. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, John.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, John.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse: Hey, wondering – piggybacking off that question, you're going to pay down some short-term debt here. You're going to generate a lot of cash Q4 and into next year. Can you level set us on what your actual capacity is remaining within an investment grade credit rating as you see it today?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, John, I mean, it definitely will ramp up as we move through the fourth quarter, which is a big cash flow quarter for us. And part of it is a function of how much EBITDA you're acquiring and what you're ultimately paying. Right now, we're at about 3 times leverage. That will continue to decline into 2019. And part of it is a function of maintaining our investment grade rating. But as we've done in the past, we can lever up a little bit more with the clear confidence that we're going to be able to pay this down and get back into our target range. So, we are going to be building more – certainly more firepower as we move into the third – fourth quarter this year and into 2019.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I think, to Mark's point on leverage with the rating agencies, I think we've – the team's done a great job in building a lot of credibility with the agencies. So, we've got more leverage there probably than we would have had in the past just because we've demonstrated that we've acquired high-quality businesses with great cash flow profile and paid things down faster than what we've committed to the agencies.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse: Got you. Understood. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up here, can you maybe just size the specific U.S. municipal business for us, and then if you're seeing any impact from at least discussions in the market around the Water Infrastructure bill? I mean, obviously it's a positive, but a lot of that stuff does get funded more at the state and local level, but it seems like it would at least be a tailwind relative to something not being done in Washington.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So our rough exposure there would be about, just roughly, $1.5 billion of revenue. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, we just continue to see broad-based health there. As I mentioned earlier, historically, our biggest exposures had been on the wastewater side. And then, of course, when we acquired Sensus, and now Pure, we've kind of leveled that out now where we're about half exposed to wastewater, about half exposed to what we call the clean drinking water distribution network. And we're seeing – and then, within those pieces on the wastewater side, about 70% of that spending is OpEx versus CapEx. And because we've got such a large installed base there, we tend to benefit in a rising tide in terms of share gain on break and fix and repair and replacement side, which we're certainly seeing right now. And we're seeing that we're still in a healthy space on the CapEx side of the equation as well.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. First off, the 30% order growth, I think that's the best we've seen in MCS since you bought Sensus and it sounds like it's in North American watering, which is encouraging. Can you give us some sense of how broad-based the order strength was and if it's tied to just a few large projects, or just how we should be thinking about the sustainability here?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. It was pretty broad based. And we see that the market in that business continuing to grow in about the mid-single digits in terms of overall spend. So certainly, there were a couple of projects that helped pop that number, but the growth was pretty broad-based both in terms of product line, but also geographically.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And within our advanced infrastructure analytics business as well, while it's a smaller piece of the segment, that was almost 30% orders growth in the quarter as well.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. I guess, a follow-up question, just shifting gears a little bit to the commercial end market, I felt like that was maybe one of the bigger changes here in terms of directional trend positive. Where are you seeing most of that strength coming from? And then, can you guys kind of speak to where you think we are in terms of the cycle for that end market relative to some of your bigger end markets, like utilities and industrial?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Brian. Yeah, we had two regions where we saw really strong growth. One was in the U.S. where we had kind of been talking about this. If you go back a year or so, we had tremendous amount of activity in our pipeline and there were a lot of projects that we were bidding on and they weren't getting released. Well, they're starting to get released. And we saw that, particularly, in the institutional building segment in the U.S. It was really, really strong and we think there's some room to run there. And then, the other driver of that growth was in China with a number of key customers where we had very, very strong growth; but very, very good growth in price, some room to run in the U.S. for sure.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So I would just offer a couple of notes here. One, we've guided up to high-single digit for the full year just based upon where we are cumulative through the third quarter and what we expect for, certainly, the fourth quarter. I think our view on what that growth outlook looks like over the 2020 planning timeframe really remains unchanged. I'd say it likely moderates back down to kind of mid-single-digit level, so I wouldn't get too attached to that high-single digit running forever. Having said that, just to punctuate, in China, one of the team – one of the things our team over there did as a great reaction to the downturn a few years ago was to diversify in terms of across a broader customer set, and that broader key account approach is certainly paying dividends now in that growth rate where Asia Pac was up 40% in the quarter from a revenue standpoint.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Walter.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Walter.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: I wanted to ask about the weather, and there were a couple of big storms in the quarter. I wonder if there was any impact from that. And then, in the fourth quarter, any projects that are building in the pipeline because of any storm-related damage?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We haven't seen – we got a little bit of a benefit in the quarter and a little bit here in Q4. But I think overall, the team's estimating it gets probably around $1.5 million, maybe $2 million on the high end of revenue. I mean, it's high-calorie revenue, but not a big bottom line impact. Part of that is just the nature of these storms and where they occur. And so, where there tends to be natural runoff, the dewatering applications are not as critical as it was, perhaps, maybe in Sandy, where we really were involved in dewatering and de-flooding a lot of underground infrastructure. We are – we will see some benefit in the quarter that we've built into our outlook as there is some repair of utility infrastructure in certain areas, but we don't expect that to be a big number for us in the quarter.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Great. And then, just on the bucket with purchase accounting and strategic investment, I just wanted to ask about the purchase accounting. When do we clear those from the comps – from the income statement? And the strategic investment, it looks like most of that's in M&C. Is that an ongoing offset to the profit improvement? How should we (56:40)?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Walter. So on the purchase accounting, that's – it's really a function of largely Pure. There have been a couple of smaller deals that we've done, but as we anniversary that, really beginning of the first quarter of next year, that goes away. And the investments, it was – we've been investing both in terms of building out capability to support some of these international deals, both some technical as well as commercial, but also taking advantage of first-mover in our AIA platform, both in terms of commercial resources, but support on the ground, too, to deliver these projects.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: So, we expect the investments to continue, certainly, probably through mid-2019. And that's a combination of, again, building the platform and capabilities around the new analytics platform with the acquisition of Pure and the other smaller deals that we've done, but also investing in these large international deals from a business development standpoint. The thing about those deals is they're likely going to have decisions on them sometime in mid to, probably, mid- to late-2019. And so, those are binary outcomes. If you win them, then it more than pays for the investments you made. And if you don't win them, you stop investing in the deal. So, we expect that to really be a bit of a cliff in the middle part of next year.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: On the M&A front, we've seen a very wide range of buyers in the market for water tech deals, everything from private equity to large strategics, to kind of smaller strategics. And I'm curious, as one of the most active consolidators, what are you seeing on valuations and how has the competitive landscape from the buy-side perspective changed in your view, maybe, over the last 12 months?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. There's certainly been some uptick in valuation expectations on the part of the potential sellers. I think that for the most part, we've seen people be fairly disciplined in terms of what they ultimately are purchasing something for. We certainly are going to be disciplined. We tend – other than any of the things that you see on the public side, we tend to cultivate a lot of opportunities that are privately owned, either family owned or they're owned by PE. We tend to focus on those areas where we know that we're going to have a lot of very natural high-competence cost synergies and as well, obviously, revenue synergies that we don't build into our model for valuation. We only count on the cost synergies. And as a result of that, we tend to cultivate these relationships over a very long timeframe and try to take them off the market without them becoming competitive along the way. So we're not always successful in doing that, but I'm very proud of our M&A and corporate development team here in terms of how disciplined and well-connected they are.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one on tariffs. Are all of the tariff-related headwinds in the value chain kind of incorporated into what Q3 was like in terms of margin, or do you think there is more impact that has yet to be felt?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So we think we have it pretty well reflected in our Q3 results and what the outlook is for Q4. To put it in perspective, we had a modest impact in Q3 of about $5 million, both on the direct and the indirect impacts of tariffs. We think that it might increase modestly going forward, but not meaningful. The teams continue to be on top of it. We're, again, focusing on the execution on the productivity side. We talked about price realization. But also, I think one of the things that many investors are now beginning to probably understand that's a bit unique about us is the impact of our product localization strategy, which we started really about four years or so ago. Whenever I certainly joined, there was some work already happening on that front, but we've really ramped that up. That helps mitigate a lot of the pressure here, because it's not just localization in the Emerging Markets. We import very little of our product offerings into the U.S. from, say, China. We have one small business line that we do, and we're dealing with that in our supply chain right now in terms of mitigating that. But then, even within China and the trade market concerns there really doesn't have much, if any, impact on our business because the largest portion of our revenue there, 90%-plus, is localized. And so, again, we tend to talk about localization from a cost management and getting the right things fit for purpose in a market for growth, but what we're really seeing now is the benefits, when you're in this kind of trade environment, that it does help tremendously to be localized.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And we have some good flexibility in our supply chain, too, both through our contract manufacturer as well as some of our own capacity to make some of those changes where that's – where we need to.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from Andrew Buscaglia of Berenberg. Andrew, your line is open.
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: So I just wanted to touch on – so your orders in your Water Infrastructure segment were up double digits and you commented on the decline in – a 1% decline for orders. What is the – can you just dig in to that a little bit more? I know you mentioned there was a delay or something like that into the next quarter, but just give us some more details around that.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I missed the first part of your question. Was the first part of the question you're reconciling the revenue growth versus the order growth?
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: You say your backlog in Water Infrastructure is up double digits...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: ...and orders declined about a percent.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. Like I said before, it was just simply timing of a few large projects that if you would have – if we would have had those in Q3, it would have taken us from being down a point to being up about 5% to 6% in orders. Year-to-date, we are up 6% in order growth there. So, the backlog itself, that's really a function of the lead times on some of these projects and when they convert into hard form orders.
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: Okay. Okay. Then – yeah, I hate to belabor the point on these tariffs and impacts on inflationary costs, but a competitor of yours in the Water Infrastructure segment is seeing supply chain disruptions really influenced by tariffs. Indirectly – it doesn't seem like you guys have changed your view much at all from last quarter regarding this, but indirectly, though, why wouldn't you guys see an impact, but some of your peers are?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Well, I think, again – I think, predominantly is the fact that we're localized. We're much more localized than many of our competitive peers are in terms of the percent of our revenue that is coming from cross-border movement. And I think, secondly, it is the benefits of scale and depending upon which channel you're talking about and which product lines that we're referring to. So, look, we don't take it lightly. We're just sticking with the facts here in terms of what we see. And I think it's also – again, not knowing, particularly, which competitor you may be referring to, we've also seen the benefits here of having created this global procurement team that we didn't have in place up until about three and a half, four years ago. And a lot of work they're doing is managing these impacts by leveraging our scale, but also working very close with our commercial teams on what are the supply chain management moves that we can make to better optimize our manufacturing network. We've got adequate capacity there and they're moving these things on a regular basis to get ahead of it. They're also the ones that are working heavily with our legal teams on trying to get exceptions, depending upon the categories that are being laid out. So, it's a multi-prong effort.
Andrew E. Buscaglia - Berenberg Capital Markets: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to Patrick for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Well, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate you all hanging on to the call with us. Appreciate your continued support and interest. Safe travels, happy holidays and we'll be back in touch with you in our next earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. We delivered another quarter of strong results at both the top and bottom line. Our teams' strong execution again led to share gains in key end markets. They were also very disciplined in their approach to pricing actions, leveraging our strong positions in the marketplace, and I'm quite pleased with the traction we've already achieved. Importantly, these factors contributed to an excellent operational performance, one in which we expanded margins and delivered strong double-digit earnings growth. The momentum we've built broadly across our businesses is continuing and supports our updated expectations for the full year. Let me now read you a few of the details. In the second quarter, we again delivered solid broad-based orders and revenue growth across all of our major markets. Orders increased 8% in the second quarter, making this the third consecutive quarter of high single- to double-digit orders growth. Our Water Infrastructure business, again, was a standout in this regard with treatment orders up 25% in the quarter and transport up mid-single-digits. Our treatment project bidding pipeline was also up double-digits in the quarter. Revenue in the quarter grew 8% organically with strength across nearly every end market and region. As I mentioned earlier, we made good progress in our price realization efforts in the quarter. The combination of our strong brands and positions in the marketplace as well as the health of our end markets helped us gain and sustain significant pricing traction. These efforts are continuing and are an important part of our effort to offset the impact of rising input cost. In addition, we continue to deliver on our continuous improvement initiatives. This helped us drive a 70-basis point year-over-year increase in both our adjusted EBITDA margin and our operating margin in the second quarter and we delivered a 24% increase in our adjusted earnings per share. So, across the board, a very strong quarter, in fact a very strong first half of the year. Before I turn over to Mark, I want to provide a few comments on our strategic work. Our consistent performance building quarter-after-quarter really reflects the focus our teams have on executing our strategic priories, which provides a roadmap to evolving our company to a faster growing, highly innovative and more profitable enterprise. These initiatives are advancing our progress towards our long-term financial targets and helping us foster a culture that is united in our purpose. Let me quickly review our progress. First is accelerating profitable growth. We address this first by driving commercial excellence. We've made significant strides over the past three years to improve how we do business with our customers, making it easier for them to work with us. While obvious on its face, it's much more complicated to change the way previously independent business teams and brands work together to harness the full scale and power of Xylem solutions to solve our customers' challenges. But success breeds success. And today, our teams have better tools and are collaborating in new ways to maintain focus where it should be, which is on the customer. Furthermore, this shift in how we execute in the marketplace is advancing our progress on revenue synergies. These synergies are of varied size and scale. Some take considerable time to bring to fruition, while others are already occurring in the due course of business. Year-to-date, we won about $30 million in synergy deals which largely will be recognized in 2019 and beyond. By way of example, one is a communications network deal leveraging our FlexNet platform along with smart meters for a consortium of water utilities operating in the Midwestern U.S. Another deal is one of the larger leak detection projects for a utility in Southeast Asia in which our Visenti technologies will be deployed across more than 6,000 kilometers of pipe. These deals are great demonstrations of how Xylem's financial strength and longstanding customer relationships can be leveraged to drive additional opportunities. In addition, we are in late stage pursuit of finalizing a couple of medium-sized deals with larger deals in our sights. Some are expected to be announced by the end of the year or early 2019. The bigger picture is that this type of collaboration is happening across our global business teams and it's yielding results. We have a growing number of pilot projects in the field and we've already expanded this collaborative effort to our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform. The second component of our accelerating profitable growth priority is capitalizing on growth in the emerging markets. In the second quarter, our organic growth increased 13%, bringing our first half total organic growth to 10%. Our targeted approach investing first in China, India and the Middle East has helped us establish a strong foothold in each market. Year-to-date, our business in China is up nearly 30%. Revenues in India are up in the high-teens and the Middle East is up mid-single-digits. And our product localization strategy is paying multiple dividends. It's enabling a closer relationship with our customers as we are better able to meet their unique needs, and it's helped to reduce the impact of a dynamic global trade environment. The third component of accelerating profitable growth is to strengthen innovation and technology at the company. We've significantly increased not just our investment in this area, but we also changed our approach in order to capitalize on the enormous expertise we have across the company, providing focus in order to speed results. We closed out the second quarter with another increase in our Vitality Index both sequentially and year-over-year. And we have not hesitated to use M&A as a proxy for R&D. Our acquisitions have provided immediate access to different vectors of technology and science, but the real impact is happening as our teams and technologies come together to create new solutions that will fundamentally transform how water and wastewater is managed in the future. Many of these efforts are made possible by our focus on driving a continuous improvement culture. We have exceeded our savings targets each year since we announced them back in late 2015, and we are on track to continue that trend in 2018. One part of this work is our business simplification initiatives. For example, our global business services program is taking dozens and dozens of varied processes in our back office functions and placing them on common platforms and centralizing this work. This will drive cost efficiency and significantly raise our level of execution, improving cycle time and the quality of this work. We're still largely in the implementation phase, but we have clear line of sight to significant savings and resulting margin expansion next year and beyond. Finally, we must have the right teams in place to deliver on our ambitious goals. That requires the right leadership and development at all levels of the company, and it requires that across the organization, all of our roughly 17,000 colleagues understand not just what we're doing but why we're doing it. Harnessing the collective passion of a global organization around the united purpose is something we focus on every day. There's one other area of strategic importance that I want to mention and that is our ongoing investments in longer-term growth opportunities. I'm specifically referring to our increased investments in our newly acquired businesses as well as in the communications platform that will support solutions from all areas of the company. During the first few months of owning these businesses, we've learned a lot, particularly from the very strong receptivity they've gained from our customers. They're looking for us to move faster and think bigger in terms of scaling these businesses and bringing them new solutions. This is particularly true around the build-out of more software-enabled solutions as well as network-as-a-service. Their feedback has reinforced our view that we have a first mover advantage in this area and we intend to capitalize on that. The strength of our operational performance along with our continuous improvement savings are affording us the opportunity to make these investments while remaining fully committed to our near- and long-term margin expansion targets. It's very clear to us that we have significant opportunities that we need to pursue now to accelerate the growth profile of Xylem to deliver what will clearly be margin-accretive initiatives over the medium- to longer-term. Now, let me quickly address our updated outlook for the year. On the top line, our revenue growth in the first half, combined with orders and backlog strength, gives us confidence to raise our revenue outlook from 4% to 6% growth to 6% to 7% growth. We are also increasing our EPS guidance operationally by $0.04. This improvement is offset by a couple of non-operational items which results in maintaining our EPS midpoint. We will take you through these details later in the presentation. So, now, please turn to slide 5, and Mark will review the quarter results in more detail.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I'm very pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter. Overall, revenues were up 13% year-over-year. This represents 8% organic growth, 3 points of growth from foreign exchange tailwind, and 2 points of growth from acquisitions. From an organic perspective, the strength in revenue was broad-based across most of our end markets and in all key geographies. The utilities end market led the way with 11% growth. This was slightly above our expectations and was driven both by the timing of project deliveries in the Water Infrastructure and Measurement & Control Solutions segments, as well as continued strong performance in our pumps and aftermarket business broadly. We saw the strongest growth in the U.S. utilities market, which was up 12%. We had another good quarter in the industrial end market with growth of 6% year-over-year. This was also slightly above our expectations. Market conditions remained solid in our Applied Water business as well as dewatering. And we benefited from some large industrial treatment project deliveries in the emerging markets where we saw strength across nearly all geographies. We also continued to see solid performance in our commercial end market, up 6% with strong growth in the U.S. and China. Finally, in residential, we were down 2% primarily reflecting a tough comparison to the prior year results when revenues grew 15%. Moving to operational performance. Our teams delivered an increase to our adjusted EBITDA of 70 basis points to 19.3% in the quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased productivity savings, volume leverage from strong organic growth, and price realization, which was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix and investments. Price realization improved 60 basis points in the quarter, and we're very encouraged by the rapid acceleration that we saw on price realization during May and June. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 13.8%, which includes 20 basis points of non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions in our advanced infrastructure analytics platform. Our teams continue to execute on our productivity programs, and we delivered $41 million in cost savings during the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year. This 310-basis point improvement offset inflation and enabled us to continue to fund strategic investments to support revenue synergies in other growth programs. Strong revenue performance and operational execution drove earnings per share of $0.73, an increase of 24% year-over-year, which was slightly higher than our expectations. Please turn to slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Let's turn to our Water Infrastructure segment, which had a strong performance across all key metrics. Orders of $580 million in the quarter were up 9% organically year-over-year and reflect strength in all applications within the segment. Treatment orders were up 25%, the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% orders growth, reflecting the continued upward trajectory of our pipeline which has expanded double-digits versus the prior year. The results also speak to the continued overall health and strong demand in the utility market. It is important to note that the majority of the treatment orders are for projects that require longer lead times and will not ship until 2019 and beyond. We exited the quarter with total backlog for this segment of $672 million, up 16% organically year-over-year. Water Infrastructure revenues of $546 million grew 11% year-over-year on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $13 million tailwind. In the U.S., the segment grew 11% driven largely by double-digit growth in the utility end market, reflecting solid underlying demand and share gains. We're continuing to see strong market performance across all of our businesses. Treatment benefited from the timing of several project deliveries and transport continued to benefit from strong aftermarket sales and achieved share gains. Dewatering also generated mid-single-digit growth from increased municipal bypass work. Outside the U.S., performance in this segment was also very strong. Emerging markets were up 18% including double-digit growth in China, the Middle East, and Latin America. The majority of the outsized growth we saw in emerging markets came from our treatment business, which was up more than 50%, driven both by the timing of project deliveries and strong underlying demand. In general, we continue to see growing bid activity and demand as government mandates on water quality continue to drive spending across the emerging markets. In addition to the robust treatment growth in emerging markets, we also saw high single-digit growth in our wastewater transport business, which continues to benefit from our product localization strategy. Finally, we also saw a second consecutive quarter of improving market conditions in Western Europe where our business grew 6% overall, primarily driven by growth in transport in the Nordic region and the UK. It is also worth noting that our industrial end market in Water Infrastructure was up mid-single-digits during the quarter. The growth was largely driven by our dewatering business, which continues to see strong activity in construction and oil and gas markets. Additionally, we benefited from the delivery of several large industrial treatment projects in Latin America and Europe. Operating margin for this segment increased 140 basis points to 17.8% driven by cost savings from our productivity programs, higher volumes, and greater price realization, which accelerated through the quarter. This more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of treatment projects this year versus last year. Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment also had a very good quarter. Orders of $400 million were up 6% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. We exited the quarter with backlog of $221 million, which is up 17% organically compared to last year. While this is still predominantly a short cycle business, the growth of our backlog continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver our mid-single-digit organic growth outlook for the year. Revenue for Applied Water was $388 million, up 6% organically versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange was an $8 million tailwind. In the emerging markets, revenue grew 14%, reflecting strong growth in China, which was up nearly 30%, driven by increased industrial project business and solid demand in the commercial building market. Revenues in the U.S. grew 5% driven by strength in the segment's commercial and industrial verticals which were up 9% and 7% respectively. In commercial, we continued to see strength in the institutional building sector and demand for our new products. Industrial growth was driven by the continued recovery of heavy industrial project demand as well as growth in our specialty flow business which serves the food and beverage and marine markets. Residential was down slightly as we lapped mid-teens growth in the prior year. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 150 basis points to 16.2% year-over-year. The strong year-over-year margin expansion was driven by cost savings from productivity programs, higher volumes and accelerating price realization, which more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of lower margin, large industrial projects compared with last year. Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of Measurement & Control Solutions. Our Measurement & Control Solutions segment saw growing momentum in its markets as well. Orders of $397 million in the quarter were up 11% organically, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. Segment revenues were $383 million, up 8% on an organic basis year-over-year. Foreign exchange was an $8 million tailwind and acquisitions added $29 million. U.S. revenues grew 10% primarily due to the deployment of the Nicor Gas deal we announced earlier this year, and we saw a return to growth in the water vertical in the U.S. We continued to see strength in the North American water pipeline and orders, which were up 40% over last year, and we continue to expect to deliver high single-digit revenue growth for the full year. The segment's European and emerging markets businesses each grew low single-digits in the quarter. We're also very encouraged with the significant momentum we see in the market with our new Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform, which is reflected in accelerating orders and pipeline growth, both of which were up over 20% in the quarter. In the short time that we've owned this portfolio of solutions, we're seeing increased opportunities and excitement from our customers to leverage these capabilities to solve their most critical problems. A great example of this is the recent win in Southeast Asia, which Patrick mentioned earlier. This win is noteworthy not only because of its size but also in the shorter sales cycle enabled by leveraging existing Xylem relationships. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points – decreased 140 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter declined 150 basis points to 9.1% year-over-year. Our margin performance in the quarter was expected and largely reflects planned investments we're making to build and to scale up the technologies and commercial capabilities of our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform to capitalize on our first mover advantage. We also continue to invest in networking and software tools as well as commercial resources to support the pilots underway to enable us to win at least our fair share of the large international deals in our pipeline. Q2 is also impacted by unfavorable mix in the Sensus business primarily due to the deployment of two recent large project wins in the electric and gas verticals which have lower overall margins than our water business. Now let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $320 million. I was very pleased with the team's strong performance in the quarter on cash flow as we delivered 800 basis points of year-over-year improvement and free cash flow conversion which positions us well to deliver our full year target of more than 115%. Year-over-year increase in second quarter cash flow reflects a 39% increase in operating cash flows. Investment in CapEx in the quarter is up modestly year-over-year driven largely by investments in product software. We continued to expect capital spend in the range of $190 million to $200 million for the year. We also returned $63 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We opportunistically repurchased another $25 million of shares in the second quarter to manage dilution. We continued to make solid progress on working capital with a 250-basis point reduction year-over-year as we continue to improve our processes and discipline. I'm very pleased with the focus and traction that the team continues to make on this metric. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and began to repay the short-term debt we used to fund the Pure acquisition. We expect to completely pay down the Pure debt by the end of this year. Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover our updated outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Let me begin with a look at our end markets. Overall, our end market view for the full year has changed slightly from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. We had a strong first half in certain end markets. And while we do expect some of that growth to moderate as we get into the second half of the year, we are updating our outlook to reflect the momentum we're seeing particularly in the utility and industrial end markets. So let me quickly run through our projections. Our utility end market continues to show strength, particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For full year 2018, we now expect revenue to grow in the high single-digit range overall. Our businesses performed well in the industrial end market year-to-date. Looking out for the full year, we see continued solid growth in the U.S. and Europe with the heavy industrials in North America continuing to strengthen. In the emerging markets, we continue to see stronger conditions in China and India and somewhat softer conditions in parts of Latin America. We project industrials to be up mid-single-digits. We expect 2018 organic growth in the commercial end market to be in the low to mid-single digit range. We see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation from recent strength in Europe. Our emerging markets should continue to benefit from increased government spending. Finally, in residential, where we have softer results in the first half of the year, we now anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We continue to see competitive dynamics in the U.S. market where demand tends to be replacement driven and we have tough prior year compares. We also anticipate solid demand to continue in China and other Asia Pacific countries as well as Western Europe. Now please turn to slide 11, and I'll address our updated outlook. As we discussed this morning, we are well-positioned to deliver on our full year commitments while continuing to invest in our longer-term growth initiatives. Given the strong revenue growth to-date, we are raising our full year revenue expectations to an organic growth rate of 6% to 7%. We remain on pace to deliver about $160 million in cost savings for the full year which will help fuel our operating margin expansion. We now expect to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 to 90 basis points to between 13.9% and 14.2%. This expansion excludes about 20 basis points of margin dilution from purchase accounting for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve by 110 to 130 basis points, which will bring the full year range between 19.8% to 20%. At the bottom line, we've narrowed the range of expected adjusted full year earnings per share to $2.85 to $2.95. This excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment cost of about $45 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 19% to 23% for the year. Please turn to slide 12, and I'll expand on this guidance. As you can see on the slide, we've laid out the puts and takes on our full year earnings guidance in detail. We started the year with a $0.15 EPS range and $2.90 per share at the midpoint. As I've already addressed, we outperformed in the first half of the year, delivering growth, price realization and a strong operational performance that exceeded our expectations. We expect this momentum to continue resulting in a $0.04 operational increase for the full year. However, we expect this improvement to be offset by an equivalent amount by the stronger dollar and the divestiture of a non-core business. So we've narrowed the range and raised the low end of our guidance, while maintaining the midpoint. So please turn to slide 13, and Mark will review our planning assumptions and seasonal outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I'll provide some additional highlights on our other planning assumptions for the third quarter and full year outlook. Given the popularity and interest in the topic of tariffs, I'll start there. There are a number of tariffs that have been proposed and a few of which have been implemented. Some of these have had little or no impact on Xylem. With regard to China, we benefit from our product localization strategy. The vast majority of the product we produce in China is sold in China or into the broader Asia region. That said, we do have a global supply chain, so we're not completely immune. But the impact is expected to be fairly modest. We are proactively managing both the direct in the indirect impacts. Our teams are on it. They thoroughly understand the potential impact and have developed and continued to execute mitigation strategies including price recovery actions. With the measures we already have underway, we do not expect the impact in the second half of this year to be material to our results and have contemplated this impact in our updated outlook. Now, moving to our other planning assumptions and seasonal profile of our business. As you can see on this slide, we've increased our expectations for growth in the full year and have updated assumptions on currency as well as restructuring, realignment and integration costs. For the third quarter, we expect growth in the utility market to continue at high single-digit growth with the industrial market steady at the mid-single-digit level. We expect commercial to continue to grow in the low to mid-single-digits with residential flattish in the quarter. We anticipate this will result in overall organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%. Consistent with the dynamics we've seen in the first half, we anticipate that project mix will continue to be a margin headwind in the third quarter. Now, I'll turn it back over to Patrick.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So we had a very good first half the year. Our strong execution led to higher-than-expected revenue growth coupled with solid price realization. With focus on our productivity for growth initiatives, we're driving margin expansion while continuing to invest in strategically important initiatives that will accelerate our growth and margin expansion profile in the future. I'm very proud of our teams, and we will continue to maintain our focus, which is continuing to create greater value for our shareholders. So with that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: And your first question is coming from Mike Halloran of Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So with really healthy demand momentum internally, and starting to see some normalization on the price cost side here, the only area that sticks out is the MCS margin side. And a couple of things in that. One, it sounds like the core margins, if you strip out all the onetime things, are tracking how you guys would hope, so a little commentary on that would be appreciated. And then also provide some context to how you expect those investments to layer through, give some context to how much we're talking, and then when you can start seeing the benefits of those hit the bottom line.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Mike, let me – this is Mark. Let me take that one. I think you've captured the essence. There are a couple of things taking place particularly in this quarter that are impacting the margin profile. The first is around investments, and that really comes in a couple of flavors, the first being the inclusion of our Applied – our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform this year as well as investments we're making in that. And that is dilutive to margins in the current quarter, a little over 100 basis points. Now, as we scale that business up and it grows, as we get towards the end of this year, that impact is relatively modest in terms of the dilution to margins. And in fact, as we continue to grow that business and the momentum we see there, we expect that to be a contributor to margin expansion in 2019 and beyond. The other piece of it is investments that we're making in both technology capability, commercial resources to win a number of very large attractive international deals as well as continuing to build out our product and software platforms around our – both water as well as electric and gas. And that impact for the quarter spends roughly $5 million, and we'd expect that run rate to continue certainly through the end of this year, but it's also – we do expect to win some of these deals. And as we win those deals and we see the revenues come in later in 2019 and beyond that they're going to have an attractive drop and certainly be accretive to margins. I think the other point to take away is just through the first half of the year, EBITDA grew 22% year-over-year in the segment and we did see margin expansion of 70 basis points in EBITDA. And we expect that trend to continue for the full year. We expect strong growth in the segment EBITDA, 20%, and continued margin expansion for the full year as well. So this is more of a – you have the confluence of now we have our new businesses in our platform. We haven't scaled revenues there, and we also have some mix that hit us in in the quarter that we do expect to see a little bit more of that in the third quarter, but that will be less of an issue in the fourth quarter and beyond as our water business grows faster.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, so Mike, this is Patrick. I'll just touch a couple of points (00:36:38). I don't want to belabor it here, but I realize it is the probably one primary spot that people are focused on that may have been a little bit of surprise for some. It was not a surprise to us. So the receptivity that we're getting from our customers and clients on these new offerings is fantastic. And what we're really doing here between now and really through the back half of this year, which we've reflected in our guidance and outlook and it still gets us to MCS EBITDA margin growth of near 20%, is to really be funding some of the scale that we need to do here around the new analytics platform and pursuing some of these large international deals. As we turn this order growth into revenue, it's going to come to really high accretive margin. And so, as we get through this year, you won't see that impact next year because the margin fall-through on the revenue we're getting is going to more than offset that, as well as we hopefully win some of these larger international deals, these are onetime development cost to win the deal, so they don't recur other than the fact that if we're pursuing other international deals down the road. So we also felt like, look, the business overall in Xylem is performing well in terms of our productivity for growth. And we felt comfortable that we could deliver on our margin commitments and our growth commitments while funding this new platform. And so that's what we're doing. We're taking advantage of first mover advantage here. And we expect to continue.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. Essentially what you're saying is the upfront investments are this year, but there's a pretty quick payback and quick turnaround to getting that momentum back in the margin progression and mitigating the impact as you scale these assets.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good summary.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So the second question then is on forward visibility as you think about your order patterns. Over the last couple of quarters, you've been talking about the backlog starting to expand, pipeline of business getting better. It certainly seems like the forward visibility is stretching out. Could you just talk about that backlog curve as you look over the next one to two years? How that's starting to fill out and how you would compare that towards maybe a normal build on a forward basis with the orders you're bringing in in the pipeline?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. I'd start with that first, Mike. I think, obviously, we continue to see high single-digit, double-digit orders growth overall here. Our bidding pipeline for treatment as we indicated was up double-digit in the teens again. Look, I certainly would not want any of you to expect that we're going to continue to see double-digit growth in the bidding pipeline and funnel or the order rate. But I do think for the foreseeable future here, certainly over the next several months and even the next probably year or two here, we expect to still continue to see that order backlog continue to grow. We are – when we look at the markets right now, a follow-on to that question, Mike, would be, how much of this growth is market versus share. And I would say that certainly with respect to the – we take a look at the commercial market, the industrial market, those are continuing to grow at pretty healthy clips right now. We're talking about mid-single-digit in both of those for the full year and the second half. I would see that continuing. I mean, obviously, the compares are going to get a little more difficult as we get into Q4 and next year, but it's still going to be a healthy trend line there. Public utility, I think, which is really where you're focusing, we see that continuing to be in the high single-digit certainly this year. I think we'll probably come out and talk about mid- to high single-digits next year as well, but that's premature. But we're gaining share there, and we feel very good about the progress we've made both on the transport and the treatment side in terms of new product development impact and the fact that since we do have in transport the market-leading position in terms of installed base, by definition, we're going to get more than our fair share of growth when you see a very healthy level of break and fix activity taking place in that market as well.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Very helpful. Appreciate the color as always.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I'd like to start on the pricing this quarter which was a nice improvement sequentially from the first quarter and maybe just talk about where you have pricing power, how did you exercise it, and what's the client receptivity to it and is that – are there more pricing actions that you have to go in the second half if needed?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Deane, it's Mark. Yeah, we talked a little bit about this on our last call, and we've been talking about it with our business leaders for some time and recognizing that we – as Patrick just said, we do have strong market positions in a number of geographies and product sets, and we felt certainly in a very strong demand environment. And with those strong positions, we should be more aggressive. We have been. Listen, customers never like price increases. They understand it, and it gets to – it also gets the value proposition and in service levels. And so we've seen good traction largely in the U.S. across almost all of our businesses. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we really saw that trending positively throughout the quarter. So, in the first quarter, we had 20 basis points of price realization. April was 30, and then we went 60 in May and 70 in June. So it really provides us with some good momentum headed into the second half of the year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And, Deane, this is Patrick. So it was pretty broad-based across all of our businesses. Again, it was largely focused within the U.S. But we're – quite frankly, while customers don't like it, they're obviously attuned to what's going on with the tariff discussion and rising input costs. And so this is not the first time they've gone through this cycle and the criticality of what we sell to them makes it easier. A couple of other comments, one, so we saw like 70 bps in Water Infrastructure, 80 bps in Applied Water as an example, and so very healthy increases. I would say it was also very healthy whether it'd be our direct channel or our indirect channel through our distribution partners. They've been leaning in as well and been very helpful in driving that aggressive activity. And then lastly, I would say part of the reason I think we saw the pickup in May and June and obviously we're staying close to it here in Q3 is there were a few of our competitors that were a little bit later in following on the pricing actions. And so that – now that they've done, that simply further strengthens the action that we've already taken.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's all good to hear. Just as a follow-up, one of the other numbers that really jumps out at us is the China up 30% year-to-date. We just had a field trip in China and Singapore, and we hit three China cities. And this whole theme of the China government ratcheting up enforcement of water pollution laws is really having a big impact. Just maybe you can expand on that because the plants we saw were – even the ones that you guys didn't host had Wedeco UV, Wedeco Ozone, and you just saw an interest in these western technologies.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, well, I think we feel we're very bullish on China. As you know, I have been for some time, Deane. And as you do, we have to take the long view on these markets like China and India and others. So I think it's a convergence of the government prioritization, not just on the connected treatment and obviously dealing with the water quality issues and mandate. But it's also, as you well know, it's a big mandate on reducing non-revenue water, which obviously plays into our new analytics platform. You take all that coupled with our localization efforts which is a really big deal, that helps mitigate this whole tariff discussion for us. But it also really speeds our delivery to market and we now have products that are really fit for purpose in that market as opposed to many companies relying upon importing kind of western technologies, so very pleased, very proud. We realize it's not going to last forever. We're not going to grow 30% a clip forever. But I think we're very much in a healthy trajectory there right now. I know one of the questions we've had from investors is, does the whole trade tension between China and the U.S. create a overhang to the economy there, et cetera. And we just don't see that affecting the businesses that we're strongest in which really is on the utility side which is a good two-thirds, almost 80% of our revenue now in China is in that space.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, you kind of stole my follow-up on the not seeing any fallout. But just maybe, does that differ at all between the public utilities versus the industrial customers in terms of their – how that mandate is affecting them?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: It's hard to say right now. We haven't seen it. We've seen good growth in the industrial and the commercial billing side. Having said that, we all went through – the whole industry went through a rough patch there, not more than two years ago when you had the whole downturn in that part of the segment. So we're coming off of a bottom. So we're still seeing growth there. So, if there was a part that could be – that would not be immune to that overhang, that would certainly be it. But that's a relatively small piece of our overall business.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's real helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nate.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nate.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I think the $30 million in revenue synergies or orders taken related to revenue synergies is probably the first time that you've actually put any numbers around this for us. Can you maybe give us a little more color on what these types of products are now that they're out of pilots? You talked about some medium-sized and larger orders maybe later in the year into 2019, size of the opportunity there for us?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, so we are pleased. And we felt it was the first time we felt comfortable putting in the number around it, because we wanted to have something of some size and scale. This is consistent with the timing that we talked about, maybe a little bit earlier than we had originally anticipated. We were generally thinking it was going to be more back half of this year, and then the larger deals coming through more in 2019. That's still our thinking as to the timing of those larger deals. The types of things we're talking about here, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of them is obviously leveraging our very strong relationships with one of the large utilities there in Southeast Asia that Xylem had a longstanding relationship with that Visenti had kind of struggled to get in there. But obviously, with the great work they've done with the Singapore PV, that's a great reference for them and ourselves. So that's upwards to close to a $10 million deal that's related to that. Again, that's going to be the rise of right now the largest leak detection monitoring deployment, I believe, around the world. And so we're very proud of that. But it's still early stages. Secondly, the one in the U.S., which I think is really exciting as well, is building out a new network-as-a-service capability to where we're actually able to leverage our FlexNet platform to not only serve one utility but the entire consortium of utilities to where we effectively own the network. And we simply lease that off to them at a fixed price and really good value in margins in those kinds of projects, and we're certainly looking to see how we might be able to roll that in to some of the larger international deals as well to boost the margins and our chances of winning. The larger deployments are, as we've talked before, these are – it's really predominantly going after non-revenue water challenges of the utilities. And we think we're one of the only companies that are out there that has an end-to-end solution right now to really be able to draw the data all the way from the water coming out of the treatment plant to its consumption and being built and work with utilities to be able to reconcile that and pinpoint where their biggest needs are as opposed to them not guessing, but certainly making their best estimates on where they should be spending their money. So a lot of work we have to do. We're in the early stages on this, but we are excited by the prospects here.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And the pipeline is growing.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And yeah, the pipeline is growing.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I think you had a 2020 target for revenue synergies of $100 million. Are you on track to hit that, see upside to it, anything like that?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I wouldn't adjust my look on that right now. I mean, we'll do that certainly in a future kind of outlook and update. But I'd say our confidence certainly is stronger than ever that we would hit and exceed that number.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then I think on the gas and electric meters obviously negative mix there, lower margin there. I think you guys have some initiatives to improve the margins in that side of the business. Can you talk about any time frames for getting the margins there up and things that you're doing to improve the margins on that side of the business?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Nate, it's Mark. Yeah, part of our investment in R&D is not just these pilots for international deals, not just our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics, but we're also continuing to spend money and develop new products to get at exactly that point, not only provide richer features to our customers on the gas and electric side, but also significantly look to take cost out of those products. So we can drive margin expansion as well.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And hey, Nate, just back on just to clarify, Matt shot me a note here, so just to remind us all. The number that we had laid out before I think after the – around revenue synergies is actually by 2020, we would be doing somewhere between $150 million to $175 million, I think is what we laid out. And my comment remains the same. We are just increasing our confidence and the ability to deliver on that number.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, it points on the board with more to do but certainly the pipeline is growing fast and there's a lot of opportunity.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, that's much better than the $100 million I had in my mind. Thank you very much for the help. I'll pass it on.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No worries.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, Patrick, kind of following up on that. Have you guys like figured out how to sell these kind of solutions, like what's the best way economically to frame this out? Because it is – you said it's a unique end-to-end solution that kind of doesn't exist in the market today. So what does this look like? Is it some sort of recurring fee? Is it a upfront sale? Like have you guys kind of gotten a little bit closer to figuring out what makes the most sense there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes, so we're in the midst of really testing that. That's part of the work that our teams are doing around some of these pilots as well. The network-as-a-service idea that I – the opportunity that we kind of posted here is just one of the many approaches that we're taking. Some of these are basic subscription models. We're also looking at ways in order to perhaps share in some of the higher level value creation that we're doing with the utilities here. I don't want to really go too much more into that from a competitive standpoint. Plus, we're still testing some opportunities here. Either way around, the revenue is very attractive from a margin standpoint. And I'm just really excited by the level of receptivity that we're getting from the customers quite frankly which is part of what's fueling the need to make some investments here is to make sure we can support that at scale.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, given like what's going on with price and costs and tariffs, generally, your businesses have a pretty substantial ramp into the back half of the year on a margin standpoint. Is that still kind of fair to think about?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, so what really gives us confidence in the second half outlook, Joe, is as you said, I mean, despite the headwinds coming in from multiple fronts, we tightened our outlook and operationally raised the midpoint to offset some of the currency and divesture impact. And it really is coming from the incremental margins on the top line and the growth momentum that we've got. It is the traction on price and that we'll be getting the full on impact of that in the second half of the year. And then third is just our ongoing productivity efforts that always – they always ramp a bit in the second half of the year especially in the procurement side.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then last for me, and maybe I can push you a little bit here. On the utility side, everything looks great. I mean that was very impressive performance again. How do you feel on industrial? You mentioned market probably growing around mid-single-digit. This is the second quarter running around 6%. Look, that's not a terrible number, but we've seen faster growth in general industrial at other companies. How do you feel like you're doing there? Do you think the share take is the same as what you're seeing in kind of the utility business where you clearly are taking share?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I would say, third question, maybe just to remind everyone again of what our industrial business really is today. But before I go there, I would say, no, I wouldn't suggest that we're gaining share across the board in industrial. I think we're certainly growing with the market. I mean, there may be some pockets here or there where we picked up a little bit and maybe given up a little bit, but on average, I wouldn't describe the industrial performance as a share gain play. Having said, your comment about relative to other industrials, you probably see – bear in mind again that the lion's share of our industrial business is what we call light industrial. And so this is a product that is not tied to production output, typically grows at a kind of GDP plus a point or so kind of growth depending upon where we are in the replacement cycle, but these are pumps basically. People just run to failure and then they replace them. And so as long as the sites are up and running, they're using our pumps. So, just like when you didn't see that part of our business go down when the rest of the industrial sector was down a couple of years ago, I wouldn't expect us to be growing at a recovery level kind of rate in this market as well. So that 6% growth that we've seen, I'm very pleased with that. That really is a bit of uptick that we saw in that small portion of our business that's heavy, which is mining and oil and gas. But that's again only 4% of our total revenue as a company. So kind of hard for us to move the needle in a big way in industrial. So we're in this kind of mid-single-digit space. That's a good space to be. Now, we do know some of that is from new product rollouts as well, and those products are coming in at very attractive margins and very attractive growth rates relative to the businesses or products they're replacing.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I would lastly say – I'd lastly say, Joe, that the localization that we've done in emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East, has also given us the opportunity to win some larger opportunities in industrial, some projects that we would not have been able to win because the lead times are too long or the cost position was not in the right spot.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, good morning. How's it going?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Chip.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: (00:57:00)
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: So it certainly sounds like there's an increased emphasis on innovation just given all the opportunities you're seeing and a pretty nice first mover advantage, how are you thinking about organic investments as you look to evolve the company over time? You talked about inching R&D closer to 5%, I think. So how should we be thinking about pace of investment versus potential inorganic opportunities? Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I would say overall in terms of the rate of spending that we've talked about in terms of increasing, between now and 2020, increasing by 100 basis points or more in R&D where R&D is a proxy for other investments, it may not all go to the R&D line. It would remain unchanged. I mean, we still feel the same way about that. We're not looking to take that up any more than what we were looking at before. That'll be a healthy level of spend. Especially, given the fact that you may recall, Chip, that we talked about we're also getting much more – much larger bang for the buck out of the R&D dollars in our base spend, because we're doing a lot more of that in emerging markets. Closer to market, it's bigger bang for the buck given the – where we're spending it in India, China, the Middle East, et cetera. Two, we've also done a good job at leaning out our new product development pipeline and getting rid of a lot of the smaller, longer-term kind of things that people might have been working on to really focus in on the things that matter most. So we just got more R&D productivity overall than we had before. In terms of your comment around organic versus inorganic, the way I would lay it out for you all would be as you think about the utilities vertical, think about that as being predominantly an organic play now. There will be some bolt-ons and tuck-ins that we do, but we don't have line of sight right now to any other big move that we'd be looking to make. It would be really just rounding out the platform that we've got here. I think as we've talked before, the other areas of inorganic would largely be banned (00:59:06) in various aspects of industrial water management. That's a broad market, very fragmented. There's a lot of opportunities that are out there, takes two to tango. And we're going to be very disciplined as we have been. Not kind of flashing lights on anything right now. Just letting you know that that would be the part of the business that would be probably more of a inorganic play over time than organic.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. That is helpful. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: I wanted to circle back on pricing and specifically in Water Infrastructure. And maybe if you could help us understand a little bit more about what you did during the quarter. And I'm thinking about some of the project work and if you were able to circle – if you were able to get back to the customers and raise prices on projects that are already kind of in your project funnel or in your pipeline versus book and ship business in Water Infrastructure?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Walter, it's Mark. It's largely the book and ship business. It's pumps, it's replacement components, it's aftermarket service mixers. Project work is unique, and you got to go out and bid it. So it's mostly those book and ship components. And that doesn't mean we're not looking to improve our margin profile on these larger projects, but they're all unique. They're all different. But that's not where the price is coming from.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And kind of along those lines in the back half of the year, are there any projects that we need to be concerned about where you were unable to raise prices or they were longer lead time that might compress the margin?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thinking about residential, outside of the comp that you've got, any other trends that you can talk about that's lowering that growth rate?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: I think that we talked about it in the prepared remarks. It's largely tough compare to last year, which was mid-teens. There was a lot of disruption in the channel last year, which drove some of that. So we'd expect that it's a competitive business environment, and we expect this to grow in the low single-digits through the rest of this year.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then the last one for me is, your inventories kind of overall, I thought was going to be up a little bit more that maybe you'd be opportunistic and bring some product into the U.S. ahead of any sort of tariff or threats of tariff. And I wonder if you had any reaction like that to kind of position for the back half and any benefits we could get from any lower cost product that came into the U.S.?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Walt, we're trying to be smart and make sure we don't get caught short relative to components and supply. So there's certainly some of that going on (01:02:33) and that would be one of the headwinds. But we're also – we've been working hard on improving our SNLP (01:02:39) and our processes and stock levels that are more time to real-time market needs. So, overall, while there's more work to do, the team has performed fairly well there despite some of those challenges and actually reduced the number of days of inventory on hand year-over-year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think (01:03:00) – this is Patrick. I think the overall comment and theme on working capital in general is we changed the management incentive structure for our top few hundred people about two years ago and embedded a third of that payout is tied to working capital ratio, so working capital percentage of revenue. And I would say it took probably the better part of the first year for it to really kind of take hold. It really has been last year and this year that you've seen significant moves downward in terms of working capital investment. That really has helped fuel the free cash flow conversion that you've seen here. So I think a lot – there's a long way to go. We feel a lot better where we are now than we did a few years ago. And I would say of all of the areas, it's the most challenging inventory, certainly is and it probably still has the biggest area of opportunity in front of it.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. That sounds great. All right. Thank you, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I want to maybe somehow get underneath this mix/price sort of waterfall that you've given us, these bridges. Because it looks like all three segments, price mix is better than it was in the first quarter. And you're talking about negative mix impacting all which would therefore suggest that pricing was a lot better in each of the segments. Yet you're taking down your operating margin guidance for the year. I know you're just pinching it (01:04:42). I know you talked about a couple of the reasons. But what's the other side of the equal sign there? Are you expecting the inflation piece to increase in all three from here? Maybe kind of connect those dots for me.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, so we did see mix impact across the enterprise. Probably the biggest piece of it was in our Measurement & Control Solutions, but we had a little bit in the other two segments. So that's a reality. We do expect that to continue into Q3 given how we see the mix setup in backlogs. But to your other point, we have done very well in terms of driving price that will continue to – we're going to see some acceleration into the second half of the year. But there is a reality and inflation does tick up a little bit as well, and what we're trying to do is get ahead of it to offset it. So it's really – it's nothing more than that. Mix did impact us in the second quarter, will continue to impact us in the second half of the year. And on your point in terms of the guidance, we've not taken it down. We've narrowed it. And in fact, on an operational basis, we're up $0.04 to where we were last quarter.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Fair enough. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is it seems to me as if with mix having run negative for a couple of – a number of quarters now, a lot of that is planned of course, because of new products, projects coming through or what have you. I'm not sensing that that's going to get worse in the second half of the year. So it would seem as if the inflation you're essentially saying will get a little worse, yes?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: That is what I said. We ran about 220 basis points impact through the first half of the year, and there's probably another 30 basis points or 30, 40 basis points higher inflationary impact that we expect to see in the second half of the year. Part of that from tariffs, part of it just from general supply and demand. But we – that's why we got ahead of the price curve.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: But again we're maintaining the midpoint of our (01:07:13).
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Absolutely.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, okay, fair enough. I guess my other question would be on M&A and thank you for the clarification of kind of looking more into the industrial areas. I was just wondering also though that there does seem to be perhaps some opportunity in commercial areas unless you're including that within industrial. And maybe you said water management, is this something that maybe – that specificity implies that you've got some things really on your radar right now?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, I wouldn't read. I mean, obviously, we always keep a very healthy active M&A pipeline and funnel. We've got a very experienced M&A team here that's working with the businesses to always be staying close to that. So I wouldn't – but I wouldn't read into it that there's anything that is more near end that we're looking at or contemplating here. So don't read anything to the word change there. I used the word broadly water management and industrial as opposed to – in the past, we've talked about treatment, we've talked about broad-based water services. And so that is an area that we're certainly spending a good amount of time just making sure we understand what the opportunities are. And to your point around commercial, I mean I do think that the nomenclature on some of these things is a fine line. I think sometimes we use different words to describe things. So we're not – I'm not necessarily describing the scenario where we're going to be going out and doubling down in parts of the market that we're already in. These would be adjacencies that we think may be attractive and we have a right to play in.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your final question is coming from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Good morning. A couple of things from my end. I guess first on the utility market, just when you're talking about the high single-digit growth outlook for the year, can you help parse sort of what your view is on the underlying market growth and then how much you would attribute to company-specific factors, namely share gains? And then I guess in the U.S., you're tracking even higher at that sort of low double-digit growth, so wondering if you can also parse out in that region what you think is the market growth versus what you're doing on a share gain basis.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I'd say that, look, it's always hard to get precise share data within any one quarter or even a year for that matter. But based on what we're hearing from utilities and what we're sensing right now is I would say the market itself is overall growing about mid-single-digits, and that typically is about where it is when you have a healthy CapEx cycle underway and you've got a kind of normal OpEx cycle underway. I'll come back to the U.S. versus the rest of the world in a moment, but I would say globally, mid-single-digit market growth, we're seeing high single-digit growth. So there's probably a point or two of growth there that I would say is coming definitely from either share gain per se or we're just outgrowing the market because of our established base that's there. Secondly, I would say that in the U.S., that would be more like a high single-digit growth of the market. And again, there's probably a couple three points coming from Xylem specific and the things there that I think are really – now, this is not limited to the U.S. It's just it's been more of a recent phenomenon. We had integrated our commercial teams across Europe and the emerging markets a number of years back. And while they went through their own growing pains, we learned a lot during that timeframe. And since then, we've seen really attractive growth by one commercial team, sharing leads and generating leads across the portfolio for their colleagues and getting incentivized to do so. We just made that move last year, you'll recall here in the U.S. and North America. And we absolutely are seeing revenue synergies from having done that here in the U.S. We've seen a great increase in the bidding pipeline. We track these in Salesforce.com. We see what's there. We give people appropriate credits for passing leads across the aisle, and they are compensated accordingly. And so that makes them hungry. And a little bit of that with some new products to throw behind it. And then just getting more familiar with what's in the actual portfolio. We have a lot of stuff in the portfolio to sell that is relevant to the utility, and I think we are definitely seeing the benefits of that. And that will help buffer when the market maybe does moderate a little bit over time. And so, again, I can't give you a specific number of share gain. But directionally, that's what gives us confidence.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. No, that all makes sense. It's helpful. A second question just on MCS. I know the Sensus mix here has been skewing towards increasing the gas and electric, if you just look at the quarterly growth rate over the past several quarters. So just wondering at a high level if you guys are at all thinking differently about the composition of that business in the context of your longer-term organic growth targets for that segment? And then I know there are implications that you alluded to for margins, and you had a little bit of that in this quarter. Can you speak to whether or not that was very project-specific or is that just really end market-specific in terms of the mix issues you had there? Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, let me take, Brian, the higher level. As always, I'll let Mark handle the near end question. But from a strategic standpoint, no change in view towards either the composition of that portfolio and/or any worries around a shifting mix towards electric and gas biased away from water. This is purely a timing issue. Our growth in orders on the water side of the business and utility were up again.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: 40% in North America, yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I think 40%. 40%...
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: (01:13:28)
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's our biggest business here over 40%. We've got a really healthy bidding pipeline. We're getting close on a few more deals there of size in the water space that we hope we can announce here in the latter part of the half of the year that supports our long-term growth rate. That will skew the mix back to where it historically has been. At the same time, look, we love these electric deals that we've – electric and gas deals that we've won, and we'll continue to pursue them aggressively because while they may be a little bit less accretive than the water side, they're still very attractive from an economic value standpoint. So we'll take it across the board. It's just right now, what you're seeing is simply a timing issue within the year and within maybe an 18-month cycle.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And I would – that's exactly what we saw in Q2. A little bit in Q1, but we'll – as those deployments continue to roll out, we'll see a little bit more of it in Q3. But as some of those orders translate into revenues on the water side, that is a much lesser issue in Q4 and moving into 2019.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you. So again, thanks everybody for your time and your patience today. I know we ran over a little bit again but I really appreciate your interest and questions. Safe travels. Have a good end of the summer and we'll talk to you in the next earnings call. Thank you.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. We had a strong start to 2018, and with the solid game plan in hand, our teams were focused in their execution and delivered strong results growing across all end markets and in nearly every geography. The momentum we began to build in the second half of last year strengthened in the first quarter and is continuing as we uncover new opportunities in healthy end markets. As we look at our first quarter results, nearly every metric met or exceeded expectations. So, let me quickly review a few of the details. In the first quarter, we delivered solid broad-based orders and revenue growth across all of our major markets. Orders increased 10% in the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. This was driven by a strong performance in our Water Infrastructure businesses where treatment orders were up 27%. Many of those projects have longer lead times. So, these orders will not ship until 2019. In addition, we had very strong orders grew up in the emerging markets, up more than 20% year-over-year. This reflects solid growth overall as well as a few large project orders that pushed that growth significantly higher. We also secured healthy order growth in our North American Sensus water business. For the quarter, revenue grew 7% organically. From a regional perspective, the U.S. market generated strong growth with a 9% increase year-over-year. This reflects continued strength in utilities where we are capturing share gains as well as improved performance in industrials and the timing of certain projects in the quarter. Emerging markets continued to deliver solid revenue growth, up 6% overall. Our investments in product localization and capacity are beginning to pay off in a significant way. The standouts once again were China and India. Both markets saw strong double-digit revenue growth and they continue to benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure, as well as growing regulatory requirements. In India, among the infrastructure projects, we have a very healthy bidding pipeline on larger scale treatment projects as well as growing analytics opportunities. Growth across our key end markets was also broad-based and solid. The utilities end market show continued strength across all regions. The double-digit growth we delivered in the Sensus electric and gas business was driven by some large project deployments in North America. We were also encouraged by the continued improvement in the industrials end market which grew 6% for the quarter. This reflects ongoing strengthening in both the heavy industrials like oil and gas and mining as well as the light general industrial applications. Finally, I want to mention the ongoing progress we're making in identifying and realizing revenue synergies across our Sensus, Visenti and legacy Xylem businesses. We are encouraged by the progress of the pilots we have underway as well as the large deals that our teams are working. As I explained at our Investor Day last year, these major deals take longer to close, but given the current progress, we expect those efforts to manifest with orders later this year and revenue in 2019 and beyond. In addition, our ongoing day to day collaboration across the businesses is increasingly creating new opportunities. While many of those wins are relatively small and therefore not highlighted, we also have visibility to deals and opportunities of more meaningful scale. And I'm confident that we'll be able to announce some of these in the months ahead. This progress increases our enthusiasm for the commercial value created by the combination of these businesses. During the quarter, our teams also focused on managing cost and driving productivity as we like many others see some signs of growing inflation on the horizon. In addition, we're managing some near-term mix headwinds as treatment project deliveries increase and certain project businesses in emerging market grows. As reminder, that work which is largely for greenfield infrastructure installations generally has modestly lower margins relative to the rest of our portfolio initially, but carries higher margins with the aftermarket and replacement cycle. One tactic for mitigating these issues is to continue to deliver continuous improvement savings. In the first quarter, we generated $36 million in cost savings, a 9% increase year-over-year which has us on pace to meet our full year targets. In addition, we've already announced some pricing actions to help offset these pressures. We saw very modest impact from those actions in the first quarter due to timing, but expect to see more impact materialize over the coming quarters. And given the health of our end markets and the mission critical nature of many of the businesses we serve, we are confident in the industry's ability and the willingness to absorb price in this environment. We ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 17.5%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. This reflects volume leverage and the savings I just spoke about. Our operating margin for the quarter was 11.1%, up 60 basis points. Excluding the 40 basis point dilution from purchase accounting amortization, operating margins expanded 100 basis points. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 for the quarter, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We continue to improve our working capital management which Mark will address shortly and are on track for another year of strong cash generation to achieve our full year target of at least 115% conversion. So, all in, a very strong quarter. And I want to acknowledge the terrific efforts by all of our teams around the world who remain focused on deepening our customer relationships and developing the solutions that will address their challenges. We have a lot of activity in the company right now as we continue to integrate new businesses and expand our portfolio. I've been very pleased with the increased collaboration that's occurring and just plain excitement about working together to create new opportunities and bring a broader set of solutions to our customers. This internally driven momentum is fueling our success in the marketplace and over time will enable us to create even more value for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Mark, I want to make a few comments on our most recent acquisitions and the formation of our advanced infrastructure analytics platform which we refer to as our AIA platform. So, let me start by revisiting why we brought these businesses together. I spend a good deal of time out visiting with customers, listening to what their challenges are and better understanding the obstacles they face in trying to address them. While there are many, three large categories rise to the top: non-revenue water, storm water management and the management of aging or overstressed infrastructure. Now, these are not new problems but the need to address them is becoming acute driven in part by regulatory edicts. That demand has coincided with a quantum leap in the generation of data, and more importantly, the capability to analyze and draw insights from that data. Add to that the extraordinary advances in technology which we're already leveraging in our legacy businesses, and this enables the development of applications that simply weren't possible a decade ago. Now, we all hear these huge numbers thrown around about the cost to meet the Water Infrastructure repair and replacement needs. These capital outlays put enormous pressure on cities and communities, but the new technology enabled solutions that we're now bringing to the market can fundamentally change how a utility operator approaches those challenges, utilizing new data insights and tools to inform their decision making in ways that can significantly reduce those costs and simply help make water more affordable. So, this is the backdrop against which we formed our new AIA platform. We've now brought together a collection of businesses with the capabilities to address these issues. The platform includes Pure Technologies, EmNet, Visenti, Hypack and we added one more in February, Valor Water Analytics. Valor brings another unique software enabled solution to help utilities optimize their revenue potential. Each of these businesses is unique and has its own value proposition. Clearly, the challenges our customers face manifest differently and require a solution that can be adapted to their distinct circumstances. With a portfolio of capabilities and technologies, we can best address these issues, and we're still building out this platform. We expect to add other capabilities to the platform through acquisitions that further expand our ability to help customers solve their challenges. The platform is being led by Al Cho who many of you have either met or had the opportunity to hear at an industry event somewhere around the world. He brings a unique understanding of how technology can be applied in the water sector in disruptive ways that add value to our customers' operations. And as I mentioned at our last call, Jack Elliott, the Former CEO of Pure, has agreed to stay on as an advisor to help us scale the new platform effectively. It's early days in this process, but we're very encouraged by the response we've received from customers. Our commercial teams who already have deep relationships with utility customers are opening up new opportunities for this portfolio. And working together across Xylem, our teams are having a different kind of conversation with the customer. It's no longer just about a project or a new product. Now, it's about how our portfolio, both our legacy businesses and the new platform, can help that customer deal with some of their toughest pain points differently, which ultimately can change the economics of their operations, increase the affordability of water and contribute to the sustainability of our communities. We are, in effect, creating a new market with our unique set of capabilities and while this will take time to develop, the opportunity is enormous. And our early experience gives us tremendous confidence in its long-term growth prospects. In fact, we expect this relatively small platform to outpace the growth of our other businesses by at least 2x. So, we look forward to sharing our progress in this exciting growth area over the months and years to come. So now, please turn to slide five and I'll hand it over to Mark to review the quarter results in more detail.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I'm very pleased with our strong start to the year. Overall, revenues were up 14% in the quarter, this represents 7% organic growth, 4 points of growth from foreign exchange tailwind and 3 points of growth from acquisitions. From an organic perspective, the strength in revenue was broad-based, across all of our end markets in most geographies. Utilities end market led the way with 8% growth. This was above our expectations and was driven both by the timing of project deliveries and very strong performance in North America and emerging markets. Most of the growth in emerging markets was from the outstanding performance from our China and India teams, which grew revenue by more than 40% and 30%, respectively, due in part to heightened regulatory focus and growing opportunities across all of our businesses that serve utilities. Industrial revenue was also up nicely this quarter with 6% growth which was at the higher end of our expectations. Market conditions remain healthy in our Applied Water business as well as dewatering. Here, the strength was primarily in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe. Rounding out the end markets, we continued to see solid performance in our commercial and residential end markets which were up 6% and 4%, respectively. Moving to operational performance, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 130 basis points to 17.5% in the quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased productivity savings and volume leverage from strong organic growth which was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix and foreign exchange impacts. Adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 11.1% which includes 40 basis points of noncash amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions in our new AIA platform. Our teams continue to perform well, executing on our productivity programs where we delivered $36 million in cost savings in the quarter, a 9% increase from the prior year. This 300 basis point improvement offset inflation and enabled us to continue to fund strategic investments for growth. Partially offsetting these investments was weaker mix from lower margin treatment projects and foreign exchange impacts. Strong revenue performance drove earnings per share of $0.51, an increase of 31% year-over-year and at the high end of our expectations. Please turn to slide six and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. I'll start with our Water Infrastructure segment which recorded orders of $554 million in the quarter, up 13% organically year-over-year. This reflects growth in all applications within the segment. Treatment orders led the way, up 27%. This performance builds on the improving trajectory we have in our pipeline and the overall health of the utility market. As Patrick mentioned, the majority of the treatment orders are for projects which require longer lead times and will not ship until 2019. That said, we exited the quarter with total backlog for this segment of $673 million, up 18% organically year-over-year. Water Infrastructure revenue of $480 million represents a 9% year-over-year increase on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $25 million tailwind. In the U.S., the segment grew 12% reflecting double-digit growth in both the utility and industrial end markets. On the utility side, we're continuing to see strong market performance across all of our businesses. Treatment benefited from the timing of several project deliveries and transport continued to generate strong growth in aftermarket sales and achieve modest share gains. Dewatering also generated mid-single digit growth in this vertical. The strong growth in our U.S. industrial end market was primarily driven by higher rentals for construction activity as well as double digit growth in the oil and gas and mining markets of our dewatering business. Outside the U.S., performance in this segment was also very good. Emerging markets were up 10% and this included double digit growth in our three focus regions: China, India and the Middle East. Government mandates and spending in China and India have driven significant activity in both transport and treatment. Additionally, the focus of our commercial teams in driving locally engineered, sourced, and manufactured products from across the Xylem portfolio has continued to gain traction and is delivering impressive results. The Middle East growth came from project deliveries in both transport and treatment. We saw modestly improving market conditions in Western Europe where our business grew 5% overall, primarily driven by solid growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy from treatment project execution and solid aftermarket sales within transport. Operating margin for this segment increased 60 basis points to 11.3% driven by cost savings from productivity programs and higher volumes. This more than offset inflation, foreign exchange, and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of treatment project revenue this year versus last year. Foreign exchange was a net 80 basis point headwind to margins. This reflects the fact that our transport business primarily manufactures in Europe. So the substantial year-over-year increase in European currencies against the dollar has resulted in higher cost of products exported from Europe for sale into the U.S. We expect this year-over-year impact will moderate in the second half of the year based on our current FX assumptions. Please turn to slide seven. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $384 million in the quarter which was up 6% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. We exited the quarter with backlog of $217 million which is up 20% organically compared to last year. While this is still predominantly a short cycle business, the growth of our backlog gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid-single digit organic growth for the second quarter. Revenue for Applied Water was $366 million, up 7% organically versus the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange was a $14 million tailwind. In Western Europe, revenue increased 10% with growth across all applications. Industrial performance was particularly strong with customers in Germany, France and UK where we continue to benefit from our investments in building up both our sales capabilities and channel partners. Western Europe also drove most of the growth in residential for this segment through promotional activity resulting in some modest share gains. In the U.S., segment revenue was up 5%. This increase was primarily driven by the segment's industrial vertical which grew 10% as heavy industrial project demand continued to recover. We also benefited from the delivery of several fire pump and turbine projects. Commercial was up mid-single digits from strong distributor restocking of heating and circulator pumps. And residential was down mid-single digits as we lapped the mid-teens growth in the prior year. Emerging markets revenue grew 6%, reflecting strong growth in Asia, primarily driven by the improvement in the commercial building market in China. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 100 basis points to 14.5% year-over-year. Continued progress on our productivity programs drove a 340 basis point margin improvement which more than offset 230 basis points of cost inflation and unfavorable mix. Now let's turn to slide eight to discuss the performance of Measurement & Control Solutions. Our Measurement & Control Solutions segment booked orders of $382 million in the quarter, which was up 12% organically. Revenue for Measurement & Control Solutions was $371 million, up 5% on an organic basis year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a $15 million tailwind and acquisitions added $20 million. In the U.S., revenue increased 10% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of large electric and gas projects, specifically the Alliant deal we announced last year and the Nicor Gas deal that we announced earlier this year. Services were up double digits as well due to networking contract upgrades made with existing customers in late 2017. Water was down low-single digits, primarily due to the timing of shipments. It is worth noting that our orders in North America water were up double-digits versus last year and we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth for the full year. Our Western Europe and emerging markets businesses were down mid-single digits due to timing of project deployments in the prior year. As a reminder, the rollout of large project deployments in the Sensus business can create some lumpiness in quarterly growth rates. We look at the business over the course of the full year and we continue to expect growth in the high-single digit range. Organic revenue in our new AIA platform grew 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and in line with our expectations. We're very encouraged with the significant momentum we're seeing in orders and pipeline growth. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 270 basis points to 21.8%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity improvements, volume and price which were partially offset by inflation and the funding of strategic investments. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter increased 90 basis points to 11.6% year-over-year. Our performance here was also impacted by the non-cash impact of incremental purchase accounting amortization from the new AIA platform. Excluding these non-cash items, operating margins expanded by 220 basis points. Now, let's turn to slide nine to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $300 million. As you may recall, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest period for cash flow. We continue to expect to deliver our full year target of more than 115% free cash flow conversion. The year-over-year decline in first quarter cash flow reflects the timing of capital spend as operating cash flows increased 20% over the prior year quarter. We had an unusually high level of investment in the quarter including a strategic investment in purchasing a previously leased manufacturing facility as well as accelerated investment in rental fleet for our dewatering business to meet growing market demand. We also returned $38 million to our shareholders through dividends and repurchased $25 million of shares to offset dilution. In February, we announced a 17% increase to our dividend pay-out, our sixth consecutive annual increase. We continue to make solid progress on working capital, reducing it by 220 basis points as we continue to improve our processes and discipline. While there's still much to do, I'm very pleased with the focus and rigor the team is bringing to this key metric. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and plan to repay the short-term debt we used to fund the Pure acquisition by the end of this year. Please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2018 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. As we discussed this morning, we had a strong first quarter and we have solid momentum moving forward. We're well-positioned to deliver on our full year commitments while continuing to invest in our longer term growth initiatives. At the top line, we continue to expect to deliver full year revenue of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. This continues to represent an organic growth rate of 4% to 6%. And as we previously stated, we expect our new AIA platform to add about 2% to our total revenue. Our continuous improvement efforts continue and our forecast is to generate about $160 million in cost savings for the full year. This result will keep us well on pace to meet our long-term target. These savings are expected to help fuel our operating margin expansion. Our adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 60 basis points to 100 basis points to between 13.9% and 14.3%. This expansion excludes about 30 basis points of margin dilution from purchase accounting for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by 70 basis points to 100 basis points which would bring that to a range of 19.5% to 19.8%. At the bottom line, we continue to expect to generate adjusted full year earnings per share in the range of $2.82 to $2.97. This excludes integration, restructuring and realignment cost of about $35 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 18% to 24% for the year. And as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations which will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 115% in 2018. Anticipated capital expenditures are $190 million to $200 million. Now please turn to slide 11 and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Overall, our end market view for the full year has not changed materially from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. While we did have a strong first quarter in certain end markets, we do expect that to moderate somewhat as we get into the second half of the year when we'll lap some tougher year-over-year comparisons. So let me quickly walk through our projections. Our utility end market is one in which we've seen continued strength, particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For full year 2018, we continue to expect revenue to grow in the mid-single digit range overall and the smart meter market is projected to generate slightly higher growth, likely in the high-single digit range. We had a good first quarter in the industrial end market. Looking out for the full year, we expect a somewhat mixed environment, particularly in the emerging markets. There we expect markets such as China and India to continue to benefit from governmental spending, but that will likely be somewhat offset by softness in parts of Latin America. We continue to project industrials to be up low-to-mid single digits. We expect 2018 organic growth in the commercial end market to be in the low- to mid-single digit range. We see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation from recent strength in Europe. Emerging markets should continue to enjoy solid growth due in part to increased government spending. And finally, in residential, we anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. We continue to see competitive dynamics in the U.S. market where demand tends to be replacement-driven and we have some tough prior year compares. But we also anticipate solid demand to continue in China and other Asia-Pacific countries, as well as Western Europe. Now please turn to slide 12 and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Consistent with what we disclosed last quarter, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2018 planning assumptions. For the second quarter, we expect sustained growth in the utility market in the mid- to high-single digit range. We expect industrial markets to moderate sequentially and return to low-single digit growth. We expect the commercial and residential markets to both continue to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. All in, we anticipate this will result in organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6%. We expect the contribution from the AIA platform to be about $30 million. We expect second quarter operating margins to be up 50 basis points to 80 basis points, this includes a 30 basis point negative impact due to purchase accounting for our recent AIA acquisitions. Our outlook also reflects an uptick in direct material costs from increasing global demand for certain materials in electronic components. Our procurement and operational teams have done a great job securing adequate supply and we expect they will continue to do so, but it is impacting cost. To address the impact of rising material costs, our commercial teams are in the market with price actions. We expect to see some realization in the second quarter and higher price realization in the back half of the year. Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our euro guidance assumption, which remains at $1.21. In the second quarter, we expect year-over-year operating margins to be impacted by FX transaction headwind, similar to the first quarter and predominantly in our Water Infrastructure segment. We expect the year-over-year impact in the second half of the year will be minimal based on current FX rates. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Again, we had a strong first quarter and momentum is continuing, both in the end markets we serve and within our teams across the company. But it's only the first of four quarters and we take nothing for granted. We will remain vigilant in our execution and remain focused on best serving our customers. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, to fuel our longer-term growth to drive greater value for our shareholders. With that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Matthew Latino - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Nate.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So unsurprisingly, I'm going to start on margins here. And I wanted to look at your full year guidance for margins because you actually ex-purchase accounting increased the margin expansion guidance by 10 basis points. You've got headwinds from mix. You've got headwinds from inflation. You've got headwinds from the stronger dollar. Yet you've actually taken the guidance for core margins here up by 10 basis points for the year. Can you talk about how you get to a better number than you did before with certainly some increasing headwinds to margins here?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'll go first here, Nathan. I think the – our read through on margins both in the quarter which came in a little bit light because of the mix of treatment, that subsides in the second half of the year, as does the impact of the FX transaction effect coming out of Europe. That subsides in the second half of the year. And I think the fact that we're getting ahead of the emerging inflationary pressure that we're seeing on some of the components and others, with price early in the year. We went out earlier this year with price increases in addition to what we'd already announced, so we could get ahead of this. And so when you rack all that up together, that's what gives us the confidence around the margin expansion for the full year. So, not concerned at all about margins.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And Nate on the – yeah, the guidance is essentially the same. The purchase accounting amortization ticked up 10 basis points. That might be what you're thinking about if you exclude that impact, but it's essentially the same.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's the same including that extra 10 basis points, but without the...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...amortization, it actually went up 10 basis points. So, there must be the anticipation of some pretty meaningful price realization in the back half of the year here, correct?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. That's right. We saw a little bit in Q1. We'll expect to see a bit more in Q2, and then we see the full effect of that in Q3 and Q4.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And we continue to ramp up productivity and cost savings as well. So, we've got good confidence in our ability to deliver those full-year margin targets, Nathan.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, on the first quarter, you're about 30 basis points below what you had forecast for the first quarter. Can you maybe break down the impact of what mix was? I mean, you obviously had a strong treatment shipment quarter, can you break that down maybe between...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The mix impact, the inflation impact.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Really, I mean the biggest piece of this, Mark can go through the details, I mean if there was one takeaway from the quarter, if you think about the higher revenue that we delivered above and beyond what we had guided to, that really was predominantly coming from some large treatment in emerging market project deliveries that accelerated into the quarter from Q2. Those came with lower margin because they're greenfield, they have great aftermarket profiles, but in the initial install they're lower margin and that impacted us alone by about 70 bps in Q1. And so, that gives you a feel for the magnitude of what we're talking about. That begins to subside. We have a little bit more of that in Q2, but we've got that reflected in our guide and then it really subsides in second half the year.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Nathan, I guess, yeah, it comes under the heading of no good deed goes unpunished. We've got exactly what we were looking for in terms of growing our position in those end markets and, as Patrick said, the project margins are a little bit lower. We're going to like the aftermarket margins a lot. But the impact that was probably 30 basis points to 40 basis points more because of that mix. In terms of the margin impact, inflation was – ran a little a bit harder than we thought. But obviously we got some nice benefits from volume leverage which offset a lot of that and also we performed better than – a little better than we were expecting on our productivity as well.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess the project work has to stay the aftermarket for the future and that will drag on in the quarter. So, I think that's helpful color. Thanks a lot.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I'd just like to stay on the topic, the emerging markets and these greenfield projects. Just to follow on, what's your line of sight for additional infrastructure needs across the emerging markets? I mean, you don't see it in developed markets. We're not building new plants but what inning are we for emerging markets in infrastructure build-out on the municipal side over the next couple of years?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, Deane, I think, it's hard to predict exactly what inning we're in but, I would say, it's the early innings based on what I've seen when I've been traveling there and when we take a look at our bidding pipeline, particularly, I would say, in India. Certainly, I think the only thing that could ever change that trajectory would be if there was a change in political administration and we're not getting any reason to believe that's going to happen. So, that's going to have a long tail to it because it really is being driven by the Smart Cities initiatives, as well as the Ganges River clean-up, as well as the connecting their population to treatment – treated water across the country. So, we've got a very significant pipeline there. The same in China. We continue to see, especially in the second- and third-tier cities, tremendous investments in water treatment there. We would be expecting those to be 30%, 40% on a regular basis. I mean, we're guiding there through our long-range plan of certainly low-double digit for those businesses. The Middle East, I think, is still very early in its recovery, coming out of the energy downturn. And so, we've seen that begin to recover quite nicely. That one in my mind is probably a little bit less predictable than China and India would be. And I just got back from South America. I spent a week there two weeks ago and was very encouraged by what I see especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, may be less so Brazil. So, I think we're in the early innings here, Deane, in terms of continued run for emerging markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And just one last point on these projects. What's the content, the Xylem content? How broadly are they taking your different products and services in these projects?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. It has broadened. I mean, it depends obviously on what the application is. But generally speaking, you're talking about projects that we're able to cross-sell. The team has done a great job there of getting in, for example, maybe on an ozone job and then being able to pull through our flight pumps pulling through analytics on the water quality side. Just to give you kind of one example. But we also – that's one of the areas where we're seeing some of the best early activity on pilots for some of some of our new Sensus revenue synergies as well.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then I'd like to ask a few questions regarding the advanced infrastructure analytics, the new subsector platform. What are the growth expectations here? This really feels like a tech incubation...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: ...holding co for you. A lot of these are still in pilot programs in terms of different projects you might even be pre-revenue. But just help us calibrate what the growth expectations over the next couple of years should be from this platform?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think, it's – what I would kind of reply would be, the comments I had in my script initially and that was we're really making a new market here, Deane, as you can appreciate. You probably of anybody understands that the most in terms of, we're kind of really addressing new unmet needs and sorting through what is the best way to optimize the revenue generation out of this given the significant disruption possibly. It's going to be having and is already having to large CapEx spend. But certainly, the businesses as we see them today, we would expect these businesses to be growing double-digit consistently and that's just with the businesses that we have today. I mean, it's a small part of our portfolio, you're right it's an incubator. We're doing probably about $120 million right now of revenue, but we're going to see that grow exponentially and we're going to be adding to it in terms of new acquisitions.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And I'm sorry, I just got one other one. We heard some rumblings that regarding the combined sewer overflow, that the EPA is like backing off on some of the enforcements and maybe this will result in some delays in orders. Are you seeing any of that showing up in like EmNet's business?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. It's interesting you asked that question Deane. I haven't been out with a number of these customers whether it be utilities or whether it be the works departments because in many cases, as you know, it's not always the same entity in any given city that manages this issue. But the conversations I had, they were not seeing the EPA alleviating pressure. They may not be getting fined right now in immediate term, but the consent decree still hold. And one of the opportunities that we have here is obviously EmNet can actually serve as one solution to helping significantly reduce what that capital burden would be and working with the EPA to actually allow that technology to be used as an alternative. Regulatory is also only one driver in this area, as I know you'd fully appreciate. It's also the public nuance that utilities and works departments have to deal with when there is a storm water overflow situation. So, it is one of the biggest headaches that works departments have across the country. So, our customers see this as a long-term issue and I'm very confident that their needs are going to persist beyond one potential administrative change in policy.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little...
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Good morning. I want to talk about the project delays on the metering side that you talked about. And certainly you're not alone there, your peers have made similar comments, but at the same time, you're seeing the strength in treatment which, in theory, is also a project-oriented business. So, my question is what is it about metering projects specifically that's different, that's leading to the delays there? And what's different about treatment where we're not seeing delays on those types of projects?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, I would say our issue was less of a project delay as much as it was just timing of projects. I mean, our orders were up 10% and that was coming from project orders coming in. We had a little bit of softness in the quarter, a little bit of that was weather. That certainly had some impact, but then you might say, well doesn't it have an impact on treatment, but it just depends on what utility you're dealing with, what location it is. I wouldn't read too much into that. We still feel very confident about looking at a mid-to-high single digit growth in our water utility business for the full year. I don't know, Mark, if you want to make a comment.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's timing of deployment of existing projects. I don't – the pipeline is very good. The order rates, we had 12% order growth in our water business in North America for Sensus. So, this is more of a quarterly phenomenon than it is anything that's long term.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. If you go back to the – to go back to the fourth quarter of last year, we had double digit growth in that part of the business in terms of orders growth. So, it really is it can be lumpy in terms of the deployment from quarter-to-quarter, but this is not a long-term trend that I'd be concerned about.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: And then my other question had to do with, Patrick you talk about a willingness on the part of customers in the utility space to accept price increases and yet if you look at their situation, those customers are actually having a harder time getting price themselves. We've really seen tariff inflation recede and it's now kind of they're barely running above CPI. So, can you just talk about – give us your take on that and why we're confident that we can push price when that the customer base there is maybe not able to pass that through themselves as well as they have historically?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think, firstly, part of that is just the, again, the critical nature. These are mission critical applications and so obviously we want to be respectful of these, so we're not going to gouge them on price, but it's also more than utility. We're talking about each one of our end markets here. So, you also need to bring in the industrial part of the equation to this as well. When we go back and we look at previous periods of time where we were in an inflationary period, back then you're talking about kind of the 2011, 2012 timeframe. We were realizing quite significant price at that point in time well above what you've heard us talk about here in the last couple of years, and it was because there was an understanding that it is inflationary environment. Secondly, what we're finding especially in the pockets of business where we've been most successful to get price here most recently, it is where we brought much more innovative solutions to bear. So, when we've embedded more intelligence and whether it be energy efficiency, whether it be cost of use, it's part of a broader value proposition here rather than just an across the board take a list price increase.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay. So, if I could paraphrase that, you think you can kind of take wallet share so to speak?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Yeah. Okay.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And you take a look at the size of our installed base and the replacement nature of that, there's opportunity there that we're seeing on the repair and replacement side of the business to take some price.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, I'll get back in queue. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Walt.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: I wanted to ask about the oil and gas business, and if you could just refresh us now how big percentage of revenue is that? And then the comments about dewatering, what inning are we there? Are you able to get pricing on the dewatering related products?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Walt. It's about the scale, it's about 2% of our enterprise revenues. Dewatering had a very solid quarter. And just looking at oil and gas, they were up strong double digits. And in fact, I had remarked in earlier comments about accelerating some capital investment to build out our rental fleet to meet market demand. So, it's relatively small in the overall scheme of things, but it is growing nicely and we're investing to make sure we can meet market demand.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. All in – to be clear, Walt. All in, our oil and gas and mining exposure both together roughly about 5% with mining in. But that's not the only piece of our dewatering business just to make sure that we don't confuse anyone there. I mean, dewatering is larger than that. It plays into also other industrial markets, muni and certainly what's been driving growth in that business also was during the middle of the downturn that team did a good job of diversifying beyond oil and gas and mining. Now we're getting the benefit of oil and gas and mining coming back. That's putting some pressure on our rental fleet, and there we're making the capital investments to support it.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Good. And then on the pricing side there, I mean, it's probably a little bit easier getting price in this part of the business.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say we had a little bit of a lag recovery. We began to see growth in order rates in oil and gas and mining second half of last year. We did not see the pricing realization early on. But now the market is absorbing that price as, again, obviously I think ours and our competitors' fleets are tightening in terms of utilization.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Great. And if I can just do one more, you mentioned the flight business and the currency issues. I wondered about anything that you could do to mitigate that. Is there a way of manufacturing in a different location or if there isn't anything, is there demand destruction that happens because of the foreign currency, the higher prices?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. There's a couple things that we can do and are doing. One is we do hedge the cash flow impact to that. But as currencies continue to rise, it's not 100% coverage. So that is one thing, and with the rapid rise in euro-based currencies that we saw the impact to that. The other that we can do and are doing is make sure that in the markets where those products are coming into, we again go after price to offset some of that higher cost. And the teams are out there, as we mentioned in our comments, taking price actions to address some of the uptick in cost inflation.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: The good news for us, Walt, is that at least in that part of the business which is really the business that is most exposed to euro-based manufacturing, pretty much all of our competitors are as well. And so it does not create a market share challenge or a competitive dynamic. And so, we tend to take the longer view here in terms of what we want to do strategically. We are and have been shifting some capacity to the U.S. That was just really to support the U.S. market growth anyway; it wasn't really being driven by currency movement.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Wondering maybe if you could provide a bit of an update on where we stand in terms of localization in emerging markets, potential for some more investments there, how you think about the benefits.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, I think we're pretty well progressed on the localization efforts in China, India and the Middle East. I would say we're furthest in China. There today, we do about 90% – north of 90% of our revenue in the market actually comes from products that are localized. And we're obviously looking to get that as close to 100% as possible. Secondly is India and I would say India is just behind that at roughly about 80% localized and we would expect that to continue to grow. Middle East, we have local factory there. We had a greenfield that we opened up about two years ago. And I'd say there, we're still moving things into that facility and also we're ramping up the actual design locally as opposed to just the manufacturing of it locally. Then I would say there probably are opportunities as we look forward in a couple areas. One is I do think we're going to have an opportunity to do some further localization on the metering side, leveraging some of our footprint in those locations as we look to grow those businesses. And then secondly would be in Latin America. Based on my visit down there, there clearly are some opportunities that we're going to be exploring in a couple of key markets. Just got to find the right timing and find the right channels to market to support that.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's great color. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Patrick, Mark, Matt.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Jim.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Jim.
Matthew Latino - Xylem, Inc.: Morning.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Clarification point on that pop in treatment, I mean you cited broad-based sales growth across Europe and North America, but that pop in orders, that 27%, is that a couple large orders driving that or broad-based as well?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: It's pretty – I mean, we had a few large projects but it was pretty broad-based. I would say, if it's skewed anywhere, it's skewed heavily towards the emerging markets and that was mainly again in China and India. But there was pretty broad based growth in orders. I mean, we saw good growth in North America as well as in Europe. So, it was not a lumpy one-off. I mean there were some big projects in there but not a meaningful piece of the 27% that we quoted.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then seems like you're pacing well, at least on an aggressive plan on it with internal initiatives on the cost side, productivity side. Can you – maybe this is more of a question for Mark, refresh us on the areas that will accelerate into 2019 and 2020 to kind of get you to that stated margin goal that you have out there, 17% to 18%?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Jim. Sure. Right now, what we have seen and are continuing to see is significant procurement and savings around our continuous improvement Lean Six Sigma programs. What we have launched this year and are ramping up and we'll see some modest benefit at the end of this year, but significant benefits into 2019 and 2020 is our global business services program where we're looking to standardize our platforms and processes and tools across finance, HR, procurement and IT. So, that is all in front of us and those are substantial programs.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. And one more if I may. I recall aftermarket sales, I mean just pre Sensus, pre Pure aftermarket was kind of dubbed at that 30%, 35% of Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. Is that still a good number? And can you kind of isolate your aftermarket sales, how much it grew in those two segments and what the obvious influence, I would think, positive on margins was? Thanks.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Listen, I don't think it shifted that much. I mean, as we're looking at it, it's..
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: It's roughly about 40%. It ebbs and flows from quarter to quarter, but it's roughly about 40% all in. And that's if you throw in the impact obviously of the new Measurement & Control Solutions segment.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Services is bumping that up a little bit. And the transport, Jim, the transport aftermarket was up double digits there. So, that was where we saw some good help.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you all.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey Patrick, can you talk about how – as you've added these platforms and you're having these discussions with these pilots, how has like the selling pitch changed? Like is it more you now doing a lot of this stuff, going into big customers and doing like a pitch to a CEO whereas maybe a couple years ago it was individual product people talking to people like at lower levels of utility?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's a good question, Jim (sic) [Joe] (58:33). Let me be clear, this is a team sport. So there's a lot of people and a lot of executives that are having these conversations. But what I would say to your point, the nature of the conversation very much has changed. So, a lot of these are me going out with the teams and meeting with the CEOs, the Chief Technology Officer, the CFO, for example, of a utility, but there are many other executives that are off doing these meetings as well. What's most important is the nature of the conversation has evolved. Before, we would be selling in, this was before the Sensus acquisition and certainly before the new AIA platform, we would go in, and quite frankly, it was more of a courtesy call. We were serving the wastewater side of the market, not very capital intensive other than large treatment plants, and they didn't have any headaches with our product. I'm not saying that overconfidently but it was not their top of mind issue. They were happy with what they got or they had issues they would share with me. Now, we're having conversations around their large capital plans which is what gets the CEO's attention and the CFO's attention, and we get to talk about what are their biggest pain points? What are the big headaches for them both from an OpEx and CapEx perspective? And it really is those pain points that I talked about in the opening around non-revenue water, the age and decay of their infrastructure, as well as headaches like storm water overflow, outdoor water, smart watersheds, et cetera. So, we leave them, we try to leave them to a process of discovery to say depending up on what their pain point is. We're pretty confident that we have a technology and a solution in the portfolio to then go do a pilot with them, and that's where we're really seeing the inflow of these pilots that I'm referring to not just on the Sensus side, but really the new AIA platform. So, it's early days, Joe, I mean I think we are evolving, we are learning a lot as we go. But it's a great – it's very different and great set of conversations with the customer to really understand what their biggest challenges are.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then, and Mark, if we get another leg higher in cost inflation or if there's something that ramps on tariffs or anything, how much flex do you have on the cost side of things to be able to maybe bring forward some of the savings at a faster rate or flex spend somewhere to kind of keep offsetting inflation with productivity like you've done so far this year?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Well, yeah, I think we're going to continue to drive our productivity programs or actually perform a little bit better than what we had expected and planned in the first quarter and the teams are doing very well there. But as inflation ticks up, we need to do a better job in getting price in the marketplace to cover that. So I think that's really what we need to be pushing on.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Joe, we also have flexibility in some of the planned investments in the back half of this year as well as in the next year that obviously we can throttle those as we need to. Obviously, we're not going to cut ourself short in terms of investing in growth of the business, but we've got some other incremental discretionary investments that we've held back on thus far just until we get a better feel for what the environment is going to be in the second half.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Robert.
Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow ups...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: ...I guess at this point. On the emerging markets, I think in China and India are about 25% of the total, that implies, I think, the rest is down like mid-single digits. So, just curious what's going on in those other pieces? Are there some particular pockets of weakness and what's the outlook for those?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not exactly sure how you did your math. I would say...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. The Middle East...
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Middle East.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Middle East was up low-single digits. And I would say we had a little bit of softness in Latin America...
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: ...that would have – and a little bit in Eastern Europe, but they're quite small, so maybe all those together that gets you down maybe around flattish for the rest of emerging markets but I think our math would still show us with low-single digit growth in the rest.
Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it. I'll follow up with that, Matt. And then just a quick one on just setting the expectations for growth in MCS, I know it's lumpy but with starting at 5%, I think that implies you need to do 8% to 9% and the remaining quarters and it's toughening comps in the back half. So, just any level setting there on how we should model that?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. On that one, I think there's a bunch of components right? The first is when you just think about Sensus which is the biggest piece of that segment. In the first quarter, they grew at 6% but we do expect that to ramp up in the second quarter and over the back half of the year to high-single digits. We've got pretty strong backlogs there. We – also on the test side we're a little bit light, we are in low-single digits and that ramps up as well. So, the next three quarters are bigger than what we see in the first quarter. So, we're confident that we'll get to that higher revenue.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: So, Robert, we had a 16% increase in shippable backlog for that whole segment and we expect high-single digits in Q2 through the end of the year and that's based on some very specific project deployments, things that we've won previously that we're announcing for, so the Alliant deal, the Nicor deal, those kind of things that are out there. So, we've got quite a high level confidence on hitting those numbers.
Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Would you guys mind just – I think I'm asking a question that maybe some people are trying to get to. If we look at your page five, your mix/price/FX/other, that was a minus 80 basis points, and in the fourth quarter, it was a plus 30 basis points. So, that shift – I know that gap gets reduced in the coming quarters by pricing and the mix things that you've already talked about. But I think it would be really helpful to us if you could tell us specifically what pricing was in each of the two legacy segments, is that possible?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: We'll take that offline. I mean, we've, I think, laid out pretty clearly what that margin delta was year-over-year. The biggest driver was volume, okay? And that was 170 basis points, 180 basis points. And we also saw significant improvement from productivity that was roughly 40 basis points. Then you had mix was roughly 70 basis point hit year-over-year and we've talked a lot about that. And obviously inflation was 220 basis points. So, those were the big drivers, the other that we mentioned briefly was a little bit of a headwind, relative to transactional FX. And obviously, we continue to invest in our business as well. So, I mean, those are the components. I don't think there's anything that's changed in terms of the model.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Understood. Thank you. And I just – a follow-up would be residential construction spending has been slowing. I mean, it's been a great market for such a long time, law of large numbers. Do you think that that ultimately backs up into utility spending in 2019?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: We're not seeing the signs at this point, Scott, I mean, based on all of the indicators we see in our bid pipeline, all the conversations we're having across utility base. You are correct that over the long-term of the cycle, depending upon where that – it really depends on the pockets around the country that it's happening as to whether or not that resi expansion is impacting the need for greenfield expansion of treatment capabilities. So it really depends on where. We're not seeing it and we're not hearing any indications of that at all certainly in terms of the bid and quotations coming in to us.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sounds good. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hi Brian.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. I'll just squeeze one in here, I know we're nearing the end of the call. But on analytics in India, I think, Patrick, you made some specific comments around that. Can you speak to China and then maybe some other regions where you're seeing some revenue synergy opportunities and also maybe speak to the scale of some of these opportunities given the commentary around them being larger deals and now maybe being more 2019 versus 2018 impact on the P&L? Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So we're seeing – I would categorize it overall that especially in the emerging markets, I mean, I'll come back in North America in a moment and Europe, but certainly in the emerging markets, that's where we're probably seeing the quickest uptake on some of the pilots that we've been talking about because there, you've heard me say before and I don't mean to be kind of facetious about it, but the emerging markets in many cases don't have the basic infrastructure in place, and therefore, they're going to skip investing in dumb infrastructure. They're going to go right to smart infrastructure and they've got the money to pay for these things. And so, there are a number of sizeable opportunities there that we are very confident about. That's not to say that North America and Europe are great opportunities as well, especially with the AIA platform. We're seeing a lot of uptake there. That's where Pure already had a strong base as well as these other small start-ups that we brought into the fold, and we're bringing them channels to market that they didn't have before. So, I want to hold sort of talking about specifically size of deals just from a competitive standpoint and, again, we'll have more to share on that as we secure a couple of these and convert from pilot to larger project.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our strong 2017 results and our outlook for 2018. As 2017 unfolded we continue to strengthen our execution, which helped us accelerate our growth momentum throughout the second half of the year. We delivered on all of our financial commitments to the year and are on track to meet our long-term objectives. In both the fourth quarter and full-year we delivered solid top line growth in the U.S., Europe and Emerging Markets and across each of our key end markets. We made solid progress in each of our businesses with a number of standout achievements including successful new product launches, strategic project wins and the continued deployment of capital, all of which will drive our long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. Yesterday, we closed on our acquisition of Pure Technologies and we couldn't be more excited about the prospects that we see ahead. We also acquired a small company called Emnet, which operates in the water infrastructure analytics base as well. I'll come back to this in a few minutes. We have a lot to cover today so I'm going to hit a few highlights and then turn it over to Mark to walk through the numbers. In addition to our broad based revenue growth we also continue to drive increases in orders and backlog. Orders grew 10% in the fourth quarter up sequentially from the 6% growth we delivered in the third quarter, this catch-ups very well going into 2018. It is worth noting that a sizeable portion of these orders is for longer lead time projects and won't translate into revenue until 2019. We also delivered solid and broad based growth across our key end markets. Our performance in public utilities particularly stood out with 10% growth in the quarter. We saw strong results in nearly every geography and across all applications with our Sensus business delivering 15% growth versus the prior year period. Another notable result was in our residential business. While it is a relatively smaller part of our overall business, it's worth calling out the double-digit growth achieved in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We'll discuss the outlook for this and our other end markets later in the call. While we continue to enhance our execution in the marketplace, we also continue to execute our productivity for growth strategy. The team delivered another year of record results, about a $150 million in continues improvement savings, a 10% increase over last year's performance. A portion of these savings are being reinvested in the business by way of R&D, innovation and commercial initiatives to drive growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 18.7%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. This reflects a strong operational performance I just discussed as well as the Sensus contribution. Our operating margin for the full year was 13.4% up 30 basis points excluding the impact of acquisitions. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, an increase of 18% year-over-year. We also had another year of strong cash generation with free cash flow up 41% over the prior year. This is an area where historically we have underperformed so I'm quite pleased with the progress we've made and our outlook for sustaining this performance. Free cash flow conversion was 147% for the year, so all-in-all, a year of strong results. I want to recognize and thank our teams throughout the company who stayed focused on the task at hand while also keeping an eye on the opportunities ahead of us and laying the foundation for our long-term success. None of this happens without their commitment and execution and I'm very proud of what we've achieved together. Now, let me shift gears to spend a few minutes on the progress we continue to make on the strategic priorities. These are the highest order imperatives that will enable us to meet our long-term financial commitments and set the company on a path of sustainable growth and expansion for many years to come. The priority of accelerating profitable growth encompasses our initiatives to drive commercial excellence, grow in emerging markets and strengthen innovation and technology. The moves we made in 2017 to bring together our various U.S. commercial teams and re-orient our sales and marketing focus around vertical end markets is helping to increase our bidding pipeline leading to strong top line results. Specifically in emerging markets, we delivered 6% revenue and 15% orders growth for the year and momentum in our key markets of China, India and Middle East is building. Accelerating innovation is a core element of our long-term growth strategy. The creation of new Centers of Excellence, a streamline approach to product development and smart acquisitions have fuelled our new product pipeline leading to a 500 basis points increase to 24% in our vitality index over the previous year. As I already mentioned, our continuous improvement program continues to generate impactful results. This is an area where we will continue to develop, creating new opportunities to unlock savings by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies. These efforts not only show margin expansion, but they are funding investments that are vital to our long-term growth and improving our speed to market. Underpinning these efforts, are the programs we are expanding to further deepen our talent pool. The additional capabilities we brought into Xylem through acquisitions have also accelerated this work. As I had outlined in my first Investor Day back in 2015, we will continue to put capital to work in smart disciplined ways to develop and acquire the solutions we need to best address our customer's challenges. Our acquisitions to date, fits squarely into our Smart Water Technology strategy. Finally, we continue to return capital to shareholders, today announcing a 17% increase in the dividend. Now let's turn to the next slide to talk about Pure Technologies and the role this new addition will play in our long-term growth plans. As I mentioned, we closed on the Pure transaction yesterday and our team has been working on the integration planning for the past month. So we are ready to get started. Pure which until yesterday was a publicly traded company finished 2017 with strong results. In the fourth quarter and the full-year they delivered revenue growth of 15% and 11%, respectively. They also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA at 25% in the quarter and 18% for the full-year. This is a fantastic business that will expand our opportunities, fuel our growth and accelerate value creation for our shareholders. Pure would be the foundation of a broad platform we're building, bringing together a portfolio of analytics capabilities and technologies that will address our utility customers' infrastructure [pain points] and significantly improve the economics of their operations. Challenges such as non-revenue water and aging infrastructure cannot be effectively address with a one size fits all approach, particularly as you move around the globe. Customers need a partner who can effectively assess and understand their unique challenges and then bring together the right solutions to address them in a way that adds value to their operations. Collectively our advanced infrastructure analytics capabilities will increasingly position Xylem as that vital partner and solutions provider, in addition to being a supplier of unmatched products and services. Joining Pure in this group will be our Visenti and HYPACK businesses as well as a smaller acquisition we've recently completed of a company called Emnet and we will continue to fill in other gaps as needed. Emnet which is based in South [Canadiana] provides network modeling and optimizations solutions that enable municipalities to manage the urban water cycle and wastewater and storm water systems. This is a pivotal addition to Xylem as it significantly increases our ability to help customers' manage their wastewater network and storm water systems areas of growing concern. Both Pure and Emnet are excellent examples of M&A serving as a proxy for R&D that will help accelerate our progress. This advanced infrastructure analytics business will be lead by Al Cho, our former Head of Global Strategy who also led the acquisition team for most of these businesses. It will be part of our Measurement and Control Solutions segment under Colin Sabel's leadership, but it will be an enterprise operation, partnering and collaborating with all of our commercial teams and business units around the world. We are very excited to bring together these capabilities to tap new opportunities. We will leverage the deep knowledge each team has along with our trusted customer relationships and global scale to accelerate the growth of our business. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide 6. Patrick's already covered some of the highlights of our 2017 results, so I'll quickly touch on a few of the details. I'm very pleased with the team's performance this year particularly our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to deliver at the high end of our revenue guidance for the year, with 3% organic growth and 4% on a pro forma organic basis. This reflects strength across all of our end markets and solid growth in each of our businesses. Geographically, we saw the largest increase in the emerging markets up 6% with the U.S. and Western Europe up 3% and 1%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 18.7% which largely reflects continued traction from our productivity initiatives as we realized $148 million in savings, an increase of 10% year-over-year as well as the benefit of volume leverage. Partially offsetting these improvements are inflation, higher investments for growth and unfavorable mix driven by emerging markets' project revenues. Operating margin for the year was 13.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year excluding the purchase accounting impact from Sensus. Earnings per share this year of $2.40 increase 18%, a clear indication that we're on the right path to deliver financial returns in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day last April. Another important indicator and one that I'm fond off, is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $544 million of free cash flow an increase of 41% year-over-year. We also delivered 147% cash conversion which is well above our target of 110%. An important driver of our cash flow performance is the progress and focus from our teams globally on improving our working capital levels. We reduced working capital to 18.5% of sales which is a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. I'm proud of the work of our teams, however, there is further room for improvement and we have good confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goal of reducing working capital to the mid teens. Please turn to slide 7 and I'll take you through our fourth quarter performance. We recorded orders of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10% organically year-over-year with good growth across all three segments. Revenues were up 17% in the fourth quarter, organic growth was 7%, acquisitions contributed 6% and we benefited 4% from foreign exchange. From an end market perspective, public utilities were up 10% organically. While we had an easier comparison to the flat performance in the prior year period as Patrick mentioned, this growth reflects strength across nearly all regions in applications globally driven by continued momentum in our markets and some share gains. Industrial was up 3% including mid single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe as we continue to see recovery in those markets. Rounding out our performance we saw a continued strength in residential and commercial markets up 15% and 4%, respectively. I'll touch on these markets in more detail in the Applied Water segment discussion in just a few minutes. Regionally, the U.S. market drove most of the organic increase for the quarter and was up 9%. Emerging markets and Western Europe were up 6% and 3%, respectively. EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter to 20.2%. This margin expansion was primarily driven by ongoing savings from our productivity programs and volume leverage. This was partially offset by inflation, unfavorable revenue mix and higher investments for growth. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, which is up 10 basis points versus the prior year excluding purchase accounting and amortization. Overall, I'm encouraged by the continued momentum in our markets and the strong execution by our teams in delivering fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.76, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Please turn to slide 8, and I'll provide additional details on our segments. I'm just going to address our fourth quarter's segment results but the details of our full-year segment performance are included. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $566 million in the quarter up 11% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by wastewater transport orders which increased more than 20% reflecting strong demand across all regions. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $610 million up approximately 17% organically over the prior year period and providing us with confidence in delivering our first quarter revenue outlook. It's also worth noting that a higher percentage of our backlog entering 2018 is shippable beyond one year due to several large project wins during the quarter. Water Infrastructure revenue of $583 million in the quarter represents a 6% year-over-year increase on an organic basis, with foreign exchange providing a $21 million headwind. In the U.S., segment revenues were up 8% overall driven by strength in wastewater transport market and double-digit growth in our dewatering business, which has benefitted from the continued recovery in the industrial energy and commodities sectors. These businesses were also strong in Canada where we posted 22% growth. Emerging markets revenue increased 5% with mid-single digit growth in all regions. On a particular note with the demand in China and the Middle East for wastewater transport pumps as well as 60% growth in India for more custom pump projects. Western Europe was up 3% overall primarily driven by treatment project deliveries in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Operating margin for the segment decreased 70 basis points to 18.4%. Benefits from cost reduction and volume leverage were more than offset by higher inflation, foreign exchange transactional losses and higher year-over-year strategic investments to accelerate growth in product localization in key emerging market countries. Please turn to slide 9. Applied Water booked orders of $373 million in the quarter, which was up 6% organically over the prior year period. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. Overall we exited the quarter with backlog of approximately $200 million up 20% organically compared to last year. Our shippable backlogs for the first quarter of 2018, increased 13% on an organic basis. This provides us with good confidence in our first quarter revenue outlook but it's important to remember this is a very short cycle business and backlog represents less than a third of our expected first quarter revenues. Revenue was $373 million or 5% organically versus the prior year quarter. In Europe revenue increased to 7% driven by a double-digit growth in both industrial and residential applications. Our investments in new products and sales capabilities have enabled us to take modest share in these markets. In the U.S., segment revenue was up 6% year-over-year, this was primarily driven by the segment's commercial business which benefited from cold weather in the Northeast driving recycling of heating and circulator pumps. The industrial vertical was also strong in the quarter as the general industrial and oil and gas markets continued their recoveries. Finally, emerging markets revenue grew 4% reflecting strong growth in China and other Asia Pacific countries from demand for secondary clean water sources. We had double-digit growth in the Middle East from large project volumes and some modest market share gains as we continue to benefit from the investments we've made to localize our supply chain. This growth was partially offset by weakness in the commercial business in Asia Pacific as well as softness in Latin America. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 150 basis points to 17.2% year-over-year, the highest for any quarter for the Applied Water segment. Margin expansion was driven by 340 basis points of productivity savings as well as volume leverage. This was partially offset by 190 basis points of cost inflation and 70 basis points of growth investments. Now, let's turn to slide 10. Measurement and Control Solutions booked orders of $331 million in the quarter which was up 12% organically over the prior year period. Revenues for the quarter, was $321 million up 10% on a pro-forma organic basis over the prior year period. This includes 15% pro forma organic growth in our Sensus business and 1% growth in our analytics business. For Sensus, revenue in our water business increased 11% year-over-year in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we lapped the challenging comparisons to the prior year from the restocking of our [IPro] water meters. And we also delivered higher growth from AMI deployments in North America as well as increased demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Our gas business was up 35% mostly from the growth in large AMI project deployments in North America during the quarter. Electric was down modestly in the quarter, due to the timing of large project deployments. We continue to see high demand for our solutions in this sector and in fact during the quarter we shipped our 1 millionth Stratus meter, a pretty impressive accomplishment for having been launched only a year ago. Finally, the team delivered a 45% increase in revenues in our Software and Services business which was largely driven by a couple of major contract upgrades. Shifting to our Analytics business, it delivered 1% growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in emerging markets from strong demand in China and India for surface water monitoring applications was largely offset by a softness in Europe. Now moving to segment margins; adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 19.9%. The increase was primarily due to 290 basis points from productivity savings as well as benefits from volume leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and higher investments for new product development and revenue synergy programs. In the quarter adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 130 basis points from 9.3% to 10.6% and was up 190 basis points excluding the impact of purchase account. Now, please turn to slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $414 million. Free cash flow in the quarter increased 58% from the prior year to $261 million, and was driven largely by significant improvements in working capital across all of our businesses, as well as strong operating performance in Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 147% for the year, the highest in our history as a public company. We invested $51 million for capital expenditures in the quarter and returned $33 million to our shareholders through dividends. We also repaid $98 million of debt which was the remainder of our outstanding short-term borrowings. We closed the year with debt at 3 times to EBITDA which is below our original forecast for the year and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. Now, please turn to slide 12 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2018 outlook.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. As we discussed we entered 2018 with solid momentum. We are confident that this momentum and the initiatives we continue to invest in are advancing us to our long-term growth in earnings targets. At the top line we expect to deliver full-year revenue of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion reflecting organic growth rate of 4% to 6%. Pure will add approximately 2% to our reported 2018 revenue. Our continuous improvement initiatives will continue to generate savings which we expect to total about a $160 million in cost savings to the full-year. This is a 10% year-over-year increase and will keep us well on pace to meet our long-term target. Our adjusted operating margin is forecasted to expand 60 basis points to 100 basis points to between 14% to 14.4%, this excludes about 20 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by 70 basis points to 100 basis points which should bring that to a range of 19.4% to 19.7%. At the bottom line we expect to generate adjusted full-year earnings per share in the range of $2.82 to $2.97, this excludes integration, restructuring and realignment costs of about $35 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 18% to 24% for the year. Finally, as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations. This will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 115% in 2018. This contemplates anticipated capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million. Now, please turn to slide 13 and I'll walk you through our end-market assumptions. Public utility constitutes about 47% of our revenue. We are entering 2018 with solid momentum in this end market and we continue to see indicators of sustain growth particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For 2018, we expect revenue in public utilities to grow in the mid-single-digit range overall. The smart meter market is projected to generate slightly higher growth in the high-single digit range. Industrial end market revenues represent about 36% of revenue. Here we continue to see a mixed environment. The light industrial markets specifically in the U.S. and Europe are solid and we see the oil and gas and mining sectors continuing to improve. That will be balanced by mixed conditions across the emerging markets where strength in China and India which are benefiting from increased government investments will be somewhat offset by softness in parts of Latin America. As a result, we projected industrial to be up low to mid single-digits. Moving to the commercial end market, which makes us about 12% of our revenue, we expect 2018 organic growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Here we see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation in Europe which is coming off of more than two years of strong growth. We expect to see some strength in the emerging markets where the Smart Cities initiative in India and solid growth in China continues to drive demand. We also anticipate greater success in winning larger projects in the Middle East now that we are able to produce products locally. Finally in residential, about 5% of our revenue, we anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the mid single-digit range coming off of particularly strong growth in 2017. We expect the competitive dynamics to continue in the U.S. where demand tends to be replacement driven. We do anticipate a continuation of a solid demand we've been seeing in China and other Asia Pacific countries as residents seek a secondary clean water source. Now please turn to slide 14, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
Mark Rajkowski: As we've done in prior years, we're providing a seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2018 planning assumptions. As Patrick just discussed, we're guiding to 4% to 6% organic growth for the company in 2018. This breaks down by segment as follows; 4% to 6% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in Applied Water and 7% to 8% growth in Measurement and Control Solutions. We're assuming an FX euro rate of 1.21 which was the average rate for January through the end of last week. For your reference, we've included our FX sensitivity table in the Appendix. We're also updating our estimated tax rate to reflect our current view following the passage of the new tax law in December. Overall, tax reform will be modestly beneficial to our business, lowering our long-term structural tax rate from 22% to 20%. Also, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $45 million non-cash charge in connection with the new tax law, which reflects the cost of repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the benefit from re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the new rate. We estimate that the cash taxes to be paid related to repatriation will be approximately $60 million. [Probably] over the years, and this will partially offset the benefit of lower cash taxes payable in the U.S. due to the rate reduction. Now, moving to our first quarter planning assumptions; we expect growth in the range of 5% to 6% as we lap a relatively weak first quarter in the prior year and benefit from the strong backlog position exiting the year. We expect our first quarter adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 11.3% to 11.5%, this reflects a 110 basis points to 140 basis points of margin expansion excluding the dilution in share purchase accounting amortization. Also, the first quarter is Pure's seasonally lowest revenue period and is expected to result in a penny of EPS dilution. With that, I'll turn the call back over Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a strong year for Xylem. We delivered on our financial commitments and made significant progress on each of our strategic priorities. Our teams are executing well and that is manifesting in stronger results in both the top and bottom line. I'm very pleased with the momentum that we've been building across the business. With a growing portfolio of smart solutions, we are forging deeper customer relationships, becoming a value partner and not just a supplier. We are in a very strong financial position fueled by excellent cash generation. This will enable us to continue to deploy capital in smart ways. We understand what our customers' challenges are and where we can create the most value in their operations and for Xylem. That's where we will continue to focus our innovation and M&A activities. We look forward to continuing this progress in 2018 further strengthening our performance and advancing on our 2020 objectives. Now operator we can open up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: One of the things I noticed from the slide deck here is that the level of investments in the fourth quarter, are higher than they were to the whole year. Can you talk about what the incremental level of investments is -- increases in 2018? What kinds of things that you are investing in, where you are in the development process to those kinds of things? I know this transferring Sensus technology to the legacy portfolio and that kind of stuff. Can you just give us an update on what these investments are, where they are going, what kind of level we should think of as a sustained level of the investment in the businesses here?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So Nate I'll -- maybe I'll talk directionally as to where we are investing and so forth and timing of that and then I'll let Mark speak specifically to the rate of investments that we saw in Q4 and what we expect for '18. I think directionally what we're seeing here is we've made good progress. The teams have identified specific areas of investments to drive the synergies with respect to leveraging the Sensus technology and those new offerings to market. Two, we've seen opportunities to increase our investments in emerging markets and accelerate those growth investments as we focus on localization. And I would also say that we have made some good investments in building out some of our marketing capabilities as well, especially around our vertical marketing efforts. So those are a few examples. Obviously as we turn to 2018 we are not planning -- I mean if you look at our long-term targets we put out last April at Investor Day we are not looking at any kind of increases in investment levels above what we laid out there. A lot of this is timing within any given quarter depending upon how we thought about the performance to the business. But Mark you want to comment on specifically [dollars].
Mark Rajkowski: And I think Nate one of -- if you just look at the year-over-year one of the things you have to keep in mind is in 2016 we had fairly heavy investment in building out some of the capabilities in the Middle East and so that to some extent depressed if you will that year-over-year comparison. So we did ramp-up a little bit more in the back half of the year and some of that is just a function of being clearer in terms of what and where we need to spend money relative to building out our systems intelligence, centers of excellence. We are building out capability in emerging markets as well to take advantage of what we believe will be continued very strong growth rates in 2018 and beyond. So, some of it is just the timing of what we've spent in 2016 and how that ramped up and really just some of the time it's taken us to really make sure that as we do ramp up our spending we know what we're -- what and where we should be spending at.
Patrick Decker: To close out on that one, Nate, I wouldn't read anything into the kind of spike there in investment levels in Q4 as to any change and view on our investment strategy or our margin targets of the company. It's simply timing from anyone quarter or year to the next.
Nathan Jones: Okay. That's fair. And then I know -- I mean everybody fascinated with the opportunities for marrying the Sensus technologies together with the legacy portfolio. I know you've been doing some development and some pilot testing of that. Can you talk about where you are in that process? When we should start to see those things coming to market and what the commercial opportunities are?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so as I've said before we've got pilots going in a number of locations around the world, the customers that obviously will remain nameless here for competitive reasons. But -- and we really are looking at capabilities or opportunities to leverage the Sensus technology from a comps perspective and a data analytics perspective and to the wastewater sector of the market. We talked about energy efficiency along the wastewater network as well as now we have the opportunity also to marry our capabilities within Sensus on the AMI deployment piece along with what we already have in the Visenti with Pure and Emnet to build out an even stronger offering there, not just in non-revenue water, but also as we go after one of the big [pain] wins at our utility customers space and city space and that is combined to overflows. The whole storm water overflow challenge is a big issue. So, now we see an opportunity to even augment some of the pilots that we're already doing by bringing in these other capabilities. So, I think you should expect to begin, to hear about some of those wins here, I'd say in the early middle part of 2018 and that really begins to ramp at least in terms of project wins later this year into 2019. Those projects and they are not turn to revenue in 2018, but they are a longer lead time, but I would certainly be expecting to be announcing some significant wins there this year.
Nathan Jones: When do you think you'd be kind of at a run-rate kind of level of production of these kind of products?
Patrick Decker: Well, I mean each one of these projects and offerings are going to be unique. There is not a one size fits all, and so I wouldn't look at it -- I don't think the measurement is going to be so much, there is going to be a run rate of a product offering or technology offering. I think it's going to be when are we at a point where we got a steady stream of contract wins and revenues coming through on that. And I would say certainly late this year is the expectation. Doesn't mean we are not going to get any before then. But I think in terms of being able to say we're there now and we actually have an established offering that we're able to use reference account wins to win other projects [indiscernible]. Best thing about winning big projects is you win more big projects because of the reference and so that's the aim here.
Nathan Jones: Got you. And I'll pass it on. Thank you very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane. 
Deane Dray: Hey, maybe to start with the record free cash flow and I was glad to hear Mark say he was very fond of that metric because I think the investors are too. So, and Patrick you said that a couple of years ago you were underachieving and I'll say you were like below 90% but you made it a priority. And so we're seeing it come through here. So for Mark you touched on the improvements in working capital 18.5 this year, mid-teens is your goal. Talk about the timeframe to get there, incentives for the management team and the sustainability of these levels because that would put you at like the top five of the multi-industry sector in terms of conversion?
Mark Rajkowski: We did make very good progress this year but as we look at the opportunities across our supply chain and inventory some of our processes in terms of the billing and collection of receivables and even in payables there is still good room for opportunity to improve. That mid teens target is certainly something that we think is achievable and out in 2020, but we're looking at making continued progress in 2017, so we would expect if I won't be a 150 basis points but another good chunk of progress. So a lot of work to do we've got opportunities around standardizing payment terms, cleaning up our processes and also in terms of on the commercial front just as we negotiate contracts getting more cash up front.
Patrick Decker: I would say Deane, a couple of things I would add, so you are right that you asked the question about incentives as well. When I made a comment a couple of years back about us underperforming, one of the changes that we made at that point in time was to simplify our annual incentive plan and to broaden the scope population of people that were in that. And one of the three metrics that we have; obviously one is organic revenue growth, the other being our operating expenses income targets. But the third was working capital as a percentage of revenue. And I would say it took -- and it is often times the case it took a good year or so for that to sink in and for the organization to really understand the levers that they could pull to drive that and the impact. And I would say where we've really felt good this year was really in the second half of the year. They are really seeing to be a pivot across the organization in terms of things come together and the part of that was driven by us bringing some talent over from [2015]. Since it's been a terrific job historically because they had a crisis years ago in terms of having to deal with working capital and cash and to transfer those learning's has gone a long way. And I think the new frontier for us beyond what Mark laid out is as we bring more and more of this longer term contract mix into our portfolio on the smart water solutions our customers are usually willing to give you some payment upfront to really finance that. And so I would expect a mix of our revenues to be favorable there in terms of working capital.
Deane Dray: This is all good to hear. And for my follow-up I just wanted to follow-up on Nathan's last question there on these new smart infrastructure platforms. So we've heard all about non-revenue water. We understand how Pure fits in with Visenti and what's been done in Singapore and what the opportunities are. We've heard a bit, you've been cagey Patrick about the water shed opportunities but I've heard from customers. I know which customers are doing the pilot programs the feedback has been very good so we're excited about that. So maybe a bit more on the combined storm overflow, I know it's a pain and coming to this or not I was here in South Bend or excuse me I was in Austin for the big water conference. And I sat in the presentation from the South Bend Municipality and they talked about Emnet. And they gave -- they showed the dashboard, was pretty compelling and now turns now it's part of Xylem. So, take us through what that opportunity is?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so I would and this is a big compliment to the Emnet team that in terms of what you've shared there. And we love the team, we love what we've seen there. I would almost view them as an equivalent of the Visenti of wastewater and storm water overflow. They've got a terrific distributed sensing capability and data analytics capability to really help cities and municipalities both predict and deal with surges around storm water overflow. So, as you are well aware and you would have heard there being heavy rainfall, snow melt, a variety of things cause serious systems overflow and exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant or they run-off and they directly flood rivers and streams and so forth. So, again Emnet provides this predictive analysis capability that helps the -- again the wastewater part of utility better design and prepare for those kind of events. We see that -- as you will know they have a number of these contracts underway across the U.S., but they are really just getting started. South Bend was their origin, these guys [can add another dam] to address that. And we really think that this is a great opportunity for us to leverage our channel to certainly not just here in the U.S., this is an issue that we deal with around the world. And it really is a new market.
Deane Dray: Yeah. Absolutely and it's great seeing you making an acquisition in this space. Just last point, just and related to this, the whole premise of using M&A as a proxy for R&D and it seems like Emnet fits that exactly and just talk about the funnel of whether Emnet type of acquisitions out there?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yes we've -- one of the things we are really excited about here is the opportunity to have I am sure many of you have had a chance to meet and work with before, I really as I said in my prepared remarks they have been instrumental with myself and the team here and Colin and others too really kind of architect what this platform needed to look like based upon our value mapping of our customers a few years back. And so, I would say we already knew going into the acquisition of Pure and Emnet, we had a pretty good idea of what those pain points and our gaps were, so we already at a growing pipeline of things like Emnet and we've got a number of others that are out there that we are quoting right now. I would say that what I'm even we're excited about is, Jack Elliott, the CEO of Pure, has agreed to stay on with me as the Senior Advisor to myself, to Al and to Colin to really help us architect even further, what this broader universe of opportunities can look like as we drive even more of a complicated approach towards the utility. So, while we think we've got a pretty good view on that, obviously the ability to get in there with these customers and further explore what their pain points is really just kind of inform further what that pipeline looks like. So, there is more to come, Deane.
Deane Dray: Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran, Baird.
Michael Halloran: Hi, good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hi, good morning Mike.
Michael Halloran: So, first on the demand side obviously really dynamic orders and good to see the acceleration of orders to be here. The prepared remarks commented on a lot of those orders providing a nice runway through 2018 but more into 2019. So, could you parse out what you're seeing both in terms of cost to [repair] replace the shorter cycle stuff how the momentum carried in the fourth quarter and how you are thinking about that into next year? And then also large projects funnel customer willingness to put capital dollars forward and kind of compare contrast those two dynamics?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, Mike let me take that one and I would say that the order strength was fairly broad based in terms of what we saw in bookings space. There was quite a bit of short cycle business, I mentioned transport was up 20% year-over-year and that's generally shorter cycle. However one of the things that we did see over the past quarter we were very successful in winning a number of larger projects and as a result as we decompose that backlog we had a much higher percentage than normally that will be shippable beyond 2018. So it wasn't there -- I would say it wasn't that we saw a decline in the shorter cycle business, that was still there but what was really encouraging was we are really starting to get traction on some of these larger projects. Treatment as well as industrial and in a number of those certainly our emerging markets countries where we have made investments to be able to be responsive to those types of opportunities.
Patrick Decker: I think that Mike, that if you -- and maybe to tie that back to what we're guiding to for 2018 and kind of what the cadence looks like over the course of the year, bear in mind that certainly Q3 and Q4 were a little bit easier compares to the previous year but they were strong in terms of order and growth overall. As we look at '18, I would say the way it shapes up is kind of 5% to 6% in both Q1 and Q2 and then probably moderates to 4% to 5% in Q3 and Q4 just because you get a little bit tougher compare at that point. But I think what we felt good about with those orders that go out to 2019 as well as the fact that when you look at our bidding pipeline and our treatment business looks, we've always uses a proxy for the health of the bidding market that continued to grow year-over-year. It is up north of $2.6 billion now in terms of bidding pipeline. So all indicators of that we are still well in -- we are still kind of in the early to mid-stages of this cycle of recovery and don't really see any signs there of any softening or weakness.
Michael Halloran: So just summing that up I mean essentially continued short-cycle strength excuse me and momentum on that side while you are building the project backlog at a pace that is better than you seen over the last few years with a still nice pipeline in front of you, that's fair?
Patrick Decker: That's what I said.
Mark Rajkowski: Yes.
Michael Halloran: And then on the margin side obviously really in gross margin in Applied and in the Sensus businesses maybe just talk a little bit about infrastructure. I understand a lot of the puts and takes there particularly on the growth side. So one that I was trying to get a little color on was the really the lack of volume, price mix, other leverage. I'm guessing the volume leverage is still there but maybe the price mix other components were a little less. So maybe what happened in the fourth quarter and just how you think about incrementals in the next year on a core basis there?
Mark Rajkowski: Yes, sure Mike and you are right I mean there was solid volume leverage. Price was flattish, it wasn't a big factor. Where we took a little bit of hit there was I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have some FX transactional losses. We do sell a lot of product out of Europe in US dollars and as we try and hedge as much of that as we can, but when the Euro really moves it has an impact. So, that was one factor. And we just talked a little bit earlier about the great success that we had in some of our emerging markets in terms of those growth rates particularly -- I mean India was up 60%, we had good growth in China and those do carry lower margins and, so that there was a bit of unfavorable mix as well. As we look forward, we expect continued margin expansion in that segment and would expect the drops on revenue growth to be more in line with what you typically see in that 25% to 30% drop.
Michael Halloran: Great. Thanks for the answers, Appreciate it.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros, Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros: Hi, good morning everyone.
Patrick Decker: Hi, good morning.
Jim Giannakouros: When looking at your margin progression goal of I think it's 17% to 18% by 2020. Does that adjust for acquisitions and just a clarification question out of the way?
Mark Rajkowski: It's reflective of the amortization that comes with Sensus but I think the important point here Jim is that we do have good confidence in getting to that 17% to 18% target. We're going to continue to generate solid volume growth. Productivity savings are going to be -- we continue to deliver strong productivity savings. In fact we've got significant opportunities around our back office that we're ramping up this year and will really be a big lift in 2019 and 2020. We really haven't seen any of the benefit from some of the volume leverage and revenue synergies that we'll certainly expect to be getting with Sensus. And so, we've got very good confidence in terms of our ability to deliver that 17% to 18% by 2020.
Jim Giannakouros: Got it. And since you touched on that Sensus legacy down revenue synergy opportunities that $150 million to $200 million or so, are you tracking on plan there? Or you I'm sorry if I misunderstood you anticipating revenues there?
Patrick Decker: No Jim I think that's right, I mean I think what I believe to earlier was I think the good indicator for us this year is we're definitely going to have revenue synergies that comes from Sensus, while revenue synergies that are coming also from the Pure transaction and the new platform we are building here. But I mean the real strong indicator is going to be what are some of the big project wins and order momentum that we have that we can talk to later this year and as we exit 2018 going into 2019. So not aware -- not counting on the revenue there, but that's not really reflected in guide for this year. I'm really focused more on what the order rate, momentum and the contract wins are as we get later in the year.
Jim Giannakouros: Understood. And one follow on if I may residential exposure within the Applied Water is subject to specific regional influences if I recall, but you're -- in your slide and Patrick you reiterated that you are calling for mid-single digit [growth] of 12% comp in '17 that's stellar can you frame that for us a bit more granularly? Appreciate thanks.
Patrick Decker: Yes, so I'll certainly give you my thoughts on that. I mean if you look at what happened in certainly 2017 and the fourth quarter, we had a lot of strength in China and across Asia Pac. We also had some share gains in Europe in some of the new products that we rolled out there. I would say growth in the U.S. is flattish in the fourth quarter but it was strong for the full-year. What happened I think to the full-year was you get that Asia Pac, Europe growth that's being driven there by domestic expansion, but it was also we've had some disruption as you all know in the competitive dynamic here in the U.S. in terms of one of our competitors buying our distributor and that created some disruption in the marketplace that our teams were successful in taking advantage of quite frankly and that got us nice path for 2017. We do see all that moderating as we go into 2018 but we expect here to be at least solid market growth in '18, I wouldn't be calling share gains in '18 it really is more of the market growth here predominantly in the U.S. and Europe.
Operator: Our next question will from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Well just to start on the Sensus side, obviously things are well ahead of the growth rates that you have underpinning 2020. I wondered if and Patrick you just commented on the big piloting revenues are still ahead of you. But we've talked about I think you mentioned something of $100 million of revenue synergies would be almost a disappointment if you didn't get there. Are you seeing any of that right now?
Patrick Decker: In terms of the actual revenue synergy or in terms of conference and our outlook?
Joseph Giordano: Well, I guess both. I mean the growth rates here of 15% you are starting to see is that something that would have happened without the Xylem portfolio behind it? Is that just a -- how much of this is the stuff that you sure were able to in partnering to the company?
Patrick Decker: I would say there is nothing that has been achieved to date that we would explicitly call out as Xylem driven synergies. Now have there been cases where there is perhaps a bit of a halo effect in terms of winning some contracts and bids, perhaps, but the things that we call as a revenue synergy are going to be very explicit in terms of bigger deals that the team either wasn't even looking at before or were but didn't have the relationship and then some of these new offerings to the market that we've talked about earlier with Dan in terms of leveraging the Sensus technology across the portfolio. Those areas we continue to remain very confident. We get a regular tracking here each month from the team in terms of what those look like where they stand and those are not reflected in the Sensus growth rate to date nor are they reflected in the guide that we've given you for 2018.
Joseph Giordano: And then when I think about that market that new re-market in general obviously a huge fall off in terms of market share after you get through the first few major players there, big transaction in the space of [Indiscernible] and I just wonder did you see any of these like smaller players as complementary to your business from a technology standpoint is there an opportunity there to kind of consolidate a little bit of that industry?
Patrick Decker: I would say as I look at that sector right now I wouldn't -- as I look at it today things can obviously change. I wouldn't say that consolidation of the metering sector is a high priority for us. I think that the moves that have happen here, I think are good for the metering sector, I think it's a healthy move in terms of that consolidation. There are a lot of players in the space, but certainly when we look at our core offerings and what we're focused on, we don't see it really having a meaningful impact, if anything its net positive for us. But again I wouldn't see us being a major consolidator in the metering space as I look at it today in terms of what our overall priorities are for growth.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. And then Mark, you kind of talked about this a little bit earlier following this on just some of that but, when we think about the margin guidance for 2020, 17% to 18% maybe exiting 2018 at a lower levels than we thought part of that given the deals and things that you've done. Have the buckets that get you to that level changed somewhat? I mean revenues probably coming in a little harder than we thought and margins while exiting 2018 a little bit lower. So, how do you closing that gap with 17%?
Mark Rajkowski: I don't think the buckets have changed materially in any respect. So, I think there is a -- we are growing a little bit higher than we thought in 2017, some of that was stronger growth in our treatment business and in emerging markets which have a little bit more lower margin profile. But, the biggest driver productivity savings is right where we expected it to be and we expect that to continue as we outlined back in April at our Investor Day. The level of investments is relatively in line with what we expected, the timing might be a little bit off just in terms of the year-over-year compare, but relative to what we're -- the quantum about the spend is in line. And so -- there is -- it's very much what we expected and there is really nothing that we see looking at ahead that would give us reason to believe that those buckets in terms of what's driving the margin expansion are shifting.
Joseph Giordano: Great. And Patrick maybe if you could just comment on like your appetite for large scale M&A in this environment where multiples keep lining. So, and I'm going to leave it there. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so look we're going to continue to be strategic and our focus around M&A. Obviously, everything we do from an M&A standpoint really needs to tie into what our overall growth strategy is, not just for the sake of going and getting bigger or doing something. And so, I take us back to what I laid out at Investor Day last year in terms of the three focus areas; one being obviously building out the kind of smart infrastructure component. Two, was looking at the opportunities over time do expand our presence in the industrial part of the water sector. And then the third was where necessary obviously we would defend our core franchises here in terms of any consolidation necessary there. In terms of capacity, we certainly have the financial capacity to be able to do this. We have the management capacity to do things of larger scale. But right now we really are just focusing in on integrating what we've got here, building out even new capabilities and really kind of again in my view hopefully establishing a first mover advantage in some of these spaces. So, that's where our focus and attention is right now, at this point in time Joe. Again, we'll continue to look at things in this space as need to and as they come along, but nothing specific that we're looking at right now of size and scale.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research.
John Walsh: So thinking about the margin bridge for 2018 you've obviously covered a lot of ground. I mean cost inflation headwinds have kind of been pretty steady here through '17. Just wanted to get you view as we think about '18 there in terms of cost inflation and what are kind of the biggest pain points in that line either around people, inflation and/or commodities?
Mark Rajkowski: Once again we are expecting the biggest driver of margin expansion will be the benefits from our productivity programs. That will be in that 300 basis point plus range. We do expect to see some nice volume drop. I mean with higher growth rates we will see a margin expansion from volume leverage. Some of that would be a little bit of unfavorable mix as we continue to grow our or see our size growth in emerging markets. Inflation we're seeing it tick up a little bit. Our expectations for the full-year is roughly 200 basis points of headwind. A lot of that is just it's a labor cost benefit cost. There is certainly a tick up we are seeing in some of the commodities but it's not rapid. I mean aluminum, steel, copper, but they are not huge components of our product build and we will continue to invest in -- at rates that are clearly consistent with where we've been in over this past year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Not to beat a dead horse here, but I think you guys had targeted if I recall $40 million in revenue synergies with Sensus in 2018. Is that target officially shifting out some here? I just want to clarify, because it sounds like it's not part of the 7% to 8% of your Measurement and Control Solutions? And then I guess if it is pushing out maybe the reasons as to why that might be the case?
Patrick Decker: No, I wouldn't say it's shifting per se. I mean in my view it just we've -- these things take some time. We are talking I'm thinking more run rate to this point in time in terms of contract wins. Look we are going to get some revenue synergy here in 2018. We will be clear on mapping out what that is, but we're still I would say not in the early stages but we are still in the stages of pilots on a number of these areas. And that the pilots and these large deal efforts that we are going after -- I talked to you before about the dozen or more large international deals that we were pursuing those things shift around. They take time. There is a lot of investment upfront that we have to do in those areas in terms of time and resource. So, look I hope that leads at much if not more comes through this year. But we didn't feel it prudent necessarily to explicitly build that into our guide for the year.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. And then one quick one from me and I'll pass it on. And I might have missed this but, Mark I noticed that Canada was, it was highlighted as an area of strength in the Water Infrastructure segment. Can you give some context as to what drove that? How much exposure you have there and if that's the trend line that sustains into the New Year? Thanks.
Mark Rajkowski: Sure. Yeah. It's really a function of strong recovery in oil and gas and mining. Commodities are -- really picked up in that country over this past year and we saw the benefit of that. It's around a $150 million of revenue, so it's relatively sizable but not one of our largest geographies but it was -- it's good to see it bounce back there this year.
Brian Lee: And just any quick [falls] there on the trend line from these levels?
Mark Rajkowski: Well, listen with that kind of growth it's going to be tougher compare. The good news is that the -- those markets continue to remain stable and we'd expect low to mid single-digit growth in 2018, just a very tough compare when you're in the 20s, this year.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. I mean I'll just add that I think that what we saw in Canada this past year really was a recovery and catching up of things that have been differed and delayed because Canada has been on its back for the last couple of years, in recent times we saw our business going down year-over-year. So, we saw some of that recovery, but it really will be kind of low single-digit expected as that market kind of normalizes to typical spend. It's largely driven by again the public utility piece and then a little bit less in our new watering business.
Brian Lee: That's very helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our final question -- our final question will come from the line of Scott Graham, BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Well done.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham: So, I have two questions for you. I suspect you not enter 2017 with the level of inflation that we've seen as we exit 2017. So, I guess what I'm assuming here is that the cost reductions which have been extraordinary are maybe been a little accelerating. You've made some comments about there being off planning. It looks like a little above plan, but even still do you think that there is some stress on the organization Patrick because the price cost with you guys is negative by nature of the business and are the cost reductions maybe providing excess stress in certain areas?
Patrick Decker: Well, I think the short answer is no, I never want to understate the challenge you have in terms of the change management in any organization when you're driving a number of initiatives and cost take out and efficiency and so forth. But, what I'd say has really I think helped mitigate that's stress and anxiety is a couple of things. One, boy is it a whole lot of easier to do that when you are at least in a growth market and people can feel growth going on around them. It was tougher when there was not as much growth that's one. That's certainly helps with the sales team in terms of their motivation and inspiration. But I think it's also being clear and transparent with the organization as to what our priorities are. And that our cost efforts aren't just across the board go after a 1,000 things at one time. We got programs around global business services implementation. There is a lot of change management going on around that in communication. Two, I think it's important to recognize that a big chunk of our cost savings are coming out of the procurement and the deployment of Lean and Six Sigma. So these are basic purchase capabilities and skills that we're teaching the organization, how to fish in these areas as opposed to being always with a block object and I think when you are giving people those skills and capabilities that makes it easier because they feel empowered to go drive change and make things more efficient. And our CI efforts continuous improvement is not just focused on the cost takeout. It's about making it easier for our customers to do business with us and be faster to market and that always makes an organization feel better. So I don't want to come across as too much [indiscernible] because it's just easy because it's not this is hard work, it's heavy lifting. I would say if it was that easy it would have already been done. So I recognize that level of stress but no I feel that the organization is very healthy and healthier than it's ever been in my view but it's something you are right Scott that I pay a lot of the attention to and that's why I spent so much time down on the road with our teams in hearing how things are going.
R. Scott Graham: My follow-up question is one of the things that you indicate in your year ago Analyst Meeting was the desire to push up new product sales and development I think it was by that about a 150 basis points over a several year period. You also you personally championed the whole we need to get better in commercialization as well. I guess my questions are on those two metrics where do you think they are impacting the most and where do you -- which areas of the business are maybe lagging in those areas?
Patrick Decker: Yes, so I think the -- I would say that two dynamics or two [things] that are one on the driving kind of commercial leadership and the commercial excellence. Really in my view the whole purpose of me putting it out there was one of our top priorities was to move our organization away from where many industrial companies are and that is spending way too much time focusing on inside the four walls of the company and being an administrative company as opposed to a commercially driven company that is hungry, that understands why you losing order versus why you win one and that the center of gravity is with the sales team and the people that are serving the customer's needs every day. And so putting in things like a net promoter score, mechanism of sales force parameter, so one to measure how customers feel about us, two to measure how our sales teams feel about what we are doing, has I think been a big move forward for us. It shows that we actually care about what's going on and we've got a lot of areas to improve and that's why that to me is all upside in front of us. We do not get score well and high on either one of those. But the good news is people are being very honest with us about where we can do better and that's what we are very much focused on. I would say an area that we can do also a much better job in is broadening our key account management skills and capabilities, and that's an area that we are now investing in as we go forward. I feel good about the progress in R&D and the spending there and the activities but now it's a matter of commercializing those and embedding those new skills on our selling organization as we sell different value prepositions here. And certainly the acquisition of Sensus and Pure, Emnet, Visenti, those are all very different DNA in terms of how they sell value to customers and that's simply been a nice change in dynamics in our commercial organization.
R. Scott Graham: Very good, thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now turn today's conference over to Patrick Decker for closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Well, thank you all for your interest and your questions and hanging on here. And so, again safe travels, I wish you all Happy New Year. I know we're well into it, but I haven't seen all of you until I do, I get to say Happy New Year. And wish you all the very best.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. We had a very good quarter and I'm quite pleased with our team's performance across all of our businesses. Each segment delivered solid revenue growth and robust order growth. We've seen improving conditions in most of our end-markets and we're executing in the marketplace more effectively than ever. We're well on track to deliver on our 2017 commitments, and this broad-based improvement and the momentum we're building give us even more confidence in our long-term growth targets. Before I get into our quarterly results, we've had a number of questions about the hurricanes and their impact. So, let me address that issue first. We were very fortunate in that few of our own colleagues were affected personally in a significant way. From a business perspective, we always position our teams and equipment to ensure we can respond as quickly as possible when disaster strikes. But in this case, it wasn't just our customers who needed help. It was everyone in the path of each storm. One of the great qualities of Xylem is the passion our colleagues have for helping others in need. It's simply part of our mission as a company. With each hurricane, our employees donated their own money to help with relief efforts. And through our Xylem Watermark program, we redirected significant funding and expanded our employee volunteer initiative to assist these communities at a very difficult time. The rebuilding efforts are in the early days and our teams will continue to help. A couple of weeks ago, one team spent several days cleaning out flooded homes and prepping them for reconstruction. And next week, we're sending a group of our colleagues to Puerto Rico to help build water towers in remote areas of the island that still have no access to clean water. These are just a couple of examples, but they illustrate the purpose driven culture we're fostering here at Xylem and I couldn't be prouder of the work they're doing. So, now let me jump in to our results. Our top line grew 5% organically in the third quarter. That includes 5% organic growth from our base Xylem businesses and 5% growth from Sensus. Mark will provide the details, but I do want to note that we delivered positive organic growth in each of our end markets and in each of our major geographies. In addition, we delivered another quarter of robust orders growth, up 6% globally. This, again, reflects broad-based strength across our businesses and our healthy bidding pipeline gives us visibility to continue growth in the quarters ahead. As we've noted previously, treatment orders are a good leading indicator of the longer-term health of the public utility sector and those were up high-single digits in the quarter. We saw particular strength in North America and Europe. Speaking of public utilities, we were pleased to see our business in that end market return to growth this quarter despite a challenging year-over-year comparison with 10% growth last year. There was solid improvement in the U.S. and strong growth in China. This shift in momentum, coupled with our robust orders performance, gives us confidence in the continued health of these markets. The industrial end market also improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. The growth was driven by strong results in our dewatering business, up 9% year-over-year in the quarter. We had notable improvement in the oil and gas sector, which increased approximately 30% overall. This growth was widespread across several geographies. While we're pleased with this turnaround, it's important to keep this in perspective. Oil and gas only constitutes about 2% of our total revenue, though the margin impact is meaningful. While our teams were working hard and delivering results for our customers, they also continue to execute against our continuous improvement and productivity objectives. In the third quarter, we generated another $40 million in cost savings, a double-digit improvement over the prior year and significant step toward meeting our full year target. Our procurement team has done an outstanding job of delivering savings and building further pipeline opportunities, and we're continuing to gain strong traction with our Lean initiatives across the company. Our ongoing commitment to these productivity initiatives will continue to deliver benefits. Our adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased 20 basis points to 19.2%, reflecting continued strong operational performance across our businesses as well as the Sensus contribution. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. So given where we are in the year, we've increased the midpoint of our full year earnings guidance by $0.05. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance now is $2.39 to $2.41. This reflects our expectations for full year operational performance and an updated assumption for foreign exchange impact. Before I turn it over to Mark, I want to share a few thoughts on our progress on our strategic priorities. Across the board, execution in the marketplace has been strengthening, reflecting our focus on driving commercial leadership. I was able to see this first-hand over the past several weeks as I attended a major industry conference and one of our own customer-focused events. The industry event, known as WEFTEC, is the world's largest water quality technical conference and trade show; this year, attracting nearly 25,000 participants. Xylem has a major presence at this show and, over the course of just a few days, we generated nearly 1,000 sales leads and met with hundreds of existing customers. What those customers are most interested in is the innovation that we're bringing to the market. They want to see how we can solve their problems and add real value to their businesses. The centerpiece of WEFTEC this year was the introduction of our latest smart Godwin pump. The launch event alone, brought in an audience of 450 people to our booth, which helped to boost dewatering sales leads by more than 250% year-over-year; so, a very productive event for connecting with customers. Then, just last week, I opened up the Sensus Reach Conference, which is really more like a user conference where customers and distributors come together to learn more about the latest R&D developments, share new applications and practices, and get technical training on our technologies. We had more than 1,000 participants this year, which was a record number, and the feedback was tremendous; another very effective way to forge stronger customer partnerships, while at the same time providing them with an early look at some of our most exciting innovation projects. One of the many topics discussed at Reach was our progress on a few innovation projects that target the synergies we're driving between Sensus and Xylem technologies. As I said when we announced the Sensus acquisition, their R&D capabilities would accelerate our own innovation and technology initiatives, and they certainly have. We're developing new solutions that extend the systems intelligence technologies within Sensus to other products across the Xylem portfolio. We're now in the early stage of rolling out pilots with select customers and I look forward to sharing more about those in the months ahead. We're also making significant progress in accelerating growth in emerging markets. When market conditions turned challenging not long ago, there were a lot of negative voices in the marketplace; but, we kept our eye on the long term and remained committed. As a result, we were well positioned to capture early growth as those conditions improved; and, that can be seen in the sequential improvement in growth we delivered each quarter this year. Our third quarter emerging markets revenue increased 8% year-over-year. Our business in China grew 16% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong demand in the public utility sector. Last month, we held our Board of Directors meeting in China where we were able to provide them with an in-depth look at our business there. This was a great chance for them to learn more about the opportunities in China and provide a very visible sign of support for our investments in that country. India continues to deliver double-digit growth, up 32% this quarter, and its bidding pipeline is growing. And we were very pleased to see our Middle East business return to growth, up nearly 20% for the quarter with double-digit orders growth as well. Finally, I do want to recognize that today is the one-year anniversary of our Sensus acquisition. While we work diligently on the integration process, the business has performed well. They delivered growth in line with our expectations. The team has delivered strong double-digit growth in the Smart Electric business, further underscoring the value that the energy adjacencies bring to Xylem. All-in, I'm happy with our progress in this first year. But I will also point out that we are still in the early stages of realizing the full value of this union and look forward to the journey ahead as we lead the industry into the Smart infrastructure era. So overall, I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We know there continues to be plenty of work ahead in order for us to meet our long-term objectives, but our teams continue to build momentum across our businesses, which has us on track to close out the year strong, meeting our full-year commitments and setting us up for a good start to 2018. With that, I'll turn it over now to Mark for more details in the quarter.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn to slide 5. Overall, revenues were up 33% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter. On a pro forma organic basis, this represents 5% growth with both Sensus and the base Xylem business contributing 5% each. Foreign exchange increased revenues by $18 million or a little more than 1%. In the base Xylem business, the 5% growth reflects strength across all of our end markets. Notably, it marked a return to growth in public utility, where we delivered 4% growth despite lapping a challenging prior year growth rate of 10%. The momentum we saw in the second quarter in our industrial markets continued to build during the third quarter, resulting in 4% growth. We also continue to see strong performance in the commercial and residential end markets, which were up 9% and 5%, respectively. Regionally, the U.S. was up 5% year-over-year with strength across all four end markets. Western Europe performance increased 3% with double-digit growth in commercial and modest growth in public utility. Emerging markets were up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in each of our key regions of China, India and the Middle East. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of large project deliveries in Asia and Eastern Europe. Our Sensus business grew revenues 5% and also delivered more than 10% orders growth in the quarter. Finally, orders for our base Xylem business were also strong, up 6% in the quarter. Moving to operational performance, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points to 19.2% in the quarter. This increase was driven by strong productivity and operating results from our base Xylem business as well as the continued solid performance of Sensus. Adjusted operating margin was 14.1% in the quarter. Excluding the 70 basis points of purchase accounting amortization for the Sensus acquisition, our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Our teams continue to execute well on our productivity programs, delivering $40 million in cost savings during the quarter. This is an increase of 14% from the prior year. The acceleration of our cost savings enabled us to more than offset inflation and continue to fund investments for growth. The strong top line growth in operating performance in our base Xylem business, along with the significant accretion from the Sensus acquisition, enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.65, a 20% increase year-over-year. Now, please turn to slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Beginning with our Water Infrastructure segment, we recorded orders of $558 million, up 5% organically year-over-year. This includes high single-digit growth in treatment and mid-single-digit growth in transport. This performance continues to drive the healthy trajectory that we've seen in these businesses and positions us well for 2018. We exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $622 million, up 10% organically year-over-year. Of this amount, more than $300 million is due to ship in the fourth quarter, an increase of 7% year-over-year on an organic basis. This gives us good confidence in our ability to deliver outlook of mid-single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Water Infrastructure revenue of $520 million represents a 7% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Our results in emerging markets led the way, again, with revenue growth of 16%. We had continued strength in China and India, both growing more than 30% in the quarter, where the markets remain strong, benefiting from government programs and funding. Our Middle East business rebounded this quarter as well, up more than 35% from the prior year as we saw particularly strong performance from our wastewater transport business. In the U.S. and Canada, the segment was up 9% and 26%, respectively, primarily due to double-digit growth in our dewatering business, which saw acceleration in the oil and gas and mining markets. The U.S. grew low-single digits in the public utility end market, driven by strength in the wastewater transport business. It's worth noting that this growth comes on top of a very difficult comparison of 25% growth in the prior year. This further reinforces our view on the overall health of the U.S. public utility market. Western Europe was flat, overall, as strength from treatment project deliveries in Germany was offset by softness in UK and Italy from lower project spending. Operating margins for the segment increased 140 basis points to 18.1% driven by productivity benefits and volume leverage, which more than offset inflation from favorable project mix and investments. Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $374 million in the quarter, up 9% organically. We exited the quarter with backlog of over $200 million, which is up 18% organically compared with last year. Of this amount, more than $120 million is due to ship in the fourth quarter, up roughly 4% on an organic basis. Our order momentum and backlog provides us with confidence in our ability to accelerate our growth to mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Revenue for Applied Water was $354 million, up 2% organically versus the prior year quarter. In Western Europe, revenue increased 7% with growth across all applications, but predominantly within the commercial building sector where we continue to benefit from our recent investments in energy efficient products and our sales teams. In the U.S., revenue was up a modest 1%. This reflects growth across all verticals with the exception of Industrial Water, where we continue to see weakness in irrigation applications due to the wet weather conditions in key agricultural regions of the country. Emerging markets revenue was down 3%, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America. Segment operating margins in the quarter increased 30 basis points year-over-year to 15.8%. The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to cost reductions from global procurement and Lean Six Sigma initiatives, and from restructuring savings. This was partially offset by cost inflation on favorable mix and currency impacts. Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of our Measurement and Control Solutions segment. As you know, during the second quarter, we combined our Xylem Analytics, Sensus and Visenti businesses. We have recently renamed this segment, which is now Measurement and Control Solutions. Revenue for the segment was $321 million, up 5% on a pro forma organic basis over the prior year period. This includes 5% pro forma organic growth in both the Sensus business and in the Xylem Analytics business. For Sensus, revenue in our electric business increased about 60% with growth driven by the deployment of the Alliant project as well as continued strong demand for our new Stratus electric meter. The water business was down about 10% in the quarter. The decline largely reflects the challenging comparison with the prior year period during which the water business grew in the mid-teens as it benefited from restocking of the new iPERL water meter. The business was also impacted by the battery supply issue we discussed last quarter, which pushed out about $4 million of revenue into the fourth quarter. This issue has now been resolved and we expect the water business to grow double-digits in the fourth quarter. We were also very pleased with the growth in our services business, which grew 47% in the quarter, and the continued momentum in orders, which were up more than 10% with strength across all businesses. Shifting to our Analytics business, this business delivered 5% growth in the quarter with continued strong performance in environmental monitoring in North America. Orders in Analytics increased by 4% with broad-based growth across most of our geographic markets. Now, moving to segment operating margins, adjusted operating margin for this segment decreased 80 basis points from 10.5% to 9.7%. The decrease was due to purchase accounting impacts. Excluding this 230 basis point impact, margins for the segment would have been up 150 basis points. Consistent with the second quarter, we have included an additional slide in the appendix that reflects comparable sales and margin performance on a pro forma basis. Given the significant impact that amortization from purchase accounting has on this segment's margins, we've presented this analysis on an EBITDA basis. On a pro forma basis, EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 130 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. The reduction was primarily driven by increased R&D and commercial investments for new product development and to drive revenue synergies. Cost reductions more than offset inflation, and sales mix across both the Sensus and Analytic businesses was slightly negative. Now, let's turn to slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial positions. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $283 million. Free cash flow in the quarter increased more than 50% from the prior year to $186 million, and was driven largely by the addition of Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 170% for the quarter, and this puts us at 101% conversion on a year-to-date basis and on track to deliver greater than 110% free cash flow conversion for the full year. We invested $42 million in capital expenditures in the third quarter and returned $32 million to our shareholders through dividends. We also repaid $150 million of our short-term debt as we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and working capital improved by 220 basis points year-over-year. Now, please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We delivered solid results year-to-date and we're on track to deliver on our financial targets for the full year. The changes in our full-year guidance reflect our expected full-year operational performance, as well as updates to our foreign currency assumptions. At the top line, we now expect to deliver full-year revenue of approximately $4.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, we project organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, which includes organic growth from the base Xylem business of roughly 3% and organic growth of 6% to 7% in our Sensus business. We continue to anticipate generating $130 million in cost savings for the full year, a 10% year-over-year increase; and, as I said previously, we are on pace to meet that target. Our adjusted operating margin is now forecast to grow about 50 basis points, excluding roughly 60 basis points of margin dilution from Sensus purchase accounting. Here, we've narrowed the range of our previous guidance. At the bottom line, we now expect to generate adjusted full-year earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.41, which excludes integration, restructuring and realignment cost of about $50 million. We've increased our projection for those costs from our previous forecast of $40 million as we've accelerated certain activities that we now plan to execute in the fourth quarter. EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Finally, as Mark discussed, we expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This contemplates anticipated capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million. Now, please turn to slide 11 and I'll walk you through our end-market assumptions. Please note that our growth estimates on this slide reflect pro forma organic revenue from 2016 for Xylem and include the impact of Sensus. Our growth rate projections for each end-market remain unchanged from last quarter, so I'll just review these very quickly. Public utility constitutes about 47% of our 2016 revenue. For 2017, we continue to expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range with Sensus delivering 6% to 7% growth and the Xylem base businesses up low single digits. We continue to expect that full-year revenue in our industrial end-market will be up low single digits. And moving to commercial, we project revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range in 2017. In residential, we continue to anticipate full-year revenue growth in the high single-digit range. Now, please turn to slide 12 and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: I'll briefly update you on our guidance for the full year and also highlight some of the key planning assumptions for the fourth quarter. As Patrick mentioned, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year earnings per share guidance range, which is now $2.39 to $2.41. At the midpoint, this reflects a $0.05 increase from our second quarter guidance. The components of this $0.05 increase include the following: An increase of $0.02 to update our euro FX rate assumption from 1.15 to the October average of 1.17; there's a $0.01 increase for better operational performance in the third quarter; and lastly, another $0.02 related to recent orders momentum and the strong backlog that we have as we enter the fourth quarter. Now, I'll highlight a couple of the key assumptions for the fourth quarter. We're anticipating 5% to 6% pro forma organic revenue growth in the quarter. As I mentioned, we're assuming the FX euro rate to average 1.17 in Q4. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 15.4% to 15.7% and our adjusted EPS will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: So thanks, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance this past quarter, particularly the momentum that our teams continue to build. Their execution is strong, which is enabling them to capture more growth in our improving end markets. We're making substantial progress on our strategic priorities. Our focused and disciplined approach has us on track to achieve our near-term objectives while continuing to advance toward our longer-term business goals and growth targets. There is still a significant amount of work to do, but we have tremendously committed and capable teams executing this work. Working together, I have great confidence that we will accomplish our objectives, including further value creation for our shareholders. Now, operator, we can open up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, maybe I can start with a couple of the big growth numbers this quarter, the China and India numbers up 30%. And for China, could you put this growth in context? We've heard reports of the Chinese amending their five-year plan regarding water, specifically and nonrevenue water. Are you beginning to see – are you in discussions where this might be an opportunity for – especially, given your work with Sensus and being able to come with a more integrated strategy towards nonrevenue water?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Deane. This is Patrick. So, I would say we are in the early stages of beginning to do some pilots in those markets, most notably in China. But I would say this order growth and revenue growth that you're seeing really doesn't reflect any of that. We're in the early stages of that. This is tied back, though, to your comment about a broad government mandate around environmental quality and water quality. And we've seen that momentum really building over the course of the last year or so. And, of course, we're also coming off of some easy comps in the second half of last year, but do feel good about the momentum that we're seeing in both of those markets as well as the Middle East.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then, just given this is the one-year anniversary for Sensus and, Patrick, you said in the coming months you'd hear more about some of these new pilot programs. But I was hoping, you can just give us some hints, directionally, as to what types of applications did these pilots address in terms of watershed monitoring, environmental, maybe nonrevenue water? But just directionally, where are these pilot programs focused?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I'll keep my comments a little bit opaque for competitive reasons, as you can appreciate, but certainly, you nailed it in terms of nonrevenue water is clearly a big mandate that's beginning to gain momentum around the world. So, we've got a few things going on in that area. You're absolutely correct in talking about smarter watershed management. There's a lot that goes into that around water quality, but also kind of advanced analytics before the water hits the treatment plant and some value that we can really drive and add there. So, those are a couple of a handful of areas that we're focused on.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Patrick, a couple times in your prepared comments today, you talked about executing better than ever. I'm wondering if you could give us a little more color on the areas that you feel the execution's improving, what areas you're focused on to continue to drive that forward?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Nate. Yeah, I'd say a couple, three areas that come to mind for me. First, is on the commercial side and we're still in the early innings on this. It's a fragmented market; a lot of competitors out there. I think our teams are more aligned than ever. Now, it's always a bit like ducks swimming. I mean, there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes here, but I do feel the momentum there in terms of our commercial teams, whether it be the tools we've given them, the incentives, but I think, also, just it takes time for people to get familiar with the portfolio, and I think that the ability to generate and share leads, we saw that at WEFTEC, as a good example. The unity there at the booth was outstanding. So, that's one area. The second is in the area of R&D, and I think the investments that we've made over the last few years are beginning to pay off. And we're seeing that in the movement of our vitality index, but more importantly, some of the share gains that we've had in a couple of our core markets. So, those are a couple of areas. I mean, certainly, the third would be the whole productivity focus around procurement and Lean deployment. While, again, we're still in the early innings there, that's really what's allowed us to fund these other investments we've made on the front end and in R&D while continuing the margin expansion.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And one last point, Patrick, I also noticed the really good progress the team's making on the Sensus integration work.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Absolutely.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Then, second question here, you've got – in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water, you had 3.2% cost reductions, 4.6% cost reductions. Can you talk about any early read on what kind of numbers we should be expecting for next year? Are you still ramping up cost reductions? Are you starting to plateau on the opportunities there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No. I think that we still have opportunities here, too. We've not plateaued. So, we have opportunities here to continue the margin expansion, absolutely; and, that really is, again, being driven by the various productivity initiatives, but also bear in mind that we are in the early stages of the simplification work that we talked and the rollout of Global Business Services and some other tools or programs that can continue to further the margin expansion.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Listen, Nathan, as you heard us talk about in our Investor Day work, I mean, Tony Milando and his team have plans to continue that momentum in Lean Six Sigma and, certainly, global procurement with new tools and capabilities. And just to reemphasize the last point Patrick made, we're just getting started on our Global Business Services work. So that's all ahead of us.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Maybe I could just rephrase that a little bit. Infrastructure and Applied Water, you put up about 30% incremental margins this quarter. Is that kind of a level we should be expecting you to be able to generate next year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, we – I think as we indicated it at Investor Day, just to reiterate that, that we – historically, we have been generating about 35%-plus in incremental margins on a blended basis; this, again, excluding Sensus. This is the legacy Xylem businesses. And in our long-range targets, we had built in about 30% plus incremental margins. And the only reason for that modest degradation was the mix of business, because we do expect to have higher growth in both treatment, as well as in the emerging markets. Treatment has a somewhat lower margin, in general. But emerging markets, lower margin, not because of emerging markets, but because of the mix of project activity there that would lead to slightly lower incremental margins. So still around that 30% mark.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Scott.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC: The growth rates are pretty interesting and I don't think, following you guys as long as I have, I can remember kind of this much volatility in the growth rates. Meaning, like treatment up 14%, for example, just seems like such a big number to me, in general. I mean, can you help us understand how, maybe, water utilities are acting differently in the marketplace? I mean, is there – is it kind of getting lumpier over time and there are things – weird things going on, like budget flushes and stuff that – or is this just pent-up demand that's just coming off of multiyear recession time period?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Scott, it's a fair question. I think the way I would describe it and characterize it would be that part of the – look, we're very pleased with the execution of the teams. I mean, there's an element of share gain in a number of these areas, but having said that, we did have a relatively easy compare; tough second half of last year where we did have the so-called air pockets that were out there. And so, we're lapping that now. Even having said that, you're still seeing pretty robust growth rates here. So, there is some level of just continued fundamental market recovery here in the public utility side, but I think what we're seeing here in general is, while we don't talk a lot about the industrial piece, because we don't have a lot of heavy industry, we're more the light industrial piece, we've seen some rebound and recovery and strength there. And then, I would also say, obviously, the Sensus business, just given the nature of meter deployments and the AMI deployments, that could be a little lumpy. That will be a little volatile from quarter-to-quarter; shouldn't be volatile from year-to-year, but maybe from quarter-to-quarter.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Yeah, that makes sense. And then, I know there's been a lot of M&A speculation and when – one of the things – and I'm not going to ask you to comment because you're probably going to say no anyways, but the – when I – we can do the math and what you can financially afford maybe and, of course, you could issue stock, I guess, if you really saw something interesting, but do you feel like you've got the people and the systems in place to really manage doing another sizable deal after you've done Sensus and such?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Well, thanks, Scott. As you said, I'm not going to comment on market rumors and speculation. All I would say there is we – I certainly do feel, and certainly the board feels, that we've got both the financial and the management capacity to do deals of size, but we're only going to do it in a very disciplined manner. We're going to be focusing on good returns on capital. We're only going to focus on assets that are clearly in line with the strategy that we laid out back in Investor Day, but certainly we've got that capacity. But, look, we're going to focus on deploying capital that's really going to create value for shareholders.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Yeah. Well, so far, you've done that. So, good job, good luck, guys, and thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Well, thank you, Scott.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Similar with Scott's discussion, I'm more interested in – when you look across the potential M&A spectrum, how are you looking as far as new technologies more towards the Sensus-type communications and analytics versus more traditional infrastructure that might be a logical fit into the portfolio, but has a different – it's certainly a different type of investment? So, how do you kind of compare or contrast that when you're weighing decision?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Joe. So, I would just – I'd go back to what we laid out in our Investor Day back in April. There are three areas that we have highlighted. One is obviously kind of the digitization of the water sector. We call it systems intelligence. We talked about industrial water services and we talked about advance in industrial water treatment. So, those are the three broad areas that we have prioritized. Now, look, the water sector is a very fragmented industry and we've got a very healthy pipeline of potential targets that are out there that we look at. And we absolutely love the digital space. And there are a number of opportunities that we are continuing to look at there that will fill out some technology gaps that we've got in our offering. So that remains to be a top priority for us. But those are really the three areas that we continue to focus on that we laid out back in April.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you maybe talk about some of the trends you're seeing within industrial treatment, specifically, as far as maybe some of the burden shifting towards them from a regulatory perspective versus just from a PR perspective. If a company is kind of wanting to be that zero-discharge kind of greener footprint, what are you seeing there over the last couple of years?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. Yeah, so we definitely are seeing trends that are shifting that direction. Part of it is the financial burden that some of the utilities face and they want to offload some of that to the deep pockets. Others, in some cases, is regulatory moves on the part of various governments. It's not been a dramatic shift, I mean, and I wouldn't suggest that we're like in double-digit land there in terms of that kind of shift, but it's been, certainly, a strengthening of that demand in that sector. It is still a very, very fragmented industry in that regard. And so, that obviously provides some challenges along the way in terms of margins and so forth, but it is certainly healthier now than it's been in the past.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And maybe last from me, can you maybe just give us an update on some of the pilots that – I think, over the last couple of quarters, you talked about some pilots you had for Sensus, mainly, some big stuff, potentially, in Asia that you've kind of been going through. So, any incremental progress there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Making progress. I'd say, Joe, just for competitive reasons, I'd rather not give too much more information on specifics around the pilots themselves, but I feel good about the momentum there. These things are longer term specification, and we would expect for there to be news there, hopefully, sometime in 2018.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Ryan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: I wondered – one thing you didn't mention, at least not very prominently, is raw material costs and input costs and that being any sort of a headwind to margins. So, I wonder if you can expand on that, what you're seeing on that front, and then tying that to a discussion of pricing and price/cost management.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Ryan, let me take that one. We haven't seen a significant ramp in those direct material costs. In fact, it's somewhat moderated from the tick-up we saw in the second quarter. We're seeing a little bit of it in stainless steel, a little bit of it in copper, but it's really modest. And certainly, what we're looking to do commercially is really make sure that, to the extent where we do see a tick-up in those direct material costs, that we're making sure that we pass it along to the customers, certainly where we can and where we have strong value propositions. And that's work that's ongoing.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. That's great.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I would just add, Ryan – sorry, this is Patrick. I mean, I know there's been some other commentary in the space around impact on like brass and copper. Less than 10% of our overall Sensus revenue, not even Xylem, but less than 10% of our overall Sensus revenue is actually exposed to brass and copper; again, different composites in our materials et cetera. And again, that's relatively – I don't want to say it's easy, but it's relatively easy for our procurement teams to mitigate that.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And then, the follow-up would be just a more discussion of strategic pricing. It seems that since organic growth is picking up, that should be a good thing for supply and demand balance across the industry. I know pricing has been kind of a headwind the last couple, few years. Is that something we should expect to turn around and we should expect growth to become a contributor to price, say, from next year and beyond, or what's your view there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we certainly would like to believe that the supply/demand equation would be coming into our favor, and it's certainly a focus area for us. And we, certainly as a leader in the marketplace, want to be disciplined in that regard. Whether or not we build that into an outlook, that remains to be seen. We really need to get another quarter or two behind our belts here to see real sustained momentum in terms of demand before we build it into an outlook.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from John Walsh with Vertical Research.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, John.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey. So, just a question around investment spending as we think about next year. I know you've talked about what you think your incrementals would drop through, but should that be a headwind or a tailwind as we think about the absolute level of spending or as a percentage of sales?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. John, we're – we still have work to do to really drive some of the commercial synergies that Patrick was talking about earlier in some of these pilot projects. We're going to continue to be innovative and look to continue to invest in R&D to ensure that we have the leading portfolio of solutions for the marketplace and for our customers. So, that – and as we talked about during Investor Day, that is going to continue to be an area where we'll make continued investments. So, that's something that we'd expect to continue to do, certainly, in 2018 and beyond.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I would – the other couple of areas I'd offer, John, would be, one, certainly emerging markets as we continue to build out for the future there. That's where a big share of Water Infrastructure investment is occurring and will continue to occur. So, we'll continue to support those markets. And then, secondly, I would say, not even in terms of just the R&D engineering support, but as we are building out new capabilities to sell some of these new digital value propositions, there will be some investment in sales and marketing there as well; but, all manageable within our – all manageable within the productivity for investment statements we've made before and will have no impact on our margin expansion goals and aims, here.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. And then, just thinking about the public utility market for Q4 in your full-year guidance construct, you know, we're going to come up here against a much easier comparison in the year ago. You have good visibility from your shippable backlog, but will still need some book in ship. Some of your peers have said they've seen slippage. It doesn't appear you've seen that, but can you kind of talk to what are the toggle points to kind of hit the lower end or the higher end of that low to mid-single-digit market for the full-year guide?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, right now we would – kind of a right down the middle of the fairway would be a mid-single-digit growth in fourth quarter for public utility. Obviously, to go above that would have some modest impact on our full year growth. But you're absolutely asking the right question. At this point in time, does it really matter what the full year number is? It's more what momentum are we seeing in the fourth quarter, to your point, and we would say that would be mid-single digits.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Good morning. This is Mike DeLalio on for Rob.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Mike.
Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Good morning. Can you unpack the double-digit order growth at Sensus? What drove that and how fast would you expect those orders to convert?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. They've been fairly successful relative to recent project wins. Alliant is one of those. Again, we don't book the entire value of the deal up-front. We do that as commitments and purchase orders are made and issued. And there's been broad strength across all of the end markets, not just electric. We've seen increased activity in gas and in water as well. So, it's been fairly broad-based. And these deployments typically – they have a little bit of a ramp; so, we saw a little bit of that in Q3. We'll see some more of that in Q4 and into 2018.
Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. And based on year-to-date orders, it feels like the Sensus segment should be up more than mid-single digits next year, perhaps more than the target 6% to 7%. Is that a fair assumption?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Listen, we are definitely seeing some momentum in that business, but we'll give you more details on Sensus and the other parts of our business for 2018 as we go through the next quarter's call.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I would say – Mike, this is Patrick. I would say that the – what we have been winning here in terms of projects of late and some others that we have line of sight to, were always necessary there for us to be able to support the range of 6% to 8%. And so, these things will kind of come and go and, obviously, it's our job to continue to build that funnel in that pipeline, which the teams are doing a great job of doing. But I would say, at this point in time, I'd still look at that 6% to 8% as an appropriate kind of guideline.
Michael DeLalio - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. Nice quarter.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you, thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, I have two questions that are on previous questions, but maybe a little bit broader. On the cost side, I know that your long-term goal, 2020, is sort of 17%, 18% operating margin; looks like you're tracking a little ahead of that. I know that this – nothing ever straight-lines, of course, but would that suggest that maybe some of the saves in the first half of 2018 maybe were pulled forward? Should we be looking at the 100 basis point per year expansion goal maybe a little bit differently in 2018, because you're ahead in 2017?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No. I wouldn't read too much into it, Scott, in terms of the pace. You're, right. It's not going to be linear. A lot of it comes down to the mix of business that we have in any given year. And you'll see some probably higher treatment growth and emerging market growth next year, again, which will have a little bit of a dilutive effect; not going backwards, just not as heavy incrementals in that area. But then, it's our job, obviously, to drive the other parts of the business hard and make up for that. And then, we've also got – we've got some impacts from – you'll begin to see the benefits of things like Global Business Services come in over the course of, probably, the latter part of 2018, into 2019, et cetera. So, there's always going to a blend here and it's going to be our job, obviously, to walk you guys through the pieces of that once we get to the end of this year and are giving guidance on 2018.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Okay. Yes. It makes sense. Thank you. The other question was kind of really about pricing. I think that we all have a tendency – I know certainly I do – to gravitate towards your utility market and you kind of think sort of zero pricing, but you're in a lot of other markets. And so...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...pricing is pricing wherever you get it. So, I guess kind of piggybacking on a prior question, you have good momentum in sort of the other three broad markets that you serve here and just sort of wondering if there are pricing opportunities in those markets?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No. You're absolutely right, Scott. So, the teams in the field are working it hard, ears to the ground, playing the leadership role where we can, hoping others are disciplined where they need to be disciplined on pricing; and so, appreciate your comment. It's far more than the 47% that happens to be in utilities. It's the other 53% that we have opportunities here as well.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And as you can appreciate, as we have our business reviews with our teams, each of them have different competitive position, market dynamics. But I can assure you that this discussion in terms of making sure that we're getting paid for value and being very aggressive with that is right at the top part of that agenda.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good to hear. Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I had a couple of modeling ones. Just maybe first off, on the lag between Applied Water orders growth, you've seen mid-single to high-single-digit growth the last few quarters, and then China foot to the low-single digit revenue growth that you're putting up. How should we be thinking about those trends converging? And then, has there been anything specific to the mix that's been driving what seem to be longer lead times there?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take that one. I would say that there is a bit of a lag. And as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we are – because of that strong orders growth, we are going to see an acceleration of revenue growth in AWS next quarter, which – into that mid-single-digit range, which is very encouraging given recent performance of the business. And some of it's a function of the nature of the projects and some of the wins. They've won some large projects that go beyond 2017 and actually set that business up very well for performance in 2018. So, the trajectory has changed. We're seeing some momentum, but not all of that manifests itself in Q3; but, we'll see that trend line improve in Q4.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And some of those – some of the mix of that order growth as well, Brian, is – I think people have traditionally thought of the Applied Water business as largely a domestic kind of North America business, but we've got good mix in the emerging markets there. So, Middle East is a good example where we've gotten some really good project wins on that business that have longer lead times, not quick turn like they are here in the U.S.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, just second one on Sensus. I know there were some questions around this earlier, but if we could dive into some of the specifics a bit. Just in terms of smart electric growth, what are you guys thinking about in terms of how much runway there's still left there? Obviously, there's been some good growth here the past couple of quarters, a lot of that due to Alliant, but when does that start to moderate? And then, with water bouncing back to double-digit growth at 4Q, can you comment on whether those comps into 2018 for water, specifically, set you up to continue at that level, or how should we just take that Q4 jump into context as we head into 2018? Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yes. I'll start with the latter first, being water, because that's still the lion's share of the business here. And so, we would say that that double-digit growth comp in Q4 is largely a comp benefit in terms of easier comp. So, if you moderate that down, again, we still really feel like we're talking about a 6% to 7% kind of organic growth for Sensus next year. Obviously, we'll model that for you guys when we give guidance, but I wouldn't expect that to be much different. In terms of electric, I mean, we think there's still a lot of runway in both electric and gas and the lighting piece. So, there's a lot of project activity out there. It is competitive. We think we have a terrific offering. There are some other great competitors out there, but we feel good about our offering as well. And we think there are going to be some more big wins there. We need those and we expect to get those to support that top line growth rate, but I certainly wouldn't be expecting it to be growing double-digit into perpetuity. So, it is going to be impacted by some lumpy projects, but we look at the pipeline and it's a bit of a Lavachart, different projects that lay on top of each other, and then we have a really, really solid base business that gives us confidence that you really should be thinking about that 6% to 7% growth for next year.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Jim.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: How are you, Jim?
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Doing all right. Quick follow-up on – just so I understand the Applied Water orders and the momentum that you're seeing there, and you're citing strength in the Middle East, is that market commentary – is that something that you're doing differently there, maybe to establish the local presence or comments that you made on the investments you made in sales? I mean, what's driving that and your confidence that you can kind of sustain growth there in Applied Water into next year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Jim. So, yeah, so I would say our commentary on the Middle East, in general, is we did have really robust revenue growth coming off the back of a couple of quarters for the first time in about a year or so of orders growth, and those are now converting. I say it's a broader Middle East commentary as opposed to just Applied Water, but it is absolutely the impact of us having made investments there in a greenfield manufacturing location, as well as a rental branch. And what that allowed us to do, the first products that we moved into that facility were products to support the Applied Water business, and supporting, mainly, the commercial building market and industrial. And really, what it did for us was not just help us from a cost position, but really from a lead time perspective. So, there are jobs that we're able to bid on now that the teams either would have not bid on before or would not have won the order because the lead times were too lengthy relative to competition. So that really is what's driving that growth, there, in the Middle East. And we are certainly seeing a little bit of market recovery there, but this really, right now, is just us taking some share there. And I don't say that in any kind of chest pumping. Really, it's just a matter of now maybe getting more of our fair share of the market based upon better lead times.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Jim.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jose Garza with Gabelli & Company.
Jose Ricardo Garza - Gabelli & Company: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Jose.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Jose Ricardo Garza - Gabelli & Company: Thanks for fitting me in. Mark, I guess if you could just kind of comment on – looks like the receivables kind of picked up a little bit. I don't know if there's anything that you'd kind of want to point out there.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Not really. I mean, it's part of that – it's just the timing of revenues. We had pretty strong performance in the last month, and days are roughly in line with where they've been. And we continue to focus on driving down past dues and improving terms.
Jose Ricardo Garza - Gabelli & Company: Okay, fair. And then, just on the European public utility side, that's kind of been flattish. I don't know if there's any kind of noticeable change from your customers that you've kind of noticed over the last few months?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Not really, Jose. I mean, I'd say the – as we spoke to earlier in the year, we've seen – I'd say, let's set UK aside for a moment. Across the rest of Europe, it's still in that low single-digit kind of area, kind of steady Eddie. I think in terms of UK, we haven't seen the growth there this year that we had historically seen during the typical five-year amp cycle. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is just the nature of the spending that the utilities are doing. They're trying to smooth out that spending so it's less of a Bell Curve, which impacted them from a cost pressure and inflation standpoint. So, there's been some of that; I was over in the UK just about a month ago. And so, we expect that to still be an attractive opportunity for us. It just probably smooths out a little bit for the next couple of years rather than coming through in lumps. But beyond that, it's still kind of low single-digits in Europe on the public utility side.
Jose Ricardo Garza - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Jose.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in and good quarter.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: I wanted to ask about – you guys called out the procurement and Lean, the benefits that you're going to be getting from that in the future. I wondered if there's any larger buckets of cost saving. Is there – are you done with any kind of special charges related to consolidation of facilities as mostly kind of operational excellence going forward?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Walt, we're going to – this is Mark. We're going to continue to look at opportunities to be more efficient in our manufacturing and supply chain. But as Patrick had commented on earlier from a prior question, there is a substantial effort underway to significantly improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our back-office operations and we're embarking upon a Global Business Services program that is going to provide us with – certainly, with substantial efficiencies and savings in the coming years; but, also, will entail some restructuring as we get into that program moving forward.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for that clarification. And then, maybe as a last one and maybe you don't want to do this, but the emerging markets, the opportunities in China et cetera, have you quantified the opportunity there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: We have. It's always tough to get data in that market that you can rely on. And that's not a critical comment; it's just the reality in terms of – especially, given the nature of some of these mandates. So – for example, the whole non-revenue water discussion is a very, very broad complex discussion; not ever easy to put a definitive dollar amount on it. All I would say is it's big. And it's certainly big enough and attractive enough for us to go after. But I would say, as we think about kind of where emerging markets, overall, go over time, if today we're around 20-some-odd percent of our total revenue, that number, in my view, certainly ought to be up north of 30%; maybe closer to one-third over time, as we think about just the mix of spending and the investments that we made. And that really would capture, I think, more than our fair share of the growth right there.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Great. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest and the questions and your support. So, in the meantime, safe travels, Happy Holidays, Happy Halloween and we'll be in touch with you all, hopefully, here in the near term. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter results. Overall, we delivered a solid performance in the quarter, operationally and with healthy margin expansion, and robust order performance which increases our visibility to stronger performance ahead. In the second quarter, we generated top line growth in our base Xylem businesses and in Sensus. We're continuing to execute well, building momentum in the markets we serve. This is particularly notable in several of our emerging market regions. Our progress in driving productivity continues to generate impressive results with another quarter of significant year-over-year gains. The more focused approach we've applied in innovation and technology, partnering with more customers and external institutions, is accelerating our progress towards pilot-ready solutions to meet our customers' challenges. And the integration of our Sensus and Visenti businesses is proceeding well with our teams capturing new opportunities as they collaborate together. The investments we've made in these and other activities are beginning to bear fruit and our second quarter results offer further proof points that our focus and discipline strategy will yield not only the short-term results we expect, but also produce the improved growth we've embedded into our longer-term expectations. So, let me take you through our results from the context of the key priority areas we discussed at our Investor Day early this year. There, we laid out our clear focus on increasing profitable growth, and that begins with driving commercial leadership. In the second quarter, we delivered pro forma organic revenue growth of more than 1% with the base Xylem and Sensus businesses each generating positive results. Our strong growth in orders illustrates the momentum that's building in the business. Globally, we generated an 8% increase in orders in the base Xylem business and double-digit order growth in Sensus. Within the base Xylem business, the growth was broad-based across all of our businesses. These results reflect in part the investments we've made in strengthening our teams and providing them with the right tools to increase their effectiveness in serving our customers. Importantly, this type of order growth sets the stage for improved top line performance beginning in the latter part this year and 2018. I want to take a moment to thank our sales teams and those who support them around the globe. They are the ones out in the field day after day, working hard to develop the right solutions to help our customers and win the deals. And it's certainly not lost on me who the real drivers are of these results. Now, before I move to the second priority, I do want to address a couple of our end markets, as I know it's on many investors' minds. First, the public utility market where we delivered particularly strong results, up 15% last year. In the second quarter this year, we saw a modest decline in public utility revenue in our base business. It's notable, however, that our treatment orders grew 21% and wastewater transport orders were up 10% in the quarter. This momentum, along with market intelligence and strong bidding activity, speaks to a positive outlook for the public utility end market, and it reinforces our confidence that our business in this sector will return to low- to mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. I'd be remiss if I didn't address the welcome upturn in our industrial business. This was driven principally by our dewatering business, which benefited from strength in the construction industry, as well as improved conditions in mining and oil and gas. It's still early days to declare a complete turnaround in this area, but it is encouraging to see solid results beginning to take hold. The next priority area in our growth strategy is driving our business in emerging markets. Now, as I've said many times, I take the long view on these regions of the world. There will be periods of variability, as we saw over the past year, so we have been steady and disciplined in our continued investment in these areas and now, as market conditions are improving, we are well-positioned to grow our business and capture share. During the second quarter, emerging markets revenue was up 7%, and orders grew 27%, nearly double the order's growth rate we achieved in the first quarter. Clearly, we are building momentum in this part of our business, and our longer-term outlook remains positive. I'd like to update you on three of our priority markets. Our team in China is continuing to outperform, delivering better than 20% year-over-year growth in both revenue and orders. This strong performance reflects solid growth in public utility, and the team is beginning to reap the benefits of our product localization efforts. In addition, our teams are working closer together to capitalize on our broader portfolio of Xylem, Visenti, and Sensus solutions. In June, I was in Zhenjiang, China, to celebrate the signing of a new agreement with a large Chinese water utility for a pilot project utilizing our smart water network solutions to help them solve their non-revenue water issue, which is a growing challenge for water utilities around the globe. The outlook in India is also quite positive. Our team delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter and a triple-digit increase in orders. The order strength extended across both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water, and we expect product localization to further expand our opportunities there. We're also making good progress in building out our new India tech center in Bangalore, which is enabling us to tap into a rich combination of local and global expertise to drive innovation. The Middle East remains soft, but we see some leading indicators of a turnaround in the market. Order growth in the region was up double digits in the second quarter, and this follows a 9% increase in orders in the first quarter. The presence of our Dubai factory is helping us better meet our customers' needs more quickly, and we expect that to have an increasing impact on future growth. Our progress in driving innovation and technology continues. We're already seeing some exciting ideas come out of the collaboration between Xylem and our new Sensus colleagues as we maintain a sharp focus on solving specific customer pain points. In fact, we're already moving from the research lab to the pilot phase on certain solutions, and we look forward to deploying prototypes of those solutions with select customers in the coming months. That's a nice lead into our progress with the integration of Sensus, which is proceeding on track with our plans. Our teams are working well in targeted areas, ensuring we remain focused on delivering our near-term financial commitments while beginning to execute against the revenue synergies we've identified. We also continue to track on pace to deliver the cost synergies we outlined of a net $15 million in 2017 and $50 million-plus by 2019. The team delivered a signature win this quarter, valued at approximately $100 million over the life of the contract, with the deal Sensus struck with Alliant Energy, which serves electric and natural gas customers across Iowa and Wisconsin. This multiyear deal represents one of the largest deployments to date of FlexNet and includes both electric and gas smart meters. This deal is another compelling illustration of the value that the electric and gas businesses bring to Xylem. It also highlights the importance of our continued investment in electric and gas to develop the solutions our customers need. As we continue to innovate, we expect to have more solutions that can be seamlessly connected to our network solutions, increasing the value we can bring to our customers across the water, electric, and gas utility sectors. The last area I'll touch on is continuous improvement, which continues to deliver quarter after quarter. We generated nearly $40 million in cost savings in the second quarter, up significantly from the prior-year period. These savings continue to help fund the growth initiatives that are key to our longer-term objectives. We're also seeing an uptick in the use of tools to reduce some of the complexities that still exist throughout our operations. Our adjusted EBITDA was up 150 basis points to 18.6%, and this reflects both strong operational performance as well as the Sensus contribution. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the quarter, an increase of 23% year over year. We also delivered solid improvement in free cash flow year over year and continue to be well-positioned to deliver full-year free cash flow conversion in excess of 110% of net income. And finally, as you saw in our press release, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance to reflect primarily our updated assumption for foreign exchange impact, which has strengthened recently. We increased our adjusted EPS guidance and narrowed the range to $2.30 to $2.40 per share. I'll come back to this when we discuss the outlook in a few minutes. We delivered a solid performance in the first half of the year and are well on track to meet our full-year commitments. Importantly, we've built strong momentum across many of our businesses that we see continuing through the second half. That, combined with improving end markets, is increasing our confidence for stronger growth ahead. Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn to slide 5. I continue to be pleased with the progress against our strategic initiatives and the commercial momentum we're building. As Patrick detailed, our teams executed well in the second quarter, and their performance, along with improving order growth, positions us strongly as we move into the second half of this year. Overall, revenues were up 25% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. On a pro forma organic basis, this represents more than 1% growth, with Sensus contributing 2% and the base Xylem business increasing 1%. Foreign exchange reduced revenues by $19 million or about a point. In the base Xylem business, the 1% growth in revenues reflects solid performance in the residential and commercial end markets, up 15% and 3%, respectively, largely driven by strength in the U.S., as well as a 2% increase in our industrial end market. This growth was partially offset by a decline in public utility, which reflects a particularly challenging comparison from the prior-year period, when we delivered 15% growth globally. Regionally, the U.S. was flat year over year, as the strength in residential and commercial was offset by the softness in public utility. Western Europe performance was down 3%, with specific pockets of weakness including the U.K. Emerging markets continued its momentum into the second quarter, when we delivered 7% revenue growth year over year. In the Sensus business, the 2% growth in revenues was in line with the high end of our expectations. This reflected strong double-digit growth across all applications, with the exception of water, where there was a challenging prior-year comparison due to significant distributor stocking of a new product in North America. Moving to operational performance, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by 150 basis points to 18.6% in the quarter. This increase was driven by strong productivity and operating results from our base Xylem business, as well as the continued solid performance from Sensus. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3% in the quarter. Excluding the 70 basis points of purchase accounting amortization for the Sensus acquisition, our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points year over year in the quarter. Our teams continue to execute well on our productivity programs, delivering $38 million in cost savings in the quarter. This is an increase of 27% from the prior year. The acceleration of our cost savings enabled us to more than offset inflation in a modestly weaker revenue mix, while continuing to fund investments for growth. The strong operating performance in our base Xylem business, along with the significant accretion from the Sensus acquisition, enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 23% increase year over year. Please turn to slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Beginning with our Water Infrastructure segment, we recorded orders of $521 million, up 10% organically year-over-year. This includes double-digit growth in both transport and treatment applications; and as Patrick mentioned, treatment delivered an impressive 21% increase in orders. This performance builds on an already positive trajectory and sets us up for a solid second half of 2017, as well as a strong 2018, as many of these orders carry longer lead times. We exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $589 million, up 14% year-over-year. Of this amount, more than $400 million is due to ship in the second half of this year, an increase of 12% year-over-year on an organic basis. This gives us good confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth and deliver low- to mid-single digit revenue growth in the third quarter. Water infrastructure revenue of $482 million represents a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. In the U.S., the segment was down 1% primarily due to a difficult comparison against the 22% growth in our public utility markets last year. This was partially offset by the strength of our dewatering business, which grew 4% globally, with the return to growth in North America being the biggest contributor to this improvement. The team capitalized on opportunities in construction as well as stabilizing mining and oil and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada. The strength in these sectors in particular is reflected in the strong growth in Canada which was up 37%. This is our second consecutive quarter of meaningful improvement in these markets which is a very encouraging sign. Western Europe decreased 4% overall, primarily reflecting softness in the U.K. We have seen some slowing there due to a shift in timing of deliveries as well as delays in investment related to the AMP6 public utility investment cycle. However, based on recent order momentum, we believe that much of this weakness to be a case of volume shifting from the first half to the second half of the year. Our emerging markets results were strong with revenue growth of 11%. We saw continued strength in China and India where government investment remained strong. Our Middle East business remained soft in the quarter, down 15% year-over-year. However, we are seeing encouraging signs of increased investment and funding, which is supported by the double-digit order growth we secured in the quarter. Operating margin for the segment increased 150 basis points to 16.4%, driven by productivity benefits and volume leverage which more than offset inflation and investments for growth. Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $375 million in the quarter, which was up 6% organically. We exited the quarter with backlog of $193 million, which is up 7% organically compared with last year. Of this amount, more than $140 million is due to ship in the second half of 2017, up approximately 6% on an organic basis. Our backlog level and order momentum provide us with confidence in our ability to deliver low- to mid-single digit growth in the second half of this year. Revenue for Applied Water was $361 million, up 1% organically versus the prior-year quarter. Emerging markets revenue increased by 3%, reflecting solid growth in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, partially offset by weakness in Latin America. In Western Europe, revenue decreased 2% as the growth in residential was more than offset by a decline in commercial building. In Western Europe, revenue decreased 2% as the growth in residential was more than offset by a decline in commercial building revenue, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison against the 14% growth we achieved a year ago. We expect that the investments we've made in our European sales capabilities and channels, as well as the new product investments we made over the past 18 months will drive improved growth in the second half of this year. In the U.S., Applied Water segment revenue was flat. Our U.S. commercial building services business grew 3% in the quarter, and that was without the benefit of any major project releases, which we do expect to see later this year. Our U.S. residential business grew 14% in the quarter. In addition to solid market growth, we also benefited from promotions and channel restocking. The strength we saw in both in commercial building services and residential was largely offset by the decline in agricultural product sales due to market softness and challenging weather conditions. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15%. The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as lower year-over-year investment due to the completion of our Middle East expansion last year. This was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix, and currency impacts. Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of our Sensus & Analytics segment. As a reminder, these segment results now reflect the combination of our Sensus and Analytics businesses. Prior-year results have been restated to include our Analytics business, which was previously in the Water Infrastructure segment. Let me start by saying that we're very pleased with the underlying momentum in our Sensus business. In the first half of the year, the business generated about 5% growth on a pro forma basis, and orders increased more than 10%. I do want to highlight a point related to our orders numbers. Some of our large, multi-year contract wins, such as the Alliant deal that Patrick mentioned are not yet fully reflected in our reported orders. We will report orders under these contracts as they move closer to the execution date and purchase orders are issued. That said, we're clearly building strong momentum in this business that we expect to result in accelerated sales growth in the second half of this year. Now, back to the second quarter. Revenues for the segment were $321 million, up 2% on a pro forma organic basis over the prior-year period. For the Sensus business, revenue in our electric sector increased 53% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of several large projects. Further driving the strong performance was demand for new products including the Stratus electric meter which is helping us gain share. The water sector was down 8% in the quarter; however, this reflects a very challenging comparison with the prior-year period during which the water sector grew 20%, as it benefited from the very successful launch of the new iPERL water meter and channel stocking. In addition, in last year's second quarter, the business generated significant service revenues related to the initial deployment of the Thames Water contract. Shifting to our Analytics business; this business delivered 2% growth in the quarter, with increasing demand in environmental monitoring in North America, which is a trend that we expect will continue through the second half of the year. Orders in Analytics increased by 8%, led by 20% growth in emerging markets and strength in the U.S. We expect the orders momentum to lead to improve growth in the second half of the year for this business. Now, moving to our segment operating margins. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 210 basis points from 8.5% to 10.6%. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the inclusion of a higher relative year-over-year margins from the Sensus business and the benefit of significant cost reductions in Analytics business. To assist investors in better understanding the performance of this segment, we've included an additional slide in the appendix, which reflects comparable sales and margin information on a pro forma basis. Given the significant impact that amortization from purchase accounting has on this segment's margins we have presented this analysis on an EBITDA basis. On a pro forma basis, EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 170 basis points year-over-year to 19.9%. The reduction was primarily driven by increased R&D and commercial investment for new product development and to drive revenue synergies. Cost reductions more than offset inflation, and mix was slightly negative year-over-year. Now, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $288 million. Free cash flow on the quarter increased almost 20% from the prior year to $70 million, and was driven largely by the addition of Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 56% for the first half of the year, which is on track with our expectations to deliver greater than 110% conversion for the full year. We invested $34 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter, and returned $52 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, of which $21 million was for share repurchases to manage dilution. Working capital improved by 170 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by the strong performance in the Sensus business. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and as a result, our capital deployment is focused primarily on debt repayment at this time. Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick, will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We delivered a solid performance over the first half of 2017, which strengthened our confidence in our ability to deliver on our financial targets for the year. The changes in our 2017 guidance reflect primarily updates to our foreign currency assumptions. At the top line, we now expect to deliver full-year revenue of $4.65 billion to $4.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, we project organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, which includes organic growth from the base Xylem business of 2% to 3% and organic growth of 6% to 7% in our Sensus business. Here, we've raised the bottom end of our total company and base Xylem business growth expectations by 1 point. Our Sensus organic growth rate expectations are unchanged. We anticipate achieving $130 million in cost savings for the full year, a 10% year-over-year increase, and we remain on pace to meet that target. Our adjusted operating margin is now forecast to grow in the range of 30 basis points to 80 basis points, excluding roughly 70 basis points of margin dilution from Sensus purchase accounting. This is an increase of 10 basis points in operational margin improvement over our previous guidance. At the bottom line, we now expect to generate earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.40, which excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment costs of approximately $40 million. We've increased our projection for those costs from our previous forecast of $30 million, as we've accelerated certain activities that we now plan to execute in the fourth quarter. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 13% to 18%. Finally, as we discussed previously, we expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This contemplates anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $190 million to $200 million. Now, please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Please note that our commentary and growth estimates on the slide reflect pro forma organic revenue from 2016 for Xylem and includes the impact of Sensus. Public utility constitutes 47% of total pro forma 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect pro forma organic revenue to grow in the low- to mid-single digit range. We continue to forecast organic growth in our Sensus business of 6% to 7%. As we've seen in the first half of 2017, Xylem base businesses are lapping a very strong public utility performance in 2016. As a result, we expect organic growth for the base business for the full year to be up low single-digits. The year-over-year comparison in the U.S. market is particularly challenging as we delivered 17% growth in 2016. As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in the low- to mid-single digit range. Large project activities are expected to drive mid- to high single-digit growth in the emerging markets, primarily in China and India; and in Europe, we anticipate low single-digit growth. Our industrial end market represents 37% of pro forma revenue. In 2017, we continue to expect that full-year organic revenue will be up low single-digits. While the year started off soft, we are encouraged by the modest growth we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic that this is the beginning of a market recovery, and we anticipate modest growth over the second half of the year. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed with strength in China and Latin America, offset by continued weakness in the Middle East. Moving to commercial, which represents 11% of pro forma revenue, we project organic growth to be in the low- to mid-single digit range in 2017, with a solid U.S. market. In Europe, new energy-efficient products and our continued investment in our sales channels are expected to help drive growth. Residential revenues reflect 5% of pro forma revenue. Based on the strength we've seen in the first half of the year when we grew 14%, we are now anticipating full-year growth to be in the high single-digit range. In the U.S., we did have a better-than-expected first half of the year, but we believe that growth will moderate somewhat in the second half. We do continue to see an increase in residential building permits in the European market, which should help drive modest growth. Now, please turn to slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: I'll take a few minutes to update you on the seasonal profile of our business, as well as the updates to our 2017 planning assumptions. For the third quarter, based on orders momentum, improving backlogs, and favorable compares, we expect the public utility market to grow mid-single digits on a pro forma basis and our industrial businesses to grow mid-single digits as well. We expect commercial building services to accelerate modestly to the mid- to high single-digit range, and we anticipate moderating growth in residential, up mid- to high single-digits. All in, we anticipate this will result in pro forma organic revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% in the third quarter. We expect foreign exchange translation to favorably impact revenue by $15 million. Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million, with Sensus growing organically at 6% to 7% in the third quarter. As for our third quarter operating margins, we expect margins to be flat to up 20 basis points, excluding the 70-basis-point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of Sensus purchase accounting. There are a couple of items that will put some pressure on our operating margins in the third quarter. The first item is driven by higher cost of batteries that we have secured from alterative suppliers for our Sensus water meters. As we discussed on our last earnings call, an accident in the spring required our previous battery supplier to temporarily close its plant. The team has done a fantastic job identifying alternate suppliers on short notice to largely mitigate this supply issue and minimize customer disruption; however, the costs are substantially higher. Third quarter margins will also be negatively impacted by a significantly higher mix of sales in our treatment business and large project revenues in the emerging markets. Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our updated euro guidance assumption at $1.15 from $1.07. This adjustment puts us in line with the July month-to-date average actual rate of $1.15. Aside from our currency assumptions, all other assumptions remain unchanged from our previous guidance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We've had a solid first half of the year. We're increasingly encouraged by the momentum we see continuing to build in our businesses, and a number of our end markets are showing signs of improvement. Our Sensus integration work remains on track, and we continue to uncover new growth opportunities based on the combined offerings from Xylem and Sensus; and as we do so, we're remaining focused and disciplined to ensure that we execute our near-term plans and continue to deliver on our long-term financial commitments. There is no doubt that we are still in the early days of realizing our strategic ambitions, as we outlined at Investor Day, and we look forward to continuing to develop significant further value creation for our shareholders. Now, operator, we can open up to questions.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thank you. My question is on the public utility market. Obviously tremendous order performance there, but obviously the underlying markets aren't growing that pace, 21% for treatment and 10% for transport. So do you think you're taking any market share there, and can you give us some color about how you analyze the respective contributions of market growth and your own competitive performance?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Ryan. Thanks for the question. So, I'd break it down into the two most meaningful businesses that operate in the public utility sector and that today is our treatment business and our transport business. And I think the answer to your question is different for each of the two. I would say where we saw the significant orders growth in treatment, that really in my view is more attributable to timing of projects being awarded. And so I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to a share gain per se, although we do feel good about our share position in that market. The flip side of that, on the transport side, where we had 10% orders growth in the quarter, again, predominantly attributed to the public utilities sector, that one we do believe is a level of share gain that's really being driven by, one, new product introductions. But also, we've got a very large share position in terms of installed base. And so, as we've seen continued healthy growth in the repair and replacement part of the business, we obviously benefit differentially in that sector. So I would attribute a portion of that to share gain.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then my other question was on oil and gas and mining, and two questions there. One, how big a contributor was Godwin to the improvement there on the rental side? And then why not more bold in calling a recovery there? It seems like a couple straight quarters of pickup. What would it take to raise your conviction level and get more bullish on that energy market?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's a fair question, Ryan. I think that our view, I guess we've been down so long in what is an otherwise a small part of our total revenue base on a business that obviously is one of our most profitable. I think we'd like to see another quarter of continued momentum here to be able to declare a definitive turnaround. Where we saw particularly healthy growth this last quarter was in our indirect channel with our distribution partners, with some restocking there as well as they were deploying capital again, which is obviously a very healthy sign. And so, rig count's going our way, a number of other positive signs there, but we just think it's prudent right now to keep our expectations very level-headed here.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And Godwin, any color there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Godwin was the predominant contributor to the growth in that area. Actually, we've got a little bit of softness in our Applied Water business in more of the downstream applications there. That was down a little bit, not much but a little bit, but that was more than offset to drive growth in dewatering.
Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, maybe we can start with China. I wasn't expecting to see that kind of growth coming out of the region, up 20% revenues and orders. And maybe part of your answer is what kind of range of products are you seeing, because the facilities we visited in Shanghai seemed to be enamored with your UV treatment, some of your advanced treatment products, so how is the take there? And then also, industry reports have been saying China is really ramping up its focus on non-revenue water, more so than anyone expected. And so, maybe that's part of your growth rate you're seeing and will you use any of the combination with Pure Technologies and Visenti there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Well, thanks, Deane, for the questions. So, a couple of things in there that I'd point to. If you look at our growth in the quarter, it was really outpaced with transport and treatment. We were actually up about 50% year-over-year in that part of the business. Actually our Applied Water business was down about 10%, as we're still lapping some of the weakness there on the industrial commercial building side. So, it really is heavily oriented towards the water sector and the wastewater sector specifically. And that really is being driven by the continued focus, as you well know, on top policy mandate around water and environmental quality, and so we really have continued to see the money flow there. Now, we're also facing some easier comparison last year, but nevertheless, we see good, solid momentum continuing there. To your second point, on the non-revenue water mandate, your industry intel is absolutely spot on. When I was over there just several weeks ago, a number of the water utility CEOs were letting me know that the last five-year mandate has been extended now to include a targeted reduction in non-revenue water, which right now is about 27% as estimated, and they want that number to be down below 10% over the next handful of years. That's an ambitious aim, but certainly it will lead to money flowing. The pilot that we announced that we signed there in Zhenjiang is the first one of those. And so, the good news here is the non-revenue water opportunity is all in front of us as a sector, Deane. And so, it absolutely is going to be the opportunity for us to leverage our partnership between the Xylem Analytics business, Visenti, and Sensus, but also perhaps leveraging the Pure combination as well.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great to hear. And then, on Sensus, really interested in hearing anything you can share on this transition to some of the pilot stage of the products. That's what everyone is watching. The extent you can comment like what kinds of applications in these scenarios like watershed monitoring, but some color there would be real helpful.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. I'll give you the color that I can from a competitive standpoint, Deane, in terms of how much detail I share there, but let me speak directionally. So, we've got some pilots that are just about ready to go forward in Asia Pacific, as well as some here in the U.S. with some of the leading water utilities. And we are piloting, quite frankly, different solutions – or we'll be piloting different solutions with each customer. I would describe them as cutting across a few different areas. One is absolutely focusing in on the watershed management and the ability to connect our outdoor water quality monitoring capabilities there. Second would be across the wastewater part of the network in terms of our pumping stations, et cetera, et cetera. And then third, I would say there are, again, the opportunities that I talked about around non-revenue water being a big future play for us. So, those are three of the areas. There are a couple of others that are out there that we're still in the early stages of developing.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Right now, we're really focused on getting the technologies enabled and making them pilot-ready, then go out and begin to commercialize them.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good to hear and just last question, I really like seeing this new segmentation with Sensus paired with Analytics. And just – Patrick, if you could just a moment take us through where Analytics focus for growth is from here? A lot of people just think it's immediately a chemical test, but it's much more on the environmental side. So, where and how do you expect to grow the Analytics piece from here?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great insight, Deane. It is a business that is very much focusing on environmental quality monitoring, the whole outdoor water management space. The acquisitions that we haven't talked about in a while with HYPACK and Tideland, ocean and coastal monitoring is another opportunity for us in that area. And I think that what we are really excited about right now with the Sensus/Analytics combination is the leverage and power we get out of the combined R&D engineering efforts. And so, you'll see an accelerated ramp and some new product introductions there over the coming – I'd say, over the next year or two. And we've been a little bit stale, quite honestly, in the Analytics business, and I'm encouraged by the opportunity the team sees there now to refresh the portfolio.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just following up on some of Deane's questions here about the Sensus business and, more directly, on some of the overlap that you can get with Sensus and the legacy portfolio. What kind of level of investment do you see ramping up to? I mean, it looks like a very fertile area for investment. Where are you kind of now? Do you need to ramp up the number of engineers you've got? What kind of investment could the business take where it's at now? How should we think about the trade-off between these investments for growth and delivering margins?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Nate. Let me start, and then I'll have Mark chime in here as well on some of the numbers. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall we talked about between now and 2020 that you would see an uptick between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of R&D over that timeframe. And as I commented at Investor Day, that was really a proxy for overall investments that we would need to make in the business, whether it ends up in the R&D line, whether it ends up in sales and marketing support as we look at different solutions offerings, but we talked about somewhere between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin – or sorry, cost investment that we had embedded in getting to our margin targets over 2020. We'll continue to modulate that and see what is needed. We've made some of that investment in Q2 and we'll make some here in the second half of the year. Our efforts right now have really been building out a center of excellence around systems intelligence in Raleigh-Durham that you would have seen the early stages of. And we'll certainly be adding some sales and marketing resources in targeted areas to really support and drive the deployments over time. But again we'll modulate that as we go along. Mark, do you want to add anything?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, just a couple of other points. The teams are now at the point where they have a much better understanding of what they really need to deliver and execute. And so, Nate, you will see some ramp-up in the R&D spend levels. To Patrick's point, as we develop those products and solutions, we'll also need additional commercial capabilities to bring them to market. But we're also looking at significantly enhancing what we're bringing in terms of data analytics, data scientists, and we certainly see that as a big opportunity going forward for the company, Software-as-a-Service. And – but we'll also try and do it smartly, so we will be taking advantage of building out our India tech center which can support some of that at a lower cost as well. So, you will bottom line see some ramp in our R&D spend as a percentage of sales as we go through the remainder of this year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: But, Nate, to be clear in what we've said here is, what we're talking about in terms of any level of investment is not different than what we talked about at Investor Day. So, this is not incremental to what we had laid out back in April.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm wondering, given the pace that this seems to be going at, if there's an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of these investments? I know maybe that will be a little bit of a drag on short-term margins, but are you seeing as you get deeper into this an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of those investments to accelerate growth?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Nate, I think it's a fair observation. I think, right now, it really is more a function of bandwidth, not so much resources per se, but making sure that we're working with specific customers on prototypes and we have to move also at their pace as we develop some of these new solutions and technologies. So, if we see opportunities to accelerate, we'll certainly do that. We wouldn't be constrained financially, quite frankly, we see there being other opportunities on the synergy side as well that we can fund a number of these things. So, it really is not a financial constraint.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And, Patrick, to that point, you talked about net synergies, a chunk of those investments are reflected as a reduction to the gross synergies that we're delivering. So, as you said, the more we can deliver in terms of gross cost synergies, it provides more opportunity for further investment.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then your order numbers are ramping up faster than your revenue outlook. Can you talk about maybe the sequencing of backlog, and how this is setting you up for growth in 2018?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. We've got – we certainly have strong backlog going into the second half. For all of 2017, we're looking at 12% increase year-over-year, but the interesting thing is it's even higher in terms of our backlog going into 2018. And in 2018 and beyond, our year-over-year improvement is 17%. So, it really – and as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, we really see that as enabling us to provide really solid second half growth in 2017, but we're even more excited about what we see ahead of us for 2018.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Good morning.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Maybe to follow up on that last one. If I do look at the end market outlook, all the segments here are getting a slight bump versus the organic growth views from the first quarter call except for public utility, but that seems to be an area where you had a couple straight quarters of pretty robust order growth particularly in treatment. So, I'm wondering how should we think about maybe the timing of orders translating to P&L lead time-wise. You mentioned these can be a bit longer. And then maybe how you think about the potential for the outlook for public utility getting upgraded and moving through the second half of 2017 similar to what's happened here with your other end markets?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, yeah. So I would characterize it as such. So, we – our outlook and the expecting to be growing in the 4% to 5% growth range in the back half of the year to get to our base Xylem, kind of, growth here. And if you look at the orders that we delivered in Q2, and we're obviously pleased with that order performance, it was against a rather weak comparison last year, where we were actually down slightly in orders in Q2. So, if you normalize for that, we're kind of in that mid-single digit range, all else equal, and that's pretty much in line with what we're outlooking in terms of organic revenue growth in the second half. And as Mark pointed out, there is some of this order growth that really extends well into 2018 which we view that as an encouraging sign, because obviously as we get closer to the end point of year here, our minds are turning towards the outlook for 2018. And I think the order performance that we've seen here really provides us with even more conviction of the longer-term growth targets that we laid out back in Investor Day.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And I'd add to that, Patrick, to the second part of the question, clearly, there is a – we're going to see a change in trajectory relative to growth in public utility. And we were down through the first half, but certainly, with that order growth, we'd expect to be up low single-digit to mid-single digits for the second half of the year; and on a pro forma basis with Sensus, squarely in the mid-single digit range.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just second question, maybe a bit more of a housekeeping one. On the EPS guidance update for 2017, it sounds like a bit of additional organic revenue growth for base Xylem and then the new euro ForEx assumption of $1.15. But if I take just the new euro rate and flow it through, I get the entire EPS raise, which is consistent with your commentary. So wondering if there are some offsets to the slightly better organic growth, or if there's something unique about the incrementals on that new revenue? Any clarity there would help. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No. I think you've summarized it well relative to the driver of the increase. It is almost entirely FX. We have updated the range. We've narrowed it. We moved up the low point to $2.30, and that's reflective of, really, some of the improved water momentum and what we see as a improved growth profile in the second half. But just about everything in that updated guidance is all FX-related.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I think with what's going on with Sensus and the synergy opportunities and how attractive that looks, I think part of what gets lost here is the opportunity ahead, just nuts and bolts with the standalone legacy businesses and the cost-out opportunities you have there. So can you kind of update us at where you are year to date versus some of your – whether it's the 2017 kind of internal target or relative to your comments you made at Investor Day on just the core Xylem cost-out opportunity?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Joe. Let me go first, and then Mark can chime in here. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of the progress on the margin expansion goals that we laid out, not only for total company, but certainly the base business, which is really where the big productivity opportunity lies. And you see that with respect to the continued strong growth in our cost-out activities in Q2 as well as year to date. And when you look at our overall margin expansion goals of up to 80 basis points in the year, that's a good pace for us in terms of margin expansion, particularly given the fact that we're really not seeing a meaningful level of net synergies from Sensus this year. I mean, we're calling for $15 million out of the $50 million over time here, only because the negative synergies hit us on day one, and that obviously minimizes some of the net synergy in year one. You'll see the full-on gross impact of that in 2018. So, if you set that aside, very good progress on the margin side and, quite frankly, we feel that the best is yet to come. We talk about the business simplification work that we're doing, next-generation procurement, we're still early on in terms of our deployment of Lean and Six Sigma. So we remain very confident around the margin expansion goals that we laid out.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, no, we're tracking very well. And we saw a ramp in the second quarter year over year, and we'll see that continue in through the second half. So we're very confident about our ability to achieve those targets that we've laid out. And as we look at the net synergies from Sensus, that too will really start to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter of this year.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then if I shift over, one of the themes that we've been hearing for a while now from a lot of companies is on rising input costs. So if you guys can comment on that. I'm guessing the commentary is very different when you're talking about maybe Flygt and Concertor versus some of the stuff in Applied, but how are you seeing cost inflation and your ability to compensate on pricing?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take that one. We're clearly seeing a bit of a ramp in inflation, and it's really driven by commodities. In the first quarter of this year, we saw a 150-basis-point impact year over year. On the second quarter, that did ramp up to 200 basis points, and that was really all commodity based, and we would expect that to continue at that level through the second half of the year, at that elevated level. And it's really being driven by copper, stainless steel. These metals are probably the most significant drivers, but the team understands that. We're pushing hard to drive additional opportunities of savings around procurement to offset some of that. And most importantly, to your question on price, year to date, it's been relatively flat, but there's a lot of movement under that flat result. There are certainly areas in our business where we have opportunity because of competitive advantage, value proposition, to push for price and we're doing that; there's other products that are less advantaged where it's tougher to do that. But we are – this is clearly an area that we're working with our teams to get more aggressive on price because inflation is ramping, it's not going away in the near term, and we just need to be better at getting paid for the value that we're providing our customers in those instances in particular.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. The good news, Joe, is we've seen this coming for a while now. So we've been working closely between our procurement team and our sales teams to make sure they understand on which product lines it's impacting us and, therefore, where we really want to emphasize going after price. And so, we do expect that benefit to begin to come through in the second half of the year going to next year. And, two, certainly in those areas where we are a definitive market leader, we will behave as such and make sure that we drive pricing in the market.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And one just quick clarification; Mark, how much of that $100 million large order in Sensus was actually booked into orders in 2Q?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: It was roughly 15% to 20%, just off the top of my head, and that's – really, a lot of that's for next year – a lot of that order will be realized next year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: The key with this one, Joe, is on these large deployments, they're quite complex. They go over a few years of just getting the meters deployed and, obviously, the team work closely with the customer on exactly what their delivery schedule is. And so, the orders that we would have booked in Q2 would have been a small portion of the overall deal, very small portion of the overall deal, and those will be shipping out, quite frankly, later this year into 2018.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Jim.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Jim.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Just tacking on to Joe's question there on that win. Any color on how we should be modeling that deployment? I understand it's weighted to 2018, 2019. Is that equal weight, is it ratable, or is it only weighted in 2018? Is it a net positive for Sensus or do you have projects rolling off that we should be mindful of that kind of offset that, and so they don't necessarily impact that 6% to 7% growth rate that you've guided?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, Jim, the – yeah, and just to clarify for everybody, so the deployment itself will take place. So, the way – it's a two-part contract. So, we got the actual deployment of the meters as well as getting the network built out that takes place over the course of the first two-and-a-half to three years of the contract. And then, we've got a service agreement, software agreement that goes on beyond that, over a 12-year timeframe, so both software and service. And in terms of the modeling, so you're going to see the heavier revenue flow in the first two-and-a-half to three years. That was in embedded in the 6% to 7% growth that we had in the core Sensus business, partly because we do have contracts that potentially roll out, that will be up for bid. But, two, at the time of the acquisition, at the time of Investor Day, we had good line of sight to a number of these large deals that are out there and had – the team had pretty high confidence they were going to win this one. So, that was part of our confidence in committing to at least that 6% to 7% growth over the long range time.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And one follow-up if I may. Industrial exposure over a 30-year exposure, I understand you're seeing some modest "improvement" overall, but stripping out oil and gas and sticking with that general industrial bucket, where are you seeing increasing activity and where would you call out spending is slow to improve?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've certainly seen a modest level of improvement in capital spending in the U.S. industrial sector, as well as in, certainly, Canada had benefited there as well. And as we've said before, we tend to sell into more the general light industrial. So, not so much tied to the actual production activity itself, but as long as the sites are up and running, they will burn through some level of pumps that are there. You'll recall that we saw some unexpected softness there in Q4 and Q1. We had talked about that we would surpass that and things would normalize, and that's very much what we saw happened in Q2 and we expect that to normalize now for the second half.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, John.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey. So, a lot of ground covered already; just two quick ones here. I guess, a quick modeling question around how to think about Sensus for the full year. A little bit of movement on the acquisition impact and the outlook, but is the low 10% still the right ballpark there from last quarter?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: From an operating margin perspective?
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Correct.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, Sensus as – on a stand-alone basis, that really hasn't – that outlook has not changed. So, there's nothing in the profile of the mix of our business or investment levels that would suggest that would be any different than what we had outlook previously.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: And we're expecting to achieve that 6% to 7% revenue growth for the full year as well.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. And then I'm sure it's still very noisy, but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask, anything out of your customers around infrastructure or any thoughts around there? Obviously a lot of noise coming out of Washington, but any thoughts around that?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, our view – and we obviously do stay close to this as best we can. In our view, it continues to be that any kind of infrastructure bill would likely be in the 2018, 2019 timeframe as clearly things are kind of shuffling around in D.C. these days. I would say that we wouldn't expect there to be a direct federal funding benefit on the water sector. There might be a little bit there, but we're not counting on that in our outlook. I think where there could be positive impact for our customers would be – as you probably well know, oftentimes the local and state muni budgets when they're under pressure or under constraint, one of the first areas they tend to go after in terms of deferring or delaying is water. And so, obviously, any alleviation of funding pressure for them on other types of infrastructure would obviously help us indirectly from a water standpoint. But we're not seeing a lot right now other than chatter. There's been no real activity that we've seen in terms of projects moving forward that weren't otherwise going, but we'll keep you updated as we go along.
John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Great. Well, again, thanks everybody for joining. Thanks for your continued interest. Appreciate the fact you hung on. We went a little long here today, but appreciate the questions. Safe travels; have a good end of the summer, and we look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call.
Operator: This does conclude the Xylem second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. We started off the year well, delivering solid results in the first quarter that were in line if not slightly better than our expectations. Once again our diversified product portfolio and end market exposure helped to balance our performance. This positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments. We entered the quarter facing some challenging year-over-year comparisons, namely in our businesses serving the public utility sector. While those tough comps are reflected in our results, we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in that end market, which I'll get to in a few moments. Our Sensus business is off to a great start this year, delivering strong top line growth. We are continuing to integrate this business with early work underway to begin executing against the promising revenue and cost synergies we discussed at our recent Investor Day. Lastly, our teams executed well. Our focus on driving productivity initiatives delivered a 33% year-over-year increase and continuous improvement savings in the quarter, further demonstrating that we are still in the early chapters of our self-help story. This progress enabled us to offset cost inflation and continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives. At our Investor Day last month, we had a comprehensive discussion about our objectives and long term plans as well as market outlook. So for the benefit of those who weren't able to join us, I thought I'd touch on a few of the key points we made there and talk about our results for the quarter in that context. A primary theme of our discussion in Raleigh was how we were driving growth. This is a critical lens through which we are prioritizing our activities. And we have a number of actions underway to accelerate profitable growth. First, as we discussed there, we've made two significant organizational changes that are realigning sales teams and businesses to take better advantage of our scale and our broad product and service offerings. We've combined Xylem analytics, Sensus, and Visenti to create one optimized business that focuses on sensing technologies. This is a powerful combination that will enable to us to better leverage the strengths and capabilities of each entity and move faster in developing smart solutions for customers. Second, we consolidated our various Water Infrastructure and Applied Water sales teams across North America into one commercial team that is now organized around what we refer to as industry verticals. Said another way, common customer sets. This structure will make it easier for customers to do business with us, because they have one point of contact who can provide easy access to our full portfolio of solutions that are relevant to their business. We've already done this in Europe and the emerging markets, and the results give us confidence in the value of this structure. These organization moves are well underway. And we expect both to be growth accelerators. Now as I mentioned earlier, our diverse end market exposure continues to benefit our overall performance. During the quarter, our total pro forma organic revenue growth, which includes Sensus, was up 1%. Our Sensus business delivered a 7% increase with growth across the water, electric, and gas sectors. On an organic basis for base Xylem, revenue was down 1% for the quarter, primarily reflecting a particularly difficult year-over-year comparison, as we generated a 12% increase in the public utility sector globally in the prior year period. We do continue to see signs of strength in public utilities. Orders were up 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by public utilities, and treatment orders more than double that. In fact, the treatment bidding pipeline was up double digits. And as I mentioned before, this project pipeline is a strong leading indicator for the longer term health of the public utility sector. Mark will give some more details on this in a few minutes. So the demand in public utilities continued to be robust. And we expect that to manifest in stronger revenue growth later in the year and in 2018 and beyond. And with the increased exposure to this end market that Sensus provides, we're better positioned to benefit from what we believe will be a period of sustained growth. Another pillar of our strategy is to drive growth in emerging markets. This is an area where we see momentum building after a period of softness. And importantly, we're very encouraged by the longer term growth prospects. During the first quarter, orders were up 14% in emerging markets and revenue grew 3%. This is building off the early signs of growth that we saw in the fourth quarter and bolsters our confidence in being able to achieve our objective for the year and longer term. In China, a year ago we faced very challenging conditions. But our team remained focused on our long term objectives. And now we're realizing the benefits, as conditions are beginning to stabilize and our business returns to growth. Revenue was up 4% in the quarter, and momentum is picking up in orders. We're also continuing to increase our product localization and we've expanded our supply chain there. India continues to be a standout and we are growing our team there to take full advantage of the opportunities. Momentum in both revenue and orders continues to grow, as the government's commitment to investing in infrastructure supports a longer term growth thesis. The Middle East continues to be a challenged market, but we remain positive on the long term prospects, given the obvious needs there: water scarcity, infrastructure demand, continued growth in construction, and more. In fact the project pipeline funnel in the Middle East is strengthening, particularly in the areas of construction and building services. Orders in the quarter were up 9% and we see that momentum continuing. Shifting gears, another part of our growth strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is our focus on strengthening innovation and technology. One of the ways that we're accelerating our progress in this area is by building a broad-based ecosystem of partners to bring together ideas, capabilities, and new products to help solve our customers' challenges and add value to their operations. We're doing this with a more integrated approach to our own internal R&D efforts by partnering with a wide range of academic and research institutions and by working directly with customers and other partners who can help us bring value-add solutions to the market more quickly. Let me provide a couple of examples. Last week we announced a new agreement to be the exclusive distributor of Pure Technologies' water applications in key emerging market regions. We will sell these advanced solutions in the Middle East, India, Singapore, and Malaysia, primarily in the public utility and industrial sectors. Pure's portfolio of solutions is designed to address several of the more challenging pain points we know our customers are struggling to solve, such as non-revenue water, operational efficiency, and asset utilization. Another example is the agreement we entered into this past quarter with our customer DC Water, a widely regarded thought leader in the water utility space in the U.S. This agreement outlines specific areas of collaboration on a wide range of research and future innovation initiatives. This includes field driven pilots that focus on new treatment technologies and increasing the productivity and resilience of their operations. We kicked off the collaboration by delivering their first Flygt Concertor pump for installation at their flagship treatment plant. This serves as an important reference case in North America. Finally, our Sensus integration is well on track to accelerate our work in the area of smart water infrastructure. As we discussed at Investor Day, we are confident that we will deliver significant revenue synergies by leveraging the systems intelligence capabilities of Sensus to develop new offerings for Xylem's customers. Our teams are making good progress. And we expect to be piloting prototypes of new solutions at customer locations sometime during this summer. To finish up on our first quarter results, let me quickly touch on our ongoing progress in the area of continuous improvement. As I already mentioned, our teams delivered a substantial increase in cost savings in the quarter, which enabled us to fund the investments needed to achieve our longer term value creation objectives. We are expanding training in various continuous improvement practices, which will further drive a productivity for growth mindset deeper into the organization. We are well on our way to achieving our full year goals in this area. Our adjusted EBITDA was up 100 basis points to 16.2%. At the bottom line we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 in the quarter, an increase of 17% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. We delivered solid improvement in free cash flow, which positions us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 110% of net income. Finally, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to reflect our updated assumption for foreign exchange impact, which has strengthened recently. We increased our adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 at both ends of the range to $2.23 to $2.38 per share. So we're off to a good start in 2017. Our teams have made good progress, and we're encouraged by the momentum we see building in the marketplace and across our business. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. So with that I'll now turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn to slide 5. I'm very pleased that we got off to a good start in the first quarter. And we've built solid momentum heading into Q2. Overall, revenues were up 26% in the quarter. On a pro forma organic basis this represents 1% growth with Sensus contributing 7% and the base Xylem business down 1%. Additionally, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $11 million or 1 point. From an organic perspective, the 1% decrease in base Xylem revenues largely reflects a 4% decline in the public utility end market versus a strong prior year comparison that was driven by timing of project deliveries and favorable weather conditions. Partially offsetting this decline was strong growth in residential, up 14%, and a modest increase in commercial of 2%. Industrial revenues were down 2% overall, roughly in line with our expectations entering the quarter. Market conditions were soft in our Applied Water business. And last year's results also benefited from a few large equipment shipments in Water Infrastructure. We started to see some positive signs in this end market with improving order rates and revenue trends as we entered the second quarter. Regionally, the organic decline for the quarter occurred in the U.S., which was down 4%. Western Europe performance was flat as expected. And as Patrick mentioned, our momentum in emerging markets continued to build, as revenue was a bright spot, up 3% year over year. Moving to operational performance. We increased our adjusted EBITDA margins by 100 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the strong operating results of Sensus and the continued ramp-up of productivity savings. Adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 10.5%, which includes 70 basis points of non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the Sensus acquisition. Our teams continue to gain traction in the area of productivity, where we delivered $33 million in cost savings in the quarter, which is up 33% from the prior year. This 310 basis point improvement enabled us to offset inflation and fund strategic investments for growth. Excluding the 70 basis points of dilution from the Sensus and tangible asset amortization, our operating margin expanded by 30 basis points. Given the tough prior year comparison we faced this quarter, I'm pleased with our team's performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.39, an increase of 11% year over year and 17% excluding foreign exchange translation. Please turn to slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. I'll start with our first quarter order activity and backlog position at the end of the quarter. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $546 million in the quarter, up 3% organically year over year. This reflects growth in all applications within the segment and was led by treatment orders, which were up 8%. This performance builds on a positive upward trajectory that we've seen in our pipeline and order activity. However, a majority of the treatment projects require longer lead times and will not ship until 2018 or later. That said, we exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $584 million up 4% organically year over year. Of this amount, $262 million is due to ship in the second quarter, also up 4% year over year on an organic basis, which gives us good confidence on returning to positive revenue growth in the second quarter. Water Infrastructure revenue of $496 million represents a 3% year-over-year decline on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $7 million headwind. In the U.S., the segment declined 8% primarily driven by declines in the industrial end market. On a positive note we're seeing some stabilization in the U.S. oil and gas markets. And for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw oil and gas revenues grow year over year in the dewatering business, which is an encouraging sign. Our public utility business also declined in the U.S. by 4%, as we lapped the 22% growth in last year's first quarter. Further impacting revenue was an interruption at our manufacturing facility in Sweden, which was caused by a vendor supply issue that resulted in some shipping delays. We are addressing these issues, but expect some modest impact in the second quarter. Western Europe decreased 2% overall, primarily driven by the timing of shipments in the UK. We continue to expect solid mid-single digit growth in the UK for 2017, largely due to the Amp 6 public utility investment cycle. Emerging markets results were mixed but up 2% overall. We had 11% growth in Asia, which was primarily driven by the timing of revenues on several large projects. And growth in China was up mid-single digits. This was largely offset by the ongoing weakness in the Middle East, where the level of government spend for infrastructure continued to be constrained, resulting in a 20% decline in year-over-year segment sales. Operating margin for the segment decreased 160 basis points to 10.5%, driven by lower volumes, unfavorable mix inflation, as well as increased strategic investments for growth. These items were partially offset by cost savings of 380 basis points, driven by our productivity programs. Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $354 million in the quarter, which was up 2% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06x in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. We exited the quarter with backlog of $178 million, which is down 7% organically compared to last year. However, of this amount $108 million is due to ship in the second quarter of 2017, up approximately 6% on an organic basis, providing another proof point for our confidence in achieving year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter. Revenue for Applied Water was $333 million, up 2% organically versus the prior year quarter. In Europe, revenue increased 6% with particularly strong growth in Germany, Italy, and the UK, where our recent investment in sales capabilities and channels continues to pay off. Continued traction with new products also bolstered performance. Emerging Markets revenue grew 4%, reflecting growth in Asia and to a lesser extent Eastern Europe, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. In the U.S., segment revenue was down 1%. This decline was primarily driven the segment's industrial vertical, which declined 8% from continued weakness in its oil and gas business, soft channel industrial applications, and a challenging year-over-year comp in revenues from fire pump projects. Largely offsetting the industrial decline was 15% growth in the residential vertical, which was largely driven by the timing of promotions as well as modest share gains. Our U.S. commercial and building services business also grew 1% in the quarter. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 90 basis points to 13.5% year over year. Strong productivity drove a 390 basis point margin improvement, which more than offset 180 basis points cost inflation, unfavorable mix, and other minor headwinds. So let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of Sensus. As a reminder, these first quarter results reflect only our Sensus and Visenti businesses. When we report our Q2 results, we'll report the new segment that we announced at our Investor Day, which is a combination of the Sensus, Visenti, and Xylem Analytics businesses. We will provide restated historical segment financial information in advance of our second quarter earnings call. Revenue for Sensus was $242 million, up 7% on a pro forma organic basis versus 2016. In the U.S., revenue increased 9% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of several large electric projects. Further driving the strong performance was demand for new products, including the Stratus meter for our electric customers and the iPERL water meter. Our emerging markets business grew 20%, predominantly driven by smart water applications in the Middle East. Western Europe was down 5%, which primarily reflects the lapping of significant service fee revenues related to the deployment of the Thames Water contract in 2016. As a reminder, the timing of project deployments in the Sensus business can create some lumpiness in quarterly growth rates. While we saw growth at the high end of our guidance range in Q1, we expect that to temper in Q2, which we'll cover in our outlook discussion. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 50 basis points to 19.8%. Margin expansion was driven by higher volumes, improved mix, and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter decreased 160 basis points to 10.7% year over year. This decline is directly attributable to the non-cash impact of incremental purchase accounting, depreciation, and amortization. Excluding these non-cash items, margins expanded by 170 basis points. Now let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $287 million. As you may recall, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest period for cash flow. However, the $26 million of free cash flow in the quarter increased significantly from the prior year and was driven largely by the addition of Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 39% in the quarter compared to a 6% conversion last year. During the first quarter we invested $43 million in capital expenditures and also returned $33 million to our shareholders through dividends. In February we announced a 16% increase to our dividend payout, our fifth consecutive annual increase. While working capital increased overall, the improvement as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the addition of Sensus versus 2016. As a reminder, Sensus positively impacts our working capital performance with their very efficient working capital model. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which will require that we primarily focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 months. Please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. As I said earlier, we're off to a solid start in 2017 and are well-positioned to deliver on our financial targets. With the exception of our foreign currency assumptions, our full year 2017 guidance has not changed. On a pro forma basis we continued to anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, which includes organic growth from the base Xylem businesses of 1% to 3% and Sensus organic growth of 6% to 7%. As we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we continue to accelerate our lean and global procurement initiatives and expect to realize $130 million in savings for the full year, a 10% year-over-year increase. With our Q1 results in this area we're on pace to meet that target. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 20 basis points to 70 basis points, excluding roughly 60 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we've updated our foreign currency translation assumptions. As a result we now anticipate generating earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.38, which excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment cost of about $30 million. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 20%. Finally, as we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This contemplates expected capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million. Please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Please note that our commentary and growth estimates on this slide reflect pro forma organic revenue from 2016 for Xylem and now includes the impact of Sensus. Public utility constitutes 47% of total pro forma 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect pro forma organic revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digit range. Sensus is expected to generate organic growth of 6% to 7%. We anticipate 2017 organic growth of the base Xylem business to moderate after a very strong 2016 but to continue growing, up low single digits. As mentioned previously, we face a challenging comparison in the U.S. market, given the exceptional 17% growth we delivered in 2016. As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in low to mid-single digit range. We expect large project activities to drive mid to high single digit growth in the emerging markets, especially in China and India. And in Europe, we anticipate low single digit growth. Our industrial end market represents 37% of pro forma revenue. In 2017 we continue to expect that full year organic revenue will be flat to up low single digits. The soft market conditions in general industrial that occurred in the U.S. last year are continuing into 2017, though we do expect modest growth over the second half of the year. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed, with some strength in China and Latin America offset by continued weakness in the Middle East. Moving to commercial, which represents 11% of pro forma revenue, we expect organic growth in the low single digit range in 2017 with a solid U.S. market and a tough prior year comparison in Europe. Residential revenues reflect 5% of pro forma revenue and we expect 2017 organic growth in the low to mid-single digit range. In the U.S., we continue to expect a flat to low single digit growth rate despite a stronger than expected first quarter. The European market looks to be modestly stronger as residential building permits increase. Now please turn to slide 12 and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Consistent with what we disclosed last quarter, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2017 planning assumptions. For the second quarter, we expect modest improvement in both the public utility and industrial markets sequentially with both returning to low single digit growth. We continue to expect commercial to grow in the low single digit range for the quarter. And we anticipate moderating growth in residential, up low single digits, reflecting the impact of the first quarter promotions. All-in, we anticipate this will result in organic revenue growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the base Xylem business. We also expect foreign exchange translation to unfavorably impact revenue by $20 million. Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million, with Sensus growing organically at 1% to 2% in the second quarter. Sensus has a tough comparison to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of distributor stocking of iPERL meters in North America last year, as well as higher prior year revenues from rollouts for two large UK contracts. One other note regarding Sensus. One of its primary battery suppliers had a significant incident at its manufacturing facility, which has shut down production. We are making arrangements with other existing and alternate suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions in serving our customers. Given our current inventory of batteries, which substantially covers our needs through the second quarter, and the initial commitments received from additional suppliers, we currently do not anticipate any material disruption in our ability to fulfill customer orders. Our teams are on top of this issue, and we're tracking the progress very closely. As for our second quarter segment operating margin, we expect margins to be up 50 basis points to 70 basis points, excluding the 70 basis point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of the Sensus purchase accounting. Finally, please note that the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our updated euro guidance assumption at $1.07 from $1.04, which puts us in line with the year-to-date average actual rate of $1.07. Aside from our currency assumptions all other assumptions remain unchanged from our previous guidance. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So good start to the year. And we're encouraged by the growing momentum we see in our businesses. The market fundamentals are solid, and our teams are executing well. We remain focused on our long term strategy, while continuing to deliver on our full year commitments. So with that now, operator, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, would like to address first some of the issues going on in municipal, both U.S. and Europe. And maybe we can start with did you see any of the project delays or some hesitation on project releases in both U.S. and Europe? And then on the second quarter outlook, you are facing another tough comp, especially in the U.S. And is the expectation that you would post another negative organic in U.S. muni for the second quarter?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Deane. So this is Patrick. Let me take the first – the second question first. So our outlook for Q2 is to be flat to up low single digits. And that's a global number. And so that does reflect some flatness to up low single digits in the U.S. as well as in Europe. So we don't see it presenting the same kind of comp that it did for us in Q1. In terms of what we're seeing in both the U.S. and Europe, let me start first with Europe. Really the only timing issue that we saw there was really in the UK and the Amp cycle. And there was nothing for us to be alarmed about. It really was just timing of shipments that hit us there in the first quarter. And so we're still expecting that to be mid-single digits for the full year as we had originally guided to. In the U.S. again nothing noticeable that we've seen in terms of any delay in projects being awarded or in the day-to-day activity. It really is simply the fact that we had such a tough comp versus last year, both due to again heavy spending activity, timing of projects, but also you'll recall we had unusably warm weather last year that drove some higher shipments and install in the quarter.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then my follow-up on given all the items going on at Xylem today – the Sensus acquisition closing, the Analyst Meeting, raising all your long term targets – we got the most questions and the most excitement around this announcement with Pure Technologies. So maybe just spend a moment there. How did this partnership come together? Specifically about the go-to-market, how will you coordinate your technologies? Is there any interoperability within your technologies? And any plans to expand beyond these initial emerging markets?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Well, thanks, Deane. I mean we're certainly very excited about the opportunity to partner with Jack Elliott and the team there at Pure. We've known them for a long time. Obviously we see them in the marketplace. We've been impressed by what their capabilities are. We've – so we've been talking about this for a little while. They've got some capability gaps in very specific emerging markets, most notably Middle East, India, Singapore, Malaysia, which is really where we're starting to – we've got a strong set of channels to market there. I think this really makes sense now in terms of complementary technologies, now that we've got both Sensus and Visenti in the portfolio, and we put those businesses together. So we're going to be exploring to see what other opportunities there are in terms of the complementary nature of those products in those markets. Again right now it's really exploratory. It's really focusing on a few key markets here and helping customers again with those very specific pain points that we laid out.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: How about from the technology standpoint?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Remains to be seen. I mean I think there clearly is some interoperability there that we'll explore over time. But still very much in the early stages here.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Understood. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I feel like I need to ask about this battery problem, because you mentioned it at the end. But sometimes when we've seen supply chain challenges, they tend to linger and cause problems that are beyond sometimes what people anticipate. And so you commented that you've got inventory and such for 2Q. And you don't see any customer disruptions. How about the cost side of it though? Is there other concerns that your cost of procurement are going to go up meaningfully in the back half of the year? And how long do you think this battery problem – or how long does your supplier think this is going to linger or take?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. No, it's a great question, Scott. So a couple of pieces there. One would be in terms of – so we have a qualified back up supplier already. And we were in the late stages of qualifying a third source already. And so obviously the teams are very much focused on accelerating that third qualification. And we think the combination of getting them both up and running, as well as the inventory that both we and our current supplier have on hand, that certainly will help us bridge any of the supply chain gaps that we've got there. To your point around the cost side, very, very minimal impact from a cost standpoint. There will probably be a little bit of maybe freight expedition in some areas. And the suppliers that we've got there have been very good with us in terms of remaining true to previous negotiations, et cetera. Obviously don't want to get into many more specifics other than that, just given the competitive dynamics and negotiations.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. No, fair enough. So just as a follow-up. Since there's 10,000 water utilities out there, and we can't talk to very many of them, quite frankly, so it's tough for us to get a view. But how many of your – do you get a sense from your customers at all that they're thinking about projects in terms of waiting until there's a federal infrastructure bill? That waiting to see if money is available and potentially kind of delaying things until you get into 2018?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: We don't see a common thread there, Scott, of people necessarily slowing down. I mean if anything we've seen quoting activity up double digits again. And our bidding pipeline up very strong. But obviously your question is more around when those things come to market. I think certainly maybe in some of the smaller utilities, where they're relying on state funding and maybe to a lesser extent the possibility of federal funding, it's less about the money that may come to water projects. And it's more about the money that may come to other infrastructure investments that take a little bit of pressure off of their budgets, and therefore, easier for them to go ahead and move forward with the water spend. But we're not – we're really not seeing a lot of that. That's really not what's impacting us here going through Q1 and into Q2. It really is simply the very tough year-over-year comp for last year.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. In fact our pipeline for treatment waters is – it's up 16%. So...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. No. I'm just trying to reconcile that and just thinking in terms of how they think about things like this. But anyways that was very helpful. Thank you and good luck to you guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nate.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If we could go to the margins in Water Infrastructure. You were down I think 160 basis points there, which is maybe 50 basis points is decremental. But you did call out some additional strategic investments there. Can you kind of quantify what the levels of those strategic investments were? And how long we should expect those to continue?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Nate, it's Mark. The – in terms of the investment specifically, it was around $5 million. And a lot of that was focused on continuing to add commercial capabilities, particularly in our emerging markets, some product localization as well. So that was the bulk of it. There was also a little bit of investment in Europe as well, but that – and that was roughly 100 basis points. But the big impact on the margin profile was really a function of volume and mix. And we had a very rich mix of projects last year, particularly in our dewatering business, our highest margin – one of our highest margin businesses. And also had a lot of aftermarket business as well with the warm weather. So it was more of a volume and mix story there.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think the – anytime, Nate, as you can appreciate, anytime – especially Q1 being one of our slowest quarters of the year. And given the fixed cost that we've got, especially on the Water Infrastructure side, any kind of volume softness there magnifies at least within the quarter. But we're very confident about getting to our margin expansion goals for the full year. As Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, we had some self-inflected issues from a supplier in our Emmaboda factory. And so that revenue is very, very rich in terms of margin. And we'll get that back here partially in Q2 and certainly in Q3.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And how long should we expect the investment to continue?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I'd say modest here through the rest of this year. There's really – I mean the only investments we'll be making for the most part would be – we'll continue to invest in some emerging market sales expansion, a bit more on the product localization, given that we do see a full on recovery in some of the emerging markets. And then we've got a little bit that we'll be investing in the integration of Sensus in terms of going after some of the revenue synergies that we talked about. So there will be a little bit of an uptick in R&D. But all of that's been reflected in our guide for the year. There's no change in outlook.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up. You've talked about treatment orders being the leading indicator. And we've seen the treatment pipeline be pretty strong for probably a year and a half now. Can you talk a little bit about if you're seeing some of that, the transport and test stuff that supposed to come behind that, strengthening in the pipeline as a result of those treatment orders leading that kind of revenue?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We would normally see about probably an 18-month – kind of 12- to 18-month kind of lag between orders actually being received on a treatment as opposed to – our comments here are as much about bidding pipeline being up. Obviously we did see good treatment orders in the quarter, 8% growth. So we do think that bodes well for the test and transport piece of the business here. But – and I think we're seeing some of that now in terms of our orders lift here in this last quarter. But that would really I think buoy us even more strongly for the latter part of this year into 2018.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So that's kind of the timeframe that we should think about those orders ramping up would be mid to late this year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct. I'd say late this year into early 2018.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And you might recall, Nate, we had a bit of a hole in our orders in the first half of last year. First and second quarter we were down organically 2% and 4% respectively. But that momentum has been building up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Q1. And – but some of that is treatment, which does, as Patrick said, have a little bit longer incubation period in terms of actually manifesting itself in revenues.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, Patrick, Mark.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Jim.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Jim.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: A question on Sensus. Revenue increased 9% I think in – you said in U.S., those large electric projects. I'm sorry. They weren't on my radar, and I apologize if you had telegraphed it before. But does that mix I guess does – well, first, that aspect, does that setup for tough comps? Or is there acceleration elsewhere in Sensus, that 6% or 7% growth in 2018 isn't a stretch? And I guess any and all comments on mix, both organic growth contribution by component within Sensus and any impacts to margins we should be aware of?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. We'll take into pieces here. So on the – in terms of does it set up for a tough comp. Let me start first with even the rest of this year. And you'll recall that we've got a rather easy comp in Q4, because we had lower growth last year, because of some delays in Saudi on their shipments due to lessor credit, et cetera. So that sets up for an easier comp in Q4 that give us confidence of getting to that 6% to 7% growth. No, we remain confident about the growth outlook for over the planning period of that 6% to 7%. We've got some large project deployments that are front-end loaded as we head into 2018. And so that will help us with this comp in Q1 next year but also through the entirety of 2018. In terms of margin mix, I'll share a few comments here and Mark can certainly chime in. Not a unusually large mix issue organically within Sensus in terms of margins between, say, the water deployment versus electrical or gas. You get a little bit higher margin on the water side than electric. But given the fact that we had a large deployment here, that also tend to be favorable from a margin standpoint. So it kind of blends out to where there was no noticeable shift from my perspective.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And you look at their margins quarter over quarter, they don't move that much. They're fairly consistent, because you might have a richer mix in terms of some of the rollouts of large projects. But you can also have some mix coming from Software-as-a-Service too, depending on the timing of that. So but they are – while the volume can be a little bit lumpy, the gross margins are fairly consistent.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And I guess sticking on Sensus or I guess the projected revenue synergies with Water Infrastructure, how should we be thinking about – and I apologize if I should know this. How should we be thinking about bucketing the growth between Sensus and Water Infrastructure? Is it pretty balanced over the next few years? Or is there greater potential in one or the other?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I'd say it remains to be seen. We haven't given that level of specificity yet. We're obviously still working through some of the prototypes. It'll be a combination of the two. There will be – the way to think about that is, where we are getting synergies by connecting our equipment in the field on the wastewater side, those revenues would flow through the Water Infrastructure. Where we are winning any of these large international deals by way of Xylem helping pull them through, that obviously will impact Sensus and Analytics as we go forward. So that's the way to think about it. We haven't yet split the dollar amounts that we teed up at Investor Day amongst those buckets. But we'll have certainly more to share on that as we get later into the year, and we get some of these prototype deployments out in the field.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Maybe look at...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Chip.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Morning, Chip.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Morning. Obviously not a big part of the portfolio, oil and gas markets, maybe we could talk a little bit more. Nice to see dewatering turning positive. What sort of trends I guess you've seen into Q2 and has your outlook changed at all?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And on dewatering while, as I had mentioned, it was nice to see growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. It was pretty modest. Okay. So the trend line has definitely changed. But it's really – we're seeing that some of that growth in pockets in some areas of fracking. Certainly Permian Basin continues to be a pretty hot area. So while the inflection point is good, we don't see any significant takeoff in that part of our business, although the comps get a heck of a lot easier over the next several quarters.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I mean just to parse it a little bit more as well. You'll recall, probably I think it was the last quarter's call or even at Investor Day, we talked about the biggest challenge that we faced in the dewatering sector from an oil and gas and mining standpoint was more on our indirect channel side with our distributors. We've seen flat to a little bit of growth in our direct channel for the last quarter or so. But it was being more than offset by double digit declines continuing in the indirect channel. And the good news was the indirect channel flatlined for the first time in Q1. So that's really what helped us get to a net positive growth on that piece of the dewatering business.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Chip.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Joe.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I – unfortunately I had to jump on a little late, so apologizes if I kind of go over something that was already discussed. But I wanted to talk a little bit about the industrial outlook here, flat to up low single digits. I know you have some oil and gas and mining and stuff in there that's not your general industrial. But can you kind of scale that versus what we've seen in earning season so far, seems to be an acceleration there. That flat to low seems pretty modest versus what we've heard so far the last couple weeks. So kind of what are your thoughts there? Does that feel more conservative to you than the other outlooks for the rest of the end market?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: It's – Joe, this is Patrick. It's hard to call at this point. I mean that business is rather short cycle for us. It's largely a replacement business through our Applied Water segment. And so because it is general light industrial being the lion's share of that, at the end of the day we've always said that it is very much kind of a GDP at best kind of business. Typically grows around that kind of 2% to 3%. We've baked in the flat to low single digits simply because of what we saw in Q1 and therefore what would one have to believe for the next three quarters to get to a solid low single digits. So there are some early positive indicators that we're seeing. But it is still early. And this is again a light industrial business. So it's not going to be nearly as volatile in ramp as you see in some of our peer companies.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. No, that's fair. And maybe just a higher level question, and maybe this is too high level for this call. But when I think about your portfolio now moving through Sensus, stuff with Pure, like how do you see Xylem becoming positioned over the next – I don't know – call it over your time as CEO there? It's kind of like more of a Smart City provider. And kind of fitting that niche more than a traditional equipment provider. How do you kind of see the business evolving into that sort of discussion?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So I think, no, it's a great question, Joe. I think that the way I would describe it is, we believe strongly that there is clearly a number of large unmet needs from helping our customers, both in water but also across other elements of the utility space, provide smart solutions to them. And we think we're building a very nice suite of offerings here and capabilities, including the data analytics side. There are still gaps in those offerings that we will either get through acquisition or through commercial partnerships like we announced with Pure. There are more to come on those types of partnerships that are out there. I would want to make sure, though, that no one ever be confused around the fact that I think it's critically important, that even though we are looking to build that kind of smart solution, we are not going to move away from our OEM heritage as a business. Because it's my experience that you really need to have the subject matter expertise around the equipment itself as well. So you can really bring a holistic solution to the customer, as opposed to only becoming a Software-as-a-Service or data analytics kind of provider. So we'll continue to invest in making our equipment smart and – much as the other industrial companies are doing. So it'll be a mix of those two. And then lastly I would say it's not limited to the smart infrastructure around systems intelligence. There are – we've talked before about advanced industrial treatment. We talked about industrial services being a bigger part of our offering. So there's more to it than just the smart infrastructure element. But that is certainly what mine and our primary focus is right now, in terms of where we invest our money both organically and inorganically.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. That's a good answer. Thanks very much, Patrick.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Digging into the public utility trends, I know you guys have talked a little bit – ad nausea on this. But given the year-over-year decline is due to mostly tougher comps, particularly in the U.S., just wondering if you can maybe comment a bit on how much of the bookings pick up you're seeing in the U.S. versus elsewhere? And then what trends you can talk to geographically on bookings specifically?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: I would say a lot of the booking momentum has been in emerging markets. But we are also seeing solid order growth in the U.S. as well, low single digits, but good momentum. But the – I'd say the biggest source of water growth has been in emerging markets. But a nice upward tick in the U.S. as well.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I'll just do a quick housekeeping one if I can. The Sweden manufacturing issue you mentioned, could you quantify if there was any impact in the quarter? And then I think you had mentioned there may be a little bit of residual impact into Q2. Maybe what exactly that impact was? And then what the remediation steps are from here? Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Brian, it was roughly $3 million in the first quarter on the revenue side. And we would – we're managing it as best we can. But it's probably – we think it's going to continue into the second quarter. We'll get it nailed down. But probably a similar impact in Q2 as well from a revenue perspective.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And the good news is here we're not losing business, so the business comes back. It's simply a matter of timing of the shipment deliveries.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Super helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Walsh of Vertical Research.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, John.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: So a question around the margin. Clearly you've been able to more than offset cost inflation pressures with cost reductions. But given what we're seeing in raws, can you talk about your ability to kind of capture price in this environment?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. This is Patrick. So I'll start here. And then Mark can chime in. So we're very much focused on marrying up the views on cost inflation with pricing in the market. And so our supply chain teams and our commercial teams are joined at the hip kind of country by country, understanding kind of what the dynamics are. Obviously in those businesses where we have a share leadership position, we're being very disciplined in terms of being the price lead and preserving that. That's much more the case in elements of water infrastructure, where we are seeing a more favorable supply/demand dynamic coupled with inflation. So a little bit easier. Never easy to get price passed through, but a little easier there. A little tougher at Applied Water, just given some of the competitive dynamics there and a little bit more softness in the end markets of industrial but also the resi business. And so you saw where we did some promotions there to drive share gain in that part of the business, albeit small. So it's a mixed bag. But it's something we're very much on top of. And I would say again mixed results up to this point.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We're making sure the teams get out ahead of it. We saw a modest bump on the raws in – when you look at it in Q1 compared to last year, 10 basis points to 20 basis points in our two operating segments, Water Infrastructure and AWS. So but the first step is awareness. And we're making sure that the commercial teams are getting good information from global sourcing, so they understand in terms of specific product lines what that impact in terms of the creep in raws is, so they can be more effective in the marketplace.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And I would just maybe wrap that up with the fact that when I look back over the last three – or certainly since I've been here, and I talk to the leaders in the businesses that have been around, I would say historically they've been very effective and very disciplined at understanding the inflationary dynamics and driving price discipline where they need to. And what's simply gotten better I think is both our focus on cost out productivity, but also having enhanced and developed our procurement capabilities. Through Tony Milando and that team, we've got a lot more awareness now earlier on I think than we would have had historically.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. Got you. Thank you. And then just a quick one on Sensus. Obviously directionally you helped us with the comps on the back half. But wanted to know if you kind of can provide the explicit organic growth comps for Sensus in Q3, Q4? And then in terms of the margin, should we build off of the 10.7% in Q1? Or you called it, there was the benefit of that large project. Does this maybe, from an operating margin perspective, take a sequential step down? And then build in the back half of the year for Sensus?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take that one. I think so what we provided to date is – we provided the full year margin profile for Sensus. We don't see that changing. We still expect EBITDA margin to be in that 19.5% range and adjusted operating margin for the full year to be in the low 10%. So as I said, it – while there's modest movement from quarter to quarter, it's not all that significant. And we did have – although I would say, given some of the mix that we had in the first quarter, it's probably a little bit higher margin mix than what we'll see throughout the remainder of the year.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. Thank you. Very helpful.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Robert.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Just a couple of things. We've covered a lot of ground. I think last quarter you talked about core growth on the legacy business of flat to up low single. Is that refined slightly better to 1% to 2% now? Or is it...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I think we...
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: ...no changes?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Which periods, Robert?
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: In 2Q.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Full year?
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I think it was a flat to low – no 2Q. Kind of...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, that's right.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But for Q2, Robert, yeah, it's up about a point from where we had guided before. And that's really just baking in the momentum that we saw coming out of Q1. And the – when we talk about what our shippable backlog within the quarter looks like, we'd support that number as well.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Any change to the back half? I think it was 3% to 4% in 3Q and a little better than that in 4Q?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say it's in line with what we said before. Obviously we'll take a look at that again as we get through Q2 and see kind of what the momentum is. But right now we've held the back half as where we had it before.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Just conservatism? Or anything you're seeing in the backlog?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, I think it's just still early. And it's again we're still a relatively short cycle business, other than the visibility we have on treatment. So we're just trying to be prudent here.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Fair enough. And if we could just chat quickly about this promotional activity in resi, up 14%, added almost a point of growth to the quarter. Just are you getting more aggressive there? Don't usually see that kind of growth in the resi looking back?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's – we – it's timing. .Some of it's terms. It's not all price. So we're trying to be aggressive commercially without giving away the store on price at all.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So we – I'd say, Robert, the – to me the – there's been a lot going on in that part of the market as you know, as you follow other companies. And so I think just keeping our teams focused on, let's win share, let's leverage things beyond price to do so. There's always some timing issue. It's a relatively small piece of our business. So even a little bit of absolute dollar impact there can swing it pretty significantly either direction. So I wouldn't get too focused in on the 14% number in one quarter. I think what we're encouraged by was the fact that it was a good growth.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: And we saw good backlog build in that business. And so hopefully it helps us normalize for the year. We've had a couple of rocky – couple of the lumpy years the last couple years due to weather and other things. And so we hope we're smoothing things out now.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. I was more focusing in on the promotional activity and just whether there was any change in kind of the pricing?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, it's not a margin or pricing thing. It was really more on the payment terms.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from Jose Garza of Gabelli.
Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Jose.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Jose.
Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC: I guess going back to that one of your competitors purchased some distribution recently in the U.S. on the groundwater side. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on any kind of impacts that you foresee? And then how you're kind of thinking about that business in the longer term, Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. No, thanks, Jose. So we were aware of this move coming for quite some time. And so we had been already building in backup plans in terms of what the future would be for us. Just to put it in perspective, the impact on us on this one bit of disruption, it's less than 1% of our total Applied Water segment revenue. So even less than that for the total company. We've already got backup plans in place. We're working with Franklin on this. We have some other alternatives that we're working through as well. And so we don't expect any disruption at all on that part of our business. In terms of the other questions that we've gotten in the past have really been around what's our strategy between direct and indirect? And does this move kind of change that? And I think it's important that I state here that we are absolutely committed to support our channel partner relationships. They have – they're valuable. They've got a long term relationship with us. They've got a lot of reach in the marketplace. And so we place a value on that, at least certainly within that part of the business. And we think making sure that we've got a broad and diverse network, both direct and indirect, is our best way to serve the market both from a access standpoint but also from a cost-to-serve standpoint.
Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate it.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year performance. 2016 was a transformative year for Xylem, as we delivered strong financial results. We made significant progress on each of our five strategic priorities, delivering organic growth at a very challenging and mix market, at the same time, we accelerated capital deployment to change the mix of our portfolio, and in-market exposure, in order to grow faster, and deliver greater value to our shareholders. Specifically, we deployed nearly $2 billion last year for acquisitions that collectively are reshaping the growth and profitability profile of Xylem. The additions of Sensus and the Visenti immediately expanded our portfolio of systems intelligence offerings, a key plank of our strategic agenda, and extended Xylem into higher growth sectors, such as, smart metrology. And as the data scientists from Visenti and Sensus are now collaborating with Xylem's commercial teams, who bring deep customer knowledge and insights from a wide variety of water sectors, a host of possibilities are opening up to develop value-add solutions that address our customers' pain points. In addition to our inorganic expansion, we made excellent progress on our ongoing productivity initiatives to improve operational efficiency, and reduce our cost structure. These efforts deliver more than $130 million in cost savings, surpassing our full-year goal, and underpinning 130 basis points of operating margin expansion. Importantly, with these changes we are better positioned to deliver increased growth and profitability over time. Throughout the year, our team stayed focused and delivered against our long-term objectives. I'm pleased with what we accomplished, but even more excited about what the future holds as we continue to extend our reach and leadership in the global water industry. Now, let's turn to our results. Looking at the top one, we closed out the full year with 3% growth overall, and 1% organic growth. This was driven primarily by a robust public utility end market and a relatively stable commercial business. That said, there's no question that we were disappointed with our fourth quarter revenue. While we knew we have a tougher year-over-year comparison, we did not foresee public utility organic revenue growth coming in flat globally, which have been up double-digits in the previous three quarters. The shortfall primarily occurred in Europe, where we anticipated a historical level of year-end customer spend out that did not materialize. In the U.S., we continue to see a weak industrial market, primarily due to ongoing weakness in oil and gas, and lower demand in the light industrial sector. Clearly, we had a challenging fourth quarter and some of those headwinds will likely continue in the near term. On a positive note, we delivered a 2% organic increase in orders globally during the fourth quarter, which included 3% growth in our Water Infrastructure segment. It is also worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up double-digits to $2.5 billion from this time last year. This is another indicator of expected continued long-term growth in the water utility sector. Mark will get into the specifics of our segment performance, but I did want to highlight that, Sensus delivered $132 million in revenue in the final two months of the year, which brought their full calendar year organic growth to 10% on pro forma basis. The addition of the Sensus business clearly improves Xylem's overall growth profile, and as we've identified significant revenue synergy opportunities, that picture is getting even brighter. As I've already mentioned, we generated 130 basis points of operating margin expansion, excluding the impact of acquisitions, which is well-ahead of pace to meet the long-term financial targets we announced at Investor Day. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, 220 basis points of margin expansion, driven by productivity actions and cost savings initiatives. This strong performance enabled us to continue to invest in strategic initiatives to drive future growth, while still delivering on our financial commitment. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.03 for the full year, a 10% increase over the prior year. This performance reflects our continuing trajectory of improving financial returns, and demonstrates our ability to deliver solid earnings growth in a still-challenging global industrial environment. In the fourth quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.66, also a 10% improvement over the prior-year period. For the full-year, we generated $386 million in free cash flow resulting in 120% conversion rate. Again, well-ahead of our original commitment for the year. Looking back at 2016, we faced a mixed economic environment across our end markets and regionally. However, there was and continues to be consistency in key fundamentals and underlying trends that impact our business in very positive ways, now and in future years. First, a steady increase in spending on water infrastructure across nearly all geographies. A growing understanding of the operational and cost benefits of systems intelligence solutions in the water sector, as well as in the electric and gas industries. Recognition of the power of big data to optimize business operations. And finally, increased demand for solutions that address both the mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of climate-related issues, such as extreme weather events. With our recent acquisitions, now more than ever, Xylem is uniquely positioned to be the partner of choice in capturing the opportunities that will result from these trends. That is why, I am still confident about our ability to drive sustained profitable growth, and create greater value for our shareholders and our other key stakeholders. Our alignment on five strategic priorities brings focus to our efforts to capitalize on these macro trends and drive growth. We made measureable progress against each of them last year, and we expect that to continue if not accelerate in the year ahead. Let me quickly address a few of them. Enhancing our commercial leadership is core to fueling our top line growth. We made a number of changes this year to further strengthen our One Xylem approach to serving customers. That is, making it easier for them to do business with us, and ensuring that we provide quick and easy access to our full portfolio of solutions. Regarding Sensus, we're in the early stages of bringing our teams together to collaborate. As I've mentioned before, we are being very deliberate in our integration work to ensure that we do not disrupt the existing businesses. We are however cross-educating key teams on our respective portfolios and enabling lead sharing through Salesforce.com and other tools. We intend to fully leverage Xylem's leadership position in the wastewater, outdoor and applied water sectors to introduce Sensus solutions. And conversely, we're leveraging Sensus' leading position in the clean water space to offer additional Xylem technologies. As we previously announced, we expect this combination to realize substantial revenue synergies over the new few years, worth at least $100 million, and our teams are now working on those initiatives. I'll have more to say about those opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day in April. Shifting now to our second strategic priority, driving growth in emerging markets. Our performance last year was mixed across our emerging market territories with 1% growth for the year. But we began to build more momentum as we moved to the fourth quarter, closing out the year with a 6% increase over the prior-year period. One standout was India. We've generated high-double-digit growth in the quarter and the full-year. While still a relatively smaller business, the opportunities for growth in India are very attractive with strong government support for Water Infrastructure projects, and broader Smart Cities initiatives. China returned to growth in the fourth quarter, as demand for infrastructure projects continued to build. A positive leading indicator for this business is the double-digit growth in orders that the team delivered for the full year. This sets us up for attractive growth in 2017 and beyond. We arguably made the most significant progress this year, on our third strategic priority, strengthening innovation and technology. The acquisitions of both Sensus and Visenti are strong demonstrations of M&A serving as a proxy for R&D. The addition of these businesses enabled a step change in our systems intelligence and smart infrastructure capabilities. Last month, we established a new Xylem Center of Excellence at Sensus' Research Center in Raleigh-Durham. There we will develop new integrated solutions that further differentiate our offerings and provide value that our customers are seeking, and are willing to pay for. We're also expanding our India Technology Center with a new campus in Bangalore, that will focus on supporting our systems intelligence related work, as well as support our expanding product localization work in India and other emerging markets. I expect our expanded capabilities to accelerate our R&D progress, which will be a significant driver of value creation over time. Building a culture of continuous improvement is another area, where we continue to deliver strong results. We've been on this self-help journey for some time now, but there is more opportunity than ever to derive greater value out of our productivity and business simplification initiatives. And as we've noted before, these efforts underpin our productivity for growth mindset, as we redirect some of these savings to strategic growth initiatives. With each acquisition, we gained new perspectives on how to improve our operational efficiency in addition to realizing synergies through global procurement and footprint rationalization. We intend to update you on our productivity plans and expected cost synergy capture related to the Sensus integration at our Investor Day in April. But for now, I will say that we are already ahead of our plan to achieve 300 basis points to 400 basis points of margin expansion by 2020 in our base business, and continue to expect to realize at least $50 million in net costs synergies, related to the Sensus integration. As we build on this progress, we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth and value creation in 2017. We expect to generate full-year revenue growth of 20% to 22%, including the contribution from acquisitions completed in 2016. On a pro forma basis, organic revenue is expected to grow 2% to 4%. Our productivity initiatives will help to drive up to 130 basis points in EBITDA margin expansion. We expect to deliver 2017 EPS growth of 12% to 20%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. And we are aiming for another year of strong free cash flow conversion coming in at more than 110%. We increased our dividend to shareholders by 10% last year. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders in line with earnings and cash flow growth, today, we announced that we will further increase our dividend by 16% in 2017. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our results.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Since you've already covered the highlights of the full-year results included on slide 5, let's turn to slide 6, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter results. Overall, revenues were up 10% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 14% growth, which was partially offset by an organic revenue decline of 2%. Additionally, foreign exchange headwinds reduced the top line by 2%. From an organic perspective, commercial was the only vertical market to generate growth this quarter up 1%. The public utility market was flat versus the prior-year period after growing 12% over the last three quarters. This deceleration primarily reflects a tougher prior-year comparison in the U.S., as well as weaker than expected revenue in certain European countries. Industrial markets were down 3% overall with steeper than expected declines in our light industrial business. Rounding out our performance, revenues declined 3% in both the residential and agricultural end markets. Regionally, the U.S. market drove most of the organic decline for the quarter, down 7% and Western Europe was down a modest 1%. And, as Patrick mentioned, our emerging market revenue was a bright spot, rebounding from a tough third quarter with 6% overall growth. Before moving to our margin results, I'll address the Sensus revenue performance in the quarter. Revenue for November and December was $132 million and was short of our expectations, primarily driven by a delay in the shipment of scheduled orders to a customer in Saudi Arabia, due to letters of credit not being released. In January, we have begun shipping these orders as letters of credit are now being processed. Despite weaker than expected revenue in the quarter, our teams did an exceptional job driving productivity, led to 60 basis points of margin expansion to 15.3%. Excluding 160 basis points of dilution from acquisitions, which is largely from the amortization of intangible assets from the Sensus acquisition, our operating margin expanded 220 basis points. Given the market challenges we faced during the quarter, I'm pleased with our team's performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.66, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Before addressing revenues and earnings performance, I'll begin with our fourth quarter order activity, and backlog position as of year-end. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $572 million in the quarter, up 3% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by treatment orders, which were up 30%. While this is excellent progress and a sharp change in trajectory from the last several quarters, it is important to understand that the majority of these projects require longer lead times, and will not ship until 2018 or later. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $528 million, down approximately 2% organically year-over-year. Of this amount, $210 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2017, down approximately 8% on an organic basis, which will be a drag on revenue growth in the first quarter. Water Infrastructure revenue of $612 million represents a 2% year-over-year decline on an organic basis. Acquisitions added $7 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. In the U.S., this segment declined 6%, overall. The significant challenges that have impacted our dewatering business this year, including double-digit declines in the oil and gas market, continue to mute growth in the quarter. Our public utility business partially offset this decline with 3% growth in the quarter, despite lapping a 13% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Western Europe decreased 2% overall, primarily driven by unexpected weakness, as municipalities in a couple of countries slowed their level of spend in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid performance in the UK, where our teams drove 6% growth. We continue to benefit from the expansion of the public utility investment cycle. Emerging market results were mixed, but up 1% overall. The 10% growth in Asia was primarily driven by the timing of revenues on large projects in India and Laos. This was largely offset by ongoing weakness in the Middle East, where the level of government spend for infrastructure continue to be constrained, resulting in a 10% decline year-over-year. Operating margin for the segment increased 80 basis points to 18.3% as productivity initiatives drove 420 basis points of margin expansion. This strong margin performance allowed us to more than offset inflation of 180 basis points, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, which was largely driven by the declines in our higher margin dewatering business. Acquisitions were 70 basis point drag on margins in the quarter. Turning to the full year, segment revenue of $2.2 billion grew 2% on an organic basis. Acquisitions added $32 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was a $55 million headwind. Organically growth in our treatment and wastewater transport businesses reflect a stable public utility market, where we had been gaining share. This was partially offset by headwinds in the industrial sector, particularly in our dewatering business, and to a lesser extent, our analytics business. Operating margin increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, benefits from our productivity programs and cost reductions, as well as a modest price realization more than offset inflation and funded investments during the year. Acquisitions diluted overall performance by 50 basis points. Please turn to slide 8, Applied Water booked orders of $348 million in the quarter, which was flat organically over the prior-year period. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.99 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. Overall, we exited the quarter with a backlog of $163 million, down 3% organically, compared to last year. Of this amount, approximately $100 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2017, down about 1% on an organic basis. Revenue was $351 million, down 2% organically versus the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., segment revenue was down 9% year-over-year in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial vertical, which declined 16%. The decline reflects continued weakness in oil and gas and in the general industrials markets. Delays in projects drove 3% lower year-over-year revenues in the U.S. commercial building sector. In Europe, revenue increased 2% with particularly strong growth in the UK, where our investment in both new products and sales capabilities continues to drive solid industrial performance. Finally, emerging markets revenue grew 15%, reflecting a strong return to growth from a stabilizing commercial building market in China, and recent strength in Latin America from industrial project deliveries. This growth more than offset declines of 11% in the Middle East. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 230 basis points to 15.7% year-over-year. Strong productivity drove a 540 basis point margin improvement, this result, more than offset 140 basis points of cost inflation, lower volumes, and 60 basis points of strategic growth investments. On a full-year basis, the segment recorded revenue of $1.4 billion, down 1% organically year-over-year. Revenue declined 5% in the U.S., primarily driven by lower demand for light industrial applications. These declines were largely offset by growth in Europe and emerging markets. Operating margin increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 14.6%. The outstanding execution from the team on the productivity side enabled the funding of our localization investment in the Middle East and also more than offset the impact of volume declines in inflation. Now, let's turn to slide 9. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $300 million. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close the Sensus' acquisition. To complete these transactions, we also issued a combination of short and long-term debt of $1.3 billion. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment primarily on debt repayment over the next 12-plus months. During the fourth quarter, we invested $34 million in capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $200 million, a 21% increase from the prior-year. Free cash flow conversion was 214% in the quarter compared to 145% conversion last year. This improvement was driven by better working capital performance, as well as higher non-cash amortization from Sensus. While working capital increased overall, the improvement as a percent of revenue primarily reflects the addition of Sensus during the fourth quarter. From a working capital efficiency standpoint, Sensus positively impacts our profile as they have a very efficient model, while working capital as a percentage of revenue is approximately 10%. This is reflected in the 310 basis point improvement year-over-year in working capital as a percentage of revenue on a pro forma basis. And looking at the base Xylem business, we improved working capital as a percentage of sales by 70 basis points, excluding FX translation and acquisitions. Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. As I've said earlier, we're well-positioned heading into 2017 to continue to make significant progress on our long-term financial targets. Transformative changes we made at Xylem over this past year have shifted our portfolio towards advanced technologies and repositioned our future growth and earnings profile. As we move through 2017, we expect our 2016 acquisitions to help accelerate our revenue growth. On a pro forma basis, we anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%. This includes organic growth from the base Xylem businesses of 1% to 3%, and Sensus organic growth of 6% to 7%. We expect generally stable conditions across the majority of our portfolio, albeit mixed geographically. I'll cover our end market outlook for 2017 in a few minutes. As we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate incremental gross savings of approximately $80 million. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 20 basis points to 60 basis points, excluding roughly 60 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. This dilution is largely driven by purchase price accounting impacts, relating to non-cash intangible amortization. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.35, which excludes integration, restructuring and realignment cost of about $30 million. This projection also includes $0.08 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 20%. Finally, the Sensus acquisition adds a tremendous cash generating business to our portfolio. As we maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment and continue to improve our working capital, I expect us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This also contemplates expected capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million, which is in line with historical spend of the combined businesses. Please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions for 2017. Now, please note that our commentary and growth estimates on this slide reflect organic revenue for our base Xylem businesses. Public utility was 36% of total 2016 revenue. Following a year during which we delivered 8% growth in this end market, we are expecting 2017 organic growth to moderate, but still grow low to mid-single-digits. In the U.S., which represents approximately one quarter of our public utility base, we will have a tough comparison given the exceptional 17% growth we delivered in 2016. As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in the low to mid-single-digit range. In emerging markets, we expect large project activity to drive mid to high-single-digit growth, particularly in China and India. And in Europe, we anticipate low-single-digit growth, largely driven by strength in the UK. Our industrial end market, represents 44% of total 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect full-year organic revenue to be flat to up low-single-digits. We believe the soft market conditions in general industrial, that occurred in the U.S. during 2016, will carry into at least the first half of 2017, with modest growth returning over the second half. We continue to assume that the oil and gas markets will be down modestly year-over-year, despite some pockets of uptick in activity. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed with some strength in China and Latin America, offset by continued weakness in the Middle East. Moving to commercial. Here, we consistently saw a low-single-digit growth throughout 2016. We expect this level of growth to continue into 2017. Market data and input from our customers and channel partners suggest a low growth environment in the U.S., where we have a leading market position in more than half of our total commercial exposure. Beyond the U.S. the global outlook is mixed. We believe, Europe will be closer to flat with lower construction activity and funding uncertainty in certain countries. Also, our business in Europe, faces a tough prior-year comparison of 10% growth. China appears to be stabilizing, and we expect our business there to grow in 2017, after a weak performance last year. In residential, we also project full-year revenue to be flat to up low-single-digits. In the U.S., we expect a flattish environment, given the competitive landscape and replacement nature of the sector we serve. The European market looks to be modestly stronger, as residential building permits increase. Now, please turn to slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: This slide provides the bridge from our full-year 2016 results to our 2017 annual guidance for revenue and EPS using the midpoint of our guidance range. From our $3.8 billion revenue base, we're adding 2% of organic growth from the base Xylem business. Sensus adds approximately 21% of incremental revenue growth, bringing total expected revenues to approximately $4.6 billion or 23% year-over-year growth. Foreign exchange headwinds of 2% reduce our 2017 full-year revenue guidance to a midpoint of approximately $4.5 billion. In terms of EPS, we expect our core business to add $0.13, which reflects organic revenue growth, carryover restructuring savings and the benefits of our productivity programs partially offset by inflation, investments and a weaker mix of revenue. Sensus is expected to add an incremental $0.20 of EPS. Note that we now expect the Sensus contribution be higher than our previous guidance range of $0.10 to $0.12. This results in operational EPS performance of $2.36, up 16% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. Based on our full-year foreign currency assumptions, which are summarized on slide 14, we expect $0.08 of currency headwinds to reduce our overall 2017 EPS guidance midpoint to $2.28 per share. Please turn to slide 13. This slide reflects our 2017 outlook for our Sensus business. This year, we expect Sensus to deliver pro forma organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% versus 10% growth in 2016. Last year, the business had a very strong year in growing both the water and electric utility sectors, significantly benefiting from a number of new product launches. This year, we expect revenue growth to be driven by mid-single-digit growth in water, a double-digit increase in the electric utility sector and another year of double-digit growth in Software-as-a-Service. We expect revenue in the gas utility sector to be flattish. EBITDA margin is forecast to be approximately 19.5% for the full year, down 80 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume growth and net cost synergies will be offset by growth investments. These investments will provide for the expansion of R&D capacity, and the commercial capabilities that will be critical to enabling the substantial revenue synergies we expect to generate over time, as well as growing the base Sensus business. I'd also point out that approximately 50% of the $15 million of net cost synergies from the Sensus acquisition are reflected in the base Xylem 2017 financial performance. The year-over-year operating margin decline also reflects 220 basis points of incremental depreciation and amortization from purchase accounting. Please turn to slide 14. As the team has done in prior years, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2017 planning assumptions. For the first quarter, we expect continued weakness in the global industrial markets, coupled with a tough prior-year public utility compare. We anticipate this will result in an organic revenue decline in the range of 1% to 2% for the base Xylem business. Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million of revenue, with the vast majority contributed by Sensus, which we expect to grow organically at 6% to 7% in the first quarter. In addition, foreign exchange translation unfavorably impacts revenue by approximately $20 million. As for our first quarter segment operating margin, we expect margins to be down 70 basis points to 110 basis points, including a 30 basis point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of Sensus intangible assets. The year-over-year operational decline is primarily attributable to lower volumes and a weaker mix of higher-margin revenue that we saw in the first quarter of last year, from very strong repair and maintenance revenues in the U.S. public utility market, and from lower dewatering revenues in 2017. At the corporate line, we expect a quarterly run rate of approximately $12 million to $13 million per quarter. Interest and other expense is anticipated to be approximately $80 million, up nearly $30 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of incremental debt issued in connection with the Sensus acquisition. Our full-year operating tax rate of 22% also reflects the mix impact of adding Sensus for the full year, and our share count assumption reflects a modest year-over-year increase. Please note that the 2017 outlook excludes approximately $30 million for anticipated integration, restructuring and realignment cost. Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our euro guidance assumption at $1.04. We believe this transparency is helpful given the recent volatility in currency rates. With that now, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So overall, I'm pleased with our team's strong execution in a still-challenging global market. Looking ahead, we expect our acquired businesses to be catalysts for accelerating our revenue, profitability and earnings growth. That, coupled with our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement and business simplification efforts, positions us well for outperformance in 2017. Now, operator, we can open it up to questions.
Operator: Our first question is coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Deane?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Operator, we can't hear the question.
Operator: Mr. Dray, go ahead.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So can you hear me now?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Can you hear me now?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, we can.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Sorry about that. Hey, I hope, we could start with the tone of the U.S. municipal market by geography and start with the U.S., so obviously tough comps, but do you still feel we're in a multi-year spending cycle by the utilities that started last year, and what's your visibility there? And then, related is this all the intrigue about where and how the Trump infrastructure spending may find its way into the water infrastructure markets. I saw this week, a preliminary listing of States' wish list of shovel-ready projects and about 10% of them were specifically geared towards water treatment plants. So, let's just start on the U.S. side, spending cycle, visibility and maybe some comments about, Trump?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. Thanks, Deane. So, yeah, talking first on U.S. water utility sector. So we do very much believe that we continue to be in the midst of a multi-year kind of bull run there, Deane, and I think the – what you're seeing here in terms of the softness in Q4 was really driven by Europe, not so much the U.S. Our guide in Q1 really is being driven by the tough comp we have versus the first quarter last year where we had exceptionally strong growth we had, that was really driven by, as you'll recall an unseasonably warm weather in Q1, so we had a lot of pull-ins from Q2 to Q1, so that's just strictly a tough comp that we're seeing in the U.S. piece. In terms of visibility that we've got as we alluded to in our comments, the bidding, the big pipeline funnel continues to grow double-digits in the treatment business, which is the leading indicator for the health of the water utility sector. And so, again, my confidence is very strong there that we will see strength over the course of this year, as well as future years. In terms of the Trump policies, I would say, let me take the opportunity to maybe touch on a few different policy agenda items that are out there, leading first with infrastructure spend. We certainly believe that it could be a significant catalyst in terms of spending in the water sector. Obviously, questions remain on timing, and as well as the funding. We also think that there has been a little bit of uncertainty in terms of projects that are already shovel-ready as to whether the funding was going to happen at a local level, at a state level or federal level, and that's led to a little bit of a – a little bit of softness here in the short-term. But all indications that we get from other E&C companies that have reported as well is, they too are speaking fairly bullish about infrastructure spend here in the U.S. and they're seeing it in their bidding pipeline. The secondary would be around tax reform. I know that there are a number of investors that probably assume that we may not benefit that much from any lower U.S. tax rates. But actually, our efficient tax rate is really driven by our European supply chain and tax-efficient structure there. Especially with the Sensus acquisition, we've got a sizable U.S. tax base here, and we would certainly benefit from any lowering of rates in the U.S. And then third is, discussions around any impact on cross-border tax given that we import a fair amount of our products here in the U.S. The reality is, if you look at Water Infrastructure, while we are a net importer of products there, the reality is, most, if not all of our competitors are also global players that import as well. And then for our Applied Water business and our Sensus business, most of those businesses are U.S., and they are actually supplied out of our factories for the most part here in the U.S. And so, we really don't think that's going to have any meaningful impact on us. So I thought, I'd take the opportunity, Deane, to go beyond just the one item from the top administration, but cover maybe three or four areas.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Terrific. And then, I hopefully still won't count that as one of my questions. Just to round out the side on the European municipal market, sounds like there were pockets of weakness, but it wasn't in the UK, were these election related at all?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, the UK was up high-single-digits in the quarter, and we would expect them to continue to grow at similar rates here in 2017 as we are really hitting the sweet spot of the AMP Cycle in the UK. The softness there in the quarter, and what we're seeing in Q1, is really some slowdown in – we normally see a stand out of muni budgets there in a couple of key markets that we didn't see in the fourth quarter, and we're simply being cautious about that in Q1. And to your point, Deane, everything we seen in here does lead us to believe that it's specifically related to France and Spain, and that's certainly is related to some uncertainty around the upcoming elections, but we did that temporary.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Just last question from me. I'd be remised if I didn't call out the free cash flow conversion, and it wasn't too long ago when, Xylem had set cash conversion as a priority, and you were in and around 90%, and so if we can get to 100%, or you've blown past that. So Mark, just give us a sense on sustainability, you've set 110% conversion goal for this year, what have been the kind of key changes within working capital, and also the Sensus contribution?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Deane. And it's really a combination of a couple of factors, and you hit on both of them. First being, working capital, we have made continued progress in the base Xylem business, and saw improvement year-over-year in terms of working capital as a percentage of sales of 70 basis points, particularly in the areas of days payable, which improved by almost 6 days, continued progress in our receivables, which were up over 2 days. We lost a little bit of ground in inventories, and that was largely a function of the slowdown in sales in the fourth quarter, but really good progress, and we expect to continue to push that in 2017. And then, the other point that you alluded to is, Sensus, and they have a very efficient model, their working capital as a percentage of sales is around 10%. And they generate a lot of cash, and that is just a structural and sustainable change in terms of the amount of cash conversion that they'll deliver as part of the combined company.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Great job on cash, and we I like that dividend increase. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question is from John Walsh with Vertical Research.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, John.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, John.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: So, hey thanks. So thinking about the $0.20 now for Sensus, do you have any guidance on how that phases in either quarterly or each one versus each two?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: It's pretty stable. We might see a modest tick up as we execute the net cost synergies, but it's relatively stable as – I think, we've pointed out on one of the slides, what the revenue profile looks like from quarter-to-quarter. So we wouldn't expect too much variability there.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then thinking about your industrial framework for 2017, and kind of maybe parsing out some of the lighter commercial versus the heavy industrial. We are hearing about kind of an acceleration in those markets, and just wondering if, maybe the reason for your outlook is that, you might be tied a little more towards CapEx than maybe MRO spending in that vertical, but any thoughts on how that business kind of typically recovers when we start to see improved industrial activity, is it a two-quarter lag. How do you guys kind of think about that?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, this is Patrick. So I would split it into really two pieces of the industrial sector. In the light industrial sector that actually is more of a replacement business for us, and so we tend to be selling more into OpEx budgets. And so historically, that business has grown in kind of the low-single-digits kind of tied to GDP. That's why we were caught off guard a bit in the fourth quarter with unexpected some slowdown there in the U.S., and we do expect that to recover, but I think we're trying to be – we're trying to be modest and conservative certainly here in the first half of the year as to expectations. So we're obviously curious to see how Q1 and Q2 play out here, and we would expect some normal recovery there. The other piece of the industrial exposure for us, albeit less, is clearly in the energy sector, more the heavy industrial piece, we're less exposed there. But the reason you hear us calling that out is simply because of the fact that it impacts our dewatering business for the most part, which is a high-margin business. It's hard for us to gauge whether we're being conservative on our guide here, but we've seen this softness now for a number of quarters, and we simply think it's prudent to continue to build that into our outlook at least for the first half of the year. So we're hopeful as others are that there will be a market recovery over the course of the year, but we're certainly not banking on that in our guidance range.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nate.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Patrick, I'm hoping you could help us bridge the gap between the down 1% to 2% first quarter, and up 2% at the midpoint for the full year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Given that, orders have been roughly flat here, down in the fourth quarter, how does that pick-up come along, I see you've got easier comps as the year goes along, but we haven't seen slowing organic growth as we've gone through the years.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If you can help us bridge from 1Q to the full year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, no problem at all, Nathan. So first, I would say, just to restate some of the things we've said here. First quarter really is driven predominantly by a tough comp versus last year, because again, we had unseasonably warm weather, we had a really strong Q1 last year as you recall, and so that's being predominantly driven by a tough comp there, as well as the impact in Q1 of the slowdown in orders that we saw in Q2 and Q3 of last year, which are now working – that's working its way through our funnel, and that will work its way out in the first half of this year. But then, we did actually see an uptick in infrastructure orders, for both Q3 and Q4. Now, some of those have some longer lead times, which by definition, would ship out in the second half of the year, in early 2018, but we expect to see the benefits of that uptick in orders that we talked about here in the fourth quarter for Water Infrastructure, up 3%. And then, I would say, we also, as you point out, we do have an easier comp in the second half year-over-year because of some of the slowdown in organic growth that we saw in Q3 and Q4. In terms of how it splits quarter-by-quarter, think of roughly as down 1% to 2% in Q1, basically flat, flattish in Q2, up 1% to 2% in Q3, and up a little bit more than that in Q4, as I'm talking about the base legacy Xylem business, that excludes the impact, of course, of Sensus.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And then, I'd like to follow-up a bit more on the heavy industrial side here. The rig count bottomed in, in the middle of the last year, we've seen that improve, there's a lot of folks out there talking about seeing improvement in the mining industry. Is there some problem with channel inventory or do you lag recovery more than, maybe, I guess, I was thinking, in that business? I'm a little – just a little bit surprised that you're not seeing or forecasting better revenue growth in those two parts of the business.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, yeah. So we do have – we do lag, to a small extent, recoveries in rig counts, and that typically, from our experience, would be at least a couple of quarter lag that we would see there, and that's just the nature of our customer base, and to some extent our indirect channel in terms of nervousness they would have around opening up the covers in terms of buying more rental fleet, et cetera. Part of it's also with some overhang in terms of them having adequate rental fleet to meet their demand as we sit here today. But, that's certainly – that pressure will certainly return to them as the market recovers. And we are seeing – we are seeing pockets of uptick in activity, and we're encouraged by that. But, we just again, right now, think it's prudent for us to not be building in and assumed recovery in that business until we have a quarter or two of actually having seen it in our results.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And if I could just slip one more in on the public utility segment, you guys have clearly been outperforming the market there, so you're clearly been gaining share. Can you talk about the two or three main areas or main things that you think is driving those share gains and how sustainable they are?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I mean we're – we're obviously, we don't take it for granted, so we're always looking over our shoulders, so we're always paranoid obviously around how do we stay ahead of the market in these areas, but I would say, first of all, we've got arguably one of the strongest channels to market in the U.S. both in terms of geographical coverage, but also the strength of our channel partners there, as well as our direct sales team. And I think about the service component that we're able to offer relative to some of our competitors' offerings, clearly when you've got a rising tide of an end market like we have in public utility, whoever has a lead market share position is typically going to grow disproportionate to the rest of the market, we're certainly benefiting from that. But I would say, at the end of the day, it really comes down to the quality of our product offerings, coupled with the service, and so we've had some recent product launches, our new Concertor launch, which is being extremely well received by the marketplace, as well as some of the additional service offering that we built around that. And I would say lastly, although it's always hard to hang your hat on this, but we've put a lot of effort in our sales team, in leveraging our Salesforce.com investment, which has really helped in terms of lead generation, and substantially increasing our funnel and pipeline of bidding opportunities. So there's a number of things, Nathan, that go into this, I wouldn't point to any one or two things, but those would be the top three or four.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful color. Thanks very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Nathan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey guys, how are you doing?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So starting with Sensus, so I know your initial accretion guide was very preliminary, but what kind of changed the big bucket, that changed you get from $0.10 to $0.12, to $0.20 and can you talk a little bit more about the clean water applications that Sensus can pull core Xylem into, I think people kind of understand core business pulling Sensus in, but can you talk about other side of that a little bit?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Joe. This is Mark, let me touch on the Sensus accretion question. Primarily two areas, one as we lock down on our valuation and purchase accounting, the amount of amortization related to intangible assets was not as high as we originally expected. So that's about $0.06, and we also did a better job in terms of how we went out and financed the transaction, that was a couple of cents. And they're continuing to perform strongly and have a lot of momentum. So those are the primary reasons.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Joe. And on the synergies from a revenue standpoint, I would step back first of all and re-summarize where we think the big ticket areas of opportunities are, I mean, first there is a funnel of a number of large multi-year contracts that Sensus was already pursuing before this partnership with utilities that we already have a good relationship with, that we can help there from a Xylem perspective or that on a combined basis now, the strength of our offering will help us succeed in some of those bids. Secondly, it's in the area of the wastewater side, where we're able to leverage their metrology in terms of their FlexNet system as well as their data analytics and data science capabilities to provide offerings to a number of customers that we already have in common in the water utility space, but also to be able to go after new customers with a test and improvement offer. Now, there's lead times involved in doing the engineering and technical work around that, so that's why we don't expect to see meaningful revenue synergies in 2017. And we don't have any of that baked into our guidance, although we're certainly going to drive like hell to deliver some, the bottom line is, we don't have that in our guidance. And then the third area is, to your point, when we look at the opportunities to now leverage Sensus' capabilities in the clean water network side, we get other parts of our Applied Water business as well as our dewatering and outdoor analytic space, where we believe, we're going to be able to leverage their data analytics and data science and Software-as-a-Service capability to be able to connect our own devices, whether it'd be in the industrial space, whether it'd be in commercial buildings. But again, those are longer lead times, we'll have a lot more to say about the nature of those opportunities and the size, in Investor Day in April. And then lastly, we haven't even talked about Visenti yet, and we'll hold that until Investor Day, because I think, people will get very excited about what capabilities they bring to the party here as well.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So, that's great color, and fair to say that the Sensus accretion, almost none of that is from a change in the operational expectations, it's all kind of accounting related, so that's good to see. As you guys have spent this much money and clearly your focus is on these kind of higher technology type aspects, when I look at your total portfolio and you sit back, are there areas now that maybe don't need to be part of Xylem, that you're not – that you don't see spending incremental dollars on that maybe you can look to divest?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I certainly, on the divestiture front, I wouldn't ever rule out anything long-term, but I'd say today, as we sit here, I wouldn't expect anything of significant size and scale. Looking at our portfolio and just doing good disciplined portfolio management, whether it'd be where we allocate capital, but also which ones we're wanting to (58:48) be a part of, it's something we look at on a regular basis, and again, if there was anything there of meaning, we would certainly share that at Investor Day, but we don't envision anything of significant size and scale as we sit here today.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question is from Nish Damodara with Robert Baird.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Nish.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, we can.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Mike Halloran, sorry about that. Must have our lines mixed up.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So first question, the share count creep here, is this just a reflection of a focus on debt pay down and less of a focus on buying back stock, or is there something else going on?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: No. You nailed it.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. And then...
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: It's – we're really focused on getting our debt down to where we need to get it.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So second question then, and I'll keep mine to two. When you look backwards at the last time we had an infrastructure bill go through, as I remember it correctly, there were delays going into the bills, people decided to wait and see what kind of funding they could get externally...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: ...as opposed to funding things with their current stream, how do you think that dynamic plays out this time? Are you seeing any signs of project softness or anything that would reflect a similar dynamic to the last cycle?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Mike, I'm in your camp on this based on the very reasons that you laid out. We've not seen it widespread, but we have seen it in pockets where there are projects that are in the hopper that we have seen some slowness in, in terms of – and we believe it is because of people looking to see well, does it need to be funded locally within our own budgets, or is there going to be state or federal funding that comes forward. What's encouraging about that is the fact that, we are seeing, and you're probably seeing and hearing from other E&Cs in the space that they're seeing upticks in their quoting activity, and so the work is absolutely out there, and we do believe that we've hit a little bit of a softness here for a couple of quarters, and the question is, when do those things come forward. And so, that's certainly my perspective, now. Phil's been around here for a long-time, and he can certainly give his perspective specifically on what we've seen historically within the Xylem businesses.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Mike, I was just going to – I was just kind of thinking back to that year. And the only thing I'd highlight is, back then, that was – that created a bit of uncertainty that the market really wasn't ready for, and how to think about it going forward. So that probably went on for a few quarters before it started to shake lose. I think, this time around, yeah – certainly, there's a little bit of air pocket here, but not likely the last beyond kind of the first quarter or two, here in 2017. So, I mean, obviously, we're watching it pretty closely. But that's a general feel by our teams, and they're obviously really close to their customers, because we predominantly go direct. So feeling a little bit more confident about the length of which that air pocket might last this time around.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks guys.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: You bet.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cassil with Seaport Global Securities.
Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. This is Jacob on for Ryan.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Good morning. In commercial, where is the strength that you guys are seeing coming from? Is it more so institutional and government buildings or is it coming from elsewhere?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. It's predominantly coming from institutional areas. So, again, we kind of throw that in terms of hospitals, universities, kind of government spend in that space. And so, that's the first piece, as it relates to the U.S. I would say, the other piece that we're seeing, a pretty strong rebound at this point in time, is within a few of the emerging markets, most notably China bouncing back. China had been on its back year in terms of our commercial building exposure through 2016, and we really saw that turn in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue through 2017, and we're seeing a tremendous growth in India from the whole Smart Cities focus as well.
Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. And then, in India, I know, you guys got a couple of few larger orders back in early 2016. Did you see any follow-on activity coming through in regards to larger orders for India?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I'd say two things. One, we do see a very rich pipeline and funnel there right now and are actively bidding on projects of similar size. And so, hopefully we'll bag some of that this year. That would not help this year, that would be a 2018 kind of benefit, but we've got very good line of sight to our outlook for 2017, given these are large projects. I would say that, with the focus of Prime Minister Modi on both Infrastructure and Smart Cities, we see that run continuing for quite some time. Having said that, what we're also doing right now, especially as we have ramped up our manufacturing capabilities there as well as our R&D and Technical Center, we're trying to help our teams there, focus is much on building the day-to-day recurring base there and all the aftermarket service that comes with it to make sure that once we get through the next few years of large projects, that we got a really established, a really attractive and established base business there that recurs.
Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. Thank you guys for answering my question.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey guys, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I just wanted to actually clarify the answer to an earlier question about the revenue growth progressing. I think, you indicated, was down low-single in the first quarter, kind of flattish and up low-single in the third quarter, I think, kind of implies flattish through the first nine months, so – which I think implies (01:05:00).
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah to clarify...
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah to clarify, Robert, so really what it is, it's...
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: (01:05:05) back-end weighted.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So let me, kind of walk you through it again. So it would be down 1% to 2% in Q1, and it'd flattish to up low-single-digits in Q2. And then, it would be up somewhere in the low-single-digit kind of 2% to 4% in Q3 and Q4.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: In each of Q3 and Q4?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct, and that's really being driven by easier compares, and the uptick in orders here the last couple of quarter is infrastructure.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you, okay. And then, what's your visibility and confidence that we get there? I know, a lot of the business is pretty short cycle?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'm quite confident on our ability to get there. I think, obviously, we have visibility to Q1, I think, we got a good visibility to Q2, given the project mix that we've got, and what has been happening in backlog, and we'll begin to benefit, to some extent, from the order uptick and Water Infrastructure in Q3 and Q4. And then, as you look at Q3 and Q4 of 2017, a combination of easier compares as well as just an overall kind of history around the dewatering business and kind of some of the opportunities we see there as we lack those type of compares. So we're – we think there's quite high confidence in our ability to get to these numbers for full year.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And maybe just finally a question on the investment spending in the lock, is investment spending on a year-over-year basis? Is that a headwind or a tailwind? And what's the thought on kind of flexing that is needed to kind of keep margin go up on track, I see, that's been kind of the approach in the past? Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, Rob, but I'll take that one. So yeah, we've got very good line of sight to the planned strategic investments, and as we've done over the course of last few years that I've been here, I mean, we will throttle those as responsibly as we need to be depending upon where the top line is coming in. And so, we've got good line of sight and discipline around that. At the same time, I would say, there's still a lot of self-help margin expansion opportunity here. And so, we do think there is tremendous opportunities on both the – both productivity from procurement as well as Lean Six Sigma, as well as trying to overdrive the cost synergies associated with the Sensus partnership here together. So I mean, the combination of margin expansion opportunities just by good old fashion operating discipline that we're continuing to drive, coupled with line of sight to throttle our investments appropriately, gives us confidence that we will – we'll deliver on this margin expansion.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. So again, I mean, thanks everybody for joining, thanks for your continued interest and commitment. Safe travels in the meantime, but between now and then, we would remind you, we've got an exciting Investor Day coming up here on April 4th in just beginning of Q2. So it will be April 4th, it's going to be located at our Sensus location, just outside of Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. It's about five miles from the Raleigh-Durham Airport. And you'll be welcome to join both presentations as well as a tour of our Innovation Center and the Sensus headquarter there. So, in the meantime, safe travels and we'll see you soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem spinning out of ITT and embarking on its journey as a new company. We've evolved since that day and made substantial progress creating significant value for our shareholders. So, today, on the first day of our sixth year, we began as a larger, stronger and more focused enterprise. We have a clear long-term strategy that we laid out last year at Investor Day. One of which is Xylem becomes the definitive market leader and a leading provider of advanced technologies and integrated solutions across the water sector to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation. We know where we want to take this company, and we're making meaningful progress and executing those plans. I'm pleased what our team's accomplished, but I know we're still in the early innings. This morning, we announced we've successfully completed our acquisition of Sensus, a global leader in smart meters, network technologies and advanced data analytics. As I explained in August, this business is squarely aligned with our strategy of becoming a leading provider of systems intelligent solutions to our customers, which we laid out at our Investor Day last year. Their portfolio includes a type of advanced technologies that are fueling the transition of the water sector to smart infrastructure. The transaction closing process was smooth with no unexpected hurdles in the various regulatory reviews. Our highly successful debt offering, it was 10 times oversubscribed, was a sign of great confidence in Xylem and in this transaction. Our teams did a great job all around in bringing this deal to a prompt close. Now we're focused on accelerating the integration process, so we can realize the full value of this combination. I'll come back to the integration in a few moments. We had another announcement today. And I'm speaking of our acquisition of Visenti, which we completed in October as well. Visenti, based in Singapore, has developed a suite of products and services that focus on increasing the productivity of water distribution networks. They primarily target the perennial challenge of leak detection, pressure management and water quality monitoring and the distribution network. While small, this company's solutions are complementary to both the Xylem and Sensus portfolio. We know them well. We entered into a strategic partnership in 2012 at the request of the Singapore Public Utilities Board. The Public Utilities Board, which is widely recognized as the definitive thought leader in the water space, asked us to partner with them to pilot a comprehensive solution to monitor the drinking water network throughout Singapore, which was highly successful. Now that they are part of Xylem with a global support and infrastructure we bring to the table, we will help them scale their business. I'll have more comments on the Visenti business in a few moments as well. Now let's review our third quarter results. Our teams, once again, delivered a solid performance in a very mixed economic environment. While organic revenue was flat year-over-year, strong execution and accelerated productivity initiatives help drive 90 basis points of margin expansion and 10% earnings growth. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially boosted by some large new orders in emerging markets. Overall, we had expected the oil and gas sector trajectory to begin to level off, but to our disappointment, the declines continued and we now expect that trend to extend at least into next year. This continues to impact our dewatering business as well as portions of our analytics portfolio. This prolonged weakness is having a disproportionate impact on regions that are highly dependent on commodities as a source of funding for other industries, such as the Middle East. We saw this play out in our results this quarter as the major project work there dropped off significantly. On the positive side, the opening of our new factory in Dubai last month will enable us to be a more active participant in the book-and-bill business, because we now can meet the quick lead times required by customers. Let me address some other market conditions. We are operating in certain end markets that are experiencing growth. Public utility is our best example at the moment, and we are aggressively going after the business and in many regions capturing share. And with the addition of Sensus, we are increasing our exposure of this sector with a broader portfolio of solutions and enhancing our leadership position in one of the faster going higher margin areas of the industry. In the quarter, we delivered 10% growth in the global public utility sector and that momentum is continuing. The U.S. continue to be the hottest market in the space. And there, we generated a 25% increase over last year's performance of 7% growth. This growth reflects the realization of pent-up demand in this space. But I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. They are taking nothing for granted, and that is evident in their performance in capturing share. The industrial segment, which represents our largest end market, is a different story. This sector continue to be a challenge, and we are closely monitoring a mixed macro-environment. We realize that we cannot control market conditions, however, we are taking steps to mitigate some of the impact. We're evaluating conditions by subsector and by region, so we can optimize our cost bases and ensure that we are well positioned when market conditions begin to improve. Moving to our emerging markets. Overall, our revenue was down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by a decline in the Middle East. One of the bright spots was China, where we generated growth in our infrastructure business. Additionally, our team is building backlog there with sequential improvement of 19% primarily in the Water Infrastructure business. They delivered a significant win in the quarter of $13 million for our Wedeco ozone systems that will be used in two pulp and paper plants. This will be the first ozone bleaching application in this sector in China, and opens the door to new potential business with a far more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution than was previously used. This is driven in part by China's increasing regulations for more sustainable practices in industrial operations. Another noteworthy region is India. There, we continued to deliver on the $39 million custom pump job that we won last year in the third quarter. This installation will be used for the world's largest lift irrigation system, which will bring water to farms serving thousands of rural villages. As we noted when we announced the win, this major project is providing a sound foundation for other similar projects in power and irrigation. This past quarter, we won a $37 million contract for a pumping station that will be part of a $1 billion mega lift irrigation project in the Telangana region in southern India. This project will ship substantially over the course of 2017. Once again, this success was the result of strong collaboration between our local team in India and our flight custom pump team in the U.S. They customize the design to meet the customers' exact specifications and ensure that the complex solution to be sourced completely with local supply. As we've done all year, our focus on cost controls and increasing productivity remains steadfast. In the third quarter, we delivered $35 million in gross cost reductions, which brings our year-to-date total to $87 million. Our global procurement group continues to lever Xylem scale to deliver sustainable savings across multiple categories. These actions helped to mitigate some of the impact of the challenging market conditions we faced. In keeping with our productivity for growth mindset, these savings also funded strategic investments for growth. Additionally, we are accelerating targeted restructuring actions that will deliver incremental savings in the fourth quarter and greater savings in 2017. These results position us well to easily surpass our full-year goal for cost savings and productivity improvements. Finally, at the bottom line, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the quarter, a 10% increase over last year's result. We also generated $121 million in free cash flow, resulting in a 166% conversion rate. Now please turn to slide 5, and I'll update you on the status of our acquisition integration. We're thrilled to now have Sensus as part of a larger Xylem. Sensus is a complementary partner that significantly broadens our offerings with the type of systems intelligent solutions that move our portfolio up the technology curve. This instantly increases the value we can bring to customers with solutions that target some of their most urgent challenges. The need to increase energy efficiency, improve lifecycle cost and extract actionable insights from data to optimize their operations, these are all high on the priority list of customer needs that we are now better equipped to meet. Together, we will strengthen our industry leadership position, particularly as we expand in the new markets, leveraging Xylem's global reach and the strong customer relationships cultivated by both companies. With the deal closed, we are focused on executing our integration smoothly and efficiently, so we can realize the full value of the combinations. Our teams have already been collaborating for several weeks and now that work will accelerate. Today, Sensus will operate as an independent business unit and will be reported as a new segment. Randy Bays, who's been serving as President of Sensus, will continue to lead the business reporting to me. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we enable greater collaboration across our sales teams and showing that we capture new opportunities while not disrupting the existing business. On the R&D side, our teams will immediately collaborate to identify areas where work can be combined or aligned to accelerate progress and fuel the substantial revenue synergies we expect to deliver. The Sensus business is increasing our exposure to more attractive end markets such as public utility through the fast growing smart metering sector. In the last two quarters, Sensus delivered top line growth of more than 10%. This gives us even greater confidence in the 6% to 7% compounded revenue growth rate that we projected through 2020, when we announced the deal back in August. With two months remaining in the calendar year, we expect Sensus to add about $0.01 to our full-year adjusted EPS. In 2017, their contribution is expected to increase our earnings by at least 5% or approximately $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share. We are still early in the process of evaluating the full range of possible synergies, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver cost savings of at least $50 million and revenue synergies in excess of $100 million by 2020, which we communicated when we announced the deal. With Visenti, we have a business that is highly complementary to both Xylem and Sensus' offerings. In fact, the company was in Sensus' own acquisition pipeline. Visenti operates in the $2 billion market of asset management solutions, which is growing in the high single-digit rate. One of the specific challenges that Visenti's technical solutions address is what's known as non-revenue water. This term refers to treated drinking water that is lost through leaks, theft or other causes. Globally, roughly 30% of treated drinking water is lost every year. Said another way, for public utility that is 30% of their product just dripping away. As utilities and communities focus their resources on improving the resiliency of their infrastructure, this is an urgent insolvable challenge that we are now well positioned to help them address. Furthermore, the addition of Visenti's highly expert data scientist, along with Sensus' capabilities in this area, will further accelerate our overall R&D work across Xylem in the area of systems intelligence. This is yet another compelling demonstration of how M&A can serve as a proxy for R&D. This was an attractive deal at $8 million plus earn-out opportunities. Given its relative size, we currently expect it to be neutral to both 2016 and 2017 results. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our final outlook for the year.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Organic revenues were flat in the quarter. We generated a point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts. We had another quarter of strong growth in public utilities, which help mitigate increasing softness in the industrial end markets. Looking at our end markets in more detail, the outstanding growth we've seen in public utility continued for the fifth consecutive quarter. Globally, we grew at 10% in this sector during the third quarter, reflecting our leadership position and ongoing strong execution in which we are capturing share and delivering value to our customers. Revenues also grew 2% in both commercial and residential building services in the quarter. Offsetting the growth in these end markets was a 7% decline in our industrial markets, including softer than expected revenues in our dewatering and analytics businesses. I'll cover these challenges further in my overview of our segment performance. Regionally, Western Europe grew 3% in the third quarter with modest growth across most of our businesses and end markets. The U.S. market was up 1%, as strong performance in public utilities was largely offset by weakness in the industrial markets. Our emerging market results were mixed. Overall, we saw a 4% decline in the quarter, which included a tough prior-year comparison of 9% growth. Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter reflecting both the timing of large prior-year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region. China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the quarter sequential improvement in revenues and orders as well as positive year-over-year growth in our Water Infrastructure segment, reflecting what we believe is a slow but steady recovery in this market. India was a bright spot, delivering strong growth up 67% driven primarily by our continued execution on the large custom pump project that Patrick mentioned. Shifting gears, our teams did an outstanding job expanding operating margin by 90 basis points to 14.6%. Our initiatives around continuous improvement, and business simplification continue to create significant value for the company. In the quarter, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our costs by $35 million, resulting in 390 basis points of margin improvement. This included $4 million in savings from the restructuring actions we executed earlier this year. These savings more than offset 180 basis points of cost inflation, and funded 90 basis points of strategic investments. Given the ongoing weak demand we're facing in the industrial end market, we're accelerating actions to mitigate the near-term impact and position the business for further margin expansion as conditions improve. Acquisitions negatively impacted operating margins by 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting in part non-cash amortization cost associated with purchase accounting. Given the challenges we faced during the quarter in our industrial markets, very pleased with our team's performance in delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to slide 7 and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $604 million, up 2% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the $13 million treatment order, which Patrick highlighted earlier. It also includes the $37 million custom pump order in India, which offset a similar large project award last year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $598 million, down approximately 5% year-over-year, but improving quarter sequentially by 10%. It's worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up 22% from this time last year. This trend gives us confidence that the municipal market will remain a source of growth for the foreseeable future. Revenues of $554 million, represent a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $8 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. In the U.S., the segment grew 6% overall. Our public utility business grew 25%, surpassing a very strong first half growth rate of 22%. This growth was partially offset by significant challenges in our dewatering business, including double-digit declines directly tied to the oil and gas market and a 15% reduction in equipment sales to distributors for reducing their investments in fleet inventory. Western Europe grew 2% overall, driven by another solid quarter in the UK where our teams drove 14% growth capturing opportunities as we continue through the AMP6 cycle. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of project deliveries across Europe as well as lower public utility demand in France. Emerging markets declined by 6% overall, driven by substantial slowing in the Middle East and Latin American markets. These challenges were partially offset by a significant positive contribution from India, with revenues up more than 80% and China returned to growth in the quarter, posting a 3% increase, a positive trend that we expect will continue. The prolonged decline in oil and gas prices is significantly impacting the level of government and industrial spend in the Middle East, where revenues for the segment were down 42%. Revenues in Latin America were down 16% in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of prior-year projects in our dewatering and analytics businesses and to a lesser extent still challenging market conditions in the mining sector. Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.9% as productivity initiatives offset cost inflation and unfavorable mix as well as funding increased strategic growth investments. Our productivity programs drove 380 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting a 100-basis-point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year savings from these actions. Inflation was a 180-basis-point headwind, and we had 70 basis points of unfavorable mix largely driven by the declines in our higher margin dewatering and analytics products. Acquisitions were also a 40-basis-point drag on margin in the quarter. Applied Water booked orders of $342 million in the quarter, flat organically over the prior year. This segment entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $177 million, most of which is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $343 million, down 1% organically versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 4% with strong growth in the commercial building services and residential markets. Here we continue to benefit from energy efficient product launches and our enhanced regional sales capabilities. Segment revenue was up 1% in our emerging markets primarily due to 7% growth in Latin America, which more than offset sales declines in the Middle East. In the U.S., revenues were down 4% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial revenues, which declined 9%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in oil and gas and to a lesser extent light industrial attributable to lower OEM demand in food and beverage and decreased stocking levels by marine distributors. Delays in the release of projects in the U.S. commercial building sector drove lower year-over-year revenues, but were partially offset by growth in residential groundwater applications. Segment operating margin increased 180 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove an impressive 410-basis-point margin improvement representing a 30-basis-point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year cost savings. This more than offset 170 basis points of cost inflation and 90 basis points from strategic growth investments, which included the localization of product assembly in the Middle East. Now let's turn to slide 9 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $659 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter and in connection with the Sensus and Visenti acquisitions, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close these transactions. We also issued $900 million of long-term U.S. notes, which were split into two tranches. The first tranche was for $500 million with a 10-year maturity and a 3.25% interest rate. The second tranche was for $400 million, a 30-year maturity at a 4.375% interest rate. As Patrick indicated, we were 10 times oversubscribed reflecting investor support for the deal and our company's strong financial profile. To complete the deal financing, we placed $200 million of short-term European debt and $200 million of commercial paper, which we expect to repay over the next 12 months to 18 months. Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain our investment grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 months to 18 months. Now back to a few more cash items for the quarter. During the third quarter, we invested $28 million for capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $121 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 166% in the quarter, and we expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. We also improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Now please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we're lowering our full-year organic growth expectation from what was previously a 2% to 3% range, to 1.5%, to reflect both our third quarter performance and changes to certain end market assumptions, which I'll cover more detail in the next slide. This reduction includes nearly a full point decline due to weaker conditions in the Middle East. Secondly, we're updating our top line guidance to reflect greater-than-expected foreign exchange headwinds. Lastly, we are incorporating the expected contribution from the Sensus acquisition. This includes a $140 million revenue that we expect this business to generate in November and December. Along with the transactions we announced earlier this year, we now expect acquisitions to add approximately 5% of revenue growth to our full-year 2016 performance. Following another quarter of strong execution and productivity delivered by our team and anticipated contributions in the fourth quarter, we're forecasting full-year operating margin of 13.4% including 50 basis points of dilution attributable to acquisitions. Excluding the acquisition dilution, our operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points over the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our previous EPS midpoint of $2.03, while narrowing our EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.04. Our new guidance reflects the net impact of the Sensus acquisition, offset by $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange translation in addition to other volume and cost savings adjustments. Mark will provide more color on these impacts in a few minutes. Now please turn to slide 11 and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility at 33% total revenue before the impact of Sensus' added to the portfolio. Over the first three quarters, we generated very strong organic revenue growth up 12% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect growth to moderate particularly as we lap our very strong fourth quarter performance of last year when we grew 8%. We expect continued momentum in this market to generate a mid-to-high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of our performance to-date and fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate public utility growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, which is higher than our previous guidance. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues, full-year organic revenue is expected to be down mid single-digits, weaker than we previously anticipated. We now expect declines in the oil and gas sector to continue at least into next year. Moving to commercial. After first half growth of 3%, we delivered a 2% increase in the third quarter. Our teams continue to see relatively healthy levels of design in coating activity, which could provide for some incremental growth in 2017. However, in the immediate term, based on actual order input rates, we believe that growth will remain in the flat to low single-digit range. Now this global outlook includes some geographic differences. For example, we expect a more stable growth environment in the U.S. institutional market and continued growth across most European geographies. China should benefit from the lapping of lower prior year comparisons. The Middle East, however, is expected to face more challenging market conditions. In residential, we now project full-year revenue to be down low single-digits. Agriculture will likely be down mid single-digits. Now while these sectors experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, we did see some slight improvement in the third quarter. Now please turn to slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the outlook. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement in business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and channel partners have when doing business with Xylem. Our ability to operate our business in a more aligned fashion with improved processes and by leveraging our global scale is a significant opportunity for us at Xylem. For example, our centralized global procurement organization was formed less than two years ago, and today, is delivering savings and improved supplier quality in terms at a significantly higher level of performance. After posting record savings of $64 million last year, the team is well on its way to delivering $80 million in 2016, representing a 25% year-over-year improvement. Procurement savings have provided 200 basis points of operating margin expansion over the first three quarters and are expected to drive nearly 260 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year. Lean and Six Sigma are also gaining traction this year as we build more capability throughout the organization. This will be a significant value creation tool for years to come. As for this year, we anticipate completing more than 100 kaizen events, which will provide approximately $35 million in full-year savings. We anticipate an acceleration in savings from these activities as we close out the year given the increased velocity of our kaizen events as well as the leverage from higher fourth quarter volume. Beyond cost savings, this program is meaningfully improving the speed and service performance with our customers. For example, year-to-date, our on-time delivery has improved by 400 basis points while also enabling us to reduce customer lead times. We also expect to see an increase in cost savings attributable to our business simplification activities. During the third quarter, we realized $4 million in restructuring cost savings bringing our year-to-date total to $9 million. As a result of recent actions, we now anticipate $7 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, nearly double the benefit from the programs executed earlier this year. These actions will help us mitigate some of the near-term demand weakness we are anticipating in our industrial markets and will provide additional run rate benefits in 2017. In summary, our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification has provided substantial benefits to-date. These actions will enable us to continue to deliver margin expansion, while also positioning us more competitively with our customers. Please turn to slide 13. As shown on this slide, we're maintaining the midpoint of our full-year EPS guidance at $2.03 per share, while narrowing the range to $2.02 to $2.04 per share. While there was no change to the midpoint of our full-year guidance, there are a number of factors which will be impacting our fourth quarter. Relative to prior guidance, we are reflecting the net impact of our revised revenue outlook, including $0.01 unfavorable impact from recent foreign exchange fluctuations. At the operating margin level, we expect higher productivity gains and incremental cost savings to provide 30 basis points of margin expansion and $0.05 of EPS benefit. We expect Sensus revenues to be $140 million for the two months ending December 31. We also expect Sensus operating income to be $0.04 accretive to fourth quarter earnings including our preliminary estimate of $0.03 of non-cash amortization costs for intangibles, which has a dilutive impact on Xylem's overall operating margins. We will provide an update to the expected impact from non-cash intangible amortization on our next call after we complete the initial purchase price valuation for the opening balance sheet. Finally, fourth quarter interest expense will increase $8 million or $0.03 per share, reflecting higher borrowings to fund the acquisition. Please turn to slide 14 where I'll briefly summarize our key fourth quarter assumptions. Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter, with Water Infrastructure anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2% and Applied Water expected to be flat to down 1%. As I mentioned, Sensus is expected to add approximately $140 million of revenues in the quarter. Operating margin is expected to range between 14.6% and 14.9%, including 130 basis points of dilution from this year's acquisitions, which is primarily due to non-cash amortization of intangibles. And earnings are expected to range between $0.65 per share and $0.67 per share. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So, overall, we continue to deliver on the investment thesis we unveiled at our Investor Day last fall. We continue to benefit from differentiated end market exposure and are delivering above market growth in the public utility sector. Our strong and sustained commitment to continuous improvement and business simplification efforts is driving margin expansion. And we are accelerating capital deployment to create greater shareholder value. Now, operator, we can open it up to questions.
Operator: The floor is now open for your questions. Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Let me start with, I guess, the big one, news yesterday that a large asset in your world is becoming available. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that debt repayments is the priority. Does that – and integrating Sensus preclude doing anything big on the M&A front, and how big would you go?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Well, thanks for the question, Jim. First of all, we clearly don't comment on speculation on transactions, et cetera. I will say that our number one focus right now is to deliver on our full-year commitments here in the fourth quarter, make sure that we're well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2017. And all that, of course, includes a very successful integration of Sensus, which we're very excited about. So, I keep my comments to that.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. If I can follow up on specifically what you're seeing in dewatering. I know that some reads are stabilizing in upstream, anything that's tied to rig counts, et cetera. But you guys are saying that headwinds may persist into next year. Curious if there's anything specific to dewatering. And how should we be thinking about the margin implications for (39:40) as well as analytics? Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. No. Great question. So, pardon my cold here. So, I think that we're not seeing anything different, I would say, from our peers or others in the space as it relates to a more dour view on the impact of oil and gas. I think we're just trying to be, quite frankly, we're trying to be conservative here as best we can on what the outlooks could be. This is a fairly short cycle business for us in dewatering. And so, it's kind of hand-to-mouth in terms of what rental rates are, et cetera. What we really saw in the quarter that was a bit more of a surprise for us, was the pull back by our distributors in terms of them buying pumps from us. So cutting back on their capital spend. And when speaking to them, trying to get a feel for how much of that is a near-term blip versus a new baseline and it's very difficult for them to get a read right now on the markets themselves. So, we're saying it carries through 2017, but that's our best guess at this stage. But I would say there's nothing unique about our position in the space relative to others.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And certainly those are higher margin product sales. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we would expect that to have roughly 30-basis-point impact on operating margins.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And lastly I would say is, the team in dewatering, they're not exclusively tagged to oil and gas or mining. There is a very healthy mini market out there as well. And I know that Dave Flinton who leads the business, he and the team are driving aggressively to diversify our exposure in that business to capture some of those non-oil and gas opportunities, but those are not quick turn, things that happen within a month or two and that's what we're really focusing on as we head into 2017.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. That's helpful. I'll get back in queue.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, would like to dig a little bit into the Water Infrastructure. It was nice to see continued strength in municipal. But one of the things that jumped out at me was some of the weakness in analytical. And a lot of people might think that's pretty resilient. So what's causing some of the softness there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I would say first, Deane, it was the industrial side of the analytic exposure that we got hit the hardest with and we saw that consistent with a couple of our bigger competitors, the same kind of market downturn. And it was also very concentrated in North America here in the U.S. I'd say, U.S. industrial was the primary impact. And then, we had a reasonably large project that we shipped out to Brazil, couple million dollars last year. So that was about a half of the decline that we saw with that tough compare on that large one-time Brazil project.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then, I liked all the color on the productivity initiative that you've got going on. Could you remind us where the goal is in terms of operating margin upside?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, and again this is all separate from the impact since it has for us, which should be additive to what we're talking about here. And we'll talk about the framework for Sensus further and the timing around when we'll give kind of new three-year and five-year outlook for the company, but our base business of Xylem, excluding Sensus, we believe that there is 300 basis points to 400 basis points of operating margin expansion. And that is net of potential increases in R&D investment. Now, those investments in R&D will not be as steep as they were before because of the acquisition of Sensus, and we'll leveraging their capabilities and investing a bit more in that area, but it was 300 basis points to 400 basis points. And I'm pleased to say, Deane, that, where we're guiding to the full year, if you take out the impacts of the purchase accounting from acquisitions, we will have delivered right at 100 basis points of that margin expansion this year. So, I feel we're well on our way here and still in the early stages of that productivity focus.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's real helpful. And then just last question for me, a little more color on this acquisition of Visenti. There's been such focus on non-revenue water, and you cited that 30% of leakage globally, and all municipalities talk about that. And that's one of the sources of fresh water, if you will. It's just fixing those leaks. So, I'm intrigued about the technology, because most people are either talking about outside the pipe, ultrasonic pipe detection or inside the pipe detection. What's Visenti's edge? And does this Singapore project – will that serve as a reference site for you?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes, it's certainly does, Deane. And I know you're extremely knowledgeable of the Singapore PUB. So you can imagine what the reference point is on a global scale, when you got Singapore PUB as the incubator to drive this. And so, Visenti has already diversified away. They've got a number of other customers in other geographies and quite frankly have more requests to their services than they have the resources to do right now, which is really part of the backdrop for our partnership and acquisition of them. But they've got a couple of different software development capabilities that are able to not only gather the data from inside the pipe using ultrasound techniques and other opportunities, but it's also their data science and data analytic capabilities that they model that data that's coming back. And their ability to do that 24x7 irrespective of what the weather is, is another opportunity that they leverage. They are unique. And we do believe that there's an opportunity here to take this well beyond some of the emerging markets. We're actually going to plan. It's a good time for me to say, we're actually going to be planning to do an Investor Day, Deane, in very early Q2, down in Raleigh-Durham. And we will be sure to have the team from Visenti there as well, to be able to showcase that technology along with what we're getting here with Sensus.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Terrific. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Ryan.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): I had a question. Wanted to push on the public utility space a little bit, and get some of the drivers there. I know that you seem to be outperforming peers there, and I want to kind of just dig on where that's coming from. I know you talk about a lot of the internal improvement, but you're also on a parallel journey to improve your channel footprint. And I'm wondering whether there's any impact coming from those efforts, whether it be new distributor alignments or any other channel issues that are helping to drive your really strong numbers in public utility.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. I mean, we're obviously very pleased with what the team has continued to do there. And as we said earlier, the funnel, the bidding pipeline continues to grow very nicely, I mean, up 22% versus same time a year ago. So, I think one of the drivers is that, we are getting better visibility into the market as to the project funnel and pipeline, and we're improving our win rates. And part of that is, I think, the impact of us being able to leverage this integration of our commercial teams looking across the entire public utility offering. So, a lot of that lead generation is helping us in a number of geographies across the board. Secondly, I think, as we mentioned before, given our substantial market share and leadership position in that space, we stand to benefit disproportionately in a rising tide environment. And so, we get a lot more looks, I think, than many of our competitors do. And that's really driven as much by our large installed base. And so, as the munis are reinvesting in refurbishment of their existing infrastructure, it's highly unusual that they would swap out or switch out an entire pump network. And so, we get the disproportionate benefit of that replacement work. And the same on the aftermarket service and repair side, we've seen continued record levels of break and fix business, especially here in North America that continues to benefit us. And then lastly, we're in the early stages of some really exciting new product rollouts. We launched a new product called (48:21), which is really not in these numbers, but gives us great confidence about market share capture as we head into 2017 as well.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I wanted to build upon Deane's question regards to Visenti. And I know you mentioned earlier, obviously, you can't comment on M&A specifically. But conceptually, as you look at that leak detection non-revenue water space as a huge opportunity, but obviously Visenti, a pretty small asset without a lot of materiality near-term in the numbers. Do you believe that that's a sufficient platform for you to grow the business you think you can grow in that sector? Or do you think you'll need at some point to go out and build on that with further M&A in that sector?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question. So, I do think that over time, we would not limit our efforts here to purely organic R&D. And so we continue to cultivate M&A pipeline. But having said that, our focus right now is squarely on integrating Sensus. What's encouraging to me also is that Visenti was actually in Sensus' M&A pipeline. So there is already a complementary benefit there that we believe we can leverage, and we're going to learn more about that over the coming months. So I wouldn't be foreshadowing any meaningful M&A here in the near-term as we focus on integrating Sensus, but I certainly would not rule out M&A over time here in this space.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I could just follow up on the industrial business, firstly on the oil and gas side there. I mean, as you said, it's a pretty short cycle business. The rig count has improved. They need water. Does that imply that there's idle assets out there that your customers are utilizing rather than buying or renting new assets from you? And just any color you have into that market and why you didn't see that improvement in the quarter.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. Now, that was clearly the surprise, one of the two surprises was that, and of course, what happened in the Middle East, so suddenly in Saudi was the second surprise for us. And those two together cost us well more than a point of organic revenue growth in the quarter, which is where we messed. So, yeah, there certainly are idled assets that are out there that oil and gas customers are using as well as mining. But it's also the impact, Nathan, of again just a mothballing and idling of either mines and/or fracing sites. And so, those two things together were the impact. So, what we really saw in the quarter was our indirect channel, the distributors pulling back on their CapEx spend so dramatically down 15% in the quarter. That caught us a bit by surprise as well. And we're trying to model that into our Q4 outlook and just trying to get a feel for what that might look for 2017. This might be a good opportunity to that point, Nathan, for me to perhaps share a little bit of the framework of how we're thinking about 2017. And if I start with the end markets, based on what we see today, we expect these mix market conditions to continue into 2017. And again, that includes a really robust public utility sector, but it will be against some tougher comparisons given what our full year growth is this year, but we would still consider that to be very, very attractive. We would also expect a sluggish environment to continue in industrial for the reasons that I just articulated here, perhaps that's conservative, but we're trying to be conservative here. I say, at this point, it would be hard to see organic growth for our historical Xylem businesses i.e., ex-Sensus, beyond low single digits, but we're obviously going to learn a lot more as we get through Q4. We're going to be watching order trends closely, particularly in the Middle East and industrial. We're clearly taking actions to manage cost as we've done throughout this year, but I probably wrap up the 2017 with what we do know. We know that we're going to get significant contribution to revenue from Sensus, which given its recent performance, should itself grow at least 6% to 7%, which is in line with the long-term CAGR that we laid out back in August, when we announced the deal. What we also know is at the bottom line we expect to get $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS accretion from Senses, now that's net of purchase accounting impacts. And then lastly, we expect our margin expansion pace to continue. Again, if you exclude the non-cash acquisition impacts from purchase accounting and you think about procurement, Lean-Six Sigma and business simplification benefits, so we expect that margin expansion right in pace to continue. And we also know that we're going to get $0.08 of carryover savings from restructuring that we've already taken this year that will flow into next year. So, hopefully to those lifts and that gives you a little bit of a framework for how we're at least thinking initially about 2017.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Maybe if we could just talk a little bit more about the Middle East. I mean, I think you said 29% down in the third quarter. Do you have the comps handy for the first half of the year in the Middle East? I can't imagine with oil priced at $50, that's likely to get any better in that geography in the near-term. I'm just wondering if you've got (53:55) the comp.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, through three quarters, we're down 4% year-over-year. So it was up, and then it took a nosedive in the third quarter. Now, part of that year-over-year decline was not a surprise to us, because we had a couple of large projects last year, large on a relative basis for our revenue there that we knew was going to be a tough comp. And that was roughly about half of what that year-over-year decline in the third quarter was, so we expected some of that. The real impact for us in the quarter, and I was just over there for our brand opening of our manufacturing facility and met with a number of our channel partners as well as with some customers in Saudi. And for those of you that are following the news there, you know that they're going through some series budget constraints right now. And the common theme across pretty much all sectors is the common kind of down 20%, 30% in the quarter. I'm not sure what the kind of symmetry is there between that and what we saw, but for example, the Saudi government just about a month ago announced that they are doing an across-the-board 20% reduction in all government employee salary immediately, and that's being driven by some of their funding constraints. And so, we saw that pullback in the quarter. We're being told that it will come back, and that it's temporary. But right now, until we see an improvement in our order book there over the course of fourth quarter, we're trying to take a prudent view here on what kind of a drag that might have on our overall industrial growth.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great color, Patrick. Thanks very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. No problem.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. When I look at muni, like the kind of above-normal trend growth that you've been seeing there, last year was good, this year even better. You talk about the quoting funnel up 22%. But given where comps are, given what's in backlog in the actual orders right now in that for muni, are they supportive of incremental growth on current rates?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: You mean, faster growth rates than what we're currently seeing?
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Well, I mean, it's going to be strong next year on the gross basis, we know that. But are backlog and current orders suggestive of incremental growth like acceleration from here or kind of staying at a really solid level.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I think it stays at a solid level. What we would say right now based on what we've seen, again, this is not in any way guidance. But we would say as we lap this year's comparison, we would expect it to be somewhere around mid single-digit growth organically through 2017. Again, we'll have a better feel for that as we kind of wrap up our backlog at the end of Q4. But based on what we see right now, that's where we'd spot it.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes more sense. And in the Middle East, across your portfolio, if current order rates, let's just say, hold from where they are today through 2017, what kind of headwind is that into next year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We probably – it'd be premature for me to give you a specific number on one region just yet given how quickly things moved. I mean, I wouldn't suggest that we're talking about the type of drop that we saw in Q3 by any means. It's probably looking more like where we are year-to-date, but again, we have a lot more work to do to make sure we have a good handle on what's happening. Specifically in Saudi is the big driver that we're focused on.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And how big is Middle East right now in terms of like total sales?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. So, a little less than 4% of our historical Xylem revenue.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Last question on Sensus. What about the parts that are non-water? What's your view on those pieces of business?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We like them very much. So, as I've said, and I know, Deane's somewhere smiling right now when he hears me get ready to say, we're not going to be dogmatic about water. This is the perfect example of that. So, on a combined basis, we'll still have less than 10% of our total revenue that is somewhere other than water. But the electric, gas and lighting businesses, really all the businesses of Sensus are participating in very attractive end markets. They're growing very nicely. They're very attractive from a profit standpoint. And quite frankly, in many cases, these are common utilities that provide both water, electric and gas. And so, there would be a dissynergy there that wouldn't make any sense at all for us to think about any different of approach. And these are also market leading positions they've got. So, we're very attracted to the entire portfolio.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Robert.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. I just wanted to clarify a comment earlier and appreciate the initial 2017 framework. I think you said on the margin side expecting kind of the pace to continue. So, I think you're looking for about up 50 bps this year. Is that kind of what the base case should be right now for next year too?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Well, I would again stopping short of giving a specific number here because we feel – we're very early in our planning process here, but I would certainly be pushing us to keep the pace we are right now. And again, I'm talking about that, excluding acquisition impacts of purchase accounting, so that would be closer to 100 basis points this year, if you separate the acquisition impacts.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: We've got a lot of momentum on the global procurement Lean-Six Sigma, those events are ramping up and same on the business simplification side, we've taken a number of actions that'll carry over into the next year as well, so good momentum on just the cost part.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Right, right. It sounds like the real challenge, I mean is just Sensus, I think with the amortization comes in at what like a mid single-digit op margin?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: It's higher single digits.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. Okay. And then I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on industrial. It sounds like the pressures are getting worse in oil and gas and mining, where they have been. But I think some comments in the prepared remarks suggest they're also spreading, I think you mentioned process for food and bev and marine. I guess, a lot of that's in the Applied Water side. Just maybe a little color there.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Robert, I wouldn't read too much into a spreading into the general industrial sector kind of what we call light industrial. We felt a little bit of weakness there in the quarter, but it was a rounding error relative to the impact that we saw from really two specific areas. And that was the impact of our distributors on the dewatering side heavily tied to oil and gas, and secondly, what happened in Saudi and the Middle East. Those are really the two new things for us in the quarter that have us thinking a little differently about our guide for this year, and so in terms of our revenue number. I wouldn't read anything into the rest of the light industrial sector.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Got you. And maybe just finally on commercial, there's been growing concern about what's happening in the non-res market. It sounded like maybe you saw some incremental slowing there. Can you just clarify what you're seeing in U.S. non-res?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We still continue to see very attractive bidding and quoting activity both on our direct channel as well as indirect. And again, I've had an opportunity to spend some time with those folks as well. And I think, they're all feeling fine around the U.S. sector. It really is some timing of products being awarded. The funnel looks attractive, but after two years of pretty constant growth, we saw some slowing there in the quarter, keeping a close eye on it as we get to Q4, but it was still up a couple percent in the quarter, which is down from where it'd been tracking through the first half of the year. So, again, keeping a close eye, but nothing there. The other piece obviously was the weakness that we've seen in China. There's continued to be a slowdown in China. We wouldn't say it's getting any worse. It's really just flat line. And as we get to the end of this year, we'll lap that comparison and we'll be talking about net positive growth for China all in.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Any particular verticals in the non-res U.S. where you saw the slowing?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We saw a little bit of slowing in institutional in the quarter. And again, that's why we – those typically are larger projects at least on a relative basis. And we saw some movement and timing around that in the quarter.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Morning, folks. And congrats on getting the Sensus deal done.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Very early here. Maybe we need to wait to get out to Raleigh as well, but any updated thoughts on synergies there? Obviously, a little bit of a different channel for water meters. Just what are your thoughts broadly?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I appreciate the question. And we will be sharing in our Investor Day down at Raleigh-Durham, which again I'll say is going to early Q2. That'll be an opportunity for us to really showcase the progress we have on integration. We're thinking about synergy, specific targets that we'll be committing to in our three-year and five-year outlook for book cost and revenue. But, I would say, as we mentioned back in the call in August, we're very confident that we're going to get at least $50 million in cost synergies. And as I've said in the last call, I'd be disappointed if we didn't have more than $100 million of revenue synergies over that timeframe as well through 2020. The areas that are really the biggest opportunity for us, on the cost side, big opportunity in the areas of procurement. And so, whether it'd be overlapping in supplier base, but also just using some of the tools that we put to use here at Xylem the last couple years. We expect the same kind of progress and momentum to be there on a combined spend basis with Sensus. There're also areas of opportunity in some of our back office functions and G&A support functions on a global scale. On the revenue side, it really is going to be focused. I would say if anything in our synergy planning team, I don't want to sound like the happy talking CEO here, but there were more revenue synergy opportunities than you could shake a stick at. The key was that their longer lead time, some of them, they're going to require R&D and engineering support from Sensus. And so, we're going to make sure that we're disciplined and balanced on how we think about those things, but they are really predominantly in areas such as: One, we've got a number of customers today in common, where they already own Sensus' FlexNet and data analytics solutions. But they only apply the data to the clean water side of the network and we have opportunities to now connect our devices on the waste water side to be able to provide similar solution to the customers for their challenges on waste water. Second is, they've got a number of big international projects that are out there that they're bidding on, that in some cases are with customers that are already customers of ours today that we hopefully are going to be able to help them leverage in some way. And third, we think there is opportunities to also leverage their data analytics capabilities across multiple parts of the Xylem portfolio to bring in some of that software-as-a-service opportunity across our existing business. So, these are longer lead times, but we are very excited both Xylem and Sensus about the opportunities here.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks. I think we'll look forward to Raleigh. And then just lastly, on leverage at 3.7 times, do you have a target there you'd like to get that too? Thanks.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We're going to get back to the mid-2s back to our target leverage. And we've been pretty clear stating that intention publicly certainly with the rating agencies.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thanks, folks.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We have reached our allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Thanks. So, thank you everybody for your interest and joining the call today. I know we've covered a lot of territory here, and you'll have your follow-up calls with Phil for any clarification. Look forward to meeting with many of you between now and our next earnings call, early next year. And as again, looking very much forward to the Investor Day down in Raleigh-Durham in early Q2. So, between now and then, safe travels, have great holidays, and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster than market growth as well as share gains in key regions. Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely, oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth. We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely, enhancing our customer-centric selling approach, leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners, improving our working capital efficiency, and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals, and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full-year commitments and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well. We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out of the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remains strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline. Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So, we are narrowing our full-year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth, to between 2% to 3%. We pleased with our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue, even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full-year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%. Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full-year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes. Please turn to slide five. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utilities helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets. Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand. Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter, was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there. The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing. But after seven consecutive quarters of growth, we were down in the second quarter. Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utilities. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though overall, we delivered 1% growth in the quarter. China continued to be soft, down 11% year-over-year, as we'd expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remains steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region. Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter. Finally, India continues to thrive, as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We have a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months. Coming back to Europe for a moment, I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the UK represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominately water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's five-year water infrastructure investment plan, known as the AMP cycle. Right now, the UK is in its sixth five-year AMP cycle, and we do not anticipate any significant changes. Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country, are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term on the markets we serve in the UK or, more broadly, across Europe. Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In a robust environment such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we receive commitments and when we receive the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of larger more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery, and this is a high quality problem. Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. water utility sector. Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the water utility business has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth of approximately 15%, with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging market regions. I'm particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement. Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our costs by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement. Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points. Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities, and localization of assembly and production in attractive faster growth regions. A couple of points on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved through our lean and Sig Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 Kaizen events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road. Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new eSourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first two online auctions. In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spend categories as well. As I said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth, while continuing to expand our operating margins. One other point, we are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year. Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion, north of 100% of net income. Our sharp focus on improving working capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis point year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide six and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter, when we had two major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million. Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we did see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June. Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind. We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses. In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in a healthy water and wastewater market. Western Europe grew 4%, driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the UK due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany partially offset by a decline in Southern Europe. Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East. Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets coupled with a softer than expected industrial CapEx environment drove mid single-digit declines in our industrial vertical. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14%, as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. Please turn to slide seven. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period, and entered the third quarter with total backlog of $180 million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat, organically, versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water and commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities. In the U.S., residential was down 5% primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine, and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market. Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets primarily due to the as expected 11% decline in China, driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development. Now, let's turn to slide eight to cover the company's cash flow and in financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23%, and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A, while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivable collections. Please turn to slide nine and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second half in a very strong public utility market. Following the strong execution in productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items. First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another $0.01 in the second half. And second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustments to the top ends of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance. Please turn to slide 10 and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility at 33% of total revenue. Through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13%, but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps. Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year. With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid single-digits, and as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized to-date and momentum heading into the back half. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications. While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect that performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior year headwinds in the oil and gas market. Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe, driven by new product demand. In addition, we expect the weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year. In our smallest two end-markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid single-digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half. Now, please turn to slide 11, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the second half outlook. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016. First shippable backlog, of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year, and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales. While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution and are delivering more quickly to our customers. Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. We see the second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August. We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives. In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million. With that, please turn to slide 12, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We delivered a solid first half of 2016, and I believe we're building strong momentum in our commercial execution, as well as achieving significant progress against our productivity initiatives. We know there's plenty more to do, but that leaves us even more optimistic about our potential for future growth. We will continue to increase our investments and strategic growth initiatives, including in the areas of innovation and technology as well as in our faster growing markets. Finally, we remain committed to driving a disciplined capital deployment strategy and continuing to improve our working capital performance, both important contributors to our growth. Now, operator, we can open it up to questions.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I was hoping to get some more color on this high quality problem regarding the surge in bidding activity. And then specifically, maybe you can size for us what this funnel looks like, maybe some color on what that mix is in this funnel. How much would be advanced water treatment, analytics and so forth. And then lastly, with this bidding outlook, what does this say about your 2017 visibility? Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Deane. So, yeah, let me just characterize what we're seeing here and I've seen this in the past, both in this market as well as even in the energy sector's when projects begin to heat up, which is obviously not the case right now in that sector. But what you saw is you've got constraints on a number of the E&C firms, the construction firms, tight labor market, obviously, some level of wage inflation there. They bid these projects, they put in there their budgetary quotes. The quotes sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were actually thinking at that point in time. They push it back, say rebid again. And although we've already been committed, the project and the order from a customer, the contractor, they can't officially place the order on us until they actually have that in hand. It typically, from my experience, takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict, but again, it is not unprecedented. And as I said, it is a high quality problem to have. And those rebids and the quotes don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. It really is just a matter of the timing of when the project actually flows through. When I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion and that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what 2017 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects. But overall, it's actually a very encouraging sign to see this level of healthy bidding and tension in the system, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And I'd add, Patrick, just to put an exclamation point on that. While it's up 15% year-over-year, we're up, we've seen 10% improvement quarter sequentially.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then just to clarify, when you talk about the preponderance of treatment systems in this pipeline, does the mix imply interest in your advanced treatment and your analytics?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: It does, it does, Deane. And it also is a bellwether for the overall wastewater market. And so, when you see healthy bidding pipelines here and project activity, that also bodes well for our Flygt submersible pumps. Anything that we're selling into the wastewater sector tend to benefit from that rising tide.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then just my last question, and Patrick, you and I have talked about this before, is when you see municipal with this type of strength, and we're not seeing any signs of slowing here, could you give us a perspective on how long these cycles run in municipal recoveries, both in the U.S. and in the developed markets?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, yeah, I would say that it's a bit more cyclical in the U.S. and the cycles there historically would run anywhere between five to 10 years on the wastewater side. I would say the recovery that we're seeing in Europe will be steadier, and we see that improvement obviously being driven largely right now by the AMP cycle in the UK, which is a five-year program, and we're in the second year of that. So, that's got a few more years of its tail behind it. And as I said earlier, we continue to see quarter sequential improvement in the project pipeline for China and each of the emerging markets. And so, we see a level of rebound happening there as well on the public utility side.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. This is all great to hear. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Actually, I want to just continue on that same vein and maybe get some, try to paraphrase your response to Deane there and make sure I understand. So basically, you're saying that despite the pretty extraordinary growth rates we're seeing in municipal, you don't feel like we're setting up tough comparisons for next year. You feel like the project pipeline or the bidding pipeline is sufficient that we can sustain a strong rate of growth despite these comps we're setting up here. Is that appropriate way to read what you're saying?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Ryan. I think the way I'd characterize it is we would consider, as we talked about at Investor Day, that once we got through this first year of extraordinary comps, that we would see somewhere in the healthy mid single-digit growth for 2017 and onward. Obviously, that can vary from year-to-year, could be a little stronger than that in certain years. But we do see the comps get tougher and they get tougher in the second half and that's why we've guided down to mid single-digit growth in the second half, averaging at a high single-digit for the year, but again, we would consider that kind of strong mid single-digit growth to be healthy and sustainable for the next number of years.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Great. And then a follow-up would be, one of the parts of the thesis I think for the company is that you've got a really strong innovation aspect in the company and the new product and development cycle is strong. Do you feel like part of what you're seeing in municipal is share gain? Because I think you're certainly posting growth rates that are in excess of what many of your peers are doing. Should we read that as share gain or is that just the project mix, or what's your view there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's a combination of the two. I would say that there is some benefit of projects in there from quarter-to-quarter, but I do feel confident that we are gaining share in certain key markets in the wastewater side. I think that is attributable to two things. One, there have been some products that we've launched that are entering the market and are being extremely well received, and we'll have more to talk about on that front in future calls here. But secondly, one of the benefits you have when you have a large share position like we do, especially on the submersible wastewater pump side of the market. By definition, as you see an increase in the level of repair and maintenance in kind of break and fix business, the person with the larger share does benefit disproportionally there in terms of growth, because it's our installed base that's being repaired and replaced. And these customers, as you well know, almost always replacing kind, and so we're certainly benefiting from that as well. That's also helped our mix because that's a higher margin business for us relative to the initial OEM install.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Nathan.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Patrick, I was hoping to get some more color on some of these growth outlooks for the rest of the year. With the 3% sequential decline in the third quarter, that kind of implies that it's kind of flat to maybe up 1% in the third quarter. And then you've got to see acceleration to something like 3% to 6% in the fourth quarter. We saw orders down 2% in the quarter, but you are sounding very confident that some of these projects are going to come through. Can you just talk about what visibility you have to that improvement in the fourth quarter to make that full year number?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Nathan, its Mark. I think part of this is just a function of the timing, part of it's natural ramp-up that we see in the fourth quarter on a regular basis, but some of this is timing and we've seen the delay from the first half of the year into the back half. And so some of this, we do expect to push out a little bit with probably more of that in Q4 than we'd expect to see in Q3.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: We also have the – we also have the visibility, Nathan, that you'll recall, that last year, we booked a $40 million project in India. That's shipping out this year well into the second half of the year as well. So that gives us confidence in the Q4 ramp as well as some other projects that we already have in the bag. So, part of it is normal seasonality in terms of Q3 being down, because we do have obviously some of the holiday periods in Europe and timing around that. And that volume tends to then be re-shipped in Q4 or shipped out in Q4. So, there's nothing there that alarms us at this point in time based on what we see in the funnel and what we've got backlogged.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: And then, I'd just add...
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: And I could cover this off, with you after the call, but you should end up with organic of about 2% here in the third quarter, and kind of 2%, 3% or so in the fourth quarter organically. We still expect FX headwinds over the course of the back half of the year and do still have some impact from acquisitions as well, but I can walk you through the details.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. The visibility on that India project kind of helps that. You talked about some of these public utility treatment projects pushing out of the first half into the second half. What visibility do you have to 3Q awards, 4Q awards, that kind of thing, and what do you view is the risk of that pushing out even a little further?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I think – we've got good visibility within particularly our new CRM tool, which is salesforce.com. So we've got a good tracking of the bidding pipeline and when these projects are likely to be awarded, what our confidence is in probability to win. We've got a whole rating system like many companies do on a project-by-project basis. So, we get very good visibility there. I would say that when you look at our guidance for the second half of the year, the scenario by which we would deliver the lower end of that 2% to 3%, would be if, in fact, there were some projects that were shifted out of Q4 into Q1. Again, we don't – we aren't calling that, we don't see that, but we thought we'd be prudent to at least build that into the lower end of the top line growth range.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I guess, that stuff's kind of beyond your control anyway.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just on the industrial performance and expectation, is it possible for you to split that out between the heavy industrial, mining, oil and gas, and the lighter industrial, that should be doing better and be less cyclical?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, Nathan, we got – of the 44% of industrial, I believe about 36% of that is what we call light industrial. So, it's not tied to production output, it's pharmaceutical plants, chemical, marine, food and beverage. It's not tied to commodities, it's separate. And that's been growing very steadily in that low single-digit rate, kind of tied to GDP. And it's been that way year-after-year, so no real change there. The 8% of our industrial which is tied to oil and gas and mining, 3% of that is oil and gas, 5% of that is mining. Oil and gas is basically going to be – it's going to be basically flattish in the second half of the year to maybe down low single-digits that were calling, depending upon the 2% to 3% range. And then mining, we're calling to be down a further 10% in the second half of the year. Again, in the case of mining, it's not tied to output. As long as the mine is up and running, it needs to be kept dry, this really is a reflection of some continued shuttering and mothballing of mining sites around the world. And so, that we don't have a lot of good visibility, I'd say, beyond a quarter out, because obviously, we're not there with our customers and know exactly what their decision is site-by-site. So we think we're being prudent by calling it down a further 10%.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is it fair to say the weakness in first half industrial revenue is largely tied to the heavy industrial side, and the improvement in the second half is just easier comps from last year?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That is correct.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Morning, thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Chip.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I wanted to stick with the logjam on the utility infrastructure side, just in terms of deployments. Is this a relatively small amount of larger projects, or is this more of a broad-based phenomenon? And then by geography, it's mostly in the U.S.?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes, it is a U.S. phenomenon. And I would say it is concentrated around some of the larger projects, some of the larger more complex projects that are out there. I mean I wouldn't suggest it's not happening also in some of the smaller ones, but we see it more in a few of the larger ones.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then just switching up on commercial, another quarter where you're seeing some pretty good traction in Europe, maybe where you think you stand there in terms of new products and some of the sales efforts. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So we saw tremendous strength in Europe. Commercial in Europe was actually up 20% in the quarter. Now that is off of a smaller revenue base relative to our competitors. So, I'd say we're still a little bit off the radar screen and that's good. It's coming from new products to a large degree, which are really focused in on energy efficiency, which are taking good hold there. But it's also really been enabled by some targeted investments our team there has made and what we call our city teams, where they are working very well together across the entire portfolio of AWS, including our Water Infrastructure side as well, and really focusing in on select key cities there in Europe and really penetrating along with our channel partners, and have made some very, very good traction. Now those comps too will get a little tougher as we lap, but we see that ongoing penetration for some time now and to continue.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research Partners.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, John.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, John. Welcome to the call.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I wonder if we can get – yeah, wonder if we can get some color around what you're hearing out of Washington, kind of around there's been some movement here in the WRDA and then any kind of thoughts around public-private partnership funding or investment that President Obama was talking about late last year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So I'll give you what we know as of right now. As you pointed out, there is proposed legislation that has bipartisan support, and it does intend to work its way through Congress. Our intel suggests that obviously nothing will happen there until after the election. And certainly, one candidate has made comments on what her approach will be on this, and obviously we're waiting to hear what the other candidate has to say about this, but both have clearly indicated the importance of making these investments in infrastructure, and that's encouraging to us. So we are optimistic that something will move forward there, wouldn't obviously have meaningful impacts in the market until sometime next year. So, right now for us, it's a wait and see approach. On the idea of P3 partnerships, we do see a growing level of discussion and interest in that concept. I'd say we are in the early stages of getting traction in the U.S. overall around understanding how P3s work, and convincing some of the public utilities around the U.S. that those can be very attractive ways to fund and finance these kind of projects. So, I'm optimistic, but these things always tend to take longer than we would like them to in terms of adoption.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. And then, just as a follow-up, kind of any update on the M&A pipeline and kind of the opportunity you see, if anything, before the end of the year.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. So, we obviously play in a highly fragmented industry, including some attractive adjacencies. So, as I mentioned at our Investor Day late last September, we continue to believe that M&A is going to be a significant accelerator of our growth over time, as the right opportunities come forward. We do have a strong and attractive pipeline, and we're very focused on opportunities that are higher up the technology curve, really focused on four key areas: smart water infrastructure, advanced treatment, industrial water services and then, of course, opportunities to defend our core businesses where necessary. I'd say naturally we don't control the timing of the opportunities. It takes two to tango, and we strive to be disciplined in our evaluation and our pursuit of any potential deals, both from a financial and a strategic perspective. As you know, we did complete two small acquisitions fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year. And as we sit here today, we feel we have a strong balance sheet to support transactions of larger size and scale.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: All right. Thank you very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Just a couple questions on the margin front. It looks like you're now expecting a little less op margin expansion in the second half, 60 to 120 bps, I think it was 80 to 130. I just wanted to clarify, what was driving that?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yes. This is Mark. Yeah. But some of that on the high end is just related to some of the volume drop. But that is partially offset by what we see as continued improvement in ramping up our productivity initiatives.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. And it's also some of the investments that we've got scheduled for the second half of the year. The timing in some of those investments, we're wrapping up investments in the Middle East expansion, as well as some of the investments that I talked about earlier in our European sales team on the city teams initiative that's driving that growth.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I see. Did some of it just shift a little more to the back half?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct. And we'll continue to manage and rate the pace on that.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And then earlier, Patrick, I think you mentioned that post this first year, you see good case for healthy mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure as the cycle plays out. What is the right incremental margin that we should be assuming on that growth?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think as we look at it right now, I would say it's probably around the 35%-plus incrementals, and that's down a little bit from what we would historically see in that sector, but that's really a reflection of higher project mix. And so obviously, depending on how that plays out and what drives the revenue, it could be at 35%, it could be higher than 35% incremental margins.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Right.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Historically, we've done close to 40%.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Right. What's the mix dynamic with treatment leading the growth here and actually test looking like it's lagging a bit? Is that a mix headwind, that dynamic?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it would be a mix headwind, although what I would say is that the relative size of the treatment and test businesses are much smaller and they're also very similar in size, almost identical in size, and so they really kind of negate each other to some extent in terms of depending upon on how they play out. But obviously, the larger piece of our Water Infrastructure revenue is being driven by the submersible wastewater pump business in Flygt, which is very attractive incremental margins. And that's also really driving a lot of our impressive growth right now in that sector.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. How are you doing?
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Joe.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: I just want to, keep harping on the same thing, but I just want to make sure I'm clear here. With the orders on muni in Water Infrastructure, so we're looking at a zero comp in 2Q 2015 for the whole segment. I just want to know what were orders for muni this quarter and year-to-date, and what were the comps? And maybe you can talk about that by geography.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Joe, we probably wouldn't get into all that level of detail here. Certainly don't want to open up that Pandora's box and be expected to be commenting on it quarter in, quarter out. You'd appreciate that. I'd highlight if you recall last year, we got the pretty large Panama Canal expansion job in our dewatering business. That was about $6 million worth of order that we got in Q2. We ended up shipping it in Q2 and in Q3, or recognizing revenue. We also got a pretty sizable public utility or municipal job in the Middle East, can't name the customer only because we're not allowed to. That was a $12 million job. It was a global project shopped, worked on by, well, a lot of different contractors and vendors. That was also a pretty unique order that we got that we delivered later in the year. And so those are really the drivers in the Water Infrastructure muni side of things. We would have seen flat order growth last year in Q2 overall for Water Infrastructure, but these would have driven, if there was 4%, 5% orders growth in the municipal side of the Water Infrastructure order book last year, that would have been offset by the beginning of headwinds that we started to see in the oil and gas business, predominantly in our dewatering business in Q2 of last year. So that was offset there.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then if we look at where you're starting to see, or whether it's bidding or actual orders coming through, any particular geographies within the U.S.? Are we focused, are you're seeing more like reuse stuff in California-type areas or is it pretty balanced nationally?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah, Joe. It's pretty broad-based. I would say, we're seeing it happening in a couple of sectors. Obviously, in those metropolitan areas that are experiencing very attractive increase in tax receipts, California being an example, Texas being an example. Florida is a very hot market for us right now. We're seeing strength in Northeast. But it's pretty broad-based in terms of the munis that are showing those signs of recovery. And I would say in terms of applications, I mean we certainly are seeing a significant increase in both our wins, but also bidding pipeline on reuse projects in places like California and Texas and elsewhere. But those are not yet hitting our revenue or our order book in a big way just yet, but expect them to do so later this year into next year. That's specifically on the reuse side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): The margin – again on the margin, sorry, trying to understand that you see a little bit of upside here, I'm just trying to make sure I understand, is that more on the productivity initiatives, the greater traction there, or are you starting to tighten up at all discretionary items versus original plans?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. This is being driven by productivity.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We are seeing increased rates of success in terms of our Lean projects and Patrick mentioned it early on, Global Procurement is doing an outstanding job. So, it is really the large productivity initiatives as opposed to a lot of discretionary spend.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, certainly, as I mentioned earlier as well, as we look at our rate of strategic investments, we'll continue to be responsible in monitoring and moderate that if we saw any weakness on the top line. So we've got good line of sight to that from a contingency standpoint, but what we're committing to you right now is productivity gains upside.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And on the Middle East, you guys sounded quite bullish. One other company I listened to this morning had incremental caution in the region, just given oil down versus it's recent highs, that's impacting their expectations, again, just versus their outlook coming into calendar 2Q.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): What exactly are you seeing there and any specifics will be helpful. Sorry, if I did miss them. Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, that's fine. That's fine. So, we were up 10% in the Middle East in Q2. And our full year outlook is to be in the mid single-digit. There is some project timing in there and movement around. So, we're calling mid single-digit for the full year. Couple things that are driving that for us. We've had some really – so first of all, we're serving the public utility market and the commercial building sector. And so, we're a little bit immune from the commodity prices of oil and gas. The Middle East is building out basic rudimentary wastewater infrastructure at this point in time, and we continue to see healthy commercial building growth there as well. And then, also the fact that we are completing our grand opening of our new manufacturing facility, dedicated sales people on the street, and localization of R&D, they're later this year. And so, we don't have a lot of that baked in from a growth standpoint, because it's not done yet, but that gives us opportunity here to take share in the market.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Great. Well, again, thank you all for your continued interest and support. Look forward to either seeing you on the road or hearing from you on our next earnings call here in three months. So, thanks all, safe travels and have a great end to your summer.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Mark Rajkowski to Xylem. Mark brings more than 30 years of diverse financial and operational experience. And importantly, he had a significant experience in leading transformational change, across operating models and product portfolio changes, M&A activity and capital market transactions, all to create substantial shareholder value. He's been here just over a month, but he's already hit the ground running, visiting the field and working closely with our senior leadership team, to gain a better understanding of the business and our plans for future growth. I know some of you already know Mark, but for those who don't, I'm sure over the coming months, we'll find opportunities for you to get to meet him. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel, who's here with this morning for his outstanding work as our Interim CFO over the past seven months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive, who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition in his important to CFO role. He's been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed and I look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem. Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full-year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end-market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. Our top-line growth exceeded our expectations, with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some projects shifting from Q2 into Q1, as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes. A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end-markets; namely, public utilities where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and fix side of the business continues, and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. As I've mentioned previously this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints. But we are seeing some changing priorities and these smaller projects are being green lit with greater frequency. In addition, as I just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top-line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. Given the treatment project installations generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist but we remain focused on our growth objectives. We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe and while we've seen a significant slowdown in some Emerging Markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work. That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market maybe stabilizing. Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April and we see a robust pipeline of project activity. So, as we begin to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results in flat to low single-digit growth for the full-year. Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year, but this result reflects the variation in timing that occurred with major project work. For example, if we adjusted for just two of the major orders won in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase. Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Given our strong top-line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day, last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close to our customers, we are engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience, and expand our channel reach, which ultimately will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability building, around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams. Our second priority is to grow in Emerging Markets and as I just mentioned, we are making good progress. In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening a new facility in Dubai, in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products, beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them and we expect to be operational later this summer. We're also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plans for localized product design to be more responsive to the needs of this market. In the area of strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already begun to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016 full-year R&D spending by 50 basis points, to more than 3% of revenue. Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence, and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top-line growth, but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business. Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment, later this month. Our next priority, continuous improvement includes Lean, global procurement, and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year, and over the next several years. As I've discussed before, we're instilling a productivity for growth mindset throughout the business so we can fund the necessary investment to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives. In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through Continuous Improvement, global procurement, and business simplification initiatives, and we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased with the momentum our teams are building in this area, and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016. Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem Learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization, as well as two concentrated development programs for high-performing managers and leaders. Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also, a strong focus on our working capital performance drove a 130 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue, and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. Our guidance increase today reflects the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates. We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top-line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're one quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment. One last point, we could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we did not change our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to slide four. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market. Looking at the rest of our end markets, our industrial vertical was flat as expected. Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions, with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and Emerging Markets growing at 2%. Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth. Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix. Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization's selling and continuous improvement capabilities, and the localization of assembly and production in attractive faster growth regions. Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year, but were up 9% excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter, as expected, due to the seasonality of these businesses. These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017. One final item. We have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out a prior year tax audit. Now, let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide five. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lapped a prior-year quarter that included two large project wins totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would have been up 3%. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next three quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year, and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. Revenue of $514 million represents a 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a $21 million headwind. Now, let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters, as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities. Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability, as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales. Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the UK Public Utility AMP6 cycle. Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India, and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East. Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low-single-digit growth in the general industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas and mining sectors. Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. Please turn to slide six. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to ship within the second quarter. Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. Highlights of our revenue performance include the following. Commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here we're seeing the continued traction from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities. In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw 3% growth in residential, but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher margin hot-water circulators declined, while demand for lower margin well pumps increased. The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and marine sectors, and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. Segment revenue was down 3% in our Emerging Markets, due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China. Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China; thanks in part to what we believe are stabilizing end market conditions as well as strong execution by our local team. Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions. Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments are funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margin expansion in the range of 30 basis points to 50 basis points. To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we managed the near-term slowdown and tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments. Now let's turn to slide seven, where I'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 24%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility. In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 million and we've returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments, as well as lower sales leverage. Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. Year over year, free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interest and tax payments in the quarter. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. Please move to slide eight, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks Mark. I'll begin by making two quick points. First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second, and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth. Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 basis points to 80 basis points overall, with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 basis points to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our Lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%. We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx. Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, please turn to slide nine. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue. We continue to expect this market to be flat to up low-single-digits. Our projection assumes that low-single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sectors. While first quarter performance in mining, which represents approximately 5% of total revenue, was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecast to decline through the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% declines. Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid to high-single-digit rate. Here, we've raised our outlook, following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the UK. And in the Emerging Markets, we expect to see continued project growth. For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East. The relatively warmer winter weather led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, we anticipate will be up low-single-digits for the year. Please turn to slide 10 and Mark will provide some calendarlization insight for the rest of the year.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks Patrick. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins of 40 basis points to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix. Looking out to the second half of the year, we anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3% with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million. Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 basis points to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage in the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix, given that will lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter. To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions and our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook, we did not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year given the volatility of currencies. Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full-year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter, based on exchange rates, late last week. With that I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So, we feel good about our start to the year and are pleased to be on track to deliver on our financial commitments. Our teams are executing well and remain focused on improving the customer experience. We continue to be encouraged by strengthening public utility market. We are making measurable progress on our strategic priorities, particularly in the area of continuous improvement, accelerating our investments in innovation and technology and investing in faster growth markets. We've made good strides in improving our working capital performance, which will lead to another year of strong free cash flow conversion. With that operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, we had lot of references about warmer weather and a pull in from the second quarter into the first quarter. Can you give any quantification – can you point to any specifics on how that might be calibrated? And then, since we're on weather, lots of a headline news flooding in the South again, and has there been any opportunities there for Godwin dewatering, not just on the one-time rentals, but this is happening with higher frequency. Are there any longer-term permanent type of projects that we saw after in the Northeast after Sandy? Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, Deane. This is Patrick. Yeah. To put a total on the combination of timing on some of the project deliveries and treatment that we've alluded to, as well as the weather impact, we'd say, it was roughly about $8 million of revenue, so just under a point of top-line growth. And I'd say, probably a little less than a third of that was the actual impact of the weather, albeit at high margin given the impact that it had on our Godwin business. To the second part of your question, we certainly see the weather patterns that are happening here as an opportunity both in the immediate term, but there is a systemic move here as you see happening. And so, we certainly have deployed our resource (34:40) on the ground, not only tactically but strategically. Part of the things we've been doing there is leveraging what we're doing in the deployment of Salesforce.com and making sure that our teams, not just in Godwin, but also on the Flygt side of the business, are sharing leads, and making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity there.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then, just a second question. I'd like you to expand on this R&D investment increase. Really interesting in how you identified three areas for further investment. I think I got them -- smartwater technology, systems, and advanced water treatment. So, it really looks like you're deliberately moving up the technology curve in the portfolio. What kind of specific opportunities do you see, and is this – are you doing this build versus buy type of decision making and what's this say about M&A opportunities?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Great question, Deane. So, as you know, I've spoken much about -- I do think that there is a great opportunity for us to continue to move our offerings up the technology curve. It really comes out of the value mapping work that we did over the course of the first year or so that I was here. That definitely has informed our priorities, both in terms of organic investment in R&D and the innovation technology roadmaps that Jay, our new Innovation Technology Officer and our R&D teams, are really focused on. But at the same time, it's also informing our M&A pipeline. Certainly the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland were a demonstration of that, and we see a very rich pipeline of further opportunities to be able to do that. You know that we set out some ambitious goals at Investor Day on where we can take our vitality index, in terms of revenue generated from new offerings over the last five years. And so, we're expecting for several hundred basis points of improvement and expansion on that over the next four years to five years.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Nathan.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Hi, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Slight difference in the way you're reporting on the slide deck there where you're specifically breaking out the strategic investments, 130 basis points in the quarter. Can you talk about how that compares to historically for Xylem, what the expectations are for the benefits out of that, maybe in ROI or any color you could give on that?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So it is a – we are purposely breaking it out because I think it's important for our investors to understand what we're doing in driving productivity support larger investments. I do want to point out that we have got very good line of sight and visibility obviously on the rate and pace of those investments, and so we're not just opening the floodgates here. We are very focused on investing in very attractive return opportunities, margin expansion that need to be accretive. A big theme of our here is not only to move the operating margin expansion but to improve our gross margins as a company as well. So that would be the color I would give you, is that we've been very focused in being accretive. We've got good line of sight on what they are. We're rating and pacing them. And you'll continue to see us break those out as we go forward. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add any color.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I think, while it's still early days, we're starting to see some returns particularly on the commercial capabilities and some investments we've made in our sales teams. We've seen that in both in Europe and as well as some of our Emerging Markets. So, the R&D is a little bit – it takes a little bit longer in terms of the time when it pays back, but some of the quick hits on the commercial side we're already seeing benefits.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And how does it compare to an historical rate of these strategic investments? Is it a significant increase?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean it's – from my perspective I think it's a sizable increase and if you look at the level of productivity we drove in the quarter and have over the course of the last year and you see us making those investments here, hard for me to put a specific number on exactly how much we've done in the past. I would say we are probably talking close to 2x the amount of what we've seen historically. And, again, that's being funded by what we are doing on the productivity side while still committing to operating margin expansion.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That 2x is helpful, and you are clearly paying for it. So, my second question was the public utility in Europe. In the slide deck there, there is an expectation that public utility in Europe is improving. Is that all better AMP 6 out of the UK, or how is the public utility market looking in the rest of Europe?
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: Yeah. So, this is Shashank. On the AMP 6 cycle, we saw a little bit of benefit in March, but the stronger benefit will come for the balance of the year. So really what we saw in Q1 was everything but the AMP 6 cycle. Our expectation that that continues at that pace for the balance of the year in Europe.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. We saw some continued encouraging signs, Nathan, in other parts of Europe. Southern Europe continues to be basically flattish but we did see pretty good growth in the rest of Central and Northern Europe.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert Baird.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning, everyone.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, two quick ones here. First the, on the guidance. What's the assumption for underlying demand? How does that track through the year when you look at the 2% expectations organically 2Q, 3% back half of the year? Is there any assumption for improvement outside of the public utility market where you've got a pretty positive outlook, or is it pretty stable from here?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I would say, it's pretty much stable from here, Mike. What you hear us talking about in Q2 really is just the impact of the shift of the projects and some of the acceleration of work in the public utility space due to the weather to Q1. So you're looking really at basically 3% over the first half of the year, which is pretty much in line with our guidance, and we'd look for similar performance in the back half of the year. So no real uptick. I mean, you heard us talk about some improvement in public utility versus our previous outlook, but that's really being mitigated a little bit by some of the softness that we continue to see in mining and oil and gas, and a little bit in resi that we called out.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So pretty normal sequential patterns then?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yes; that's correct.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, second one is, when you look at over the last five or so quarters, orders versus revenue, revenues obviously outpace the order side. Some normalization on that this quarter. Maybe you could just talk about the dynamic there, obviously a positive outlook for growth that's been outpacing where the orders have been. Is that short cycle, is that project timing? Maybe could you just talk about that dynamic.
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: And then, Nathan (42:15) and as you noted there is several pieces to that. And when you take a look at some parts of the business like the Applied Water segment, there's a heavier portion of book-and-ship business that typically happens, and the second quarter ends up being the strongest quarter there. But there is also some seasonality, I mean, there is also some impact with project shipments. As we talked, there was pulling of project shipments in the first quarter. And on the order side, we also talked about on the Water Infrastructure side, a year ago, we had strong activity with a couple of large projects that impacted the year-over-year dynamic. So it is a mix of when the projects actually book, when they actually ship out, as well as the level of the book-and-ship activity. And then the last piece is also the lapping of the oil and gas headwind we saw last year, and that laps in the second quarter. So we'll see favorability in Q3, Q4 as we have good prior year comparison on oil and gas.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I would just add here. Another a bit of color on the backlog is, as we look at the treatment pipeline, which is a good leading indicator for the rest of our public utility kind of business here, it is lumpy and so you do see these kind of quarter-to-quarter comparison that would be challenging, but the actual bid pipeline that we're going after is actually up 10% year-over-year. And so, we continue to see very healthy trends in terms of the projects that are coming to market. And so, that bodes well for the back half of this year into 2017.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. I appreciate the time.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Morning. Thanks. I guess, Emerging Markets, you talked about some stabilization in bookings in China. Can you maybe give us a little more color on what you're seeing there?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, as expected, China was down both in terms of top-line growth and orders year-over-year because we are lapping the drop off there that really occurred mid to late last year. But quarter sequential, we saw 20% plus growth in orders. And so, that's very encouraging for us. It looks like it appears to be stabilizing. What's really driving that? Again, as we talked about in our prepared remarks is just being the number one policy issue right now or one of the top policy issues for the China government. And so, we continue to see a very attractive pipeline there, projects coming forward and good order trends.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And then, on India, maybe you can just give us an update on that large project? And then, also, how you're thinking about timeframes for localizing product there? Thanks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: Yeah. So, on India, we talked last year, late last year, on a couple of large projects that we won, we've started delivering on some of those. The pipeline on the quotation activity remains very high and it tends to be large projects, in infrastructure, primarily, on the Water Infrastructure side, so that continues strong. As far as localization initiatives, a lot of the large projects we are doing, they're almost 90%-plus localized. Quite frankly that's how we stay competitive in the India market, which is an extremely competitive market. So, we see continued growth in that market space. We're also looking at on the Applied Water segment opportunities on the commercial building side with the smart cities initiative. And again, a lot of that will be driven by localization initiatives as well.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets: Back on the cost inflation item, the 190 basis points headwind this quarter, is that more comp or commodities, and I'm just wondering in the back half, as some of these commodities have started to increase again, does that line item may be becoming an even bigger headwind?
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: Yeah. Primarily, and we talked about this I think in the last several quarters. The bulk of our inflation is from compensation and benefits and then there is a little bit coming out of commodities. As you've noted, commodities was soft all the way through last year and the first quarter they did pick up a little bit. But the way we get impacted by pure commodity because it's only a piece of the components we use to make our product isn't as significant. But to your point, as we go through the rest of the year, there could be a little bit of a headwind on the 190 basis points, maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points is what we've historically seen about the 190 basis points level, as we go forward. So, there could be a little bit of that. Quite frankly, some of that should also help our pricing in the market because commodity does support better pricing levels as well.
Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets: I think pricing lately has not been as robust as it historically has been, so are you starting to see some of that reverse and maybe see some pricing tailwind offsetting. Are you seeing that already?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. In the quarter, we saw about 30 bps to 40 bps of pricing benefit in the Water Infrastructure business, which is really the business that's benefiting the most from kind of the rising tide of public utility. And so, that was really the first time we've seen that in quite a while, so we're pretty encouraged by that.
Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning, guys.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: Good morning, Jim.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Just on the public utility, I'm sorry if I missed it, but broad based strength, well understood, but are there any areas geographic areas worthy of note, whether you're seeing a particular strength or weakness to call out in the U.S.?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, yeah. So, the biggest – far and away, the biggest area of strength for us right now is the U.S. We saw a 22% growth in the quarter coming from the U.S. Now, again, that was a combination of some of the benefits of the warmer weather conditions, some of the increase in repair and maintenance activity and also some project strength. So, that's – we are not going to hold to the full year at that level but we're expecting it continuing to be very attractive. And then secondly, we saw, again some returning strength in Europe. As Shashank mentioned earlier, we haven't really begun to see the full impact of the AMP 6 cycle in the UK but we are seeing some of the activity coming through in Q2 now, and expect that to really begin to ramp up for here over the course of the year. India was another real big bright spot for us, I mean, up 90% and the pipeline is continuing to grow there. I'd say, no real areas of weakness that I would call out in public utility. It was pretty broad based. We were up 12%, overall the company. So, I'd say that's one of our biggest bright spots across the board.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant specifically in the U.S. but nothing to call-out in the U.S. by region?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: No, nothing really to speak of. I mean, it's pretty broad-based across the board. I mean, I think, we didn't see any areas where we saw low-single digits or flattish or down. Everything was growing at least mid-single digits. I think it's a matter of relative bright spots.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. And by product line, call it, transport, treatment, test, you're showing obviously different growth rates given project activity timing, that's understandable. But can you discuss any impact you are seeing specifically from upgrading your go-to-market strategies, your more unified sales approach, et cetera. Just checking that that's the driver of the share gains that you are speaking of and anticipating.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we certainly feel very confident about the bright spots we're seeing early on here as we've – whether it be revision of some our incentives, whether it be the implementation of Salesforce.com, whether this be our teams getting more time together, we co-located some of our offices, and our sales teams. There is a lot of ingredients that go into that, an increase in training that we've done and just being very proud of how hard our teams are working in the field, they are getting added. And I think, that's where leveraging our combined efforts are important. I also think that's we are having a definitive market-leading brand or brand that we've got, you tend to benefit in a rising tide. And we just can't – there is no rest for the weary here, so we can't. We got to keep looking over our shoulder and working as hard as possible.
Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brent.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Brent.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning. On the dewatering business, it seems like some of the challenging sectors there should be nearing a bottom at least and understand the mix headwind today, but can you speak to how the overall pricing environment is evolving there? And is it realistic to think as the business reaccelerates we should start to see a net positive for Water Infrastructure margins?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So, certainly, we – given the oil and gas and mining exposure, that our dewatering team has been facing there that was a big body blow for us last year. And really provided a headwind for against all the other great margin expansion efforts that we were doing. The team within that business did a fantastic job of at least holding their margins flat, despite a significant drop off last year in revenue. And I think, we are confident that as that business rebounds, hard to make a call as to when oil and gas and mining might rebound, but certainly as that business laps that and begin to get some additional top-line growth, we would expect to see quite sizable incremental margins fall through, given a number of the cost actions the team took last year to manage the bottom. And that certainly would be an accretive impact for Water Infrastructure.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Sure. Okay. And then, Patrick, the 10% increase in the bid pipeline for treatment you referenced, was that for the U.S. or globally?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That is global.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And is it fair to say, it's higher in the U.S.?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I'd say the growth rates are higher in the U.S., yes.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay. You're welcome.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Pat.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I just wanted to circle back and make sure I was clear on what you were dealing about the order momentum and how it's tracking versus your plan? The commentary in the last couple of quarters has seemed very positive, certainly maybe a lot of that is just a muni. But it doesn't feel like the momentum is really building here in the orders?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think we feel quite comfortable and good about the outlook. I think the momentum that we see is very much in line with our plan and kind of where we've guided to. As we talked about, we got a number of these big projects last year. So, when you're looking at year-over-year comparisons, there is going to be some lumpiness there. I know that people can look at orders within Applied Water. That's not a big backlog business. And so, it really is heavily skewed towards book-and-ship business. And so, again, we feel positive. Again, we're keeping our expectations in check here. We're in the early stages of a public utility recovery. And hopefully we're seeing things stabilize in the Emerging Markets. China obviously had a significant impact in the order book in Q1 on a year-over-year basis as well.
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: I'd add, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that when you exclude a couple of unusually large projects that we had in the first quarter of last year, Water Infrastructure would have been up 3% year-over-year.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Fair enough. And then, just a question on line of sight through that 80 bps to 130 bps of half margin improvement you're expecting in the back half, it sounds like a combination of volume and restructuring. I mean, how much of what you need to see that is in the backlog and just general line of sight on the restructuring coming through?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. As we look at the back half, a big part of that acceleration is cost reductions. So, we will see ramp up from our 260 basis points that we saw in Q1 to closer to 380 basis points in the second half. So, we are expecting to see acceleration in cost out as well as those periods are seasonally stronger in terms of volume. So we'll see more volume leverage and we'll also benefit – part of that cost reduction will be additional restructuring benefits, $8 million in the second half the year. That work is underway.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: I'd just add that within that guide we've also got about a 100 basis points from it – going the other direction from strategic investments. And so, obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we got line of sight to that. We will rate and pace that accordingly, but right now we feel confident about making those investments.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. So, that's something that you can dial up or down a little bit depending on how things...
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: That's correct. Yeah...
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: That's helpful. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Bennett of Sterne Agee.
Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee: Patrick, I would like to dig in a little bit on your industrial market overall. I guess, I think we all know what's going on in oil and gas and mining, but within the rest of it, and I know you guys serve a ton of different end markets, but would like any color you could provide on what may be strong within that and what may be weak. And then, more specifically on your industrial water treatment business, which I know is kind of an increased focus of you guys going forward, so I was wondering if you made any progress there.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, very quickly on the industrial piece, it's good to pull it out as you did. So in that 44% of overall industrial revenue for us, 8% of that is tied to oil and gas and mining, so the other let's call it 36% of our total revenue, we really refer to that as more light industrial, and that's been up 3% and are expecting that to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S., it's overweighted to the U.S. It is a broad swath of exposure ranging from food and beverage to pharma, to chemicals, to marine, to a wide variety -- car washes. It's a wide variety of areas. The nice thing about that business is that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them and so it's a good steady business. The tweaks that we typically see there is when there can be adjustment in inventory or stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But, again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016. On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. We're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater, and that is a business that tend to be lower margin for us. Hence the discussion around shifting even more of our weight toward the industrial sector where it's higher technology, more regulations, deeper pockets, people willing to spend based on lifecycle cost. And so it is an area of focus for us both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those tend to be slower to come to fruition, but we're working on those right now, as we speak. And as we've mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path.
Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee: Got it. That's helpful. And then one quick question on the commercial market. I guess you said in your slides that you expect the U.S. to moderate and was wondering if you've seen that or is that based on orders, or I guess what makes you think that U.S. will moderate?
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: So – and that is based on the first quarter order activity, and as we mentioned on the residential side, where we had strength in the groundwater side. But on the residential circulators, which fall onto the commercial side, there was a little bit of softness because of the relatively warm winter. So we did see moderate growth in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year.
Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee: Okay. Thank you.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. How are you?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess, if I had to ding you somewhere, maybe – you maybe start talking about the incrementals on organic growth being a little bit lower, and can you just kind of flesh out how much of that is from mix shift towards treatment which is lower margin, but kind of a good problem; how much is M&A; how much is FX? Can you kind of talk about that a little bit?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure, yes. Most certainly in the first quarter, the biggest driver of that lower incremental margins than what would historically have expected would be the treatment mix, and again, some of the projects that moved into the quarter at lower margins, so that was one big impact. If you look at the overall, certainly what we saw in terms of the investment in the Middle East, in the quarter, which hit Applied Water only because that's the first business that was going in there in terms of product localization. And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, Applied Water will more than recover that and expand margins for the full year, so it really is the timing of the investment that hit in the quarter. Those'd be the two biggest impacts. Obviously, we had a little bit of dilution from the acquisitions, but that was not so large and will be as expected, that becomes neutral over the course of the full year.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Hey, Joe. It's Phil. I'd just highlight. So if you're looking just on the face, it looks like we have got 20% incrementals for the quarter...
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: But if you back out the acquisition impacts, we're right in the sweet spot of the norm of about 35% incrementals overall. So pretty much in line with what we would have expected.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. I wanted to talk higher level about municipalities and what you are seeing. Are you seeing more of a willingness to invest in newer technology, like are you able to value sell maybe a more expensive project if you can convince them that it's better long-term benefit? Are you seeing a shift in (1:01:46)
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say, Joe – Joe, it differs. It clearly differs by customer. I mean, I think that those water authorities that are privately owned and privately managed, they tend to focus much more on the pure economics and the longer-term lifecycle and therefore, definitely play up the technology curve and are willing to adopt more of a solution sell there. But I would also say there are, even in the public sector, there are a number of water authorities that are becoming much more progressive. It's not limited to here in the U.S. It's actually been faster adoption in some of the Emerging Markets, in parts of Europe. So, it really depends on the customer itself. But we are encouraged by their willingness to adopt new technology and to really focus in on the value proposition.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Awesome. And then, one last question, and I'm sorry if I missed this earlier. Can you talk about your M&A pipeline and what you are seeing out there in terms of potential targets on the technology side and what you are thinking in terms of size?
E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me share my observations on that since I'm the new guy on the team. One of my early observations is that very impressed with the strategic work around the value mapping and targeting where to play and how to win, and one of the benefits of that is having a very clear roadmap to informing our capital allocation choices including M&A. And as I got up to speed on the M&A pipeline, very clear that both in terms of the number as well as the relative attractiveness of those opportunities that are in the sweet spot relative to smart infrastructure monitoring and control up the technology stack if you will. It's robust and I think there's a lot of opportunity there.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, Joe.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning...
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Good morning, David.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: ...and thank you for slipping me in.
Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.: Sure. Good morning, David.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just two quick questions. On the aftermarket, I was hoping maybe you can quantify the growth you've seen in the aftermarket? And maybe some of the impact from TotalCare? And maybe provide us a little bit more color on the margin impact that w can expect over the rest of 2016 and 2017? I know it's probably pretty small this year but how should we think about that? And then the second question will be water reuse?
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So on the aftermarket service side, we've seen growth of about 5% organically, and it's a pretty good spot to be in. Obviously, we're looking to grow that even more but it's good to have a steady mid-to-high single digit kind of piece of business there that generates margins that are historically about 1.5 times the level of our original equipment sale on the project. So we do believe that we've seen some share gains in that area as well. But hard to quantify and it's a very, very fragmented market. So that is an area of the business that we have prioritized in terms of focusing our teams, our work structure, et cetera to make sure that we get at that to make sure that we win more than our fair share of that aftermarket service business. On reuse, reuse continues to be a very attractive spot for us in our treatment business. Obviously, the flashpoints in California and other areas that are now looking at reuse as a truly viable alternative whether it'd be to desal or other forms of treatment, it well positions us to play in that sector. It's still a very small piece of our business. And so I wouldn't put too much on it in terms of financial impact in the immediate term, but I think it's a very positive trend line for our business from a technology standpoint.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.: Sure. Well, thank you all for joining. Thanks for your continued interest. And thanks for your patience on the call today. And we're looking forward to catching up with you soon. So, in the mean time, safe travels and we'll speak to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

Now, please turn to slide four. I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Partick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Phil, and good morning everyone. Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macro level and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remained focused on executing against our long-term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results. We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange translation. And we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% driven by working capital improvement. Importantly, I am encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead. External factors such as steadily increasing spend on water infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems, and climate related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem. As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day last year, mainly stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver that growth. That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplification, which will be significant levers for long-term value creation. Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are a couple of examples. The perennial battle to increase spending on water infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk, and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flash points such as the tragic situation in Flint, Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country. Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. In addition, on the heels of the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed on to in that historic agreement. Given that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals. In light of that, last quarter, we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win-win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term. We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly one-third of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter, when we delivered 5% year-over-year growth. The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continue to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This however was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 when most of the impact fell in the second half of the year. To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points, and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12. Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwinds to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these two sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market. Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial-related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting, equipment cooling, and fire suppression. The critical nature of these products and services and maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials. One final point, the leading position we have in certain consumer demand-driven applications such as beverage dispensing and marine and RV pump applications helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016. From a regional perspective, we remain optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing, and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We have a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe, and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first nine months of the year, our businesses in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. First, the 2% organic growth compares with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year-over-year growth. Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter, driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given that our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years. Shifting gears now, as I mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multi-year self-help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include Lean and Global Procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement. Today, G&A costs sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past two years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond, as we execute the business simplification plan we laid at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reduction over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016, from which, we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call. We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investment for future growth, the targeted investments in the Middle East, China, and India we highlighted at our Investor Day, and accelerating capital deployment on two fronts: returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters. Let's turn to slide five and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs. We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015. Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrates systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings fit well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie-in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition of HYPACK. The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customers' need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space. The acquisitions of Tideland and HYPACK illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligence, full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve. With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Patrick. And since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I will make some specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year. We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1% primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8%, as unfavorable weather, namely the severe flooding conditions in the Southern U.S., wiped out this year's season. As a reminder, agriculture represents 2% of our revenues. Regionally, we generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets where we posted a 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here, growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued. The U.S. and Western Europe markets each grew 1%. In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter, whereas Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada rounds out our geographic performance. There, significant declines in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue. As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs. We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase the 5%, excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation. Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns. Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved 105% conversion of net income. We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015. That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in as many years and a record $175 million of shares repurchases. Turning to slide seven, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance. During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus commentary on our ending backlog. We entered 2016 with total backlog of $716 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact, backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and about $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%. Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%. From an end market perspective, we saw significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries and an improved U.S. markets, coupled with share gains, drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S., where we have about 50% of our customer base. Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same. We continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector. The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%. Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, Global Procurement and business simplification savings, offset inflation, driving 140 basis point improvement in segment margins. Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. Now, let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide eight. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $30 million project order in Saudi Arabia, as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates. Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again reflecting the oil and gas weakness. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Off this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we had seen last year on an organic basis. While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short-cycled business. We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. and the emerging markets, up 4% and 5% respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness. I would further summarize our revenue performance as follows. Transport applications, which include our water and wastewater pump and dewatering business, were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase its share position. We also saw a double digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business driven by a relatively large project delivery and, to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and UK. And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong up 4% with particular strong of Europe, up 9%, with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. Additionally, our delivery of critical, analytical instrumentation used in China's river cleanup project drove local revenue growth up by 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3%, as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America. Partially offsetting these headwinds were growth in the Middle East. We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million, driven by sourcing and Lean initiatives, as well as $2 million in restructuring savings. This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation, as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. Let's turn to slide nine. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. A book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we have seen over the last four years. Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant currency basis, which we expect will mute growth in the first quarter. Applied Water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4% respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which was down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first nine months of the year. I would further summarize our revenue performance as follows: Building services grew 3% as we continued to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. Lastly, irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, declined 12% driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014, when we delivered 25% growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. Material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions. Despite volume leverage on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The Applied Water portion of this project was sold at a negative margin. However, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with the Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growing strength in the public utility end market in the U.S., and the continued build-out of water and wastewater infrastructure in the emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%. While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market. Moving on to the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, up 3% organically, due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications, despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds. In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4% as strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which was down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. Please turn to slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position, with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. Lastly, our return on invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Now, please, turn to slide 12 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Shashank. As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long-term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial change at Xylem to strengthen our commercial capabilities, taking specific actions to improve our customers' experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry vertical selling, and simplifying our commercial processes. We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investment of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 basis points to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our Lean and Global Procurement initiatives to generate gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster than market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth. Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we are positioned to exceed market growth, despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 basis points to 80 basis points overall, despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. This dilution is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as non-cash intangible amortization. Excluding the diluted impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 basis points to 100 basis points. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05, which excludes restructuring and realignment costs of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million. Please turn to slide 13, this slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to be flat to up low-single digits. This projection assumes low-single digit growth in light industrial applications and double-digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and that the UK's multi-year AMP 6 cycle of infrastructure investment accelerates late in the second half of the year. For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid-single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues to be here and that conditions in Europe modestly improve. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low-to-mid single-digit range driven by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels seen in 2015. We also expect continued low-single digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture will likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015. Please turn to slide 14 and Shashank will provide some calendarization insight for the year.
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Patrick. As we have done in prior years, I'd like to highlight the seasonal profile of our business, which you can see on the left side of the slide and our perspective on 2016 on the right. As for the first quarter of 2016, we expect 2% organic growth coupled with approximately 1% growth from acquisition. Foreign exchange translation is anticipated to be a 4% headwind. As for operating margin, we anticipate it to be flat year-over-year as the oil and gas and mining headwinds will continue to offset volume leverage and cost savings. Our expectations also assume a modest level of increased investment for our growth initiatives. We are assuming that both Global Procurement and Lean savings accelerate through the year, whereby we realize about $20 million on gross savings in the first quarter and expect to deliver about $120 million for the full year. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Please turn to slide 15.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Shashank. So, we had a strong finish in 2015 as we faced some challenging conditions. Again, I want to thank our team for their performance as their focused execution against our strategic priorities helped us to deliver on the commitments we set forth at the beginning of 2015. I am confident in their ability and commitment to deliver against our organic growth targets and margin expansion opportunities. Xylem is in a very strong financial position and we will continue to drive our balanced and accelerated capital deployment plans. I am very encouraged as I look ahead to 2016 and beyond. No doubt there are challenges in the near-term but I am confident that our team will continue to execute with operational discipline to drive our success. That commitment and focus will provide the foundation for future growth for Xylem and our shareholders. With that, operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane.
Shashank Patel: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. So, you really checked all the boxes this quarter. If I look at it, you've got in line EPS, you've got free cash flow, you do a dividend boost, you do buybacks, you get a deal done, so hopefully you still got some feel-goods left for the rest of the quarters in 2016. So, anyway, the question I wanted to focus on first is, interested in hearing a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the Applied Water business, because it sounds as though the order spanned both Applied and Water Infrastructure, which is good to see, that suggests you're doing cross-selling. But the way the P&L gets tallied, Applied ended up showing a negative margin. So, to kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? And how do you – if you net the two out, how does that project look?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Well, thanks for the comments opening there, Deane, as well, we appreciate it. On this project – this is a project actually that has been in backlog for multiple years. And there've been some delays in the customer job site, in terms of ultimately delivering it. So it's been in backlog for more than a couple of years. The margin was net positive and attractive for us. I wouldn't say we have other projects like this that are out there. I mean, it was fine. It was an element of some solution sale. It was a bundled offering for an LNG application. But, again, it's a bit of a one-off. It's a large project and it's going to span over a few quarters here in terms of shipping it out.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, the follow-up question is not so much Xylem-specific. But I'm really struck by and interested in hearing your comments on the ramifications for this water crisis unfolding in Flint, Michigan, and again, it's on the front page of the journal today...
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Deane Dray: So, how do you feel? What's your sense of what happens and the response within the municipal water community? Is going to be further congressional pressure here? What went wrong? What does this mean for the need for smart water networks? I know that's been a big focus for you and...
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Deane Dray: ...just how you think this plays out? And what are the ramifications for spending on this backlog in U.S. Water Infrastructure?
Patrick Decker: Sure. It's a great question, Deane. And, as I had mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, it's obviously a tragic situation there in Flint. As you'll recall, we had similar situations, though maybe different causes in Toledo not long before that. And you've got a number of these flooding conditions that we see from a resilience standpoint. There is infrastructure that needs to be invested in. As you've been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent-up demand that's out there. But, I do believe, that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur. And so, it's difficult to predict kind of over what timeframe, we think, it will begin to free up. But I do think this will be a collection of flash points that begins to move things forward.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. Just to sneak one last question in, the deal is another focus in the water analytics side, hydrology. What's the pipeline look for M&A?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. So, we're excited by both the HYPACK and the Tideland acquisitions. They are very nice additions to our portfolio and really tie in nicely with the capabilities we already have in the analytics space in that area of hydrology. The pipeline overall – I mean, that's only one vertical obviously that we're focusing in on. If I go back to Investor Day, we talked about smart water infrastructure or systems intelligence. We talked about advance treatment in industrial and we talked about making sure that we defended and protected some of our unassailable kind of core franchises. So, the pipeline continues to build. It's very attractive. It's pretty broad and deep. As you know, it's always difficult to predict the timing of when things come forward. It always takes two to tango. But I am very encouraged by the work the team has done to further build out that pipeline and lines up really nicely with the value mapping work that we shared at Investor Day.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you, Deane.
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose: Good morning, both. Thank you for...
Shashank Patel: Good morning, David.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
David Rose: Just a couple follow-ups on the restructuring actions, the $25 million. Can you break this down? And is this incremental to 2017 and 2018? How should we think about it? And then second question is, is your mention of unlocking private capital, I mean, you're overall in it, and I was hoping that you can elaborate on that.
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Shashank Patel: Yeah. This is Shashank. I will take the first question. As far as the $25 million, it is incremental, and it generates about $8 million savings in 2016 probably back-end loaded towards the second half. As far as where those actions are, I mean, that is restructuring and realignment. And it's in the areas of footprint, it's in the areas of the G&A and business simplification initiatives we had outlined during the Investor Day.
David Rose: And I'm sorry, how much is in Applied Water and how much is in Water Infrastructure?
Shashank Patel: Yeah. We don't – actually, we don't disclose how much of that is broken up by segment, but the total is $25 million.
Patrick Decker: One of the reasons for that, David, is some of these are shared locations, where it will impact both businesses.
David Rose: Okay. Great. That's helpful.
Patrick Decker: Yeah. On your second question around unlocking private capital, our role there is not necessarily being actively involved in financing and those type of activities. What I'm really alluding to there is we're involved in – it's our role as the thought leader in the water space, we are involved in a couple of efforts with other organizations in helping further this movement around things like public/private partnerships, other models that exist in other parts of the world that are not quite as commonplace here in the U.S. We believe that there is a large role for the private sector to play in driving attractive investments there. And so, helping in some of the education effort in that area is really the role that I'm referring to.
David Rose: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Okay. Thank you.
Shashank Patel: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Shashank Patel: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I think, Patrick, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the public utility market. And I think you commented that U.S., Middle East and Asia were up double digits, and did not make any reference to Europe. Given Europe is the biggest end market there, could you give us some color on what you're seeing in the public utility market in Europe and what your expectations are for 2016 there?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. So, it's – we saw Europe really stabilize over the back half of the year, and I would describe it as stable at this point. I mean, it is still a mixed – it's a mixed bag. I would say we have not seen the continued deterioration in the southern part of Europe that we'd experienced in the kind of first three quarters of the year. That stabilizes well. So, I think we're on fairly solid footing. One of the things that will benefit us in 2016, of course, is the impact in the UK of the AMP 6 infrastructure investments cycle there that you are all probably be quite familiar with in. That cycle was launched, I think, April 1 of this past year. It takes about 15 months or so for all of the engineering and design and spec work to happen on the part of our customers. And then, we really begin to see the revenue come our way in late 2016 through kind of 2018 or so. So, I think net-net, it's stable in Europe and kind of low-single digit growth for 2016.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks. And if we just look at the light industrial, part of industrial, I think we're all fairly comfortable that oil and gas and mining are not going to be very good in 2016. You're talking about low-single digit growth there, which you need to get that flat or maybe up slightly. Can you talk about the different dynamics that are going on within that market that have you able to grow in what's probably a flat to may be slightly down global industrial market?
Patrick Decker: Sure. And that's a great question. I'd say, first of all, when you think about the nature of what the light industrial sector is, customers in that area are quite diverse. But across the board, they are very much focused in on energy efficiency to reduce their operating cost. Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industry. It's not really tied to the factory output, but it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating cost. These are not large capital outlays that are required in the part of our customers. And so, it doesn't tend to be big on the radar screen, other than again, they play a role – these products play a role in helping them reduce their operating costs through energy efficiency. So, we think we're pretty resilient. I think that was demonstrated through 2015, when that part of the business again was up 2%, organically. And we've seen really nothing here in the latter part of 2015 or early 2016 that would change our view on that.
Nathan Jones: How much of that light industrial market is driven by the regulatory environment rather than the operating environment?
Patrick Decker: I wouldn't say it's a large driver in that area. I mean, I would say that as some of the energy efficiency regulations that have already been put in place in the EU come to the U.S. over the course of the next few years, then certainly there will be somewhat of a driver there. But I wouldn't say it's a big driver today. It's really more just, again, the managing their operating cost.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much for the help.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Ryan Connors: Wanted to talk a little bit about the kind of price cost situation in this environment, if you might expand on that for us. Obviously, some of the raw material prices have come down and if you could talk about that impact on your P&L vis-à-vis what you're seeing on the pricing side, that'd be helpful.
Shashank Patel: Yeah. So, this is Shashank. From a pricing perspective, we expect fairly neutral conditions. So flattish pricing 2015 going into 2016. Clearly, we'd like to see more price in 2016, but it will be challenged based on current commodity environment. So that's a – so, as I said, it's flattish but, from a savings perspective, that does help because we do buy a lot of raw material, and the current environment helps drive more out of Global Procurement, and our target in 2016 is for higher cost-outs from Global Procurement perspective, as well as business simplification.
Patrick Decker: And I would just add, Ryan. I think that, as we've talked a little bit in the past, there's probably less than 10% of our revenue that is in end markets that are more challenged from a pricing standpoint that really being in the ag and resi part of the market. We continue to manage through that and maintain, I think, a very good discipline from a pricing standpoint. The area that we would suggest, over time, you would suspect the supply/demand favorability to work in our direction would be on the public utility sector. But we're still so early in the recovery there that we're not really counting on that kind of price dynamic in 2016.
Ryan Connors: Okay. And so, might you – I mean, would it be – would you hazard a guesstimate at what kind of a basis point tailwind raw materials could be to the margins, if you are able to say hold your price flat in aggregate?
Shashank Patel: I would suspect it's probably about 20 basis points to 30 basis points.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then my other question, just real big picture, Patrick. I mean, you issued your 2016 guidance today and talked a lot about some of the puts and takes and some of the positives. But what do you view as kind of the biggest risk factor that could cause things to not play out the way you've laid out today as you look out over the next 11 months here?
Patrick Decker: Sure. I would say that the area that we kind of called out in our prepared comments as clearly going to be – we've already built some of this into our outlook, and that is continued downward pressure in both oil and gas and mining. Again, those are now only 8% of our total revenue, so it's not a large portion of our business. But certainly, if we saw mining drop off dramatically, then that would put pressure on our top line. But we feel that we've reflected that in the bottom end of the organic growth range. In terms of profitability, again, as we mentioned in our comments, these businesses are very high profit margin for us. Again, we feel that we've taken it in consideration in our guidance, but obviously, there are other cost out actions that we would take in the event that we saw that. And that's certainly something we've learned from this past year in our dewatering business.
Ryan Connors: That's great. Thanks so much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore: Good morning. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Chip.
Chip Moore: So, you touched on muni trends in the U.S. and Europe. Maybe we can move to emerging markets a bit. What gives you the confidence, I guess, that infrastructure spending holds up over there? And then maybe to follow up, talk about some of the softness you've seen on the commercial side?
Patrick Decker: Sure, on the – so, on the public utility side for emerging markets, the real key drivers there certainly at the moment, and we're still seeing this in our quoting activity and bidding activity, is the – again the fact that in our largest emerging markets, the whole issue of access to water and sustainability there are top policy issues and concerns, whether it'd be in China, whether it'd be in the Middle East, whether it'd be in India. And so, we are certainly not seeing any significant downward pressure there or slowing down of those large projects. But that certainly is something we're keeping a very close mindful eye on. As we did indicate in our guidance around emerging markets and we saw it in the fourth quarter, certainly, a significant headwind and pressure on the commercial building side, especially in China, as well as some of the impact of lower commodity prices on the industrial business there in China as well as in Latin America. So, again, in our guide for 2016, we feel that we've taken a pretty balanced approach in that area. But again, we'll keep a close eye on that and modulate our cost base accordingly across the rest of the portfolio.
Shashank Patel: And just to add a little bit of color to that, for emerging markets in 2015, we delivered about 7% growth and it did slow down in Q4 primarily due to China. As we look towards 2016, we kind of moderated that to a mid-single digit growth. And certainly, we factored in the slowness in China especially on the commercial building side. But then, we got investments going in Middle East, South Africa as we've talked about, as well as we have some large project deliveries in India that help the overall emerging market picture.
Chip Moore: That's great. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on oil and gas. Dewatering comps get better in the second half, 40% decline this year. I think you called out double-digit decline next year. Maybe you can just talk about sensitivities and what you're baking in there for declines on oil and gas. Thanks, folks.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. So, we've built in about a 30% impact in decline in the first half, and then obviously that stabilizes over the course of the full year. And so, it blends out in that kind of low-teen decline for all of 2016. And we've also factored in about a 10% decline in mining in that outlook.
Chip Moore: Great. Thanks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman: Hi.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Brent.
Brent Thielman: I think most of my questions have been answered. But a question on Canada, it's shown some pretty sharp declines for a couple of quarters now. How large is Canada for you? And when do we start to see those comparisons ease?
Phil De Sousa: I'll give you guys – so this is Phil. I'm just going to just jump in here real quick. So just to put into perspective the declines that we've seen in Canada, both, fourth quarter and full year completely almost entirely tied to that oil and gas decline that we've got there. And so, for the year, of the top of my head, I want to say, it's down 13% – 15% or so for the year. And in terms of size, it's about $150 million in revenue.
Brent Thielman: Okay. Great.
Phil De Sousa: And that's Canada overall, not the oil and gas within Canada, just to be clear.
Brent Thielman: Got it. Thanks, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Brian.
Shashank Patel: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Konigsberg: This might sound like a little bit of a crazy question considering the backdrop, but under the scenario where oil prices do say improve just modestly, and you do get a supply response out of the U.S., I'm just curious, maybe two things. Where do you think that oil prices actually need to go to, to actually initiate a supply response? And how quickly would you guys benefit, if that was to happen?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, Brian. I would say – I mean, I wouldn't want to kind of put a dollar amount out there in terms of the oil price to go there. But, the key is, it needs to be substantial enough that there is a meaningful increase in oil rigs. That's really the high correlator for us. And I think also, given our heavy exposure on the fracking side, again, I think that we would need to see a pretty notable move upwards in oil prices for us to be able to see a meaningful recovery there. So, I don't want to sound too dour or sour on that because I do believe that, once we get a lift, and there will be a lift at some point down the road, the teams in that part of our business have done a fantastic job at managing the cost base, so we will certainly see a very healthy incremental leverage when we see any growth there. But we're not counting on any of that here in 2016.
Brian Konigsberg: Sure. Understood. And next, can you maybe touch a little bit more on the free cash flow. You're looking for 100% plus conversion. Maybe you just give us the outlook as far as what are the kind of meaningful contributors. Obviously, you've got D&A. I mean, are you counting on working capital coming through or are there other items we should be thinking about?
Shashank Patel: Yeah. I can take that one. And it is over 100% and the drivers there are the normal generation of cash plus, on the working capital side, we showed good progress in second half. That momentum continues and that momentum will continue for the full year so we expect – that's why we expect over 100% is all the working capital areas such as we had good progress on inventory and accounts payable. On the AR side, we actually got hurt a little bit with the heavy shipment in December. But that's an area we continue to attack as far as pass-through receivables and we saw a good progress there in the fourth quarter as well.
Brian Konigsberg: Great. If I could just sneak one last in, what's the update on status on CFO search?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. So, we've had a lot of interest in the role. Interviewed a large number of experienced public company CFO candidates. We're down now to the short strokes. And so, I'm confident we're going to be announcing something here in the very near future here.
Brian Konigsberg: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Decker: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Prendergast with BB&T.
Nicholas Prendergast: Hi. Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Nicholas Prendergast: I just had a quick question about your emerging markets. And I know you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but I'm not sure I entirely got it. You noted that growth was 7% in the year. It slowed down to, I believe, around 2% in Q4. What exactly drove that again?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. That was predominantly the sharp decline that we had in commercial building and industrial in China in the quarter, and we also had a tough prior year comp as well. We had quite a large growth in the fourth quarter last year in emerging markets.
Nicholas Prendergast: Okay. And then, if I heard correctly, in the Q&A, I think you said you've kind of moderated your view in emerging markets from the 7% in 2015 to somewhere around mid-single digits in 2016. Is that correct? And then, I guess, what gives you confidence that that will continue, and you don't continue to suffer from this China slowdown or whatever?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. That is correct in terms of what we laid out. And I think the – again, what we see there is confidence. I mean, first of all, I would say, I wouldn't focus too much on any one quarter because, again, the large of our business in emerging markets is still projects given these new greenfield things that are being invested and those can be choppy in terms of quarter-to-quarter movement or year-over-year comparisons. But again, we think that it's continued strength in public utility in China over the course of the full year, and it's the benefits that we're seeing from the investments we're making in the Middle East. And then, lastly, you may recall that last year we announced a $40 million project win in India. And a large piece of that ships out in 2016.
Nicholas Prendergast: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Hey, guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano: I actually can't believe I'm asking this question, but can you kind of refresh everyone on weak dollar implications for your business as expectations seem to be shifting a little bit here?
Shashank Patel: Yeah. I will take that one. As far as, from a euro perspective, which was a big headline about a year ago, the euro today is trading roughly what it was on the average for last year. Where we see the foreign exchange impact in 2016 is probably the British pound, the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar impacting us as well as emerging market currencies. There's some softness there which kind of blessed during the fourth quarter, still is there, and we've baked all of that in. And that's where we see the challenge. We do not – as long as the euro holds, we don't see the headwind from the euro like we did a year ago.
Joseph Giordano: No. I mean, if we're getting into a situation where people think the dollar is going to weaken going forward and – weaken versus the euro, how is that going to benefit you guys?
Phil De Sousa: Joe, let me just jump in here. Last year, we kind of gave the – a better rule-of-thumb schedule, if you would. If you want to kind of do it based on the outlook or based on where we are here in terms of the calendar, you basically think about it net-net, about for every [ph] cent (57:36) move in the euro, you got about $0.01, if you would, benefit to us or, if you would, headwind to us at the bottom line. So, it's about a penny for penny.
Shashank Patel: That's for the full year.
Phil De Sousa: For the full year.
Patrick Decker: Yeah, and I – obviously , as you well know, Joe, and everybody on the call knows, it's such an uncertain environment right now from a currency standpoint that we simply snap the rates here based on where we are today. And we'll continue to be transparent on moves either direction on EPS impact.
Joseph Giordano: Perfect. And then on the utility side, can you kind of talk about what you're seeing in larger CapEx-type projects versus what you are seeing in repair and replacement? More on – I guess, more on the order side, probably more on the forward look.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. I mean, we continue to see very attractive increase in quoting and bidding activity. We're seeing some increase in our win rates in that area as well. We are – we aren't seeing a major shift in the mix of our business just yet in terms of project versus more of the repair and maintenance. And part of the reason is the fact that as we still see that some customers kind of kicking the can down the road. We've seen a nice uptick in our break and fix part of the market as well. And so, that piece continues to grow quite nicely. I would again reiterate, although it's a small portion of our revenue in a given year, our backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond is up 48%. And so, again, a small portion of revenue, but it's historically been a leading indicator as to what the growth should look like in terms of momentum two years, three years out. And so, I would be concerned if I saw that trend going the other direction. It just continued to build over the course of the last year as we've given you those numbers.
Shashank Patel: And just to add a little bit – yeah. On the treatment side of our business, in the fourth quarter, we did see plus 20% on the order side. Granted that's longer lead time and that's also leading into the 2017 backlog, but we did see strength in treatment.
Joseph Giordano: Yeah. Okay. And if I can sneak one more, on the deal that you've done on the analytic side, outside of near term dilution from the purchase price and allocation and things like that, how do you see margins of those businesses at scale kind of comparing to the segment average before this?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. Sure. So, without giving specifics on any one deal, I would say that to your point, as we get to the noise of the non-cash items that go through EPS, these deals we've done will be in line with our operating margins as a company, once we factor in synergies and other benefits. And those margins become even more accretive quite frankly, as we do further deals in the space because of the knock-on synergies and blended margins that we obtain.
Joseph Giordano: Great. Thanks, guys.
Patrick Decker: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cassil with Seaport Global Securities.
Ryan Cassil: Good morning, guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Ryan Cassil: Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe you could talk about the book-and-ship business. It looks like you're anticipating that being a higher percentage of sale in 2016 or at least in the first quarter. And it's at a time when customers are being cautious on inventories and visibility as well. What gives you the confidence there on the short lead times stuff?
Shashank Patel: So I think – and you're right we are counting on a high level book-and-ship business and that's tied to the 2% to 4% growth we expect. And specifically the areas that we have a high book-and-ship for example, the Applied Water segment and that's driven by new products that we've actually launched and introduced over the last couple of years, and those affect both the European market and the U.S. market. So, that's going to drive that higher level of book-and-ship activity in the year.
Ryan Cassil: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Shashank Patel: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of things, one on the tax rate. I think at the Analyst Day, you guided that it should be 21% kind of through 2020. I saw it was 18% in the quarter and you're guiding it to 20% for 2016. Is there anything to comment there? Is there more progress being made on tax initiatives? Or how should we think about that and in the context of the long-term guide too?
Shashank Patel: Yeah. The overall tax rate, and we are guiding to the 20% range realizing that any quarter is impacted by the mix of where the profit is from a global perspective because the tax rates do move around. But based on the tax structure we have and based on the mix that we projected in 2016, we're basically guiding to the same roughly 20%, it's on average 20%. As I said, it moves. It does move slightly quarter-to-quarter.
Robert Barry: Right. I mean, is the driver just based on the planned mix of business this year or should we now be thinking based on initiatives that the tax rate ought to track better?
Shashank Patel: It's the mix of the – the regional mix of the business is the driver.
Robert Barry: Got you. And then just finally, maybe if you could unpack the mid-single digit growth that you see in the public utility, how that's kind of shaped out between the transport treatment versus test verticals?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, I would say that, on a relative basis, to that mid-single digit, we would expect that there be a slightly higher growth rate than that in transport and treatment. And I would say that the – thinking about the test side of the business, that would be kind of in line with what we guided to there. And then obviously, what kind of pulls that down a bit would be the dewatering piece of the business, which is still going to be dealing with the oil and gas and mining lap.
Robert Barry: Got you. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remark.
Patrick Decker: Great. Thank you. Well, we appreciate the continued interest by everybody. Thanks for joining on the call today. Safe travels between now and the next time we see you, all. And we look forward to updating you on the next earnings call. Thank you, all.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Patrick Decker: Thanks, Phil and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. Today we reported another solid quarter for Xylem, with better than expected growth at both the top and bottom lines. We are also reaffirming our full year organic revenue growth expectations of 1% to 2% as well as our full year earnings expectations of $1.82 to $1.87 per share. I'm pleased with our teams overall executions and we're continuing to build our capabilities. We are in the early stages of executing against the long-term objectives that we laid out at Investor Day last month and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Before I get into the business highlights for the quarter. Let me start with some color commentary on our markets. As I've discussed previously, Xylem is well positioned in key end markets that have solid longer term growth profiles. Well some concerns do exists in the broader industrial end market and certain sectors of our emerging markets. I'm quite encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business. For example, we continue to see positive signs of steady recovery in the Public Utility market, which constitutes roughly one-third of our global business. We are seeing improvement in the Break/Fix side of the market. This is an area that has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred needed repairs and upgrades. But eventually, this equipment either breakdowns or reaches the end of its operational life and must be addressed. In addition, project quotation and our longer cycle treatment business which we view as the bellwether for the more capital intensive investment cycle of the public utility market remains strong. In fact, our treatment bid pipeline has grown 17% versus a year ago. This is a positive leading indicator for continued order growth that should benefit our entire water infrastructure segment. Our third quarter organic revenue performance in public utilities, up 5% demonstrates that we are successfully capitalizing on improved market conditions, and increasing our capabilities to gain market share. We are optimistic on the growth outlook of this important end market and we're confident that our strategy will continue to drive above market performance over the long-term. Industrial was also a significant market for Xylem and similar to other companies in this phase. We certainly are impacted by the underlying market trends. However, we're better positioned than most. Our industrial market exposure is more weighted to the general industrial sector. Oil and gas which has faced extremely steep declines represents less than 5% of our total revenues. So consistent with our performance year-to-date, we continue to anticipate modest growth in general industrial, offset by the near-term headwinds in oil and gas, which we begin to lap in the second quarter of 2016. From a regional perspective, I remain optimistic on the US markets. Particularly, the Public Utility and Commercial Building sectors which will address in more detail later on the call. Europe is more stable than a year ago. And we expect to more favorable outlook given our strong presence in the public utility market there and early signs of success with certain product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. I also want to address the emerging markets, which I recognize has been the cause of much hand-wringing over the past few months. During the third quarter, our business and emerging markets grew 9% overall. Driven by continued investment in infrastructure and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit growth for the year. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have a clear strategy to drive growth in these regions including localizing more research and development, building our manufacturing capabilities and strengthening lower local teams. These initiatives will position us to continue to capture a larger share of the growing infrastructure investments being made in the emerging markets. While there has been some deceleration in the commercial building and general industrial sectors. Our business is overweighed to the water and wastewater utility sectors in the emerging markets. For example, we posted 12% growth in China in the third quarter, significantly outpacing the market. That growth was fuelled by an 18% increase in our water infrastructure segment, well our Applied Water segment grew 3% year-over-year. In other regions, we continue to expand and further penetrate the markets. Take India, where we grew more than 300% in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our team there, which during the quarter won a $39 million project order which we will begin to deliver to the customer next year. And we made substantial inroads with our Analytical instrumentation business on important government projects such as the Ganges River Cleanup. Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our investment to expand our presence in the Middle East. These are just a few examples to illustrate why we remain confident that ongoing investment in water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to fuel growth for Xylem in these faster growth regions. Now let's cover the business highlights for the quarter. Orders were flat organically year-over-year as well lapped last year's particularly strong quarter, when bookings were up 8%. We continue to build backlog existing the quarter with just over $810 million in projects. Of this, approximately $450 million is due to ship in the fourth quarter, representing 44% of our expected revenue. The remaining $360 million in backlog is expected to ship in 2016 and thereafter. Which represents an 18% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis, as well as 50% plus increase quarter sequential. We delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter, which was better than we anticipated coming into the quarter. Our adjusted operating margins was flat year-over-year excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. The biggest challenge we faced in the quarter was the incremental mixed headwinds from declines in our dewatering rental services and lower margin project deliveries in our Applied Water segment. We were able to mitigate these factors through continuous improvement activities and by taking action on discretionary cost measures, which also enabled us to continue to invest in future growth initiatives. Given the impact of the significant unfavorable mixed issues. We were pleased with our team's ability to deliver earnings that were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. At the bottom line we delivered earnings per share of $0.49 up 4% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. And finally, we delivered another quarter of solid free cash flow performance with conversion of that income of 132% for the quarter. Now turning to Slide 4, those of you who joined for Investor Day will recall that I laid out a very clear investment thesis for Xylem. First, we're well positioned to benefit from a favorable macro outlook in our key end markets in growing presence in faster growth regions. This positioning in combination with our focused execution will enable Xylem to drive faster than market growth. Second, we have a clear runway from margin expansion driven by our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives. And the final element, which I want to touch upon further is our commitment to larger scale balance capital deployment. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we repurchased more than 2 million shares for $75 million and we have approximately $475 million available under our authorized programs. In addition, we paid $26 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter or $77 million year-to-date reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that last week, we completed our acquisition of HYPACK. A software firm that specializes in delivering unique solutions and services in the coastal and hydrographic market. Strategically within our $300 million Analytics platform. HYPACK strengthens our position in the surface water, ocean and coastal markets and importantly HYPACK expands our Analytics capabilities in software development. This transaction is a good example of how we can and will use M&A as a proxy for research and development. As we indicated earlier this year, we have a solid pipeline of targets ranging from small bolt-on businesses to larger targets that can enhance our current portfolio or extend our strategic platforms. Xylem will continue to be active on the M&A front. And my expectation is that we will close on a number of bolt-on acquisitions over the coming few quarters. Meanwhile, we continue to cultivate targets of larger size. So now let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover our full year outlook. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect to generate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 2%. We now expect full year operating margin to be approximately 13% up 30 basis points excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation as benefits in productivity actions and volume leverage will likely be partially offset by unfavorable mix. We are reaffirming our previous earnings per share guidance of $1.82 to $1.87 for the full year, which includes $0.23 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this headwind, year-over-year EPS growth is still expected to be in the range of 4% to 7%. Finally, we will continue to execute a balanced approach to capital deployment, which we expect to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion. With that, let me now turn the call over to Shashank Patel to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Shashank?
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6. We generated revenues of $902 million, down $61 million from the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind driven by a stronger US Dollar. Excluding this impact organic revenue increased 2% slightly above our expectations. We saw growth across our key end markets, the strongest being public utility which was up 5% driven by an uptick in municipal spending. Additionally, we generated growth in industrial up 1%, residential up 6% and commercial up 1%. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our smallest end market agriculture which was down 7%. From a regional perspective, we again saw the strongest performance coming from emerging markets which grew 9%. We continue to experience growth in Western Europe and Australia during the quarter, but we also felt the unfavorable impact from a weak oil and gas market, which drove declines in Canada and the US. Operating margins was 13.7% flat year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. Global procurement, lean initiatives and restructuring savings reduced cost by $29 million in the quarter driving 320 basis points of margin expansion. Offsetting these reductions were material, labor and overhead cost inflation. Unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering, rental and sales and lower margin project deliveries and to a lesser extent foreign exchange transaction headwinds. Overall, pricing was neutral for the quarter. At the bottom line earnings per share declined by $0.04 to $0.49. However, excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.06, we grew EPS by 4%. Our tax rate was generally in line with our expectations. Our share repurchases during the quarter were executed opportunistically in late August and early September and therefore had a relatively insignificant impact to our share count expectation. Now, let me cover each our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. Water infrastructure recorded orders of $590 million down 1% organically reflecting a tough comparison with the prior year, when we posted 10% organic growth. The high single-digit growth generated in water and wastewater transport applications was offset by declines in our dewatering business driven primarily by oil and gas market weakness. Our book-to-bill ratio was $1.07 in the quarter. Slightly better than last quarter but not as strong as last year. Overall, we existed the quarter with backlog of $624 million up 6% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately 52% is due to the ship in the fourth quarter with most of the balance expected to ship in 2016. Well this represents a relatively small portion of our anticipated 2016 revenue, we are encouraged by the 23% organic relative to the comparable figure last year. Revenue of $551 million was up 2% year-over-year on an organic basis. Treatment revenues grew 10% and Test increased 2%. As was the case last quarter, transport was flat overall. Regionally, we generated most of our growth in the emerging markets. Where we continue to see growth driven by increased regulations and demand for both public utility and industrial water and wastewater infrastructure. We posted 9% organic growth in these faster growing regions including 18% growth in China. Australia and Western Europe grew 19% and 4% respectively. This growth was partially offset by weakness in the United States and Canada primarily due to declines in the industrial oil and gas markets. Growth accelerated in the Public Utility sector, where we posted better than market performance in the aggregate. Our performance this quarter reflects the positive longer term outlook, we have for this attractive and stabilizing end market. As I mentioned earlier transport was flat overall for the quarter. We saw a significant growth in our water and wastewater pump business up 9% organically including accelerated growth in the US and Europe. Offsetting this growth was weaker than expected performance in our dewatering business. Which was impacted by year-over-year 45% decline in oil and gas application. We expect these headwinds to continue until we lapped the first quarter next year. The good news here, is that we continue to benefit from a healthy construction in Public Utility market, where combined we generated approximately 14% growth in the quarter. Our treatment was up significantly with strengthened Western Europe complemented by project deliveries in China and Australia. And to wrap up on the top line, Test grew 2% overall primarily driven by the delivery of our multi-million dollar projects in emerging markets. Operating margin decreased 90 basis points from 16.3% to 15.4%. Cost reductions, net of inflation drove 60 basis points of operating margin expansion. However, operating margin was negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable mix, which was driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. We also continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives in the quarter such as our expansion in the Middle East, which we outlined during Investor Day. While FX translation negatively impacted operating income during the quarter, it had a neutral impact on margin. Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk for Applied Water segment. Applied water recorded orders of $349 million up 2% organically. As improving markets conditions and new product introductions in Europe more than offset the anticipated slowdown in China. In the US, our biggest regional exposure we continue to see an improving commercial market driven by the institutional building sector. We entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $188 million [ph] up 5% on constant currency basis. Approximately $125 million of this backlog is expected to ship during the fourth quarter representing approximately 34% of our anticipated fourth quarter revenue. Turning back to the third quarter results. Revenue was $351 million up 3% organically from the prior year. Building service applications were up 3% and industrial water increased 6%. Irrigation declined 7%. Regionally, we generated 7% growth in emerging markets and 21% growth in Canada. The US and Western Europe were also up slightly for the quarter. Let me provide a few more details on this performance. In Asia, our business increased nearly 10% fueled by growth in India, Thailand, The Philippines and to a lesser extent China where growth decelerated to 3%. Additionally, we delivered mid-teens growth in Eastern Europe and high single-digit growth in Latin America. In the US, we generated mid single-digit increase in residential and modest growth in commercial and industrial applications, partially offset by weakness in irrigation. Canada grew significantly this quarter, as we delivered on a high spec fire turbine [ph] project and experience some strength in the commercial building sector. Operating margin declined 40 basis points from 14.4% to 14.0% year-over-year excluding FX translation headwinds. Cost reductions and net of inflation drove 110 basis points of expansion in the segment. However, operating margin was negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable mix driven by lower margin project shipments and the one-time impact of a retroactive Italian compensation tax change. Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position. With a balance of $611 million at the end of Q3. Our net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 24.5% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facility remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balance capital deployment strategy. During the third quarter, we invested $21 million in capital expenditures and we return $26 million to shareholders through dividends. As Patrick discussed, we opportunistically repurchased $75 million in shares under our existing share repurchase plan. Free cash flow was $116 million during the quarter, which includes a strong conversion on the 132%. With that, please turn to Slide 10 and I'll cover our 2015 guidance. Beginning with our organic revenue outlook by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue has been flat year-to-date and we anticipate a flat growth the fourth quarter as general industrial growth is likely to be offset primarily by near-term oil and gas headwinds. Given our fourth quarter outlook for general, industrial growth. We still expect flat full year performance within this market. The Public Utility sector which constitutes 33% of our total revenue is anticipated to grow at a low to mid single-digit rate for the full year. You might recall, that we had a low single-digit growth over the first half of the year. However, we experienced an acceleration in that growth during the third quarter, which we expect to continue through the end of the year. While we continue to expect above market growth in key regions like the US. Given that we have sizable project scheduled to ship later in the fourth quarter, there is some risk of project deliveries slipping into 2016. For the commercial market, we now anticipate full year organic growth in the mid single-digit range better than our previous expectations and reflecting the positive growth trend in the US institutional building sector. We are also projecting slightly better full year performance in residential. We now expect this market to grow at a low single-digit range with low-to-mid single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect the fourth quarter to reflect growth in Europe as well as continued growth in emerging markets. In Europe, we are driving share gains with new products that address customer needs. Driven by increased energy efficiency regulation. As we outlined at Investor Day, this is one example of how our innovation agenda is being developed are on both immediate and emerging customer needs. Finally, our smallest sector agriculture will likely be down mid-to-high single digits. Strengthen the Western US region driven primarily by continuing drought conditions is expected to be more than offset by the unfavorable impact from floods earlier this year. Turning to Slide 11 to summarize our revenue outlook as well as cover the rest of our full year guidance. At the segment level, we expect water infrastructure revenue of approximately $2.3 billion. Organically, we now expect growth of flat to up 1%. This is 1% lower than the previously anticipated and it reflects [technical difficulty] dewatering which are related primarily to oil and gas applications. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we do expect these headwinds to moderate, as we get into the second quarter of 2016. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of $1.35 billion. Organically, we now expect revenue growth of 2% to 3%, which is slightly better than our previous expectations. This reflects the commercial and residential performance I highlighted earlier. Segment margins are anticipated to be 14.2% and operating margins are projected to be approximately 13.0% reflecting year-over-year margin expansion up 30 basis points excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. At the bottom line, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.82 to a $1.87 excluding restructuring and realignment cost of $20 million and other special items. We are on track to achieve 100% free cash flow conversion this year. And we continue to invest return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015. While our business is impacted by several currencies. The most significant impact comes from the Euro. Our Euro-Dollar exchange assumptions remains unchanged at a $1.10. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%. Approximately 1% higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue. And lastly, fully diluted share count is count is now expected to be 182 million reflecting our third quarter repurchase activity. Now I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Shashank. To wrap up, I'd again highlight that we delivered another solid quarter. We continue to see signs of an improving public utility market and post above average organic growth overall, overcoming industrial weakness. We still have a lot of work ahead of us to close out the year, as our teams delivered a very strong fourth quarter last year. Looking ahead, we know our year-over-year comparison will ease starting in the second quarter of 2016, as we finally lapped the substantial declines in our dewatering rental business driven by the oil and gas sector. In addition, we are committed to maintaining focus on driving productivity and cost discipline, which will enable us to continue to deliver a stronger bottom line performance. We are also focused on executing our capital deployment strategy. Returning capital via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases and cultivating a solid pipeline of M&A targets. Lastly, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made this year and pleased that we continue to be on track to deliver on our full year commitments. And now operator, we can begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I wonder, if we could just, with trying to get a little bit more color on Slide 6 the volume price mix at minus 50 basis points. I would assume that with plus 2% organic growth, volume was a very slight tailwind and the mix just from dewatering, I would think was probably at least 100 basis points of headwinds. So I wanted to try and get some idea on how price is behaving overall for the company there.
Shashank Patel: Hi, Nathan. This is Shashank, so I'll take that question. From a price realization standpoint, we're neutral overall. So what we've experienced in the second quarter. We saw third quarter, so there's pockets of price pressure out there. But overall, it was pretty much flat in the third quarter and that's our expectation in the fourth quarter. The mix dynamic you talked about was primarily coming from the dewatering side, where the oil and gas headwinds were stronger than we had forecasted, so that impacted the mix part of the equation.
Nathan Jones: That's there. I guess price was neutral and I guess, it sounds like it has been for the whole year.
Shashank Patel: Yes, correct.
Nathan Jones: And you did say, in your prepared remarks Patrick, that you're expecting some modest general industrial growth going forward. I think that's probably better than the general industrial economy outlook. Can you talk about what's giving you confidence that you're going to share growth there? Perhaps what the different market exposures are that help you out?
Patrick Decker: Sure I think, first of all it's our geographic exposure that helps in that regard as well. So again, there is some of the emerging markets that factors into that. But it's also, when you look at the nature of our industrial exposure, it much less weighted to the energy sector and much more to broad based general industrial and again, we do - we just continue to see signs of strength that's there. If you look at where we are in the quarter industrial growth excluding oil and gas was up about 2.5% and that's roughly what we're continued to expect through the balance of the year.
Nathan Jones: Okay, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.
Scott Davis: Trying to get a sense of your M&A pipeline. Now it's your first deal that we've seen and quite some time and I'm trying to get a sense of this as a first of and many and a flurry, it's relatively small transaction but is there a stuff that's a little bit larger in your pipeline.
Patrick Decker: Sure, thanks Scott. There certainly are acquisitions of larger size in the pipeline. We are actively in discussion with a number of bolt-on targets kind of smaller tuck-ins. Certainly larger than the ones that we announced here, but we also continue to cultivate some larger targets that are out there. And so, we really highlight this one not so much because of the size, I wouldn't consider this to be typical of the sizes we go after, with really to demonstrate as much that the pause is over. And two, the fact that as I mentioned in Investor Day. I really do see M&A serving sometimes as a proxy for R&D and that really is largely what this acquisition is pointing to.
Scott Davis: Okay, great and then. From a strange question, but trying to get a sense like Break/Fix infrastructure is old we all know that, but is Break/Fix the type of thing. I mean, you mentioned it's been weak for a last few years. I mean, I would assume that just based on the installed base you have and infrastructure that you have existing it's pretty old that Break/Fix would be fairly decent growth through the cycle. I mean, how do you think about what that should be? I mean, have you drawn out models or how to sense I guess of Break/Fix specifically should be 5% grower or is it something that could be a little bit better than that because there's pent-up demand.
Patrick Decker: Sure, I'll take that one Scott. So I would say, you're absolutely right. So we've got a very large installed base especially on the Public Utility side and as a result of that. Even throughout the cycle, we would normally see low-to-mid single digits in terms of steady growth. I think what we're saying here is, we're seeing kind of the upper end of that and would expect that could probably be growing even faster as we go forward here because as you've heard it say before, it really is a trade-off for these infrastructure owners. You can only kick the can down the road so long before it's going to catch up with and you're going to be forced to deal with the Break/Fix aspect of things. Now obviously that could moderate and balance towards Greenfield infrastructure investment as well. So it's always the balance in the equation, but we would expect to continue to see probably the upper end of that mid single-digit growth in Break/Fix.
Scott Davis: That's really helpful. Okay, I'll pass it on, thanks good luck, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I was hoping you could expand on the data point you gave regarding the bid pipeline being up 17%. Just remind us about the methodology, the parameters, how you're tracking that win rates and how it converts to backlog?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, our teams have a very, especially in the project side have very good visibility to all of the active projects that are out there within the EPC community as well as the property owners themselves. And certainly as, we've continue to build out the utilization of Salesforce.com. We've got even more visibility to the pipeline and what the conversion rates are and we have seen some improvement in our win rate as well, as an increase just in the level of quoting activity. And so, pretty rigorous pipeline review that we do on a regular basis. So as I mentioned earlier, Deane in my prepared remarks. We're not really looking at that pipeline so much as a view towards what our treatment business would be per se because as you know the project side is still a relatively small portion of our overall revenue. It's just historically been a leading indicator as to demand that's coming for our broader water infrastructure business overall.
Deane Dray: And just to remind us, that mix between the Break/Fix and projects. Historically it's been around 70-30 is that still the case?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I'd say that's a case right now. It's probably shifting a bit more towards maybe 75-25.
Deane Dray: Okay and with 75 on the Break/Fix just, so we're clear.
Patrick Decker: That's correct.
Deane Dray: Okay and then, hoping you can expand on China. Lots of focus in terms of, what their economy is doing, but we're seeing real differences across the multi-industry sector, that's on China growth depending on their vertical exposures and obviously you're on the favorable side of this. So talk about your mix in China pipeline and who you're competing with for these projects. How much of it is domestic Chinese players versus other western players?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So I'll take various aspects of the gains [ph] and if I don't address each of your questions. You're just, remind me again of some elements of it. So we saw again in the third quarter continued robust growth as you pointed out and that really is driven by our over waiting towards public utilities and the municipal side. And that really is being driven by largely the government mandate there around pollution control and water preservation. So that's the overall macro driver that's there. We obviously have seen a slowdown in the commercial building sector. Although, it was still growth for us in the quarter and we expect that to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. In terms of the - who we're competing against there. It is a combination of global players, but also local players. Obviously part of what we're doing in terms of localizing our product design in China and looking at ways to augment what we call our Tier 1 offering with a Tier 2 offering there as well, is to protect ourselves on the flank in terms of local competition. We're optimistic about the opportunities that we have there to be able to even grow that kind of Tier 2 segment, while still preserving margins in that business because of the features and benefits that we can decouple and deliver that at a better value for customers more in the Tier 2, Tier 3 cities that can't really afford [indiscernible] any of the larger pumping stations that these large cities do.
Shashank Patel: And just to, this is Shashank just to add to that. So on the - as far as the international players, obviously the [indiscernible] are big one, we compete directly head-on against. And on that side, that is premium value segment of the market and that's a lot of way, we participate today and as Patrick said on the infrastructure side. The investment continues there, so we've continued to see strength there. As we've all heard, there's been a slowdown on the construction side and that's where we've seen the slowdown in commercial building services, but there again with the localized product. Where we're going to be looking at competing more on the, let's call it the value segment. Which is where you see a lot of the local players.
Deane Dray: Great, that's real helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg: I just wanted to touch on the fourth quarter guidance. So just looking at the sequential change from Q3 to Q4, you had a pretty big uptick or a decent uptick on sales, which is a bit higher than what you potentially see and then separately just on the margin, you were down you [indiscernible] basis points in Q3 year-over-year, but you're expecting that to take a pretty big step up into Q4, I know there was some mix you said on the Applied Water. But you also noted, the oil headwind being a mix negative, which I assume will continue in the water infrastructure in Q4. So can you address me the revenue and margin, how you see the progression sequentially?
Shashank Patel: Yes, let me take that one. From a revenue perspective, first point is, we do have an extra day versus the prior year last year, that's what the bottom 1% as far as organic growth. If you recall, last year we had a very tough compare, we were up about 6% in the fourth quarter but when you look at the normalized growth it's more like 3% to 5% in Q4 last year. Since we equate that and we look at the guidance this year, it's about 1% to 3% organic growth over the fourth quarter last year. Which with the extra day and normalizing last year it's kind of inline and it's supported by the strong order activity we've seen. On the margin question, clearly in the third quarter we had margin headwind not only from the softness in the - from the oil and gas and dewatering, but also the points I noted especially on the AWS side, where we had the Italian tax true up, which was a one-time true up as well as FX transaction and those were primarily driven by the strength in the [technical difficulty]. But when we take a look at that headwind going away, as well as the extra volume leverage we get in the fourth quarter that's how we anticipate the extra margin expansion Q3 to Q4.
Patrick Decker: And Brian, I would just, this is Patrick. I would just add a couple of things. On the margin side, we also as is normally the case, our global procurement savings accelerate over the course of the year. So we'll have some additional procurement savings in Q4 as well. On the revenue side, within that range, obviously we talked about there's always risk of project delays at the end of the quarter shifting from one to the next. The way I would handicap it for you all, it would be within the guidance range that we gave you. I'd kind of go right down in the middle of fair way in terms of what that revenue guide would be and that would help mitigate any, of that risk that maybe out there. So just to help you guys kind of do your models, I'd say right down the middle of fairway on the revenue guide.
Brian Konigsberg: That's on the water infrastructure side that you noted, possibly.
Patrick Decker: That's overall. Yes, that's actually - it's mainly on the water infrastructure side that you would see some of the bigger project, right.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay great and then just maybe comment a little bit more on the oil and gas. So you're lapping the steep decline starting Q2 of next year. But are you starting to see stability at low rates or are you - is it still falling at a pretty substantial degree even sequentially.
Patrick Decker: Yes, so it's a good question, Brian. Just to maybe help size it up for everyone. So again the oil and gas exposure for us for the whole company, is roughly less than 5% of our 2014 revenue. It's actually going to be down around 3% to 4% of our 2015 revenue given the sharp drop that we've seen. That exposure really has begun to stabilize and we got 44 branches in the US, seven which are the ones that are really tied to fracking and they're the ones that are really been hit the hardest. The team's done a lot of great work in managing the cost side there, mothballing in some locations, moving equipment to other international markets to open up opportunities there. And so, we really don't see another leg down from a dewatering standpoint and oil and gas. Given that our exposure is really now being contained. That's why we're making the commentary around getting through Q4 and Q1 and then we finally lap that tough compare on that, small piece of our revenue but disproportionately profitable.
Shashank Patel: And just to add to that, the 5% that Patrick talked about as far as the percentage of total revenues. We expect that to be down 50%, so that function change we saw with the oil and gas.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: I wanted to revisit this topic of mix in Public Utility and think about in a little more strategically, not in the fourth quarter or even 2016, but as the cycle kind of plays out in theory. You've got a pretty good, divergence in the mix there. Your project business is more subject to bid and there, I would assume lower margin, but yes the repair and replaces almost had some aftermarket type elements and higher margins. So as we move years into this upcycle. Where do you see that mix evolving and where do you see the impact on the margin being?
Patrick Decker: Yes, certainly there would be some shift towards a larger project mix. But it's certainly over the timeframe that we talked about at Investor Day kind of looking at over the next three years to five years. I certainly wouldn't expect that to shift dramatically. There's probably, if you look at it historically that might go up to maybe a third of our overall revenue that would be on the project side versus where we've been tracking over the course of the last few years.
Shashank Patel: The other point - the other point to notice as we discussed during Investor Day. One of the big initiatives on the innovation technology side will be to work around VOD [ph] which is really taking cost out of the material component of our product. So obviously, you talked about long-term, that's the big long-term drive over the next five years and that has an impact directly on the gross margin line and then some of other business simplification work we'll be doing, obviously will improve gross margins as well.
Patrick Decker: I mean to be specific, Ryan on just to give you a feel and maybe to take it back to Investor Day in terms of the targets that we laid out there for you all, that we're marching towards. Historically, our incremental margins have been around that 35% give or take. What we factored into, our long-term outlook was through a combination of some slight uptick in project mix as well as faster growth rates in emerging markets that, that long-term incremental margin that we assumed might be more around that 30%, maybe little slightly better than that, but it's you know probably down about 5 points from historical average and we got that already modeled in, that obviously derived, are thinking also been around simplification, VOD [ph] some of the other things we're doing to offset that to really driver the bottom line expansion, that we committed to.
Ryan Connors: Okay, great and then my second one had to do with sort of the new product pipeline. Obviously, a strategic focus on innovation that was a big theme at the Analyst Day. So can you provide any real-time color on what's hitting the market for you and whether there's anything that will move the needle as a pricing or volume standpoint over the next say 12 months.
Phil De Sousa: Ryan, its Phil. We just have a little bit of a technical difficulty here. You just flipped over to a backup line, can you just repeat the question for us, just one more time from the beginning.
Ryan Connors: Sure, thing. So yes, just asking about the new product pipeline, that's something that you focused on quite a bit innovation at the Analyst Day and wondering, whether you can provide any update on kind of the potential for new product introductions to drive pricing over the next 12 months or so.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Ryan, this is Patrick. So we feel very good. First of all, can you hear me?
Ryan Connors: I can.
Patrick Decker: Okay, great. So I feel very encouraged and very good about what's happening in our innovation funnel and pipeline. The areas that we highlighted at Investor Day focused on elements such as energy efficiency. Obviously as the Internet of Things make its way to the water segment. Our whole monitoring and control platform that we're building here, those were things that we are already bringing the market and we have a number of introductions that are scheduled here through the end of this year and end of 2016 and onwards. We do feel and see that does give us a pricing opportunity, as we increase the value, we're giving to our customers and as we've seen and parts of our business where we really activated that pipeline. The growth rate, as you would expect in that part of the business, where we're actually introducing new products has grown function over the rest of our base business and has come at more favorable margin. But we'll have more in our coming earnings call. We'll be announcing some of the new products that we've actually launched.
Ryan Connors: Great, well thanks for your time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman: Appreciate the comments on the pipeline and backlog of public utility work. I'm curious, regionally has the mix of that pipeline shifted more toward emerging markets compared to recent years or is it kind of relatively unchanged between developed and emerging?
Patrick Decker: I would say, right now there is not been a big shift between the two obviously. There are some large projects that you've heard us announce that we booked here, I'd say over the course of the last year. so whether that be in parts of Asia, whether that be in Latin America or the Middle East and we certainly had a number of those high profile big project wins. But in terms of what we see in terms of bidding pipelines as well as other bookings. We are seeing again emerging strength in the US that we discussed again thus far this year. Secondly, we would expect more so in 2016 and 2017 not sure if you're familiar with the UK AMP Cycle, which is a five-year investment cycle, really targeting the water sector by the UK government. We are now in that first year, there's typically a bell curve that's associated with that five-year timeframe and so it's typically year two and year three, which is next year and the following that you will also hear us talking about ramp up in project and order activity there in the UK, which is not our largest market, but it certainly moved the needle in terms of our overall order activity.
Brent Thielman: Okay, great and then, I think I'm going to step back as you're kind of building momentum in emerging markets, where you know these market shares are kind of still up for grab. How do you assume the competitive environment evolving here lately because you look around many of your global peers are kind of suffering into pressures in oil and gas or other industrial markets. And I'm wondering if that's kind of accelerating some of their interest in pursuing business on the utility side, where clearly things look better.
Patrick Decker: Certainly there is heightened level of interest in these emerging markets especially on the public utility side. I would say that, where we have and I certainly never take that for granted but where I think we really do have a distinct advantage is, if you take an example like China. We've already got a very well established footprint there, we got great customer relationship, we've been there for a number of years. To our customers there, we really feel like a local company. Obviously, although we're run as a professional global organization. The Xylem name is well-known there. We're well penetrated and I really think that we benefit from the integration of our portfolio. And so, often times it maybe that our Flygt brand is example of the calling card. Based upon the great relationship we have there. But that now is pulling through in many cases, our treatment and our Analytics opportunities there in the country as well. The same is happening in India, as well as in the Middle East and certainly in South America as well.
Shashank Patel: And I think to just to add to that, is clearly the competition for, all companies. They're focusing towards more of the emerging markets because that's where the growth is and that's how we're addressing that, is with the local presence. So the investment in Middle East, South Africa and Dubai that's one way to address it. But then a greater way is for localizing the product content and getting the lower cost into our material [ph] so we can be more competitive in those markets as well.
Brent Thielman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi [indiscernible] I'm on the call for Rob. So first question on, if you can comment on the outlook going forward for that Canada business given the impact of lower oil price on the broader Canadian economy. So how would you say the business going forward?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I would say fairly simply. We've seen some level of stabilization, in terms of the exposure that we've got there in Canada. Obviously we've benefited this last quarter from some growth there and some project activity. But again I'd say for us is, it's pretty stable at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay that's helpful and then, if you can maybe breakout the 5% growth in public utility in 3Q. To what extent that was driven by your share gain versus the end market improvement?
Shashank Patel: Yes, I will say out of that 5%, I mean it's tough to say that, because share gain or not but I think we're roughly speaking probably 30% to 40% on that will probably be share gain and the balance is just the overall market is improving.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Prendergast of BB&T.
Nick Prendergast: I just had a question on your corporate and other expense. When I look at your EBIT calculation, you give the two segments and then you give a consolidated number and then obviously the delta is that corporate expenses. Anyway, those significantly lower than we're expecting in the quarter. Is there anything going on there specifically?
Shashank Patel: Well so and you're right, corporate expense was lighter [ph] in the quarter and what we did, is we aggressively managed discretionary cost in order to mitigate some near-term margin headwinds because we saw that in the third quarter especially with the volatility, with China's devaluation and the turmoil out there, a lot of in emerging markets, but there was collateral damage. So we aggressively managed the project type cost that we have in corporate. So and that's why we've got a lower cost in Q3. But the more typical run rate that we see is in the $11 million to $13 million range for each quarter.
Nick Prendergast: Okay that was very helpful and then finally on your share repurchases. In your guidance you said that reflects the repurchase activity that you had in Q3, does that imply that you're not looking to repurchase anymore in Q4?
Patrick Decker: No, I mean not, we're not implying that. I think the - we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of share repurchase. We clearly have the capacity with the authorization that we already have there as well as our balance sheet. We've got the capacity here to do both share repurchase as well as accelerated M&A activity. So I wouldn't read anything into the comments as it relates to Q4.
Nick Prendergast: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Rose of Wedbush Securities
David Rose: I have a couple follow-up questions and just to dig a little bit deeper into the order rates. I mean this is sequentially continue to move down or versus upward and I know you talk about the funnel of RFP's being up 17%, but help us in kind of reconcile the direction. I can understand maybe one quarter it's a little bit lumpy, but again this is a third quarter, where you're a little bit soft and then just think about the timing. If you're going to articulate the timing for us, how we should think about some of those projects going into at the end of 2017 or end of 2016 rather. What do you need to see in terms of RFPs coming through or orders coming through, in order to see growth in 2016?
Patrick Decker: Yes, I would say that I wouldn't read too much into the last couple of quarters or so of the order moving. I really would focus more on what's happening to our backlog. They're shippable in 2016 and beyond. We've had in any given quarter there are a number of projects in any given year and we try to kind of call that out for you guys in terms of what's in there and I realize it maybe choppy overtime. But as I just kind of look ahead to 2016 and beyond, certainly based on what we're seeing here in terms of our public utility strength again the modest strength that we in industrial and certainly the strength in commercial building. I think you should see kind of continued pattern in terms of organic revenue growth here through the first quarter and as I mentioned earlier, when you get into Q2 when we pass this difficult dewatering compare, then I think you begin to see a further acceleration of our top line. So not quite so dependent upon the long-term bookings and projects. Really being driven as much by the short cycle nature of our business and what we're seeing in the trend line there.
Shashank Patel: And just another note, when we look at the third quarter last year, this is the tough compared note that we had in the prepared remarks. Last year, Q3 were up 10%, so it was a very tough compare. It was our strongest quarter from an order booking standpoint in 2014.
David Rose: I appreciate the color and then it's helpful. And maybe, we can kind of do the same thing, as we think about the margins and I know Ryan touched upon sort of the mix shift to longer term, but as we think kind of think about, even the mix shift go into 2016, you have a number of puts and takes and as we look at, maybe you talk about total care in terms of your service component adding to margins and maybe even the mix shift in terms of treatment and Analytics, helping the margin story. Can you provide a maybe a little bit more color about what can help margins in 2016?
Patrick Decker: Sure. I'll hold back from giving any kind of perceived guidance for 2016. We'll certainly cover that in our February call. But in terms of the trend lines that are there. When you think about the impact this year of the unfavorable mix of dewatering, which is a small - the oil and gas piece of our revenue is small, but it was disproportionately profitable. So when you think about kind of getting through Q4 and Q1, you then should expect to see a return to kind of our normal incremental margins that we'd have in the past that kind of 35% range. In terms of the things that help that obviously we'd lapping the dewatering compare. Secondly, you would get the normalized incremental margins on volume fall through. Obviously. We're going to continue to be driving lean and procurement and simplification opportunities, as we talked about in Investor Day. There obviously will be some reinvestment for growth as well. But we'll outline at that for you in the February call.
David Rose: Okay and that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joe Giordano: I just wanted to ask about, the systems integration on the margin side. I know that's a longer term project, but it's a real opportunity for you guys, regardless of kind of the markets you're in, so what are you kind of seeing there in terms of, I guess it could be in the front end and the back end? I know the front end you're looking at the sales side in terms of CRM as well.
Patrick Decker: Sure, yes. We're pleased with the progress that the teams' have made there. Obviously it’s' a lot of work, it's more than just putting systems energy well in there, Joe. It's a cultural change and its training and education and getting people accustomed with the tools, with the adoption rate on the Salesforce.com or CRM is very impressive here in North America, which is where we've largely focused our efforts. We're now obviously doing in other countries as well. We're doing a lot of work right now on the project quote configurator [ph] software that we got to make that easier for our customers and our sales teams to work with and so we're in the middle of that implementation as well. But I certainly echo your comments that's going to be in my view, a significant competitive advantage for us. We're early stage in that. It is a multi-year implementation that we're focused on. The other piece that you alluded to was the back end and that was also a big piece of our simplification game plan that we laid out at Investor Day and we already have some level of shared services implementation in North America. We're prioritizing Europe next and we are very advanced in the planning phase and moving into execution on that.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks for the color there. I had to hate to ask you questions on oil and gas for you guys because I know how small it is, piece of the overall pie. If we're - I'm hearing people talk about spending in North America being down potentially another incremental 20% next year. I know your business took a major hit this year like kind of an immediate hit as spending drops. So now if that was to happen next year again on the E&P side. How do you think your business would fair relative?
Patrick Decker: Yes and I think, that if you look at the direct exposure that we have in oil and gas which by the end of this year would be somewhere between 3% to 4 of our total revenue and it is really isolated largely to a certain number of branches in dewatering and to some extent our Applied Water business. You know I wouldn't suggest we're completely into it, but I think it's a manageable kind of impact for us. And so we keep a close eye to it, but a number of these locations. We're about as close to mothball as you can get. And we've redeployed the pumps to other markets and so I think the team's done a great job in sheltering us from another leg down in that area. But we certainly keep a close eye on it.
Joe Giordano: You know that's kind of what I was thinking and just last from me. I just want to touch on the buyback. It's the most active quarter in the company's history. Do you know what you have left on the authorization by wondering from a piece perspective? Should we start thinking this is more representative of a more average rate?
Patrick Decker: I wouldn't read anything into it. I mean again we're going to be opportunistic. Like I said before, we have the capacity to do both that as well as acquisitions and if we think it's smart to do so, we'll continue to do so.
Joe Giordano: Great, appreciate the time. Thanks.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick Decker: Great. Again, I want to thank you all for your continued interest in Xylem and thank you for joining the call today and we look forward to updating you on the fourth quarter as well as our 2016 guidance in early February. So between now and then, safe travels and happy holidays and we'll see you [indiscernible] soon.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem's third quarter, 2015 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Now, please turn to slide three. Now I’ll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us today. We have a number of items to cover this morning but before we get started, I’d like to address the news regarding our Chief Financial Officer transition that we announced earlier this month. First, my sincere thanks to Mike Speetzen for his many contributions to the company over the past six years. As many of you know, he played a key role throughout the separation process from ITT, providing strong leadership for the financial organization as well as broadly across the business. We wish Mike and his family the very best as they transition to a great new opportunity at Polaris. I would also like to recognize and thank Shashank Patel, who is here with us this morning for quickly stepping into the role of CFO on an interim basis. With nearly two decades of experience at ITT and Xylem, Shashank has deep knowledge of our many businesses and is a highly respected finance and operational leader. He has been able to hit the ground running and help facilitate a smooth transition which is allowing us to proceed with a disciplined, thorough search for a permanent successor. Now let’s turn to the current market environment. Our second quarter results and finally our outlook for the balance of the year. The combination of our uniquely diversified portfolio along with strong execution, enabled us to deliver solid results in the second quarter. I am pleased with our team’s ability to perform well in a challenging environment, increasing long-term backlog, continuing to gain share, and taking cost actions to mitigate pricing pressures. In our Applied Water Systems business turned in another record operating margin performance. In addition, we are encouraged by what we’re seeing in key end markets. The commercial market for example generated solid growth over the first half of the year, and we anticipate growth to accelerate in public utility during the second half. However, market conditions do remain mixed. The industrial market broadly speaking is challenged. As we’ve noted previously, the significant downturn in the oil and gas sector, is shaving an unfavorable direct impact on our dewatering business. As that downturn has persisted, the impact has expanded to other industrial sectors that are currently served by dewatering. That said dewatering is a very attractive business with a compelling historical growth profile, but we currently are working through some near-term market challenges. Looking ahead, our focus remains centered on executing our long-term strategy and delivering on our commitments. I am confident that we’re well-positioned to weather the near-term headwinds and generate solid results within the range of expectations we previously announced. As you saw on our press release this morning, we have narrowed the range of our full-year outlook to reflect our latest view. Now let’s review our results. Orders in the quarter were up 1% organically against record bookings last year. We continue to build backlog, exiting the quarter with just over $800 million in projects. Notwithstanding that, we’re still primarily a book and term business. I am encouraged by the strong execution that resulted in an increase in our sequential backlog, shippable beyond this year by nearly 40% in the quarter. Let me highlight a few project examples. We recently won a $6 million rental contract for Godwin Pumps for the Panama Canal expansion project. As many of you know, the expansion project will double the Canal’s capacity and allow even larger vessels to utilize this waterway. Our dewatering pumps are being used to fill the new lock basins with nearly 2 billion gallons of water as part of a testing phase for this new system. This is a very complex application that needed tremendous technical expertise and the team will very quickly to meet the customers’ tight timeline. On our call last quarter, I discussed one of our innovative water reuse pilot projects in California where interesting water reuse continues to grow. This past quarter Xylem was commissioned to deliver a unique water reuse solution, Island Water Reclamation Plant in Los Angeles. Our advanced oxidation process from Wedeco will be used to ensure that the plant complies with California’s stringent groundwater recharge regulations for indirect potable reuse. Finally, an example in the Middle East. Ashghal, the Public Works Authority of Qatar has commissioned the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant in Al Dhakhira, northeast of the capital city of Doha, included in this plant will be a 56,200 cubic meter per day capacity water reuse facility. In addition to our flight pumps and mixers, our state-of-the-art reuse technology including products from Leopold, Sanitaire and Wedeco were selected for this new plant. We expect to deliver product for this project in both 2016 and early 2017. Shifting back to the second quarter results. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 1%. We generated growth of 3% in our Applied Water segment including double-digit increases in China and Latin America as well as continued strength in the U.S. commercial building sector. The Water Infrastructure segment was flat for the quarter primarily due to a decline in our dewatering rental services business, which serves the U.S. and Canadian oil and gas market. We expect these oil and gas sector headwinds to continue, but we are working to minimize the overall impact in the near-term. For example, we currently are redeploying assets to regions where they can be utilized and at the same time help us to expand our international dewatering presence. Partially offsetting these near term challenges is growth in other key applications, including our water and wastewater pump business. We are capitalizing on our strong offering, and well-earned reputation to outgrow the underlying market and increase share. During the quarter, our business posted mid-single and double-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe respectively. Again, this is an encouraging indicator [Technical Difficulty] utility end market is stable and likely moving into an upward trend. Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The increase savings generated through continuous improvement actions preserve profitability, offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix resulting from the declines in dewatering rental services. During the quarter, our new centralized procurement team was able to leverage our global scale in key categories to drive nearly $20 million in cost savings. This team, which commenced late last year, is continuing to expand the universal spend categories that it targets, in order to reduce the consolidated Xylem spend. I’m very pleased with our contributions today. At the bottom-line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.43, up 2% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. Considering the muted top-line growth and unfavorable mix, we were pleased with our team’s ability to deliver earnings in line with expectations for the quarter. And finally, we also improved free cash flow generation, up 21% year-over-year for the quarter. Now let’s turn to slide four. I’ll briefly summarize our outlook for 2015, and on the next slide, I’ll outline the changes relative to our previous guidance. We now anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 2% for the full year. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. We are narrowing the range of our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.82 to $1.87 for the full year. We now expect year-over-year EPS growth in the range of 4% to 7% excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange translation. Finally, we’ll continue to execute a discipline approach to capital deployment, which is still expected a result in a 100% free cash flow conversion. With that, let’s turn to slide five, and I’ll provide some additional color on the outlook. We are reducing the top end of our full year revenue outlook by approximately one point of organic growth or $40 million. This reflects the incremental weakness in our dewatering business. While the dewatering rental declined then the oil and gas market generally remain in line with our previous expectations. We are seeing incremental unfavorable impacts on our distribution partners. This is a result of a weaker industrial CapEx market, as well as the prolonged oil and gas decline. We’ve also updated our pricing outlook. We now expect pricing to be flat for the year, which is down slightly from our previous expectations. In summary, organic revenue growth is now expected to be approximately 1% to 2% and as a result of the slightly stronger euro, total revenue in the range of $3.64 billion to $ 3.68 billion. From an earnings per share perspective, we’ve narrowed our guidance range to a $1.82 from $1.87. This reflects the change in revenue as well as unfavorable mix. We are diligently working to offset as much of these headwinds as possible and are driving for an incremental $0.07 of earnings from productivity actions. These actions, which include global procurement opportunities, further Lean deployment, and strategic cost management are currently underway. However, we expect to realize the majority of the benefits in the fourth quarter. Finally, we are also updating our second half guidance for foreign exchange translation of $0.02. As we look ahead to the second half, we are not counting on a significant uptick in the current macro environment. We are confidence in our ability to deliver modest growth as we navigate through challenging conditions in the industrial market. We intend to leverage that growth and execute on cost savings initiatives to deliver on our full year commitments. With that, let me now turn the call over to Shashank Patel to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Shashank?
Shashank Patel: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide six. We generated revenues of $920 million, down $85 million from the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind driven by a stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of our valves divestiture in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding those items, organic revenue increased 1%, slightly below our expectations and the outlook we provided during our last call of approximately 2%. From an end market perspective, commercial lead the way up 6% with public utility and agriculture up 2% and 1% respectively. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in the residential market of 2%. The industrial end market was flat year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we again saw strong growth in emerging markets, up 9% combined with 10% growth in Australia and modest growth in Western Europe, up 1%. This was mostly offset by declines in Canada and the U.S., which were down 16% and 2% respectively, primarily due to industrial oil and gas market headwinds. Operating margin was flat at 12% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. Once again despite headwinds in our largest end markets limiting our organic growth, we’re able to demonstrate our ability to execute cost management to maintain our operating margin. Focus on continuous improvement and restructuring savings, reduce cost by $32 million in the quarter and resulted in 350 basis point of margin expansion. Partially offsetting these reductions, where inflation cost, unfavorable sales mix and the impact from the divestiture of our valves business last year. Earnings per share, declined by $0.05 to $043, however excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.06, we grew EPS by 2%. Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide seven. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $585 million, slight organically. Here we saw the high-single digit growth in treatment and modest growth in water and wastewater pump applications, offset by weakness in our dewatering business. Book-to-bill was $1.06 in the quarter. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $614 million, up 9% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately 70% is due to be shipped this year with a balance of nearly $200 million expected to ship in 2016 and beyond. The revenue of $551 million was also flat year-over-year on an organic basis. From an application perspective, test and transport revenues were flat, while treatment was down 2%. Regionally, we generated most of our growth in the emerging markets, which are up 8%. Australia and Western Europe, both contributed approximately $3 million of growth or 11% and 1% respectively. However, declines in the U.S. and Canada, mostly offset our growth. To further summarize our revenue performance, I’d highlight international expansion of dewatering and test, drove growth in emerging markets like Latin America, India and China. In Western Europe, we saw broad-based demand for water and wastewater pumps, partially offset by a decline in treatment project deliveries in Spain and France. Australia was up double-digits, probably driven by strength in treatment, where we are benefiting from regulatory growth drivers around controlling sewer outflows and increasing wastewater recycling for reuse. Test was slight overall probably because of the timing of a multi-million dollar project shipment, which lifted to July. Lastly, we saw significant declines in the U.S. and Canada, derived from lower demand for oil and gas dewatering applications. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points from 13.1% to 12.8%, excluding a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange translation. Operating margins was negatively impacted by inflation and unfavorable mix, coupled with an increase in growth investments and pension costs. This was partially offset by cost reductions resulting from sourcing and lead initiatives, as well as $3 billion of restructuring savings. Let me now turn to slide eight and walk through our Applied Water. Applied Water recorded orders of $359 million, up 3% organically. The strength was headlined by commercial building services, as we continue to see recovery in the institutional building market in the United States. Additionally, we saw significant growth in the commercial sector and to a lesser extent in industrial within emerging markets. As a result, we entered the third quarter with a total backlog of $198 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis. Approximately 80% of this backlog is expected to ship this year. Revenue was $369 million, up 3% organically from the prior year. Building service applications were up 3%. Industrial water increased 3%, and irrigation grew 1%. Regionally, we generated growth in emerging markets and the U.S., which grew 13% and 1% respectively. Western Europe was slightly down overall for the quarter. To summarize further our revenue performance, I’d highlight, we continue to see growth in emerging market regions particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America as commercial and industrial markets continue to expand. Additionally, growth in building services was driven by strength in U.S. commercial up 6%, where we have seen distributors stocking due to the continued recovery in the institutional building sector. Irrigation increased slightly as strength in the U.S. and Latin America offset weak market conditions in Europe. Residential was down 2% globally from weakness in Europe and roughly flat performance in the U.S. Operating margin expanded 10 basis points from 14.7% to 14.8% year-over-year excluding FX translation headwinds. Margin improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and volume leverage. These factors were partially offset by negative sales mix, inflation costs and the unfavorable impact of the valves divestiture. Now let’s turn to slide nine, where I will cover the company’s financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $600 million at the end of Q2. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 25%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit faculties remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested $20 million into capital expenditures, and we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends. We have approximately $60 million of additional potential repurchases under our authorized share repurchase program. Free cash flow was $64 million during Q2, which marks an improvement of $11 million from the prior year and primarily reflects improved working capital performance. With that said, please turn to slide 10, and I’ll cover our 2015 guidance. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 2%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue growth of 1% to 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2%, reflecting margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. At the bottom-line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.82 to $1.87, excluding restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million. As Patrick noted earlier, we have narrowed our full-year outlook to reflect a slightly lower organic growth and unfavorable mix partially offset by an increase in productivity and cost savings. Additionally, we have also updated the projected impact from foreign exchange translation. As noted on the slide, we expect EPS growth of 4% to 7%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. As mentioned earlier, we are driving to 100% free cash flow conversion of net income, and this takes into consideration expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We expect return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvements in 2015. Our operating tax rate is still expected to be 21%, approximately 1% higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be 183 million. Turning to slide 11, we have provided for you a summary of our first half performance by end market along with our current full-year outlook which, as you can see, has been adjusted to reflect current end market conditions and anticipated trends. In summary, Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue, is expected to be flat year-over-year versus our previous expectation of low single digit growth. Our current full year outlook reflects our first half performance and lower general industrial growth assumption over the second half of the year. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue is anticipated to grow at low single-digit to mid-single-digit rate. Here we have increased our outlook, to reflect our first half performance, solid backlog in our water waste water transport pump division, and encouraging signs of improving market conditions in the U.S. For the Commercial market, our full year outlook remains unchanged. With growth expected to be in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and we continue to anticipate strength in the emerging markets. We do expect growth to moderate over the balance of the year, given the restocking activity we saw over the last nine months. Conditions in Europe remains soft, but we continue to expect that new products will drive growth over the second half. We now project the residential end market to be flat, reflecting our first half performance and expected stable U.S. market conditions. Previously, we had anticipated a low single-digit decline. Finally, our smallest sector, Agriculture, will likely be down low single-digits for the year. Strength in the western U.S. region driven primarily by continuing drought conditions is expected to be more than offset by unfavorable flooding impacts in Texas and other parts of Central U.S. It is also important to note that we face very difficult year-over-year comparisons in this market segment as well as weak European market conditions. Turning to slide 12. Given the continued focus on foreign exchange and expected incremental headwinds, we thought it would be appropriate to revisit the information we covered last quarter. So first, let’s begin by discussing Xylem’s foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure and as such we have a place – we had in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our seventh largest currency pair exposures. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis. Furthermore, we hedged the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet, and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments. Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected in our underlying operational performance. Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will continue to isolate the impact, so you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives. The table illustrates the top-five currency exposure for Xylem. It provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the rate assumed in our previous guidance as well as the average rate during the first-half. Perhaps most importantly, because FX rates have continued to significantly fluctuate. We have also included the rates we assumed in our guidance update. Similar to last quarter, the table includes the full year expected impacts on revenue and operating income. To summarize, based on the rate assumptions used for our guidance update, full year revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $300 million, and operating income by approximately $54 million, which will result in $0.23 of EPS headwind. As you can from this the slide, we already saw revenue negatively impacted by $162 million and operating income by $25 million over the first half. And we expect second half results to be negatively impacted by $138 million on the top line and $29 million for operating income. As Patrick highlighted earlier, we are reflecting the recent strengthening of the euro in our forecast. This benefit is reflected in both our second quarter performance and the outlook for the balance of the year. We will continue to provide quarterly updates with full transparency. Turning to slide 13, I’ll provide some color with regards to our expectations for the second half. I’d like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2015. I’ll begin with some comments around our shippable backlog. Of the total $812 million in backlog, $573 million of shippable in the second half of the year, and the remaining $229 million as expected to ship in 2016 or thereafter. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $405 million and that represents approximately 45% of our expected third quarter revenue, and its consistent with what we had last year. So we still have a lot of book and term business to secure and deliver in the quarter. As per revenue growth, we expect second half organic revenue to be approximately 1% to 2%. We see the second half profile similar to years past, down sequentially in the third quarter with a ramp up in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we expect revenue to decline in Q3 approximately 3% sequentially from the second quarter reflecting the impact of European seasonality in July and August. On a year-over-year basis, we expect third quarter organic growth of approximately 1% to be more than offset by foreign exchange impact of approximately $80 million. We expect sequential operating income performance in the second half to be driven by volume and incremental cost improvements in areas such as global souring, lien, and strategic cost management. Second half sequential incremental margin is expected to be approximately 56%, lower than last year’s sequential performance primarily reflecting unfavorable mix. As for the third quarter, we anticipate margin declines of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year including FX translation. By segment, we expect the sequential margin improvement to be more pronounced in Water Infrastructure than in Applied Water. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million. With that said, please turn to slide 14, and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Shashank. As we move past the midpoint of the year, I’m pleased with the progress the team has made, particularly in terms of their continued focused execution. While we are weathering some near term market challenges, several areas of the business have delivered solid growth. Importantly, we continue to advance our strategic agenda. And I look forward to updating you in more detail on that agenda at our upcoming Investor Day. As a reminder, it will take place on Thursday, September 24, in New York City. At that time, we plan to outline our long-term growth strategy, which will include organic and inorganic growth plans, our continuous improvement agenda, as well as our capital deployment framework to drive shareholder value. It will also be an opportunity for you to engage directly with my leadership team. We will share more details on the agenda in last August. And, now operator, we can begin the Q&A session.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Deane.
Shashank Patel: Good morning.
Deane Dray: I was hoping, we could start on the comments on muni, and it’s been a while since there has been some positive comments about growth and rebounds and so, take us through first geographically, the European municipal buyers versus the U.S. and address where the pickup is coming? Is it from break in fix MRO or are there any projects getting released?
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Deane, yeah. So, let me give some overall commentary here. I would say, it’s a combination of both in terms of break in fix as well as some project activity there, that we see rebounding. When you take a look at what we’ve seen thus far, we’ve looked at about 2% growth in muni in the second quarter, about 2% to the first half of the year. We are seeing an acceleration in that area. We expect the second half of the year to be up mid-single-digits. And so we are seeing some acceleration there. It’s being driven primarily by both treatment and transport predominantly in the U.S., but I would say also as well as Europe, but Europe to a lesser extent than the U.S.
Deane Dray: Are you actually seeing projects getting released?
Patrick Decker: It’s a combination, but yes, we are seeing – we are seeing projects are getting released, again, it’s still a bit slow, but we also have seen an increase in the quoting activity as well as in our win rate on that quotes.
Shashank Patel: And Deane, this is Shashank, and just add to the on the pump side from our transport division in the second quarter, we’re up 6%, for the half, we’re up 4% and that’s where we see strength in the second-half of the year as well.
Deane Dray: Understood. And this is the second question to, maybe you can expand on the expectations regarding pricing, it doesn’t sound like it’s a big headwind, but directionally it looks like it’s gotten a little bit tougher for you. And maybe if you can parse out what the pricing environment is like on OVE versus your aftermarket business?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Good question, Deane. So, I would say first of all, you know through the first-half of the year and continuing through the second quarter and we expect this continue through the rest of the year. Pricing has is pretty been neutral. We had previously expected it be up about 30 basis points, 40 basis points, and right now, we’re seeing that being neutral across the businesses, but an aggregated number. When you take a look at the individual pieces of the portfolio. I would say we are beginning to see the supply demand mix work in our favor over time on the muni side of the equation. We haven’t seen that fully come to realization yet, but we expect that to be the case more in 2016 and beyond. As we see increase in demand, where we’ve seen the most pressure from a pricing standpoint has been predominantly in Applied Water and that’s in the well pump business, there where again it’s a soft market, tough competition. And so, we are taking a very disciplined strategic approach in that area. Obviously, we’re also working to put that pressure back on our suppliers by being more aggressive on the sourcing side. So we can mitigate any of that that pricing pressure that we’re seeing.
Deane Dray: Thanks. And just, hopefully he’s listening, I wanted to wish Mike Speetzen the best and we’ll really miss him.
Patrick Decker: Absolutely. I’m sure he is listening.
Mike Speetzen: Thanks, Deane.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: If we could just start on the commercial side there. You had first half plus 8%, you’re looking at low-to-mid singles for the full year, which would kind of imply pretty wide range of down low-singles to up mid-singles in the second half. I know you’ve talked a little bit about distributor stocking in the first half and destocking in the second half. If you could just give us a little bit more color around the slowdown in the commercial in the second half, and how much of that is destocking versus end market slowdown?
Patrick Decker: Yeah. This is gigantic that one. We actually saw a growth in the first half of 7% and there was – just give you destocking in the first half, primarily in the U.S. as well as we have strength in China. China was up in the high-teens. And what we expect in the second half, specifically in the U.S. a little bit of destocking going on as well as slower growth in China in the second half, driving to our – we’re calling it low-single digit growth in the second half versus the plus 7% we saw in the first half. I will say that we are quite encouraged by what we see happening in the commercial building sector. As you know, we’re heavily weighted towards the institutional side of that market. And we are seeing a continued recovery in that space.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Then on the overall margin guidance for the company, it’s gone from 13.2% midpoint to a 13.1% midpoint. You said you had expected 30 basis points to 40 basis points in price that’s now neutral. Is a couple of million dollars lower expectation of restructuring savings? Can you talk about where the offset on the positive side is coming from to those two negative things?
Shashank Patel: Sure, yeah. So, couple of areas. First of all, we have really been driving the global source and global procurement and productivity effort here quite aggressively, and we’ve seen – we’ve seen an uptick in that progress, so that’s certainly helping us out here. Obviously, we also saw some uptick as we talked about in the area of commercial and public utilities, and those tend to be good margin businesses for us and so that’s help mitigate. The biggest single driver, of our margin outlook for the balance of the year, really is driven by industrial being weaker than expected, and that’s just given the very high margin nature of our dewatering rental business. And so, that’s really what’s driving predominately that downtick. But we’re trying to more than offset that as much as possible through other productivity efforts. And just another note on that is. Realizing that we were in competitive markets as well as tough markets industrially as well as dewatering mix impact. We have taken a more – we always take good approach in cost management but we’ve also focused more on the cost management side, to help with all the other productivity that we work on.
Nathan Jones: All, right. Thanks very much guys.
Shashank Patel: Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Nathan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.
Ryan Connors: Great, thank you. Yeah, I wanted to talk a little bit, hello. Wanted to talk a little bit about the Europe side. You noted stronger growth in I guess, industrial applications in the slide deck in Europe. I assume that some of the new products on the HVAC side that might be driving that, but if you could just expand on the drivers behind that strength in European industrial?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, actually on the HVAC side, we did have significant product launches last year, as well as this year. So, we’ve seen some of the benefit of that for in the first-half of the year, and we expect to see the some additional products that will be launched in the Q3 time period of this year. So we expect to see continued strength from them – primarily driven by product launches.
Phil De Sousa: And Ryan, this is Phil. Just we also saw an uptick in the quarter, particularly from our wastewater pump division, and Patrick’s comments earlier I think with regard to the public utility market, and we did actually see strength there as well. But the industrial wastewater pump market also was up quite significantly in the second quarter.
Q – RyanConnors: Okay. And then that, I mean, that, will that pipeline of new products continue to be refilled as we move into the balance of 2015 and into 2016, or will we kind of start to anniversary some of those and hit some tougher compares?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, so good question, Ryan. First of all, we definitely will continue to see an uptick in the amount of new product launches. Obviously, we need to manage that in terms of, we don’t want to overload our sales teams with too many new products, but there is quite a bit in the hopper right now that we’re quite excited about. And we’ll be walking you guys through at Investor Day. Some of those exciting launches, and some of the key focus areas that we’re targeting, but the short answer is, yes, we will continue to see new products be a very integral part and critical part to our growth strategy. And when you look at our vitality index, it’s up to 18%. So this is something we’ve been working on for the last two years or three years, and it – continues to tick upwards. So that continues to be in focus, and our goal is to continue growing that, so the pipeline will continue.
Ryan Connors: Okay. And then, this is kind of a tough one to answer, I realize, and I know we’re e going to hear more about this at the Analyst Day. But if you could just kind of qualitatively discuss for us, Patrick, your initial thoughts on kind of 2016 top-line, I mean, there is so many moving parts we have, I guess, the 4x headwind will annualize and kind of go away on a translation basis and we’ve got the different end markets. And what’s your kind of your thought process about how 2016 will shape up relative to the company’s longer term top line growth goals?
Patrick Decker: Sure. So, yeah, as you said – obviously we’ll give more color at Investor Day and it’s a little early for us to predict given somewhat of the short cycle nature of the business here, but let me speak at a top level. I’m very encouraged by what we’re seeing particularly on the public utilities and the commercial side of the equation. And the fact that you’re looking at a sizeable increase in our backlog and shippable in 2016 and beyond. Again, we’ve seen more than a 50% growth in that in a total company wide basis. So that’s quite encouraging. I would say, so looking at from that perspective that all net-net is positive and probably positive up versus what I’d have been thinking previously. Having said that, the one big unknown that we’ve got obviously is how long this oil and gas weakness is going to continue and given the impact that has on our dewatering business, which is such a high margin business for us. So that’s really in my view the biggest wildcard right now, but everything else in net-net, I’m feeling more encouraged.
Ryan Connors: Okay. So I guess if we look at the long-term growth goals of the companies, turnout there in the past, would it be safe to say 2016 has given us some puts and takes, but it’s more or less kind of a normal year, right. It means, you’ve got some nice drivers and a few offsets.
Patrick Decker: That’s correct.
Ryan Connors: Okay. Well, great thanks for your time this morning.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Phil De Sousa: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose: Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.
Patrick Decker: Sure, good morning.
Phil De Sousa: Good morning.
David Rose: Just a couple of quick ones. One, following up on the procurement initiatives, I mean can you quantify how much of the spend as a percentage of total spend is left to target and what you’re expectations are in terms of the dollar amount of savings left and maybe the big buckets if you could?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, I’ll start surely giving specific numbers here today and we certainly will be in a position to kind of layout what that overall target opportunity is and certainly at investor day, this is a multi-year journey that we’re on and we have obviously being going after the biggest spin categories and the most obvious spin categories things like castings for example and so I would say most of our progress thus far has been in those direct spin categories. There is still plenty of room for us to move there and certainly as we see growth in volume as we look into the out years just that increased level of volume and spend will continue to refresh and give us an opportunity to drive become savings there. Obviously indirect spend in some of the other categories of spending are areas that are still very rich and fertile for us to go after. But again, we’ll talk more about that in detail at investor day.
David Rose: Can you just maybe bracket a ballpark about how much spend was left to go after?
Patrick Decker: I would say that on the direct spend which we’ve been working on for many years we’ve captured most of that. On the indirect spend category where we had a big effort starting about 12 months to 18 months ago, there I think is where the biggest opportunity is, as far as the percentage, I’m not exactly sure but I think we have probably targeted at least 50%, 75% of the indirect spend categories. So there’s still, as Patrick said, there’s still more opportunity for that. Yeah, this is a multi-year journey and effort. So the buckets evolved, the level of spinning evolves and so, I’ll stop short of talking about a specific number or a percentage right now, but again we can get into that more depth on Investor Day.
David Rose: Okay. I appreciate and I certainly understand. And maybe if I could one more, kind of on a big picture item is the cash flow is great for the quarter. You seem a little timid on the share buyback and maybe you can articulate for us what you’re thinking about that?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah. So, share repo, it continues to be one of the elements of our capital deployment framework. It will continue to be an important element of our capital deployment framework. Obviously, beyond offsetting dilutive impacts from equity grants, we do view repurchases as an opportunistic lever to return capital back to shareholders. Again, we’re going to update you in terms of what our outlook and what our plans are for that Analyst Day as well, but you can rest assure it will continue to be an important element of our framework.
David Rose: Okay, great. Thank you and I look forward to hearing more from you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Giordano of Cowen & Company.
Tristan Margot: Hey, guys. This is Tristan Margot for Joe today.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Tristan Margot: Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here, most of my questions have been answered, but could you give us a breakdown of the organic order growth that you have by region and by end markets?
Phil De Sousa: Hi, Tristan. This is Phil. That information we don’t typically provide, but if we get a sense, just as a reminder, the Applied Water division is very much so a book and ship business and so you can pretty much approximate the same to a geographic profile – application profile as the revenue organic profile – organic growth that we highlighted earlier today. As far as the organic order growth for Water Infrastructure, perhaps I’ll just leave you with a thought process so that we are seeing an uptick in orders on the treatment side, both the U.S., Europe, and we continue to see – if you had continued healthy growth on the emerging market side.
David Rose: All right, great, thank you. And then, just a quick one on oil and gas, I know, you’ve highlighted, I think 40% decline in the second half.
Phil De Sousa: Yeah.
David Rose: What are you seeing currently in oil and gas? Is it how we flatten out here or, or what are your expectation or what do you see right now?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so, the 40% decline that we talked about previously is in still line with our latest outlook and expectations as we talked about in our prepared comments. What you’re saying here in terms of us talking about further weakness there is really more of a broader industrial knock-on effect and the impact that has on some of our distribution partners. So our outlook remains unchanged, again 40% down year-over-year. In terms of whether that’s the bottom, I mean, it’s certainly we hope it’s still bottom, it feels like it’s the bottom. But I [indiscernible] anyone to make that projection just yet. So that’s why we’re taking a cautious approach here.
David Rose: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking the questions guys.
Patrick Decker: Sure, thank you.
Phil De Sousa: Thanks, Rose.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.
Scott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.
Patrick Decker: Good morning
Phil De Sousa: Good morning.
Scott Davis: I wanted to get some clarity on where you’re spending capital, where you think there is, where do you think there is growth in and what kind of projects and things you’re spending money on, whether it be adding capacity versus productivity and things like that?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so from an overall capital perspective, I would say – and I’ll talk about this both in terms of true CapEx versus where we’re directing maybe our ongoing expense focuses well. Certainly we see the opportunity we’re executing on that in terms of investing more in a few of our critical emerging markets. And so again building some extra capacity in China to support the growth in demand there as well as certainly in the Middle East. We’ve approved an expansion there that I’d talked about it a little bit briefly in the last earnings call and that will be localizing our assembly in test capabilities and adding some additional feet on the street. We’ve been investing as a priority more in R&D to again drive our new product development pipeline, and again we’re quite encouraged by some of the opportunities there. And then I would say third, probably not big news if you are on the phone, simplifying our IT environment and reducing the number of systems that we’ve got and investing more in the IT implementations to support the frontend of the business is the third area, I would say a priority from a capital perspective.
Scott Davis: It sounds good. Fair answer. And then I don’t know how you can comment on this, but I’m curious to hear your thoughts at least on pain there and trying on it at least the concept of consolidating the industry. I mean how easy to approach from these angles, since you could probably tell me [indiscernible] your comment, but – I mean how easy is it to consolidate this industry? And how – how much consolidation do we need to see? I mean when I think about flow in general, it is one of the most fragmented of the sectors that we. Industrial analysts are covering, there’s probably 25 players out there. I mean we’ve got number of verticals that are consolidated down to a four or five major global players. I mean what do you – how do you think about this industry and how it stacks up in the next several years, and what kind of consolidation we might see and how easy this to consolidators, and just...?
Patrick Decker: Sure.
Scott Davis: It does look easy from the outside, but when you really dig in, it’s – their channel conflicts and all of kinds of other issues that have to navigate that makes a less interesting?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Well, I may be pleased to hear this, because I won’t say, no comment. But obviously, as a general practice, we don’t comment on speculation or on others kind of move. But obviously being a flow control veteran and bound to space for a number of years, I think it is easier [indiscernible] . Having said that, it’s till fragmented and there are opportunities to consolidate in the space. There is more complexity behind that that meets the eye for many of the reasons that you pointed out. And so in terms of predicting what will happen, what could happen, I wouldn’t go further than that to speculate. Again, we remained focused on our strategy, and executing what we’re going to do. Obviously, deployment of capital towards M&A is going to be a very meaningful part of that. We’ll be sharing a bit more about that in terms of areas that are particularly interesting to us at Investor Day, and that will be a richer dialog at that point, Scott.
Scott Davis: Okay. And then just last question. I mean when times are tough like this, we normally see market share shifts go back to the best players or the strongest players. Most of all, capitalized has been most cost supplier, producers in the scale, and [indiscernible]. It’s difficult for us to get external validation, but do you feel like you’re gaining share, there’s a feel like you are outperforming your pump industries?
Patrick Decker: I am always cognizant Scott not to get too far ahead of my [indiscernible] , in terms of talking about share, but the bottom-line is, I’m very pleased by what I’ve seen through the first half of the year. When you take a look at our growth rates in our key end markets relative to what the underlying end market growth is, I think you see that most prominently, and again our pump business, you also see that I think to a meaningful extent in a number of our business, including treatment. But it’s – it’s too early to kind of declare that. It’s still a tough market. We’re – we’re using all the levers that we have at our disposal. But it does feel quite encouraging on behalf of the team right now. But again, we still got a lot of work to do to make this sustainable.
Scott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. Good luck, guys. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Okay, thank you.
Phil De Sousa: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity.
Chip Moore:
Patrick Decker: Good morning. Thanks.
Phil De Sousa: Good morning, Chip.
Chip Moore: Just wanted to follow-up on the rental biz a bit. Do you think headwinds bottom out here in the second half as some of those idle assets get redeployed or where do you think we stand in that process, maybe if you have some historical context?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so we’ve – the team – I’ve been very pleased with what the team has done in proactively addressing this and we do expect to see benefits of the redeployment of a large number of our pumps to put them out for rent in some of the international markets. And so I think we are looking at this as a silver lining on the situation, because it does help us accelerate building out that international business. That takes time to get the pumps there to get them in place and ready to rent, and then obviously you’ve got to create demand. But we’re quite encouraged and optimistic about the opportunities there. That certainly will help us as we go into 2016 as well. Certainly, in terms of – do we think it’s the bottom, do we think it gets better from here. As I mentioned earlier, that’s hard to predict. I mean it feels like it. I think the team is optimistic that it is the bottom at this point in time. What I feel good though about is the again -the approach the team’s taken. And I do think that will help buffer relative to some of the other players in the marketplace.
Phil De Sousa: And this is Phil. I just add. It’s not that we want to exclude obviously portions of the business from our results because it’s now already behind the diversified portfolio. But if you did take aside the oil and gas related say, deep water and rental branches out of the equation. We’re seeing very solid growth, in all the other branches, and I think that plays into the diversified application expertise of our Godwin business here in the U.S. and more broadly speaking across the globe.
Chip Moore: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, folks.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: So our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg: Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning, Brian.
Phil De Sousa: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Konigsberg: Hey, guys. Hey, couple of quick questions. On the – just the adjusted guide for the year, the productivity number of $0.07 just seems like, it’s decently large. I know you guys put in place, spending curtailments late in 2013 as well, which seem to yield pretty good benefit. Has the belted loosened over the course of 2014, and now you’re bringing that back down, are you finding more opportunities? And maybe a little bit more color on that bucket would be great?
Patrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, I would say, the bell is absolutely not loosen. I think, the – it is an issue of just continuing to apply good disciplined cost management and in constrain, as well as identifying further opportunities for cost reduction efforts. As well as we talked about, just the acceleration in our global procurement capabilities as well. As you’ve heard us probably say before I do think that the large majority of the opportunities that had been done thus far have been happening within the individual business units themselves. And to some extent, the function, the opportunity going forward here as we talk about the opportunity to simplify the company further, is really looking at things horizontally, from a company perspective, and as opposed to just within the unit themselves. Those are harder to get out, but that’s say a big part of the, what I’d call the self-help story in terms of margin expansion. The other point I note is from a productivity standpoint. Historically, the second half is stronger than the first half. And that’s just leveraging the incremental volume, we have that helps productivity as well as the whole fixed overhead cost issue. So if you look at even 2014 second half to first half, we had an improvement of almost $0.06 in productivity. So $0.07 is kind of in line with that with the additional actions, we’ve taken and the global procurement effort, we are accelerating this year.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay. But just to be clear that $0.07 when you build up from previous guidance to the new guidance that $0.07 incremental versus what you’ve planned as of say to the first quarter, is that correct? And is that mostly coming from procurement or is it mostly coming from discretionary spend that you’re able to cut back on?
Patrick Decker: It’s primarily coming from procurement.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay.
Patrick Decker: And Brian, one element just to highlight, we’ve got some of that benefit already here in Q2. And so as you kind of think as we are trying to offset some of these unfavorable mix and we’re certainly ramping up the GSS activities, given the deflationary environment. We want to go back and certainly first half, with some of our suppliers, expecting of course that they will take some time to get a little bit of acceleration. So you should see more of that benefit come in to the fourth quarter.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay. Got it. Yeah. And maybe you just touched on inflation and deflation. I mean, do you anticipate you’re going to start to see some deflationary benefits in the second half of the year just from commodity prices coming down? I know you’re pushing down [indiscernible] itself, but just kind of raw materials, you’re purchasing. Does that become additive to you versus the previous guidance? And is it baked into the numbers?
Patrick Decker: It’s baked into the numbers. And you’re right that will help in the second half.
Brian Konigsberg: That will be in the second half. Okay.
Patrick Decker: Yes.
Brian Konigsberg: If I could just sneak one more in. Just on the oil and gas part, so there’s been a lot of discussion about U.S. drillers kind of approaching, I guess the market with refracing, rather than just natural fracing. Does – is that present the same type of opportunity for your transport dewatering business, as it would for I guess a normal state of drilling?
Patrick Decker: It would be – we would largely be indifferent to that. So it would still be the same level of activity to be managed.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of Davidson.
Brent Thielman: Thanks. Just one more question. On the dewatering business, you have some headwinds in areas like mining and oil and gas. Can you remind me, how much these sort of commodity sectors represent as a portion of business?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, so oil and gas is about, again oil and gas mining, that whole commodity play is about 15% of our dewatering revenue.
Brent Thielman: Okay.
Phil De Sousa: And Brent, this is Phil. I just want, it’s 15%, [ph] how much worth, its 15% each.
Brent Thielman: Between mining and oil and gas?
Phil De Sousa: Correct. So the total combined make-up approximately call it 30% to 35% of the dewatering profile.
Brent Thielman: Great. Thank you.
Phil De Sousa: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna.
Robert Barry: Hey guys. Good margining. Thanks for taking my question.
Phil De Sousa: Good morning.
Patrick Decker: Good morning.
Robert Barry: I was wondering if you could unpack the industrial outlook a little bit, I guess especially on the Applied side. It sounds like it’s more than just oil and gas and mining getting worse. And I know you have very broad exposure within what you call industrial in Applied?
Patrick Decker: Yeah, I would say that, you’re right. Its primary oil and gas and mining, but then there is a whole bunch of other segments that get impacted by industrial, it’s the all other industrial category. And there, obviously, we just like the rest of the business in Applied Water, we were soft in the first half. In the second half, we actually have some projects that are shipping in the second half. So when you look at the second half versus the first half, first half was negative 1. Second half is projecting low single-digits. It’s held by the backlog that’s in there rather than improving market conditions in industrial.
Robert Barry: So whenever you see – the outlook is lower because industrial is weaker, and it sounds like you kept the oil and gas decline the same, and all the nine oil and gas and mining stuff actually looks better in the back half. So, is this incremental weakness kind of absorbed already or are things actually worse out?
Patrick Decker: No, sorry. It’s absorbed. I mean it’s absorbed in the revised guidance now that we’re giving you. And the way that you’ve read it is absolutely right. What we saw deteriorating further was in the oil and gas mining piece, again predominantly in dewatering. We did see some weakness through the first half in Applied Water on that broader industrial piece, but to Shashank’s comment, when you take a look at the second half of the year based on very specific projects and backlog and demand mainly in the Applied Water business, we expect a more positive outlook for the second half. When you bring all that together, it still ends up being flattish.
Robert Barry: Got you, got you. And then maybe just a quickly, I wanted to clarify on the restructuring, and if you said this already, just tell me and I’ll read the transcript, but it looks like the carryover savings are lower now from 2014, I think 2015 versus it was $18 million. Did you talk about why that’s lower?
Patrick Decker: Robert, that’s right. So I think the key point to bear in mind here, and perhaps, we could probably made this a little bit clear in our prepared remarks or in original Q&A. But the expected carryover savings this year is a bit lower, but you should expect the balance that $2 million, to $3 million that has essentially been reduced here. We’ll see that early part of next year, it’s more of a timing shift if you would in terms of when we’ll actually realize some of those year-over-year savings. We have one specific project that’s included in and it’s been delayed but it’s still on the docket, and will be executed by early 2016.
Robert Barry: I see. Okay, thank you.
Patrick Decker: Thanks, Robert.
Phil De Sousa: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing comments.
Patrick Decker: Sure. Well, thank you. Thanks, everybody again for joining us this morning, I appreciate your continued interest. We look forward to seeing you all at our Investor Day again September 24 in New York City. Between now and then, safe travels to all, have a good summer and we look forward to seeing you then. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s Xylem’s second quarter, 2015 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual results and events could differ materially from those anticipated. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Phil, and, thank you, all, for joining us. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to acknowledge the earthquake in Nepal that occurred last weekend and the events that continue to unfold in the aftermath. The resulting devastation and suffering are profound and we, along with so many other global citizens, are responding with immediate resources to assist with their most urgent needs. We are also actively working to identify additional means and funds to help in this recovery. That spirit is core to our mission here in Xylem, and we're keeping all those who've been impacted in our thoughts. Now let me turn to our results. We started off the year on a sound footing, generating solid first quarter results. This morning, I'll share some highlights with you. I will also provide a brief update on a few of our key priorities for the year and discuss our 2015 outlook. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to share additional details, and we'll wrap up by addressing any questions you might have at the end. We delivered another quarter of solid operational performance, as our team steadily increased their focus and elevated their execution to deliver a 7th consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While growth rates in the immediate term are not particularly impressive, I am pleased with their execution, particularly as we faced mixed economic conditions, including weak industrial markets. And looking ahead, we see some encouraging signs in certain end markets we serve as well as attractive investment opportunities that will position us well for stronger growth over the longer term. As market conditions and macroeconomic variables fluctuate, we remain focused on the factors we can influence, mainly building stronger customer relationships to fuel sales and build backlog, driving better performance and executing a disciplined capital deployment strategy. This is how we will create more value for our customers and our shareholders. As I discussed previously, we have rolled out our integrated commercial IT platforms in a couple of regions now. We're still in the early stages, but I'm very encouraged by the results I've seen. These tools are enabling our sales teams to increase lead generation across the portfolio, reduce the time required to produce a quote and simplify the administrative burden with a streamlined ERP system. For example, our CRM system, salesforce.com, was implemented across our Americas region and will be rolled out globally over the course of this year and next. This tool facilitates the immediate sharing of contacts and business leads across our commercial teams and growth centers. This is feeding our pipeline of projects, which over time we expect will result in a higher growth rate. A key component of our overall progress is our work in the area of continuous improvement. We are squarely focused on driving a continuous improvement mindset across the enterprise. In other words, broadening the deployment of lean beyond the 4 walls of the factory. Already, we see pockets of success across certain geographies as teams lean out various processes. So we know, there's more that can be achieved, and we have some high priority projects to advance this agenda. One example is an end-to-end supply project -- supply-chain project on one of our largest product lines that should yield a 25% reduction in inventory. And by centralizing our global sourcing activities, we know have visibility to identify meaningful savings on indirect spend, such as contingent labor and freight. These initiatives drive performance, and they generate measurable savings that can also be reinvested for growth. Last month, we announced that Steve Leung had joined Xylem as Senior Vice President and President of Emerging Markets. The emerging markets are particularly important to our growth strategy. They encompass some of the fastest growing areas of our business as development in these regions fuels the building of new infrastructure, which presents us with the opportunity to develop new installed bases of our water technology solutions. Steve is well-positioned to lead our efforts to capture and maximize those growth opportunities. One of his immediate areas of focus is to advance our strategy of further localizing our supply chain and R&D in critical growth markets, beginning with China and Middle East. Steve brings more than 2 decades of management and commercial expertise as well as deep knowledge of the unique needs in these regions. I had the opportunity to work with Steve previously, and I know he will bring new ideas and perspective to the good work that's already underway. I also expect to be able to announce a new Innovation and Technology Officer in the coming weeks. This leader will help us to coordinate and accelerate our R&D efforts, focusing on breakthrough technologies and innovation in services and business models. As I've said before, we intend to invest some of the productivity savings we generate back into growth opportunities, including innovation. Now let me quickly review of our first quarter performance. Orders were flat organically, but they were up 4% in our Water Infrastructure segment. This growth reflects several key project wins with notable progress in our treatment business, which delivered order growth of 13% in the quarter. And while Applied Water orders were down 4%, we did expect a deceleration in this segment following the strong bookings generated during the fourth quarter of last year. One of our big wins in the quarter was a $16 million order for a major municipal project in Canada. The order for flight custom pumps along with accessories and spare parts is part of a multi-year project to upgrade this municipality's drinking water treatment plants and distribution systems. This win reflects both the superior quality of our products and the benefits accrued made strong customer relationship. In addition, our teams will be able to bring forth the applications expertise needed to craft a customized solution that met the unique requirements of this multi-faceted project. This comprehensive approach also helped lay the foundation for potential collaboration on future phases of this endeavor in the years ahead. This order contributed to a 10% year-over-year increase in total backlog in constant currency. Our teams are spending more time in the field, more time with customers understanding their needs, and the result is that we are building a richer pipeline of projects. Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to see some of that work in action on a visit to Southern California. As all of you know, the State of California is now into its fourth year of record drought conditions. The Governor recently issued an executive order that among other things imposed mandatory portable urban water use restrictions and accelerated funding for certain drought mitigation initiative, including the development of water reuse projects. Xylem is very well-positioned to help the state and its many municipal viable water reuse projects. We have the leading technologies, the applications expertise and the proven experience to develop solutions to create a sustainable source of water. In San Diego, I visited the Advanced Water Purification Facility at the North City Water Reclamation Center. This site is the focal strength of the city's demonstration project, which is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of water reuse technology to supplement local drinking water supply, both indirectly and directly. Our technologies are integrated throughout this pilot, and our team has worked closely with the customer on all phases of this venture. This along with other pilots in California is helping to feed our reuse pipeline. That said, even with accelerated state funding, these projects take time to develop to bring them to the point of an actual order. But our teams are working with the right people on the ground to influence and advance these initiatives. Now getting back to our results. Organic revenue grew 1% in the quarter, which was in line with the guidance we provided in February. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year or 60 basis points, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. This margin expansion was driven by productivity gains and cost reductions from our continuous improvement initiatives. It also reflects our disciplined approach to investments. We delivered earnings per share of $0.33, up 9% year-over-year before the impact of foreign exchange translation. Considering the muted top line growth, we're pleased with our team's ability to generate the strong bottom line performance. We also improved free cash flow generation after funding and increasing growth-enabling CapEx investments. And finally, on the capital deployment front, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and opportunistically repurchased $50 million in common stock. In total, we've returned $76 million in capital to our shareholders. As I mentioned previously, we do expect to execute on some bolt-on acquisition opportunities later in the year. Now turning to Slide 4. There's no change to the operational outlook in our guidance. Given the deterioration of the dollar since we last provided guidance and the ongoing volatility in the currency markets, we believe it's prudent to update our 2015 full year guidance only to reflect additional foreign exchange translation headwinds. To recap, consistent with the guidance we provided in February, we anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Similarly, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to grow in the range of 50 to 90 basis points, reflecting a carryover benefit of our broad-based restructuring efforts last year as well as additional efficiencies we expected to drive in 2015. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a $1.80 to a $1.90 for the full year, which includes $0.26 of negative foreign currency translation impact. This is a little more than we previously anticipated. Excluding this headwind, year-over-year EPS growth is still expected to be in the range of 5% to 10%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion. With that, let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenues of $837 million, down $69 million for the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind turned by stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of our valves divestiture in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding those items, organic revenue increased 1%, in line with our expectations and the outlook we provided during our last call. From an end market perspective, commercial led the way, up 9%, with both public utility and residential up 2%. Partial offsetting these gains were declines in the industrial and agricultural markets of 1% and 13% respectively. From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, up 9% and modest growth in the U.S., up 2%. This was partially offset by declines in Canada and Australia, which were each down 12%. Lastly, Western Europe was flat for the quarter. Operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.8%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation, margins increased by 60 basis points, which demonstrates our improved cost base as this is a strong performance given the limited operating leverage on 1% organic growth. Focus and strong execution on continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives reduced costs by $23 million in the quarter and resulted in 270 basis points of margin expansion. Partially offsetting these reductions were inflation of nearly 2%, higher pension expense and the unfavorable impact from the divestiture of our valves business last year. Earnings per share declined by $0.01 to $0.33, however, excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.04, we grow EPS 9%. Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, up 4% organically, including a $16 million project win for transport custom pumps. Book-to-bill was 1.12, our strongest since the first quarter of 2010. As a result, we exit the quarter with total backlog of $585 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Of this amount, 75% is due to ship this year, with the balance of nearly $150 million expected to ship in 2016 and beyond. Revenue of $500 million was flat year-over-year on an organic basis. From an application perspective, we saw 3% growth in treatment while transport was flat and test was down 3% due to a tough compare. Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 10%. The U.S. was also positive, up 1%. Offsetting these gains were declines in Canada, Australia and Western Europe. In summary, strength in emerging markets was driven by our ability to capitalize on the development of water and wastewater infrastructure in these regions. Treatment, for example, increased more than 40% in China, driven by the delivery of ozone and filtration projects. Transport applications also grew, up 9% in emerging markets, and test generated positive momentum but not enough to overcome a comparison to a $3 million project delivery in Brazil last year. The great news is that we expect to deliver on another sizable project to the same key account later this year. The U.S. contributed organic growth of 1%, driven by strength in test applications. Offsetting this favorable performance was lower public utility spend and lapping of prior year projects in Canada and Australia. Furthermore, we saw weakness in Canada, driven by the softening on the oil and gas market. Operating margin increased 10 basis points from 10.5% to 10.6% due to cost reductions and positive price realization. Restructuring savings of $4 million coupled with sourcing and lean initiatives more than offset the negative effects of inflation, pension and foreign exchange transaction (sic) [translation] losses. Foreign exchange translation unfavorably impacted operating income by $6 million but was neutral to margin. Let me now turn to Slide 7. I'll talk through our Applied Water segment. Applied Water recorded orders of $353 million, down 4% organically. We do not believe this is an indication of any significant changes in this segment's end markets but rather due to timing, as Applied Water reported organic order growth of 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, we entered the second quarter with total backlog of $208 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis, more than 60% of which is expected to ship within the quarter. Revenue was $337 million, up 2% organically from the prior period. Building service applications were up 6%, irrigation was down 13%, and industrial water was down slightly of 1% year-over-year. Regionally, we generated growth in emerging markets and the U.S., which were up 7% and 2% respectively. Europe was flat overall for the quarter. To further summarize our revenue performance, I'll highlight growth in building services was driven by strength in U.S. commercial of 9%, where we have seen distributors restocking in advance of what we anticipate could be a recovery in the institution of building sector. Additionally, we continue to see growth in emerging markets regions like the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Residential was up 2% globally as our new energy-efficient ecocirc XL pump drove a 20% increase in Europe. U.S. residential was down 4% as cold weather negatively impacted construction and demand in well pumps. Both irrigation and industrial water applications were down from tough comparisons due to project shipments combined with overall softening market conditions. Operating margin expanded 60 basis points from 13.3% to 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding foreign exchange, margins were up 90 basis points. Margin improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and volume leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower price, the unfavorable impact of last year's valves divestiture and nearly 2% cost inflation. Now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $554 million at the end of Q1. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 27%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested $37 million into capital expenditures and we returned $76 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Q1 return of capital to shareholders included 10% increase in dividends per share and $50 million of share repurchases. This leaves us with approximately $50 million of additional potential repurchases under our authorized programs. Free cash flow was $2 million, which marks an improvement of $5 million from the prior year and is driven by improved working capital performance. That said, please turn to Slide 9, and I'll cover 2015 guidance. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue flat to up 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.7%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13% to 13.4%, reflecting margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.90, excluding restructuring and realignment cost of $20 million. As Patrick noted earlier, we are reducing our full year outlook to reflect the potential for incremental foreign exchange translation headwind. As noted on the slide, we continue to expect EPS growth of 5% to 10%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. As mentioned earlier, we are driving to 100% free cash flow conversion in net income, and this takes into consideration expected capital expenditure outlays in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We expect our return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%, given the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation on operating income and an assumed higher tax rate. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, approximately 1 percentage point higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue, specifically higher growth in the U.S. where we have our highest effective tax rates. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be at 183 million. Turning to Slide 10. We've provided a summary of our first quarter performance by end market along with their current full year outlook, which as you can see remains consistent with our original guidance. In summary, industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to grow at low single digits. Our projection assumes growth in emerging markets but moderately lower than performance last year. And with the exception of oil and gas, we expect growth in the U.S. While oil and gas represents less than 5% of total revenue, it does have a higher profit margin. This end market is expected to decline approximately 40% year-over-year. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is anticipated to grow at a low single-digit rate. Here, we expect continued growth in emerging markets as well as the U.S., where we see encouraging signs in terms of municipal funding strengthening in the second half of the year. We anticipate Europe to be stable. For the commercial market, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and we continue to anticipate strength in the emerging markets. We do expect growth to moderate over the balance of the year, given the restocking activity we saw over the last 2 quarters. We expect Europe to remain soft. Despite the positive start to the year, the residential market remains challenged, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. New product launch in the third quarter of 2014 will provide a boost and partially offset the market headwinds in Europe during the first half of the year. But ultimately, we expect global residential to be flat to down low single digits for the year. Finally, our smallest end market, agriculture, is anticipated to be flat for the year. Turning to Slide 11. Given the continued focus on foreign exchange and expected incremental headwinds, we thought it would be appropriate to revisit the information we covered the last quarter. So first, let's begin by discussing Xylem's foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure and as such, we have in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our 7 largest currency pair exposures. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis. Furthermore, we hedge the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet, and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments. Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected in our underlying operational performance. Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating our financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will continue to isolate the impact so that you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives. The table illustrates our top 5 currency exposures. It provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the rates assumed in our previous guidance as well as the average rate during the first quarter. Perhaps more importantly because foreign exchange rates have continued to significantly fluctuate, we've also included the rates we assumed in our guidance update, taking into consideration the average euro-to-dollar rate in April of $1.07. Similar to last quarter, the table includes the full year expected impacts on revenue and operating income. To summarize, based on the rate assumption used for our guidance update, full year revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $320 million and operating income by $59 million, which will result in $0.26 of EPS headwind. As you can see from the slide, we already saw revenue negatively impacted by $73 million and operating income by $10 million in the first quarter, and we expect second quarter results to be negatively impacted by $100 million on the top line and $18 million for operating income. Turning to Slide 12, I'll further illustrate this impact. As you can see here, we expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% before approximately 8 percentage points of negative foreign exchange translation impact. This is 1 percentage point or $40 million higher than we previously anticipated. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $528 million to $553 million, resulting in margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points, excluding the $59 million negative impact of foreign exchange translation noted on the slide. Again, this includes an incremental headwind of $11 million relative to our prior guidance. Turn to Slide 13. Let me cover our second quarter outlook. As we've done in prior years, I'd like to highlight the seasonal profile of our business, which you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect organic growth of approximately 2%. We anticipate foreign exchange translation headwind of approximately $100 million of revenue. On a sequential basis, total revenue should grow approximately 10%, which will result in a first half-second half profile of 48% and 52% for revenue respectively. Overall, we anticipate operating income to be down year-over-year, primarily due to $18 million of expected foreign-exchange translation headwind. Unfavorable mix and normalized corporate run rate cost will dampen profitability and as a result, we anticipate incremental margins of approximately 25% on a sequential increase in revenue. Lastly, we anticipate that continuous improvement activities and restructuring savings will fund strategic initiatives as well as cover year-over-year inflation. With that, let me turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. As I said, we're off to a solid start to the year. We're excited about the direction Xylem is headed and look forward to sharing more details about our future plans at an Investor Day meeting later this year. For now let me get reiterate that we remain focus on driving stronger operating performance even as we face some uncertainty in the marketplace. I'm pleased with the progress the team has made in that regard and the continued momentum of that work. We do see some positive signs ahead, and we will continue to invest to ensure that we are well-positioned to capture new growth opportunities later this year and into 2016. We remain committed to delivering on our financial commitments and executing a broad-based capital deployment strategy. Our operational outlook remains unchanged, and we're on the right path to realizing the full potential that this company is capable of delivering. So operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Given all the macro anxiety, that's an awfully nice clean quarter from you guys. First question is help me understand the order cadence for the past 2 quarters. So it looked like Applied was up nicely in the fourth quarter, but now I'm looking at flat organic orders starting off the year. And does that in any way challenge you to hit this 1% to 3% organic revenue growth for 2015?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Deane, this is Mike. I think from an Applied Water -- and I'd made a couple of comments in my prepared remarks. We had order growth in the fourth quarter about 9%, and we think that the performance in the first quarter is just indicative that a lot of folks, given some of the promotional programs and things that are under way probably did quite a bit of restocking, ordering back in the fourth quarter. And so as we look at what the projection for the balance of the year is, as it relates to Applied Water, we don't see anything from an end market standpoint that says we're going to see anything play out any different. It looks like the commercial market is in a recovery mode. The Architectural Billing Index, specifically around institutional, has remained above 50 now for some time, and so we think that's driving some of the advanced ordering that we saw in the latter part of last year.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And on the -- your comments on oil and gas. Now I'm not surprised, except for your exposure is less than 5%. But the expectation that, that business is -- could be down 40%, that's much higher than our sensitivity model suggests. And maybe expand on the comment that this as one of your higher-margin businesses.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So Deane, it's -- we have obviously some oil and gas exposure in our Applied Water business, but the predominant exposure really comes out of our dewatering business where we're working on the frac pads for whether it's oil or gas, which is a pretty even blend between the 2. That business was down about 25% in the first quarter, and based on our current projections, we anticipate being down around 40% for the balance of year. We've taken some of that into consideration as we had worked through guidance, but we've obviously made sure that the teams are working the actions that they need to do to try and offset that risk. I think the good news is our dewatering business had such a broad portfolio in terms of exposure to construction, muni bypass disaster recovery that we've got the ability to mobilize and redeploy assets, and that's a lot of what the team is really focused on right now.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just if I can have one last question. Just to clarify, your comments on the increased business in China on the treatment side. You cited ozone and filtration. And is the filtration piece, is that part of your licensing agreement with GE?
Michael T. Speetzen: No. This would not be related to the Zenon membrane. This is around our Leopold gravity filtration business.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. So that's for your core legacy filtration side...
Michael T. Speetzen: Exactly, exactly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connor (sic) [Ryan Connors] with Boenning and Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to -- Patrick, you mentioned this effort, that you'll be announcing a new Chief Innovation Officer. I thought that was an interesting comment. And our understanding was that the product development pipeline had actually begun to regain some momentum and that, that was kind of a positive part of the story. So can you give us a little more color about what drove the decision to sort of more institutionalize that? And what exactly that person's mandate will be? And what the kind of goals are in terms of metrics to drive any kind of material improvement on that front?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. No, I'd be happy to, Ryan. So certainly, I'm very pleased with the progress that each 1 of our 5 growth centers have done over the last few years in revitalizing the pipeline. And you have heard more and more of our new products coming to market. This really is less about a leader coming in and kind of dipping into what each of our business units are doing. There are still some efficiency gains to be achieved there by way of localizing more of our product design and our innovation and technology in some of our fast growth emerging markets, whereas right now that's still large -- a large part of that is happening in the heritage markets in which those brands originated. So certainly driving it towards emerging markets is going to be part of that person's role and responsibility. But this is as much about some of the value mapping work that we've done over the course of the last few months, where we've engaged in a fact-based effort to really map out what the full array of what our -- kind of what our value chain needs are that our customers are managing each day in different end markets, whether that be in the muni market, whether that be in the oil and gas, power, mining, food and beverage. There's a whole list of markets that we have focused in on. And what this person is really going to be doing is working with our marketing teams and others to identify where are some of the white spaces that we want to be driving both organic innovation and technology but also helping inform some of our M&A activity. As you know, M&A is oftentimes a proxy for R&D in an industry where the IP is so fragmented. So those are probably the 2 primary areas that I have the innovation/technology lead focused on.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I guess my related follow-up would be related to your last point there, which is as you look at the M&A environment, I mean, you mentioned that the company will likely become more active there over the balance of the year. What is the core? Obviously, you can't share with us any specifics, but are you more looking at acquisitions that add to your distribution or product portfolio in developed markets? Or is it more of a technology M&A? Is that really the focus?
Patrick K. Decker: I think it will be a combination of the 2. I would say our predominant interest will be in adding new technology and capabilities to the portfolio, but certainly, where there are opportunities for us to strengthen the core, we'll certainly take advantage of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions from me. I wanted to talk about pricing. How would you gauge that in 1Q maybe across the different segments or maybe it's better to talk across geographies? And how you view that going forward? I think there's some concern in the industry in general about how much of revenue declines are price generated and when that -- with decrementals associated with that, things like that.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So we -- for the quarter, pricing was essentially flat for us overall, but it's a tale of old segments. So the reality is in our Water Infrastructure segment, and we talked about this last year, we were undertaking quite a bit of activity to really boost our ability to get price in that segment. And we started to see traction. We started to see that in the fourth quarter. We've seen it again in the first quarter, where we got about 40 basis points. So it's not earth-shattering, but it's good progress. I think the area where we're seeing certainly a lot more pressure, and I don't think we're alone in this in terms of the commentary we've heard from many of our peers and competitors, we had close to 90 basis points where the headwind in the Applied Water segment. That market's very competitive. Given some of the dynamics around the end markets and the weather conditions, we've seen that amplify. I would say that it's remaining at this point disciplined, but it is an area that we're keeping a close eye on and obviously, the teams are very actively working countermeasures. As you think about the full year guidance, we talked about expecting price that would be somewhere less than 50 basis points. There's a chance that could be pressured, but it's early in the year, and we're going to be pushing the teams to do what they can to offset it and quite frankly making sure that we're hitting the right value proposition out there to get the price that we think we're entitled to, given the products that we have.
Patrick K. Decker: I would just add that 2 other areas that I think we're very much focusing on in helping mitigate this is, again, you heard us talk about ramping up our global procurement and sourcing efforts. So taking advantage of this low growth and kind of deflationary environment to put that pressure back on our suppliers. Secondly, this is an area where, again, rolling out new products is very helpful to us in terms of arresting the price declines, if not even driving some level of increase. So all the more reason for us to be bringing new products to market.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, that's fair. On the emerging markets side, that's been up double digits, high singles for quite a bit now. When do we start rolling into comps that become a little bit more challenging to keep that kind of pace?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, we actually had our most difficult comp in the first quarter, where we had 18% growth last year. And as we indicated in our initial guidance and obviously what we've reiterated today, we expect strong growth in the emerging markets, high single digits. We just don't anticipate it being at the level that we recognized last year, where we were up about 13%. So we've kind of lapped the most difficult compare, but obviously, there's dynamics going on in China around the commercial markets and so we think the guidance level that we've put out there is pretty consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter and is driving quite a bit of the growth for the company.
Patrick K. Decker: I would just add that I do want to just remind everyone that we're still very much in the building installed base mode, and so it's heavy project activity. It will be choppy and lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but we do see a steady stream of new products coming.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, that's good to hear. Maybe last from me. On the industrial outlook, minus 1% for the quarter. That includes big declines in oil and gas, and you're still looking for up for the full year. And there's been a wide variance across earnings so far this season, I feel, on industrial segment guidance. So why do feel that your products are kind of more resilient in this environment? And what makes you -- what gives you comfort that you could still see growth despite the 40% decline in oil and gas there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I'd say it's a couple of things. One, within the segment that shown about [ph] oil and gas dewatering, as I mentioned earlier, even though we are facing significant headwind from that particular vertical, that business serves a variety of other end markets that we do see continued strength in. So I think from a dewatering standpoint, we certainly have the diversity of the portfolio. From a more broad-based industrial perspective, I would say the geographic and ultimate end market breadth that we have. So if you remember some of the charts we've displayed in the past, our industrial segment is very diverse in terms of general industrial, food and beverage, construction, et cetera. And so we think by that diversity, that's given us a little bit of insulation relative to the low single-digit growth rate that we're expecting for the year.
Patrick K. Decker: And this is also where we, I think, are very well-positioned from an emerging market standpoint, especially with the install build in the Middle East and China. And so while we're doubling down our efforts in those areas, I certainly don't want to diminish the great work the teams have already done historically to build our base there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I had a couple of questions on the margin profile, both, you know, from kind of above the unit level. So first of all, the R&D reduction that you had year-over-year, is that something that you see as structural what you've done to improve the productivity and return on investment in R&D? Or was this more discretionary?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. I'll take that one. I would say it's largely timing of spend within the quarter. It certainly is not a trend line that we're focusing to continue. If anything, over time, we'll be marginally increasing the amount of investment we spend in R&D. There is also the opportunity we've been driving here to be more efficient and effective in our R&D spend. So as we again further move to localize more and more of our R&D investment in some of the emerging markets, that's a more efficient spend that we're going to get because that will be able to support not only those local markets but also some of our global activity. So it will be a mixed bag going forward, but I wouldn't read anything into the modest decline in the quarter.
Michael T. Speetzen: And, David, there is also some foreign exchange translation tied up in this. If you remember, we have overweight in terms of our engineering that's outside of the U.S., in areas like Stockholm, where we're benefiting from a translation standpoint. Even if we pull that out, we are down, so the comments that Patrick highlighted absolutely apply, but it's being amplified by foreign exchange rate now.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So in Q2, that will be set back to a normalized level?
Patrick K. Decker: That has declined, yes.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, lastly, within the margin contacts, on the Water Infrastructure side, you seem to make some pretty good progress despite the FX headwinds and some of the sluggish commentary you made about the overall market. Where did you see most of the traction front end or within the 4 walls? Maybe you can provide just a little bit more perspective on that?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I think, David...
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry -- and then lastly and within that context, if you can also give us some color on how the pipeline looks within the backlog going forward.
Michael T. Speetzen: Sure. I think from a margin standpoint, certainly the continued effort and focus that we have across the business on making sure that we're driving the lean and the global sourcing productivity. And I would say for Water Infrastructure, you don't see all of the margin leverage come through because as we indicated, as we're growing in emerging markets, which for that segment, we're up 10%, while there are attractive margins, they're obviously at a lower rate because it's primarily OEM business versus having the after-market content. We are getting that volume leverage off of the growth within the platform and so that's obviously aiding to the margin profile.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: So then the backlog...
Michael T. Speetzen: And then -- yes, so the backlog for Water Infrastructure, so orders were up 4%. The backlogs, it one of the strongest levels we've had. As I indicated in some of my remarks, when you look at our shipments for 2016 and beyond, we are up over 50% and so we're continuing to see the strength. Our treatment business was up about 13% from an order standpoint and that was pretty evenly spread across the globe. So at this point, we're not calling a full-on municipal recovery, but we are certainly seeing a continued growth and order strength for that business, not only in treatment, but also in our large transport business.
Patrick K. Decker: I think we've also been pleased. We've seen our win rate improve in the treatment business as well, which is a leading indicator for the rest of the business. It's gone now from 40%, up to 45%, driven by a number of factors, but it's pretty encouraging sign for us.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess really what I was getting at was that the margin profile, that backlog as you start to sell. Continue in emerging markets, as you pointed out, is there margin pressure there or do you see some margin improvement because of the product mix that's changing?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So we actually took a snapshot of that and continued to look at it. And it supports the gross margin level that we have that's just shy of 40%. Because at the same time that we are obviously winning in the emerging markets with margin that may be a little bit lower than the average, we also have some of our higher-margin business coming through in that backlog as well. So overall, the blend is in supportive of the outlook we have for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: As you get ready to roll out the new sales tools globally here, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen so far in the U.S.? And then when you couple that with some of the newer energy efficiency products, et cetera, how are you thinking about potential share gains?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. I'll take the first part of that and maybe let Mike comment on the second piece. I mean, we're very pleased with what we've seen in terms of the collaboration that our new sales tools drive. I think the benefits are in a few areas. One is it does make it easier for our commercial teams to get visibility as to sharing leads across the portfolio. As you've known for a while, we -- oftentimes, our businesses have served the same customers, but we haven't always glanced at those customers in a coordinated fashion. So the salesforce.com tool is certainly helping in that regard. I think it's also getting us more visibility to projects that are out there. So the combination of better visibility and improving our win rate is obviously a powerful combination. I think ultimately, over time, this is also about simplifying the lives of our sales teams and taking a lot of the administrative burden off of them. We are in the very, very early innings of that. So that's all opportunity in front of us to allow them to be able to spend even more time out in the field in front of customers. In terms of again rolling out new products, our vitality index is roughly around 20%. And that dipped down a little bit in the first quarter just by way of mix, but we do feel good about a number of the new products that we have that we've already rolled out and some others that we're going to be announcing here over the coming few months. And if you might add, Mike, on the...
Michael T. Speetzen: Chip, I assume your question was in relation to the deployment of salesforce.com in terms of the shipping?
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: That's right..
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I think, when we look at things like the ecocirc that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we obviously are taking share in the European markets. And as we look at having a tool that enables, as Patrick said, our sales force to be able to communicate opportunities and execute on those, we think that, coupled with the energy-efficient proposition that we have in our products or that we're developing for our products, and given the climate we're dealing with with our customers in terms of trying to reduce costs, we think that's going to give us a very strong platform. As we've talked in the past, being able to outperform the market by 1 point or 2, that's going to be a key part of that equation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: You've had a few quarters now of strength in the commercial nonresidential product area and seems to be some momentum in that market. Is this a group that can be as meaningful as 20% or more of your sales mix, if the market gives you enough tailwind all else kind of generally equal in the other applications?
Michael T. Speetzen: I don't think so. I mean, it's 13% of our revenue today. And when I think about the growth potential that we have, say, in industrial and even public utility growing at a moderate rate, it's going to be tough for it to surpass that. I mean, we had 9% growth in the first quarter, but as I indicated in my comments, we think that's going to moderate to kind of low to mid-single digits. Some of that is being driven by advanced stocking. But it is going to be a great part of the portfolio for sustained growth as that market continues through over the next several years.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of your guidance, are you expecting cost inflation to kind of stay a headwind throughout this year? It seems some of the movement in commodities last several months would help in that regard.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I mean, at this stage, we're calling it less than 2%. So relative to last year, we actually saw the starting decrement towards the end of last year. But relative to last year, it's actually a net benefit for us. It's also -- there's also a sizable component of wage inflation in it as well that needs to be addressed. And I think Patrick's comments earlier around the strategic sourcing organization, I mean, we are really driving hard to continue what we've already had a strong performance to more than offset that. So back to the earlier point, even if we do start to see some of the price downward pressure coupled with inflation, we're still confident that we can drive margin expansion in that environment.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Question on restructuring. So you kept that at $20 million. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think that there was maybe, what, $17 million, $18 million that wasn't done in '14 that actually you're just doing in '15 and you added a couple of million more when you provided your initial outlook. I guess I was under the impression there that, that could become more aggressive. Can you just maybe talk about where that stands? Is there an opportunity to maybe kind of hit the gas pedal on that this year? And where those opportunities might be, if you could?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure, Brian. I mean, again, I -- we certainly announced that there remains a couple of hundred points of opportunity as a percent of revenue to reduce cost. You see that most notably in our G&A line, but there's also costs that are hidden within our gross margin infrastructure. I would say we're taking a very strategic approach, rather -- that's far more proactive rather than reactive, and it's actually tied in to our overall broader strategy. We will be sharing more details on what that plan would be as part of a multi-year, multi-faceted approach later this year at our Investor Day.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So not likely much more this year, is that takeaway?
Patrick K. Decker: Still reins open. We'll have more to share. We're in the late stages of developing those plans. As you saw, we announced a few months ago, we appointed Tony Milando as our Head of CI and Business Transformation. So Tony's working very closely with Mike, myself and the leadership team to finalize those plans.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got it. And secondly, just on the guidance, maybe you could help a little bit with the bridge. So the performance in Q1, you gave a pretty fairly detailed guidance for Q2 and the full year operating profit. Just kind of looking at the revenue trends for the second half of the year, you're looking at down maybe $100 million-or-so at the midpoint, but you're looking for flat operating profit. Could you talk about what is layering in in the second half that's going to help buffer still a decent sizable revenue headwind?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So one of the items is actually where you started, which is the restructuring. So we ended up picking up about $6 million in first quarter, we'll probably get another $5 million in the second quarter. And then the balance of the $20 million is going to end up showing in the second half. So you're going to have elements of that as well as just the mix of the portfolio in the second half and our continued focus around making sure that we've got the discipline around sourcing and the lean deployment within the business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna Financial.
Unknown Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on the call for Rob today. So my first question goes back to dewatering. So you mentioned oil and gas. I was wondering what was the performance in the other verticals, in particular mining, utility and construction.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So our dewatering business overall for the quarter was flat, and it was primarily obviously driven down by the performance in the oil and gas. So the balance of the portfolio was probably up around 4%, 5%.
Unknown Analyst: Okay, great. So my second question regards more on the geographical basis. In Canada, the weakness that you saw in 1Q, how much of that would you say is related to direct and indirect input of oil and gas? And then in Europe, Europe was flat. And have you seen any improvement in Europe? Or is it too early to say?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. It's on the Canada side, it is driven by oil and gas. We had a big distribution order last year that went into that particular segment. So we do anticipate having headwind through the rest of the year, but it was overtly pronounced in the first quarter. And as it relates to Europe, I mean at this stage, I would say things are progressing. I don't know that we're in a position right now to make a call other than what we've talked about the year being flat.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker: Great. Well, thanks again, everyone. Once again, as I said earlier, it's very early in the year, but I do feel that we're off to a very solid start. And I look forward to our next call in late July, where we will be updating you on our progress. So in the meantime, thank you again, and safe travel to everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

And actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning I'll review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and provide a brief update on some of our major initiatives. Mike will provide additional details, and then we'll discuss our 2015 outlook. So let's get started. We closed out 2014 strong. The renewed focus on execution across our organization helped us to generate solid organic top line growth, the sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as well as double-digit earnings growth. And I point out, that these results were achieved in an environment with strong foreign exchange headwinds and a mixed economic environment, conditions that we anticipate will continue throughout 2015. I'm pleased with our progress but we are in the early stages of our journey. We continue to operate in an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. We are encouraged by the bright spots such as an improving U.S. market and solid opportunities in several emerging markets, where we are poised to continue to grow and take share. But there remain many challenges, the most significant being the uncertainty in Europe, given both the political and economic headwinds the region faces. We are also keenly aware of, and closely monitoring, the currency markets, as foreign exchange translation does have a disproportionate effect on our reported results. But let me be clear. This will not be a distraction for us. We remain focused on the factors we can control, such as driving growth in our core business and operational improvements to drive out cost. Enhancing commercial excellence at Xylem is a strategic priority and critical in our efforts to accelerate profitable growth. And we're making good progress in rolling out the integrated technology solutions that are enabling stronger selling effectiveness and making it easier for our customers to do business with us. I anticipate measurable improvement in this area over the course of this year and look forward to sharing our progress. With regard to cost reductions, opportunities remain to drive further business simplification and structural efficiencies. We are taking appropriate steps to achieve additional productivity gains and cost reductions, leveraging the lean and global sourcing capabilities we are building as well as other targeted cost actions. We expect these efforts to also enable us to overcome some of the headwinds, including the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange translation and slow growth in Europe. We are taking a balanced view towards 2015 in light of uncertain and challenging market conditions. But we remain committed to executing our plans to achieve faster than end-of-market growth and further expansion of our operating margins and returns on capital. But first, let's review the fourth quarter performance. Orders grew organically 3% year-over-year. The sequential deceleration in growth in the previous quarter reflects the impact of some large Water Infrastructure project wins that closed in the third quarter and the push-out of orders from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2015. Taking a longer view, we saw orders grow 6% on an organic basis during the second half of the year, with at least 1 point of growth attributable to our longer cycle infrastructure project business. Organic revenue increased 6% in the quarter, reflecting growing strength in the industrial and public utility sectors. We saw 8% growth in the U.S., as that market continues to improve, and the emerging markets were up 14% in the quarter, including 25% growth in China. I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our business in Europe, which delivered 1% growth this quarter despite a very challenging environment. Our operating margin expanded 70 basis points in the quarter to a record 14.7%. This reflects continued progress on improving execution across Xylem. To wrap up the fourth quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.62, an increase of 11% over the prior year. This result includes a $0.03 drag from the impact of foreign exchange translation. Now turn to Slide 4. For the full year, revenue increased 3% on an organic basis. We saw broad-based growth in the industrial and public utility markets and benefited from the recovering U.S. commercial market. We generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets over the course of the year, where we posted a 13% increase. Our operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year, including a 100-basis-point reduction in G&A cost, an area that continues to have room for further improvement. We delivered record earnings per share this year of $1.97, an increase of 18% and a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path forward to improve financial returns. Finally, we generated $297 million of free cash flow in 2014, an increase of 50% year-over-year. We are continuing to make progress on our working capital performance across the business, which improved 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our increased profitability, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 45% in 2014. That includes a 10% increase in the dividend and $130 million of share repurchases under our current program. As we announced in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. This further illustrates the confidence we have in our execution and the cash generation ability of this company, and it marks the third consecutive year of dividend increases. So with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $1 billion, essentially flat to the prior year, including a $50 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 6%, which includes the benefit of 1 extra business day or roughly 1.5% when compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. From an end market perspective, we saw strength across the board. Industrial was up 6%, with growth in all regions, including mid-single digit growth in the United States and double-digit growth in both Latin America and the Middle East. As a reminder, Xylem serves a wide variety of industrial customers, and in the quarter, we generated industrial growth in both our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments. I'll cover both of these in more detail in the next 2 slides. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 5%, with mid-single digit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. We generated even stronger growth in the emerging markets, where we continue to see public utility investment to build out water and wastewater infrastructure. Revenue from our commercial end market was up 8%, with 14% growth in our U.S. business, which represents more than 50% of our overall sales in this end market. Operating income of $153 million was up $8 million over last year, despite $7 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. Operating margin increased by 70 basis points to a record 14.7%. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, global sourcing and restructuring savings, more than offset inflation, driving a 30-basis-point improvement in segment margins. Corporate expense was $3 million lower than the prior year, when we incurred onetime costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Wrapping up on the consolidated results. Strong organic revenue growth and execution across our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in record EPS of $0.62, an increase of 16% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange or 11% overall. Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. In our Water Infrastructure segment, we reported revenue of $672 million, up 6% on an organic basis. We grew across all major regions, with emerging markets leading the way, up 13%. U.S. revenue increased 6%, while Europe grew 3%. I'd further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport was up 6% overall, with broad-based strength; in Europe, the business was up high single digits, driven by public utility demand for our applied pumps, aftermarket parts and prepackaged pump stations as well as timing of shipments from Q3 to Q4. It's important to note that performance within Europe was mixed. For example, France, our second-largest market in Europe, was down low teens. In the U.S., we continue to see strong performance in industrial transport, driven by dewatering applications related to natural gas extraction-related activities. Treatment revenue was up 4%, as we delivered a large water filtration project in Brazil, and continue to see strong demand for filtration and disinfection products in China. Finally, test applications finished a record year with another strong quarter, up 5%, with strength in the U.S, driven by continued success of new products and cross-selling of our European-based technologies. While strong revenue growth in the quarter was balanced across the region and applications, order performance for Water Infrastructure was mixed. For the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $596 million, flat on an organic basis. This was down from the 10% organic growth we experienced in the prior quarter. While transport orders grew, treatment orders were weaker in the quarter as we saw some project delays in the U.S, Europe and the Middle East. For the fourth quarter, we're reporting record operating income of $113 million and a record operating margin of 16.8%. Performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and cost reductions of $26 million, driven by sourcing and Lean initiatives as well as $6 million in restructuring savings. In addition, we saw the benefit of a slightly improved pricing environment and a favorable impact of foreign exchange translation. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 3%, unfavorable mix and increased spend on strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water reported revenue of $370 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw strong growth in the U.S, up 9% organically, and emerging markets grew 18%. Latin America and the Middle East were both up more than 40%. Growth in China moderated from earlier in the year but was still up 10%. Europe remained a weak spot, however, declining 3% as construction and industrial demand was soft. I'd further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 6% as we benefited from a long-awaited recovery in the U.S. institutional building market and associated distributor restocking as well as success with marketing and promotional activities; industrial water grew 7%, with strength exhibited across most regions; and lastly, irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, grew 25%, driven by the timing of several project shipments against a relatively small revenue base. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%. However, this headline masked the strong 70-basis-point improvement in operations as foreign exchange translation negatively impacted results by 30 basis points. Our strong operational performance was driven by volume and cost reductions from sourcing and Lean Six Sigma activities and, to a lesser extent, restructuring savings. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of nearly 3% and the impact of divesting our valves business earlier in 2014. And pricing was neutral in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Looking back at full year 2014 results, let me first start with Water Infrastructure. Revenue was $2.4 billion, up 4% organically, including double-digit emerging market growth, driven by the build-out of public utility infrastructure and industrial growth. In addition, we saw low single-digit growth in the public utility market for developed regions overall and strength in the U.S. industrial market, driven by demand for dewatering applications. Operating margin was also up strongly, increasing 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.3% due to volume leverage and the impact of cost reductions initiated in 2013 and 2014. Moving on to Applied Water. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 2% organically. We delivered 9% growth in emerging markets, including double-digit growth in industrial water applications in the Middle East and Latin America. We saw U.S. strength across all applications, including signs of a slowly recovering commercial building market. The weak macroeconomic environment in Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, was a consistent headwind throughout the year. For the year, Europe was down 2%. Operating margin increased 90 basis points year-over-year to a full year record of 14%, primarily reflecting positive price, strong productivity improvements and the impact of cost actions from 2013 and 2014. Overall, a focus on productivity and cost efficiency against the backdrop of a slow global growth and currency volatility has enabled us to generate strong segment margin expansion over the course of the year. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $663 million at the end of Q4, with approximately 21% held outside of the U.S. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During 2014, we invested $119 million in capital expenditures and we returned $224 million to shareholders. This includes a 10% increase in our dividend and $130 million under our share repurchase program. We also generated $297 million of free cash flow, largely reflecting higher income and lower CapEx spend. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $99 million. Free cash flow conversion finished the year at 91%, up from 87% last year. That said, we fell short of our 100% conversion rate target, primarily due to working capital performance. We're disappointed with our performance in this regard, and as you'll hear Patrick address in a few minutes, improving working capital performance is one of our top priorities in 2015. Lastly, we increased the return on invested capital by 90 basis points to 10.9%, in line with our expectations. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover the CEO update.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. So please turn to Slide 10. As we look ahead, we have a clear vision to achieve our goal of establishing Xylem as the definitive market leader in the water space. These long-term strategic initiatives will enable us to grow our business, establish stronger commercial partnerships and build a culture in which excellence across all functions is fostered and delivered. Let me briefly discuss our 2015 strategic priorities. We continue to see increased growth opportunities in the emerging markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we are focusing additional resources in China and the Middle East this year, building more robust capabilities and growing our presence in each market. Globally, we're already beginning to develop deeper, more distinctive industry vertical marketing capabilities. One of Xylem's unique strengths is the breadth of products and services we offer customers across the water cycle. Positioning Xylem as the total solution provider for certain industries and large key accounts will enhance our ability to solve our customers' challenges and drive efficiencies along the way. As I've said before, I believe the opportunity to drive continuous improvement and business simplification across the company can and will be a significant lever for long-term value creation. This is the fundamental thread in the productivity for growth mindset that we are driving into our day-to-day activities. Last month, we announced that Tony Milando will be joining us as our Senior Vice President of Continuous Improvement and Business Transformation. Tony just started this week, and he brings a wealth of experience in business integration and simplification. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment we face today, we are looking to accelerate certain Lean and global sourcing initiatives as well as some other targeted cost actions. We will continue pushing the cost levers, and Tony now will help accelerate the execution of our Continuous Improvement road map. In addition, we will invest some of those productivity savings back into the business to build new and stronger organization capabilities that drive faster-to-market growth and margin expansion that is sustainable over time. As Mike mentioned, improving our working capital performance is also a top priority, and we anticipate at least 100-basis-point improvement as a percentage of revenue, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. Finally, as I mentioned before, we intend to initially pursue bolt-on acquisitions. While timing is always difficult to predict, we aim to be more active in this area in the latter part of the year. So now please turn to Slide 11. As I review this slide, the growth rates I refer to all exclude the foreign exchange headwinds that we expect to negatively impact our results. Looking at the year ahead, we anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 90 basis points, reflecting the carryover benefit of our broad-based restructuring efforts last year as well as additional efficiencies we expect to drive in 2015. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95, which includes $0.21 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this headwind, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 10%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in 100% free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 12. This slide outlines our expectations for 2015 organic revenue by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. This projection assumes continued growth in the U.S. but a slightly slower growth in the emerging markets. The public utility sector, which constitutes 1/3 of our total revenue, is anticipated to grow at a low single-digit rate. Here, we anticipate continued growth in the emerging markets as well as in the U.S., where we see encouraging signs in terms of municipal funding. For the commercial market, we see growth in the low to mid-single digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and the emerging markets are anticipated to have continued strength. But we expect Europe to remain soft. The residential sector remains challenged, and we anticipate we will be flat to down low single digits, as Europe continues to be a drag. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, will likely be flat for the year. Please turn now to Slide 13, and Mike will walk you through a few more details on our expectations.
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, again, Patrick. Given the recent focus on foreign exchange and the potential impact on many companies' financial performance, we thought it would be appropriate to help provide transparency as it relates to our company. So first, let's begin by discussing Xylem's foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure, and we have in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our 7 largest currency pairs. Furthermore, we hedge the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet as well. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments. Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected on our underlying operational performance. Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will isolate the impact so that you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives. This table illustrates the top 5 translation currency exposures for Xylem, and provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the 2015 rate assumed in our guidance, which was based on a spot rate for each currency last Friday. To summarize, based on these rates used for guidance, revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $280 million and operating income by $48 million, which results in a $0.21 EPS headwind. Turning to Slide 14, I'll further illustrate this impact. As you can see here, we expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% before approximately 7 percentage points of negative foreign exchange translation impact. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $528 million to $553 million, resulting in margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points [ph], excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation noted on this slide. Please turn to Slide 15. Just a few more points around our full year 2015 outlook. On this slide, each of the projected margin and EPS growth rates exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue of $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue flat to up 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.5% to 14.9%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13.1% to 13.5%, reflecting margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points. At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95 excluding restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million. As noted on the slide, EPS growth is expected to be 5% to 10%. As mentioned earlier, we're driving 100% free cash flow conversion of net income, and this takes into consideration expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We expect return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%, given the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation on operating income. Excluding this anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, approximately 1 point higher than in 2014, given the expected mix in regional revenues, specifically, higher growth in the U.S., where we have our highest effective tax rates. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be $183 million. With that said, please turn to Slide 16. As we've done in prior years, I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting the seasonal profile our business, which you can see on the left side of the chart. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect 1% organic growth, due in part to the fact that we have 1 less day in the first quarter of 2015, and an extra day in the fourth quarter later in the year. On average, 1 day represents $15 million of revenue, which would impact year-over-year growth by 1.5%. I'd also note that we expect foreign exchange translation headwind of approximately $75 million in the first quarter. We anticipate operating income to be down year-over-year, due primarily to $12 million in expected foreign exchange translation. While we anticipate our annual corporate expense to be held flat with 2014, we expect corporate expenses in Q1 to be in the range of $12 million to $13 million, slightly higher than last year. And lastly, we anticipate that continuous improvement activities and restructuring savings will fund strategic initiatives. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. Let me conclude by reiterating that we are pleased with our results in 2014. We made significant progress last year, delivering strong financial results, refining our operating model, and raising our execution game. We entered 2015 with solid momentum, and we intend to build on our achievements. I am confident that we have the right strategy in place and we're building the right team to move Xylem forward and increase the value of our shareholders' investments. Operator, we can now open up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just to start off, I really appreciate that Slide 13 you provided on your FX exposure. We recognize that this is a -- not one of the elements necessarily within your control, but this additional detail is a big help. And so a couple of questions, for starters, and just so everyone is clear, I know some initial worries about the Swiss franc and being your tax center in Switzerland, I know it's a nonissue, but Mike, if you could just take us through why it's not an issue. And then also address, please, within the hedging, why 75% on the transaction hedging? Why not 100? And where we would see the mark-to-market adjustments on a quarterly basis? Are those in your operating results? So -- and I know I just grouped up all my FX questions there.
Michael T. Speetzen: Okay. All right, Deane, so let me take a shot at this. So I think as it relates to Swiss franc, we do have some impact from that because we have local cost. But relative to the total size of the company, they're very small and not material. I think the key element to understand is, although we are in Switzerland, our functional currency within Switzerland is the euro, since we're transacting primarily with euro-denominated countries. And so again, it gets back to, the majority of our foreign exchange impact is heavily weighted, and you can see that on Slide 13 in terms of the amount of profit that we capture in Switzerland but it's denominated in euros. As it relates to the hedging program, it's a bit of a call from a company perspective. We have picked 75% because what that does is that essentially gives us some cushion for any variability we have in our forecast. It's all about qualifying for hedge accounting so that we avoid the second part of your question, mark-to-market variation. As long as we can demonstrate that we're effectively hedging predicted cash flows with a high degree of accuracy, essentially, all the mark-to-market gets caught in basically a balance sheet account and then is released as we incur the gain or the loss on the actual transaction. So it takes the variability out of the P&L and it gives us a little bit of cushion from a financial projection perspective.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. And just one follow-up within the currency exposure. Mike, how would you characterize your natural hedge with having manufacturing in, let's say, Sweden and just outside the U.S., how are you balanced on the revenue and cost side?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I'd say, probably not as much as we'd like to be, and I think that shows up in the fact that our hedging program covers about $0.5 billion in net cost and cash movements. And I think for the European exposure, we're pretty well offset, given that most of our manufacturing is done in either Italy or in Sweden. But we do deal with some of the cross-currency effects. And with our Applied Water business, we have a pretty heavy manufacturing base in the U.S., and that gives us a little bit of a disadvantage, especially when we see the U.S. dollar appreciating. But again, we look to try and use the foreign exchange transaction program to put us in a better position in terms of hedging that off.
Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then away from FX and -- first of all, I appreciate all that additional disclosure and detail on the FX side. And then just if you would characterize the benefit -- potential benefit from lower fuel cost, and is that included in your guidance? And just update us on any direct or indirect oil exposures on your revenue side. I know there are some -- a bit in transport, but how would you characterize those?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I guess, I'd characterize not only energy cost but, I would say, overall commodity impact. We saw inflation rates that had averaged out around 2.8% throughout the course of 2014. Right now, built into our guidance is inflation that's just around 2%. So we are certainly seeing the benefits coming through across the board in the business. And I would say, in terms of exposure, we have less than 5% of our revenue that's exposed to oil and gas, and it's primarily, Deane, as you well know, in our dewatering business. And I would say the majority of that exposure is actually against natural gas. We've taken a view that we are likely to be down and that is obviously built into the guidance range of 1% to 3%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just trying to get a sense of your level of conservativeness in the guide on top line, and the 1% to 3%, it looks like -- from Slide 3, I guess, it is, orders up 3%. I mean, are you seeing something in January that causes concern or is this just a lack of visibility and just trying to remain reasonably conservative?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, Scott, let me -- this is Pat. Let me take that one. I mean I'd say, first of all, we were pleased with solid second half growth in the business. I would say, though, we need to recognize that we're still operating in a pretty low-growth environment. So we do feel that we're taking share but it's in a low-growth environment. And while we are seeing some pockets of improving conditions, they are balanced with other markets where there's greater levels of certainty, especially in parts of Europe. We do have good visibility into Q1, both revenue and earnings. Obviously, we're being impacted, as Mike indicated, by a number of shipping days. So don't want to get into the -- ahead on that one, but it does have some impact for us. So there's no real concern if we go into Q1 from a revenue standpoint. But as you pointed out, it's a very short-cycle business, and while we do see a number of bright spots, there are challenges. And so we want to be appropriately balanced in our outlook for the full year, given that short-cycle nature and, therefore, we think it's a good balanced outlook for the year.
Michael T. Speetzen: And Scott, what I would add to supplement Patrick's comment around the short cycle, our backlog is up as we head into 2015 but it only represents 17% of our anticipated shipments for the year. So just gives you a sense of how much is left to go, and even when you look at the first quarter, I've got roughly 40% sitting in backlog. So we're kind of watching things on a day-to-day basis.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure, sure. Understood. My follow-on question just relates to the balance sheet. And there's things you can and can't control. The one thing you can control is your capital structure. And the comments of bolt-on acquisitions but more back end of the year variety, it just leads me to believe -- I mean, what is the risk for sitting here kind of 12 months from now and the cash balances are again building on the balance sheet and we're leaving a key lever that you guys can use on the table? So I guess my question is, is that why not step up repurchases or think about a more progressive use of the balance sheet to try to control some drag from the earnings growth here?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. So Scott, this is Patrick again. We do have $70 million left in our authorized share repo program and so whenever we sit back and talk about and think about our capital deployment framework, we still see our top opportunities here being to continue to invest in the growth of the core business. And so we are making investments in CapEx and R&D, consistent with the past. We did have the increase in the dividend and we'll continue to pull that lever. We are very actively looking at and pursuing the development of our M&A pipeline. So we're going to continue to remain focused in that area. Obviously, we want to balance that between execution there in our own internal operating execution. But I'm feeling better and better about that and the pipeline is looking more and more attractive. And we will use that remaining repo that we've got authorized if we find that things are not moving as fast on the M&A front as we'd like for it to. But I'm confident that you're going to see us be pretty active here in the back half of '15 on the M&A front, again, focused on bolt-ons.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: A question, I guess, as it relates to currency again. You do have a significant amount of manufacturing in Sweden, and the kroner has also taken a big dive, it's actually even worse than the euro at the moment. What kind of impact could that have in terms of a potential competitive advantage for you there with the manufacturing in Sweden?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, it certainly plays in especially as we start thinking about the pumps that are manufactured in Sweden and exported into the U.S. and Latin America. And I would say this has been a pretty fluid environment, I mean, given the fact that the rates really fell hard in the latter part of December and then constructively throughout January. We've got our teams obviously taking a hard look at what some of the competitive implications are across the board.
Patrick K. Decker: And I would just add to that, Nate, and I mean you're absolutely spot on that, as things move fast here, I think our folks in the field are pretty savvy and were very much focused on not just relying on hedging strategies to try to mitigate this FX impact but really, where there's an advantage, to take full advantage of that. But it's fluid and we'll move as fast as we can.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And we've seen some of your competitors and some folks in adjacent markets talk pretty constructively recently on the U.S. municipal market. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market and what your expectations are for potentially accelerating orders as we go through the year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I mean, we -- Nathan, as we talked about through the course of 2014, we definitely saw a pickup and it was more on the construction side, specifically around what we saw on our treatment business, which had orders that were up double digits. As we go into 2015, we're looking at the public utility market overall to be up low single digits. We do think the U.S. is an area of opportunity. We continue to be very balanced in how we're looking at that. I think one of the general concerns is, are we truly in a recovery or are we simply just catching up on the backlog of work? And I don't know that the jury has come back on that one. So I sure hope that it would represent additional opportunity, but we're playing it kind of right down the middle right now.
Patrick K. Decker: I mean, I would add that we are seeing the project funnel grow, particularly in our treatment business, which is being driven by that. But again, the timing of these things, many of them are longer-term, multiyear projects and so, again, we're just trying to take a balanced view here as to what to bake into '15.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And on the $20 million of restructuring expense you're planning this year, can you talk about where that's targeted and what the potential impacts are? And that's excluded from your EPS guidance this year, correct?
Michael T. Speetzen: Correct. I'd say a fair amount of the restructuring component is actually associated with the actions that we undertook in 2014. So it's really tied into the $18 million worth of restructuring benefit that carries over into 2015. We also have additional realignment, which is a continuation of some of the ongoing transformation activity we have within the business. And then some smaller elements that are related to, what I'll call, a little bit longer-term restructuring activities that are within the business.
Patrick K. Decker: I would add that, I mean, we are absolutely committed to taking actions to improve the operating efficiency. As I've indicated before, I still stand behind the fact that we see a couple of hundred basis points at least of opportunity there in terms of cost out. I'd say this is on the heels of a good job by the team over the past few years in terms of taking cost out. But I would say that we're in the middle innings of developing what I would see as a multiyear and multifaceted plan. It's going to include Lean and global sourcing, much of which is already baked into our plan and it's really the driver behind the 50- to 90-basis-point operating margin expansion that we're talking about, before FX. But in addition to that, we have identified some strategic actions that are centered around business simplification that we think can reduce our structural costs. And lastly, I would say, with Tony Milando coming on-board now, together, he and I will be developing and executing a plan that's focused on strategic opportunities to reduce cost that cut across the businesses as opposed to the recent activity in the last couple of years, which is really centered on business unit by business unit. Now the opportunity is to look across the businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: I was hoping you could touch on Europe a bit more, I guess, particularly for the Water Infrastructure business. Sounded like it was pretty mixed; France down. Just talk about country-by-country a little bit. Confidence that, that business stays stable.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I think, Chip, we've taken, I'd say, a fairly conservative view relative to Europe. I mean, Europe was a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated. We were essentially looking for it to be flat, and we were up about 1%. As we look out into 2015, we're essentially counting on Europe to be, call it, flat. The Nordics continue to be strong. Economically, in the way they develop their water systems, we feel confident there. We're confident from a U.K. standpoint because we track with the AMP cycle, and we know that, that's going to be into more of a downturn here for the next year and then moving into an upswing. I'd say where the question marks start to come is around Western and Southern. We pointed out the fact that France was down. France is one of our larger end markets, and so we've seen a little bit of volatility there and we're keeping a close eye to make sure that we can understand and track that. Germany's remained relatively balanced and Southern Europe continues to be a net drag for us. And so at this point, I wouldn't say we're going to expect to see something that occurs through 2015, in our view, that's going to be dramatically different than that and, as a result, that becomes more of a drag on the top line growth.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Okay. Yes, that's helpful, Mike. And if we shift it to emerging markets, obviously, great results. Looks like that strategy is starting to pay off. Maybe you can just detail out a little bit where you're funneling some investments there?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. So I -- do you want me to take this one, Mike? All right. We've identified -- I certainly don't want to suggest that we're only focusing on China and the Middle East. I mean, we're certainly sowing the seeds and building the capabilities in other critical emerging markets as well, and we're seeing good growth there. But we're taking a very focused strategy in 2015 and making investments both in China and the Middle East. They're largely driven by the need to further localize our manufacturing, some of our R&D work, the innovation that we're doing around the products and services that are tailored for those markets. And we're also putting some more feet on the street in those markets as well. So it really is more about localization and transferring some of the responsibilities and capabilities to those markets away from some of our core developed markets where the activity occurs today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wanted to just start by following up on some of the comments you made about accelerating some of the sourcing, Lean actions, perhaps, accelerating some structural cost actions. Do you mean to imply that there could be some upside to that $20 million bucket of restructuring that's currently in the plan?
Patrick K. Decker: I think these are actions that, first of all, would likely not benefit us until late in '15, predominantly into '16 and onward, because they are going to be a bit more difficult to get at structurally than some of the things that we've done the last couple of years. And we're in the middle innings of developing and finalizing that plan. And so I wouldn't necessarily see it as straight up upside to what we're guiding to right now. Obviously, we're going to accelerate and get these things as quickly as we can. And as I've mentioned earlier, we'll certainly be keeping you guys apprised of the progress over the course of the year.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And then I was wondering if you could just unpack a little bit the expectation within infrastructure growth of 1% to 3%? Anything there that stands out as maybe, within the businesses, as a little bit stronger or weaker? It sounds like maybe treatment, with some of the pushout, might be weaker; transport stronger. But just curious as to your views across transport, treatment, test. And within transport, dewatering I think has been stronger. Is that still the expectation?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I think as it relates to dewatering, we certainly expect to continue to see growth, with the exception of the oil and gas exposure, where we do anticipate getting a little bit of headwind. I'd say as it relates to treatment, probably not as strong a growth as you would expect, mainly because the project sequence out over time. These can be 9-, 12-, 18-month projects. I'd really look at the core transport and test businesses as being kind of the key drivers. But again, looking at Europe as a potentially drag on the overall performance. And I think from a pricing environment perspective, although we did see a little bit of a positive price, about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter, we're not anticipating that to be a significant driver. We are anticipating some positive price but it's going to be below 50 basis points throughout 2015.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Is mining expected to be a headwind or tailwind or neutral? I think it's been a pretty big headwind, but...
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, for us, I think in 2015, it's about net neutral. We saw most of the impact this past year or so.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Fair enough. And then just maybe 1 final one, a housekeeping item. You talked about resi weakness, and calling out Europe. Just how much of that 7% of the business that's resi is in Europe?
Michael T. Speetzen: It's about 1/4.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: 1/4 of the 7%?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Question, first, on the restructuring. At what point do we start taking that into operations and not call it up specifically that's more tailored towards like a Continuous Improvement type of initiative?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I think I'll give you my perspective and then Patrick can certainly weigh in. I think we've got to get through what I'll call as next wave of transformation, which obviously we have not fully detailed out yet and need to understand the impact. But I do think, philosophically, we agreed that at a point here in the not-too-distant future, we need to start to incorporate that into the earnings profile of the business.
Patrick K. Decker: And I totally agree with that. We've talked about that internally, and it's really been -- and it's really been myself that said let's make sure that we have this window here in front of us, where we know that we're going to be doing some more transformative things, and I want to make sure that we're able to be as transparent as possible with all of you as to what that looks like. But we definitely want to get to a level of normalcy here in terms of just baking it into our results.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then more of a high-level question. I'm just curious to hear what comments you had or what potential implications you think about some of the tax proposals being discussed in Washington now regarding accrued foreign income and things like that, and where's your cash position relative to the U.S. versus overseas, things of that nature.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I -- a couple of comments. One, tough to comment because nobody knows what's actually going to make it through. I think, obviously, we're supportive of any proposal that would enable us to get our cash back from overseas in an efficient manner, given the fact that we have 80% outside of the U.S. That said, we don't wait for tax changes. We've got a pretty active strategy from a planning standpoint and we've been pretty effective, since we spun off, with being able to repatriate cash in a very tax-efficient manner. So we'll obviously continue to watch it. We've got a strong tax team here that stays pretty plugged into what's going on in the regulatory, environment and we have demonstrated in the past that we can react pretty quickly to regulatory changes.
Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And then just lastly from me on M&A, just real quick. Where -- are you looking to increase -- I'm assuming Europe is where valuations have declined the most, are you looking to increase your exposure there if the opportunities present itself?
Patrick K. Decker: We certainly wouldn't rule it out. I wouldn't comment right now on a preference as to one geography versus another. I think that we're going through some very attractive kind of value mapping work, as we speak, in terms of laying out, really leveraging this industry vertical marketing capability we're building to really understand what the full range of water management needs are for our customers in different industries. And we're really doing that work along with pursuing some deals in the pipeline already. So -- probably wouldn't want to comment on geography at this stage.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to follow up, first of all, just on the restructuring and realignment. Just to be clear, so the $20 million is not included in the numbers. You have $18 million of savings from the '14 actions. And is that -- $20 million in total, that's an additional $38 million coming through?
Michael T. Speetzen: No. It's $20 million in total, $18 million of which is from the actions we executed last year. Some of that cost carries over into '15, and then we have $2 million of extra benefit from actions that are occurring in 2015.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And so the $20 million in restructuring realignment cost, what sort of benefits should we see in '16?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, like I said, about half of that $20 million cost is actually related to the actions that started in '14 but, from an accounting standpoint, we weren't able to accrue for that. So if you look at what we incurred in 2014, which was about $26 million, that was below what we had originally guided to and it mainly had to do with the cut-off of what is accruable and not accruable on the restructuring. The balance has to do with realignment. So it's a variety of things associated with getting the Lean deployment, manufacturing footprint, those types of things under way.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. All right, that's clear. And then just a couple of follow-ups. Just on the commentary around your residential assumptions. I mean, you've got just 1/4 of that really is in Europe, so vast majority is in the U.S. So why wouldn't you see higher gross rates? I mean, what sort of assumptions are you -- do you have embedded in Europe for resi? I mean, if we combine...
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so definitely, David, the headwind in Europe, it is just 1/4 but it does carry kind of a mid-single-digit decline with it. The thing that I think we always need to point out with our resi business as it relates to our U.S. exposure, given that it is about 1/2 of what our residential business is, it is primarily a replacement market and it's primarily around borehole pumps. So while we do anticipate the residential market will be on an upswing in 2015, our ability to participate in that is really more on a replacement. Not to say that we don't participate in new builds, where they're putting in ground wells and things like that, but it's just not as big an opportunity as all the new construction going on.
Patrick K. Decker: David, I'd actually highlight, to the extent that there's a recovery in or a continued, if you would, progress in the residential market, that's actually going to benefit more that U.S. public utility [indiscernible] Water Infrastructure.
Michael T. Speetzen: Public utility, yes.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Sure. I was just looking at some of the peers that have had much more positive commentary around residential. And maybe if you could, lastly, on the treatment side. You've made a lot of changes in terms of product development on the treatment side coming up with small-system solutions. Does that change the nature of the cycle? I mean, greater short cycle, where you have less visibility. And I'm really kind of thinking about Water Infrastructure [ph] as an example. Does that sort of change your visibility in that market? I mean, the opportunity set seems to increase but you have less visibility. Is that fair?
Patrick K. Decker: I don't -- I think it's a fair question. I don't -- we certainly don't have a sense or a feel that it's necessarily going to reduce our visibility in terms of shipping mix that much. Actually, part of the work that we've benefited from in terms of, one, having integrated our front end commercially as well as the implementations of our CRM solution, is that we -- our teams, especially in North America where we -- we're implementing it first, are actually getting more visibility to building out the project funnel. So we've actually grown our project funnel pretty significantly here over the past number of months as well as having improved our win rate as a result of that. So I think there are going to be things that we do internally from an execution standpoint in getting better visibility and expanding the funnel that would mitigate any of the offset that you're referring to in terms of change of mix at short cycle.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Maybe touching a little bit more on just oil and gas. I understand it's 5% of your revenue exposure. Can you tell us what the contribution to operating profit is? I suspect that dewatering, higher margins, is it maybe closer to 10% of operating profit?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Brian, I want to stay away from getting into the details but the couple of points I'd give you is, it is dewatering, it is rental. But I would tell you, it's in the lower end of the value-add spectrum on that, so I wouldn't anticipate the type of drop rates that we've seen in the past on rental. But as we indicated, it's less than 5% of our revenue. We do think that the team has some pretty good options in front of them to try and offset some of the potential headwinds through branch expansion and some of the activities that they have under way, just given the size of player we are in the market. But at this point, we really didn't call it out because we don't anticipate it being a significant headwind at this point.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I guess, just following on that path [ph], I understand you said the exposure is more kind of on the gas production side, which gives you a little bit more comfort. Do you have, I guess, a sense of the exposure to gas production? I mean, is it on associated wells or is it dry gas wells? Because obviously, there's been a ton of production of gas coming from wells that are targeting oil than as a byproduct. So if we're going to going get a pullback on that type of production, have you done that type of analysis and is that being incorporated in your outlook?
Michael T. Speetzen: The team has definitely done that. And what I would tell you is that the majority of our exposure is going to be direct, not residual and, at this point, it's about watching what's going on with natural gas pricing and rig counts. And at this point, the thing I'd point out to you is we actually had very strong performance in the fourth quarter. So we have not seen any initial signs but, obviously, it can change relatively quickly.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Yes, I mean, I'd say that obviously, we took a fairly big leg down since Q4, but -- okay, just moving on. Maybe just on inflation, so I think you said in Water Infrastructure, up 3% from an inflation standpoint. I mean, so just with the commodity prices coming off, I mean, where is most of that inflation coming from? Is it wage and I guess other sorts of inflation? And shouldn't that start to moderate maybe [indiscernible]?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So the 3% that I spoke to was relative to 2014. And as I think I answered to an earlier question, we think inflation's going to be closer to 2%. A big portion of that, obviously, is what we do from a wage perspective, which has not come down year-over-year in terms of what we give folks in terms of merit increases on an annual basis. And then there are parts of the component base that have not moderated as much as from a commodity pricing standpoint. So we've got a great strategic sourcing team. They've done a lot over the past several years to drive savings, and we're pretty confident that whatever residual inflation we see, we've got the ability to more than offset it.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.
James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes, just a quick one on -- and I'm sorry if I missed it, if you can talk about the competitive landscape in both of your segments or by end market? You mentioned that you don't think price is going to be a headwind this year. Just some color around that. Is that reflective of more rational players out there or reflective of your value proposition relative to other products out there? Any color would be helpful.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I think as it relates to Applied Water, there's probably going to be a little bit of downward price by us. It's probably less about the competitive environment. It's more about what we've seen in the underlying commodities. That business tends to track more closely. We do anticipate getting positive price, but may not be at the same level that we've gotten over the past couple of years as commodity prices are settling down. I think within Water Infrastructure, it's probably a bit of the market calibration, and we're now entering a period where the market is growing, albeit at a very low rate, and that is taking a little bit of the pressure off. But I don't want to suggest that those competitive pressures have diminished dramatically. I think it's going to be about how do we make sure our teams fully understand and have the capability internally to do the right value proposition selling to make sure that we're getting paid the premium that we deserve given the performance of our products.
Patrick K. Decker: I would also add that one of the other things that the team is working hard to do is, one of the benefits from a pricing standpoint is when you're able to ramp up your launch of new products. And we have had a number of new products that we've launched recently and a number teed up for 2015. So it's always easier to go talk price when you've got something new to talk about in terms of technology and solutions. So that's going to be another lever for us to pull as well.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker: Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for your time in the call today, and we appreciate your continued interest and we look forward to updating you on our next call. So safe travels and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Xylem Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Phil De Sousa: Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. 2014 continues to be a critical year in the evolution of Xylem and the third quarter results we announced today reflect continued progress on our journey. By now, I hope you've all had a chance to review our press release and other earnings materials. So I'll provide you with some headline thoughts and perspective on the quarter, our progress and a look ahead, so let's get started. Our teams are squarely focused on execution and as a result, we are delivering the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and earnings growth as well as margin expansion. Our ability, both to accelerate growth and continue to increase the efficiency of our operations is key to our success and ultimately, the key to increasing shareholder value. So let's get into the third quarter performance. Organic revenue growth was 1% while orders increased 8%. As a result, we exited the third quarter with record backlog up 12% versus the prior year. We're continuing to focus on building our longer cycle backlog, which will help extend our visibility and ultimately support a longer term growth profile. I am encouraged by these results but the fact remains that some of our end markets are still challenged and continue to be slow to recover. Furthermore, we are cautiously monitoring economic conditions in key geographic markets particularly in Europe. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points to a record third quarter level of 13.9%. This reflects continued progress on improving execution across Xylem. Just a few more comments on our overall performance. We improved our year-to-date free cash flow by $104 million versus the same period a year ago. On the capital deployment front, we opportunistically repurchased an additional $30 million in common stock. This brings our full year repurchases to $130 million. And in the aggregate, the total return of capital to shareholders via repurchases and dividends increased year-to-date to $201 million, an increase of $94 million over the prior-year period, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value through disciplined capital deployment. To wrap up the third quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.53, up 8% over the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $1.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 21% versus the same period a year ago. We have delivered a solid performance in the first 9 months of the year. Importantly, our results show that we are moving the company in the right direction, and we remain on track to deliver our 2014 commitments. Now turning to Slide 4. We announced this morning that we are tightening our full year EPS guidance, reflecting both our performance today and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Given recent volatility in the foreign exchange rates, we now expect to generate approximately $3.9 billion in revenues. In terms of operating income, we expect to improve our operating margin to approximately 13% and to deliver earnings per share growth of 15% to 19%. Shortly after I joined Xylem about 7 months ago, I discussed a number of focused areas that we identified as opportunities to improve our operating efficiency and accelerate growth. While there's not time this morning to cover in detail all the work that's underway, I did want to mention a few areas in which we continue to make good progress. All of our teams have been focused on improving execution and specifically, driving productivity for growth. For example, over the past couple of years, our Applied Water division has redoubled its efforts to get cost out of the system and streamline their processes. As a result, they have been able to reinvest some of those savings into R&D and innovation, which has led to new products that are hitting the marketplace now and there's much more to come. We are confident that this will ultimately return that part of our business to better the market growth. Importantly, they're accelerating innovation while continuing to improve their operating performance. In the third quarter, the Applied Water division delivered an all-time high operating margin and that was achieved in an environment of mixed market conditions. Now we are still in the early days of this work, but I am pleased with this measurable progress. We've also discussed the opportunity for Xylem to accelerate growth by integrating our front-end commercial assets and capabilities. In addition to the realignment of our sales organizations, we have also been working to develop a multifaceted IT solution that will better enable commercial excellence across the company. In other words, making it easier for customers to do business with us and for our sales teams to have the right tools to reduce quote preparation time, share customer leads from one business line to another and work within a more standard ERP system. This will enable our sales teams to accelerate growth and will be a fully integrated set of solution that is rolled out globally. Let me touch on 1 component of that work, deployment of a new customer relationship management or CRM platform. Over the last few months, a dedicated team has been designing and programming our new sales and marketing process. They have worked at a fervid pace and as a result, we recently launched our new CRM tool, salesforce.com, in several businesses across our Americas region and Australia. This was an important milestone. CRM allows us to present ourselves to key customers as one company, capitalizing on the unparalleled expertise we possess in multiple verticals, bring greater value to our customers, while growing our own business. This rollout will continue, and we expect to have it fully deployed by the end of 2016 and I do look forward to sharing some successes on this front in the coming months. Finally, we're also continuing to execute our plans to accelerate growth by focusing our resources and efforts in faster growth regions, namely in emerging markets. For the quarter, revenues from emerging markets increased 10% and the team succeeded in winning some larger project bids that are increasing our backlog. We intend to intensify this focus and sharpen our strategy in order to capitalize on attractive opportunities we see in these developing regions. As we look to 2015, China and the Middle East will be the most important areas for us to accelerate further localization of our supply chain and building stronger local capabilities. Other fast-growth markets such as Brazil, India and greater Asia remain important to us, and we will be further assessing specific growth accelerators in those markets as well. I firmly believe that no company is better positioned than Xylem to lead in this industry. Our ability to leverage our global footprint and breadth of solutions and expertise to address our customers' most complex water issues and deliver strong results is unmatched. But we must execute aggressively and continue to evolve our organization and make the most of our global assets and strength of our team. With that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenue of $963 million, essentially flat to the prior year reflecting both the impacts of our divestiture and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 1%. From an end market perspective, we saw strength in industrial and commercial, partially offset by declines in public utility and residential. Industrial was up 3% with growth in the U.S. and emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in Europe. As a reminder, Xylem serves a wide variety of industrial customers with applications from both our segments. As for the third quarter specifically, we generated industrial growth in the Water Infrastructure segment and had flat performance in Applied Water. I'll cover both of these in more detail in the next 2 slides. In commercial, strong markets across all regions helped us drive 6% growth in the quarter. Europe was exceptionally strong, up double digits with growth primarily attributable to the successful launch of new products. In the U.S, leading indicators have been generally positive for several quarters, and we are starting to see the impact of that recovery in our business. Wrapping up in commercial, we continue to see strong performance out of the emerging markets particularly in regions such as the Middle East and Asia and Latin America, where each delivered double-digit growth. Revenue from the public utility end market was down 3%, slightly below our expectations. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects the continuation of a soft CapEx order environment in developed regions that we experienced last year and during the first half of 2014. It's important to note that our order trends in this market have generally improved in recent quarters. We are seeing some positive signs in our long-term backlog, suggesting that the market has stabilized. OpEx activity remains stable with growth in both the U.S. and Europe. I'll cover up more specifics by segment but overall, we saw strong revenue growth from emerging markets, up 10% and modest growth in the U.S, up 4%, partially offset by a 6% decline in Europe. Operating income of $134 million, was up $4 million or 3% over last year. As Patrick mentioned, despite modest top line growth, we delivered a record third quarter operating margin of 13.9%, up 40 basis points. We continue to deliver strong segment performance as margins expanded 110 basis points to 15.6%. This was partially offset by higher corporate expense. Corporate expense was $16 million reflecting a normal quarterly spend rate. Cost reductions totaled $46 million and included approximately $10 million of restructuring savings with the balance coming from sourcing and lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds, was inflation of approximately 270 basis points and unfavorable price and mix in our Water Infrastructure segment. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, organic growth and solid operational performance coupled with strong execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.53, up 8% versus the prior year. Core operations drove the year-over-year EPS improvement contributing $0.03. Growth includes $0.04 of restructuring savings, as well as $0.03 of year-over-year corporate expense headwind. And finally, lower share count contributed a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter. Now let me provide more details for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $619 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 13%. U.S. revenue increased 7% but Europe declined 7% overall. I further summarize our revenue performance as follows: Test applications were up 4%, posting growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. I'll note that based on performance to date and expected growth on fourth quarter, this platform is on track to achieve record full year top line performance; transport was up 3% overall with noteworthy regional differences. In the U.S. we continue to see strong performance in industrial transport applications, including mid-teens growth in dewatering; in Europe, the business was down low single digits primarily due to lower book-and-bill activity in France and the ramp down of the AMP5 cycle in the U.K. Finally, treatment revenue was down 15%. This decline reflects the lower deliverable project backlog in the U.S. and Europe that we had entering the quarter, and the timing of projects in emerging markets. While we delivered minimal revenue growth overall, perhaps a more important result was our strong orders performance. For the third quarter, we booked orders of $680 million, up $63 million or 10% year-over-year and 11% on an organic basis. During the fourth quarter, Water Infrastructure has a total backlog of $656 million. Of this amount, $380 million is scheduled to deliver in the fourth quarter, an increase of $27 million or 8% relative to a year ago. The balance is scheduled to be delivered in 2015 and beyond. For the third quarter, we're reporting operating income of $97 million and operating margin of 15.7%. Performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reductions, which totaled $29 million, including approximately $7 million in restructuring savings with the balance coming from sourcing and lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 3% as well as unfavorable price and mix. Let me now turn into Slide #7 to address our Applied Water segment. We delivered revenue of $362 million, up 1% year-over-year. Regionally, we saw growth come from the U.S. and emerging markets, which were both up 2% overall. Europe, however declined 1%. By application, building services grew 2% and industrial water was flat. Irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, was down 2%. I further summarize our revenue performance as follows: In the U.S, we generated broad based growth across both commercial and industrial water applications. Our emerging market performance was driven by mid-teens growth in China and was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe and Latin America. As I mentioned, Europe was down overall as weakness in residential and general industrial markets was partially offset by strength in commercial. Operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 14.6% year-over-year, a record level for this segment. Cost savings from sourcing and Lean Six Sigma and to a lesser extent restructuring, increased margins by 440 basis points and more than offset inflation. We also saw a positive lift from volume and price. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $529 million at the end of Q3, with approximately 90% held outside of the U.S. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while also enhancing shareholder return through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 3 quarters, we invested $77 million into capital expenditures and we returned $201 million to shareholders. This includes the 10% increase in dividend per share and $130 million under our share repurchase program. We also generated $176 million of free cash flow, largely reflecting higher income and lower CapEx spends. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $104 million, with free cash flow conversion increasing to 77% from 45% last year. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2014 guidance.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. So let's start with the top line. We anticipate 2014 revenue of approximately $3.9 billion, which reflects organic growth of 2% to 3%. For Water Infrastructure, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. And for Applied Water, revenues will likely be flat to up 1% organically. I'll remind everyone that the revenue range already reflects the reduction in revenue attributable to the U.K. Valves business we divested and now also reflects approximately $30 million of unfavorable foreign exchange translation that we expect to impact our fourth quarter results. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.6% and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.2%. We are pleased with the execution of our broad-based restructuring actions this year from which we expect to achieve savings of $17 million. This adds to the carryover savings of $25 million from actions executed in 2013 and brings our total savings to $42 million. Excluded from our overall results is 2014 restructuring and realignment cost of approximately $40 million to $50 million, $11 million gain on sale of our U.K. Valves business and special tax items. So overall, we now anticipate delivering earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.98 and I would highlight that our mid-point guidance remains unchanged at $1.95. Mike is going to walk you through the full year and fourth quarter details in a few minutes but first, let me provide some additional highlights around our end market outlooks. Please turn to Slide 10. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market representing 45% of total revenues, through the first 9 months, organic revenue was up 3%, slightly better-than-expected driven by strength in the U.S. and emerging markets. For the full year, we expect revenues to come in toward the high end of a 1% to 3% range. This assumes continued growth in the U.S. and emerging markets and that conditions in Europe do not deteriorate further. Public Utility at 34% of total revenue is our second largest end market. Through the first 9 months, organic revenue grew 3%, reflecting strong emerging market performance and stable maintenance of repair activity in the U.S. and Europe. While we do expect some organic growth in the fourth quarter, there is potential risk for delays in some project schedule to ship before year end. With that said, we have adjusted our full year expectation for Public Utilities to 1% to 3% from our previous outlook of 2% to 5%. 1 final note on Public Utilities. Given the positive third quarter order performance and the current view on our project pipelines, we remain positive on this sector in 2015. Moving to commercial, which represents approximately 11% of our revenue, we are maintaining our full year outlook, which calls for flat performance year-over-year. In addition to the flat year-to-date performance, this outlook reflects growth from new product launches and an improving outlook for our U.S. business offset by weakness in Europe. There is also no change to our residential market outlook. We continue to expect low single-digit growth, driven by the U.S. housing recovery, partially offset by continued weakness in Southern Europe. And lastly, at just 3% of our business, we expect full year agricultural revenues to be flat year-over-year. So the takeaway here is that we continue to see mixed market conditions particularly by region. U.S. non-res markets have shown signs of improvement. Public Utility OpEx remains generally stable and the CapEx environment appears to be incrementally better. We are, of course, closely monitoring Europe. So please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Mike to cover some additional details on the guidance.
Michael T. Speetzen: I'd like want to spend a minute calibrating on the evolution of our full year guidance. In February, we issued a guidance range of $1.85 to $2.00 with a mid-point of $1.93. This past July, we raised the low end of our guidance by $0.05 and the related mid-point by $0.02 to $1.95 reflecting strong first half performance, slightly offset by the divestiture impact of the U.K. Valves business. Given the significant decline in the euro, we are taking into consideration a $0.01 headwind for foreign exchange translation on the third quarter and a $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange translation in the fourth quarter. Despite this headwind, we are maintaining our midpoint guidance essentially offsetting the negative impact from foreign exchange with additional productivity. Now let's talk about the fourth quarter. We expect revenue of slightly more than $1 billion, with organic growth in the range of 1% to 4%. Let me cover some of the key assumptions we have made relative to our revenue projection. We have assumed the U.S. dollar to euro foreign exchange rate of $1.27. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the U.S, down low single digits to flat performance in Europe and emerging market growth of more than 10%. We entered the quarter with a total of $504 million of shippable backlog, which represents approximately 49% of our expected fourth quarter revenue. This highlights the fact that we still have a fair amount of book in term business to deliver in the quarter. There are 2 other items I'd highlight with respect to our guidance. First, fourth quarter operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. And second, fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $183 million. With that said, please turn to Slide 12 and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some final comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks again, Mike. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and encouraged by our continued progress. Solid execution has us on track to deliver on our financial commitments for the year which includes generating record revenue and earnings per share. At the same time, we continue to focus on building those important capabilities that will enable us to extend our track record, deliver sustainable growth and increase shareholder value. Despite a year of tremendous change at Xylem, our teams have remained focused on the future, identifying ways to work more efficiently and more collaboratively to leverage our full suite of products and services to our customers. This work will continue and I firmly believe that will elevate our performance across Xylem and will help us to build our position as the global leader in water. Operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing environment. It wasn't something that you covered in that prepared remarks there, but I know that's been a headwind recently, seems to be stabilizing a bit, especially in Applied Water, but if you can just talk to us about kind of the pricing dynamics.
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, Ryan, let me at least cover some of the financial implications. In the third quarter, we saw about 10 basis points, which is pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter. In a way I characterize it is Water Infrastructure continues to see price pressure in the neighborhood of about 40 basis points negative year-over-year. Applied Water, we've continued to see positive progress. They are reflecting about half a point worth of positive pricing. I think many of the dynamics that we've talked about in the past are still there and I think they were evidenced by many of our peers who reported that sales are still not at the levels that they have been historically, which means that we've got excess capacity and that's putting significant price pressure across the marketplace, as we see it today.
Michael T. Speetzen: And I would only add, Ryan, that I think it speaks to what we saw in Applied Water and I think we're going to see it elsewhere, is all the more reason is critical that we continue to ramp up our new product development pipeline. We've brought a number of things to market. We've got a number of things in the pipeline but anytime you're able to do that, it gives you something new to talk about, it gives you a competitive differentiation and is very helpful on the pricing side.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I guess the related follow-up would be as you look at this nice order growth you had in the quarter, are we to assume that those orders reflect the kind of price dynamics you just mentioned, Mike, pressure in the Water Infrastructure side and some positive -- modest positive momentum in that order boards on the Applied Water side?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, think in general, those will be the general characteristics that we would see and as we indicated, the order growth is predominantly in the Water Infrastructure segment. It's not only the core pumping business, for example, but we're also booking more of the project business which is a more difficult one to give you commentary on the pricing side because each one of those tend to be unique in nature.
Patrick K. Decker: And I think it's important to call out, Ryan, that of the 8% organic orders growth that we had in the quarter, roughly 3% of that was from a couple of the big projects that we announced in the emerging markets over the course of the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So could we just talk about a little bit about what your visibility of the 2015 is right now? Obviously, you made some positive commentary on the 2015 environment for your Public Utility side. Maybe if you could just take us a little deeper look on what you're seeing from a customer base at the end of next year? What the commentary looks like and what gives you confidence in that public Utility side?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure, right. Let me open with a few comments here and then Mike can kind of walk you through specifically what we do know about '15. I mean, I'd say, first of all, it is tough in this environment to assume or make any specific predictions at this stage. Obviously, with the typical kind of slowdown in Europe in the third quarter, it's tough to kind of draw a read in Q3. It's really from September and October and as we close out Q4, so how we close out Q4 is going to play a much bigger part in how we determine or formulate our views around '15. I would say that we are certainly planning from an internal standpoint around a low growth environment, really want to make sure we keep our teams focused on driving the productivity for growth and the cost efficiencies. We do see some mixed bright spots that are out there. Certainly, the growing backlog that we've seen, some of the longer cycle projects that we brought into the pipeline are encouraging but I say it's too early to tell right now in terms giving you read on '15.
Michael T. Speetzen: Mike, and I gave you some of the specifics where we do at least have a beat on both headwinds and tailwinds as we head into next year. I think given where the foreign exchange rates are, and I'll use the euro because it's our biggest exposure. If it's at about $1.27, we think that's going to be about a $40 million top line headwind and pose about an $0.08 EPS headwind. The reason being is we have an awful lot of profit held in the euro currency that goes through our Switzerland headquarters over in Europe. Pension, we anticipate a couple of cents worth of headwind and that's anticipating what the discount rate could be, as well some of the mortality tables that have been updated. But the good news is we have carryover restructuring savings. So the actions that we've initiated in 2014, we're picking up some of that benefit that Patrick spoke to in his prepared remarks. We should pick up about an incremental $20 million worth of savings in the first half of next year.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then the follow-up is, if you look at the Applied Water margins, can you just talk about the sustainability of those levels whether or not there was any stocking benefits you guys saw from the new product launches and what the right run rate on a forward basis looks like?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I'd say there's certainly would have been a little bit of a stocking benefit but not enough to really move the needle. I'd say we certainly do feel that the margins in that business are sustainable. I mean when you think about the fact that the team has achieved that level of improvement despite being in a no growth environment and in some cases, actually facing headwinds, that is a business that also levers nicely whenever we see some topline growth. I actually think with the new product introduction that we're bringing onto the market right now, that's going to return us to growth in that business and I think you'll see some nice leverage fall through. So we'd expect to continue to see margin expansion in that business as we return to growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: When we were down at WEFTEC this year, we heard some pretty positive outlooks from people there on the project side in the U.S. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market and maybe a little bit about globally as well?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, Nathan, I think we're seeing that show up in our results and I'll give you just a bit of a preview around our Americas region. We saw positive orders growth. In fact, they were one of the largest components of the 8% that we saw within the quarter. The treatment business, specifically, was up, call it in the low 20s, and that's, I think, indicative of the commentary that we've given in the past, which is we've seen that market has significant headwinds over the past couple of years. This year that dynamic appears to be changing. I think for us the question is how much is dealing with pent-up project demand versus new growth and projects coming online. I think that's the piece that continues to be in the forward look that we have. But overall, I think it's a big part of why overall, we remain positive on that sector.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Just focusing in on treatment there. Obviously, some pretty negative revenue comps in this quarter, which is from weak orders historically. When do we lap that and start seeing growth based on what's already in your backlog?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, I would anticipate us -- there'll be some lapping as we get into the first half of next year. But if you think about the nature and the timing of these projects, these can be anywhere from 12 to 18 months. So it will be more of the second half of 2015 is what I would anticipate. We obviously still have a lot of work to do to build the details up. We're in the middle of our planning process right now, so we'll provide more perspective on some of those linearity details when we provide guidance in February.
Michael T. Speetzen: And the good news on this, Nathan is that in a number of cases, part of the reason for the revenue decline was push out of projects. So the projects haven't gone away. It's just the timing has shifted to the right. So that should help us as we get into '15 as well.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And just a follow up on Europe. Down 6% in this quarter, outlook for down low single digits in the fourth quarter. What you see is the risk there to actually just achieving that low single-digit rate with what we're seeing in Europe at the moment?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, Nathan, if I look at what we had in the third quarter, the 6% down, there was a good portion of that, that related to projects that's pushed out of third quarter into fourth quarter and into first quarter of 2015. So we've got a pretty good idea of what the book-to-bill rates are. The backlog levels as we go into the fourth quarter support the range that we've given and we are anticipating that we will have a little bit of weakness in our book-to-bill business. What I can tell you is that we have been monitoring our results, obviously, on a weekly basis. October is lining up consistent with the assumptions that we have built into the guidance. So we haven't seen anything at this point that tells us anything different is going to materialize.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.
James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Seems like you're a little bit ahead of plan as far as gaining traction on your cost take out or your better efficiencies versus your plan entering the year. Can you -- if I'm correct, can you kind of highlight where exactly you're, I guess, accelerating or the sources of that incremental margin benefit versus where we were anticipating the kind of cadence for 2014 or earlier in the year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, there were few things that we did, Jim. One is we've obviously, taken the restructuring savings up. That is a direct reflection of the fact that given some of the weakness we saw earlier in the year, the teams move out more aggressively to make sure we were getting the actions in and picking up additional benefits. I would say that we continue to have a hard-pressed around areas like Lean Six Sigma and our global sourcing as areas of opportunities and that continues to play well for us, as the teams are working hard, given some of the ambiguity we've had in the top line and some of the jitters we've heard in the market. That's been the appropriate action response from the team. So we're seeing a lot of that play through.
James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And as far as M&A if you can give -- give us an update on how your pipeline is looking, valuation in the -- in your targeted areas and I guess, a timing update as we enter 2015 just a couple of months from now.
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, I would say that first of all, we continue to cultivate the pipeline. I mean, we certainly lifted the pause on M&A so certainly, the last few months, after my arrival, the teams have been fervid about developing that pipeline again. The good news is these are all targets that we had in the pipeline for a while that we've stayed close to, so the pause didn't hurt us there at all. We do expect to be active in 2015. Of course, the timing is less predictable in terms of when we would actually be able to pull off. We've said before and I would stand behind that, that we will be looking to target about 2% to 3% of our total revenue in terms of size of acquisitions. That's our target. We continue to actively cultivate that. The acquisitions that we would do through '15 would likely be bolt on, kind of close to the core and then really begin focusing on developing that pipeline into '16 on some of the larger scale, maybe adjacency type of acquisitions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital market.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Question on your comments about ramping in China and the Middle East. I'm wondering if you can say a little bit more there about what kind of investments you'll have to make to make that happen. How much you think that can move the needle for you and if you can give us any sense of timing on when we might start to see some of that?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. Let me start by saying that even with the intensified focus on China and the Middle East, we certainly would not be looking to go outside of our CapEx range of between, say, $120 million, $130 million per year. So we've got opportunities by way of which we've kind of reprioritized our deployment of capital internally. Doing it much more as the one company approach as opposed to a collection of businesses and that's spurring up some capital to put behind some of these more focused plays like a China and the Middle East. In terms of the type of actions that we are already working on and putting in place and that will continue through '15, is a heavy focus on further localization of things like product design, our R&D capabilities locally, building out key account management capabilities. We've got some great relationships with customer there already that as we began to really market to them the full portfolio of capabilities that we've got beyond just the Flygt pump as an example. They're really driving a lot of demand for that. But in many cases, we don't have the localization requirements to be able to meet that. So it's really going to be a more a matter of investment of management time and attention than it is financial capital, per se itself. In terms of when we expect to begin seeing real benefits from that, I mean obviously, we're already growing nicely in these markets, but we're going to be setting a much more aggressive, ambitious kind of target for ourselves relative to market growth in those areas, and I would certainly expect to see the benefit of that begin to come through in late '15, into '16.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And just a follow-up, you also mentioned I think more of a general comment about rebalancing the portfolio in new product introductions. Can you just say a little bit more there, how much more aggressive are you getting there because that's been part of your initiative for some time.
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, see so we spend today anywhere between 2.5% to 3% of our total revenue on R&D and I don't envision that in the near-term, that number necessarily changes very dramatically. Obviously, over time, here you heard us talk about productivity for growth mindset, which is all about how we do get at the next 200 to 300 basis points of revenue of cost out of the system, so that we got the flexibility where we need to, to put that money back into innovation technology, system development, et cetera, but that's going to be over a multiyear time frame. In the immediate term, it's really been a matter of reprioritizing where the teams are investing their R&D dollars. We do believe with a heavier focus on emerging market growth as well and building local capabilities in the design standpoint. We'll actually get more bang for the buck in terms of every dollar that we spend and obviously as we grow the top line, by definition even holding our percentage constant in terms of R&D, is going to put more absolute dollars of investment into the system. The last thing I would say on that is one of the capabilities that we are focusing on building right now that we don't have consistently across the company is what we call industry vertical marketing capability, where we sit with our customers and really understand the full suite of what their water challenges are and then map that against what our current offering is and then fill those gaps either with new product development, could be business model innovation but it can also inform our M&A pipeline in terms of where we want to fill the gap.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Another nice quarter for the dewatering business mid-teens. Can you just walk us through where you're seeing pockets of strength there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Overall, the business was up kind of mid-single digits. The U.S. is where we saw the significant performance in the teens. And it was really related to oil and gas. I mean all the underlying markets seemed to be doing well with the exception of the mining market, which is down kind of low single digits. But the oil and gas area has continued to be robust for us as we've expanded throughout the U.S. and that's really been the driver of the growth.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: And just as a follow-up, maybe you could talk about oil and gas exposures for the company as a whole, with crude coming down. Are you seeing any impacts there?
Michael T. Speetzen: At this point time, no. We've got about $200 million to $250 million of exposure and it's relatively broad and I would say on the natural gas side, that's where we've seen probably the biggest pickup, but even of the crude side, we haven't heard much in terms of pullbacks. So things have held relatively stable there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: A couple of -- on the SG&A side, can you provide us a little bit of color in some of the headwinds you may have faced from the CRM and some of the other initiatives? I mean, you had great cost control but what were some of the offsets?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, couple of things, David. I mean, we're down year-to-date $32 million from where we were last year, almost couple of hundred basis points and it's been primarily around the G&A side where we've gone from being kind of mid-9% down to under 9%. The continue focus for us, is we try and drive the efficiency in the business, obviously, some of that's coming from the leverage of the top line and the balance is really coming from some of actions that we've taken. As it relates to the quarter, I would say that we saw a more typical corporate level spend. I assume that's kind of what's underneath the question that you have. There's really 2 dynamics there. One, if you remember last year, third quarter we were coming off of a pretty bad performance in the second quarter and so we had taken a significant number of actions to defer cost initiatives within corporate. Then you have on the other side of that, this year we had deferred things out of the first half. If you remember some of our commentary around concerns over the weakness we've seen in January and February related to the weather and we essentially green lit a number of those initiatives. So CRM a prime example. It's not a significant amount of outlay. You're talking about something that's in the $1 million, $1.5 million range, but in totality, we were essentially moving forward given that we've gotten more comfortable with the top line environment.
Patrick K. Decker: And I would just add to that, I mean, I think, as I look at where we are as a company, an organization right now, there's clearly an opportunity to continue to drive business simplification and drive operating efficiency and that same approach is going to be applied to our corporate cost. Now as we standardize certain things, integrate certain things, ERPs, et cetera, you may see some cost shift around between the segments and corporate but the goal is to reduce SG&A further overall as a company. I would also say that when I look at the capabilities as a company that we need to augment, ISS opportunities like simplification where we are going to be organizing differently here in the very near future where we'll be organizing our global sourcing and our lean deployment differently to drive better standardization across the company. Second of all, I talked about the need to improve our Xylem wide focus on innovation, really increasing our focus on disruptive technologies as well as better coordination amongst all of our different businesses, so we would be organizing differently around that. And then third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to do a better job of getting voice to the customer and really augmenting our capabilities around certain key industry verticals and so there will be some moves we're making on that front as well. All of those together in my view will be with the spirit of driving and approach as 1 company and drive operating efficiency and growth.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then one follow-up, if I may, on the inflation front. It seems relatively high versus what we're seeing on a global basis and maybe you can provide some color on where you're seeing the inflation?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, there's couple of things, David. One is you have to remember that we have the pay increases included, so we're not including just the material inflation, we're including labor inflation in that calculation, as well. And I would say that there are pockets where we're definitely seeing a reduction and we've seen inflation coming down. We're now sitting around 2.7%, 2.8%. I can't point to any specific item. I'd say things have, for the most part stabilized. We're not seeing any significant movements up or down at this point. And as we look forward into next year, we think the levels are going to be pretty consistent with what we're seeing today.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: So when do you start to lap the labor inflation?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, we continue to give increases every year. So you've got third quarter -- I'm sorry, first quarter of lapping, but you're essentially lapping what you've done in terms of pay raises that go effective at the end of the quarter.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I mean, so there isn't really any from your perspective a catch-up that you implemented early on, I mean you're just going along?
Michael T. Speetzen: No this is just typical merit increases that we do each year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Partners.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Mike, actually the first one for you, actually just going back to FX. I was surprised as far as the impact you noted for 2015, $40 million of revenue and $0.08 of profit. I know you mentioned something about that, so little -- maybe a little bit color on that. I mean the $0.08 hit on $40 million of revenue, it's almost like a 40% margin fall through on that. It just seems extraordinarily high. I don't sense that we had that type of dynamic in the past. Is that new and is there something kind of changing the sensitivity to FX? Or is it -- maybe just touch on that a little bit more.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. Well, we definitely saw it play out in the third quarter and we anticipate it in the fourth quarter and the commentary around next year, again, using the euro is a proxy because we obviously want to see how rates settle out and bake that into the final guidance that we'll provide in February. But the long story short is as we've discussed in the past, given the structure that we have in Europe, there's a significant amount of our profit that goes through Switzerland and that is a euro-denominated functional currency. So when we translate that profit back, it is at about a 40%, 45% drop rate. So on that $40 million worth of revenue, again, assuming about $1.27 U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, that's going to convert over and give you about $0.07 to $0.08 headwind from an EPS standpoint.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And there's nothing to suggest that -- that's the same on both sides of the coin, correct? I mean -- either way, it's not that sensitive. If we see a strengthening of the euro, it's going to work the same way the other way. I just want to make sure.
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. Absolutely.
Michael T. Speetzen: Absolutely.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. The other question I had was -- actually just around just more cost savings. So you're expecting another $20 million to carry over into '15. Maybe just talk about where you think we are, how much more low hanging of fruit exist if you want to put in innings, type of analogy, but how much more obvious restructuring is there to do versus just kind of growing the business and getting savings through leverage?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I would say that the analogy of low-hanging fruit, I wouldn't suggest it's low hanging. So I think everything we do at this point in time is going to be have to be strategic around where we look to drive efficiency, redeployment of capital and cost, and so that's really the work that we're doing right now as we finalize our plans around 2015 is what more is out there for us to get in '15 and even in '16 and '17. So I would say -- I would characterize it that we are in the middle innings at this point. I think the teams have done a good job of executing the restructuring over the last year and a half. As I mentioned earlier, I do believe that there's another couple of - few hundred basis points of cost as a percentage of revenue that could be taken out of the system over time. But again, that's going to be a multiyear journey. I think you'll see some steady progress against that in '15 and '16. But again, we'll have more to say on that in the February earnings call.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: But just to be clear, I mean, that couple of hundred basis points, is that going to be driven by additional restructuring or is this going to be top line leverage to get there?
Michael T. Speetzen: It's going to be a combination of the 2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to talk about orders a little bit. So second consecutive quarter over $1 billion. That's a nice number. We've seen some big orders out of emerging markets in the last couple. So just wanted to get your sense on the sustainability of that kind of run rate in terms of orders and outside of those big project wins, kind of where have you seen the geographic breakdown of the remaining orders?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, let me maybe touch on the geographic breakdown first. Definitely the emerging markets continue to be strong for us, places like China and greater Asia, specifically as we've seen continued project wins and those bookings have maintained robust. I would say that in the Americas per some of the comments that I made earlier, we've seen strength pretty much across all of our water infrastructure lines, primarily around treatment, so obviously a good indicator of some of the project activity and things starting to at least stabilize and pick up going into next year. Europe has been a bit mixed. The transport side of our business was positive in the third quarter. The other elements were essentially flat to down. And I'd say that's going to be the area that we're going to be spending a lot of time and making sure that we're keeping an eye on. The other areas seem to be holding up well and at this stage we think that the way we've got the teams aligned, the opportunities, the project funnel that are out there, they're getting a bite at all the appropriate opportunities.
Michael T. Speetzen: I would only add that when you look at our emerging market revenue today, roughly 20% of our revenue comes in the emerging markets and what I would say is that's obviously, a great area of opportunity for us. You've heard us talk quite a bit about. I would caution as you saw in the quarter that these larger projects that come through can be lumpy, in terms of timing. And we'll certainly do the best possible way that we can to make sure that we're keeping it clear and clean for you, so you understand what the base business is versus the larger project wins.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. So emerging markets about 20% of revenue. I'm assuming that they've been carrying bigger weight over the last couple in terms of orders, right?
Michael T. Speetzen: I mean, look the Americas were up double digits in the Water Infrastructure segment in the third quarter. So we certainly have seen in some of the developed regions. That said, emerging markets have been very strong for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel of Morningstar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: So most of my questions have been asked already but just one question on future divestment opportunities and what potential you see for further areas to sell off some of your businesses to improve your overall business mix?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. We've done a pretty exhaustive review of the businesses that we've got. The team has done a good job by the time that I was arriving early this year on mapping out the historical growth profile, the returns on capital of each one of the businesses, the incremental returns on capital, all the things that good allocators of capital look at when we're making investment decisions or divestiture decisions. And I would say other than the U.K. Valves business that we divested here recently, there's really nothing of any meaningful value there that I would say of size and scale that you should expect to hear from us on. I mean we'll continue to always take a hard look at some of the smaller businesses in the portfolio but there's nothing really there right now. I would say, right now we are very much focused on the acquisition side of the house.
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Partners.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just 1 point of clarity. On Page 5, in a key performance drivers, you talk about volume price mix and other being 180 basis points headwind, yet in both the segments, both of those buckets are tailwinds in the quarter. Can you just explain the discrepancy between that? Am I just reading it incorrectly?
Michael T. Speetzen: I think the biggest part, Brian, is going to be the corporate cost. It's about $6 million, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks that puts us back at more of a typical run rate versus what was a very low level worth of spend last year.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker: Great. Well, thank you, everybody. I appreciate your -- we appreciate your continued interest in the company and in following us. Look forward to catching up with you in early February to discuss our fourth quarter results and provide our overview on 2015 outlook. So thank you, all and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Xylem Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Phil De Sousa: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Speetzen. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's quarterly results and discuss the full year outlook for 2014. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. [Operator Instructions] We anticipate that the call will last approximately 1 hour. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xyleminc.com. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight on August 13. Please note that the replay number is (404) 537-3406 and the confirmation code is 66840967. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Presentations. All references today will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated. The non-GAAP financials are reconciled for you in the Appendix section of the presentation. With that said, please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Now, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, we announced our second quarter 2014 results. In a moment, I'll give you some headline comments and share my perspective. I'll then provide an update of our 2014 goals and some additional color on my observation since our last call. I'll then turn it over to Mike to share more details on this quarter's performance before I cover our full year outlook. So let's get started. I'm proud of our teams and encourage with what we achieved this quarter. Despite mixed levels of recovery in our key end markets, revenue growth was up 4% organically. And coupled with the execution of our cost savings initiatives, drove an operating margin expansion of 220 basis points, a 33% improvement in earnings per share. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue and earnings growth, as well as margin expansion. Second quarter orders were just over $1 billion. Now while the headline organic growth registers 1% in orders, the overall total is a new record, passing the previous mark set during the last year second quarter. As a result, we also exit the quarter with record backlog with just over $800 million, up approximately 8% versus the prior year. Just a few additional comments. Relative to last year, we have a 5% increase in backlog that is shippable in the second half of this year and a more impressive 18% increase for next year. I'm encouraged by these results but I also must point out that some of our end markets remain challenged and are still slow to recover, and our business remains predominantly short cycle. All of this adds up to the fact that we still have a lot of work to do to deliver 2014. Beyond the short cycle business, we are continuing to focus on building our longer cycle backlog. As an example, we recently won a bid for a $9 million water filtration system which will address the critical water shortage in São Paulo, Brazil. This is exciting because it's the largest award we have ever won in the region and it's a referential win with an important key account for us. We believe we'll be able to do more to help address the significant water crisis Brazil is facing and we expect there will be more opportunities in the country for Xylem. In the Middle East, we had another referential win, a $7 million order to expand and upgrade existing ozone systems at the Tubli wastewater treatment plant in Bahrain. These are just 2 examples of the opportunities that we think are plentiful in emerging markets. We intend to find and pursue these opportunities and expect that the breadth of our product line, the service proposition we offer and the skills and support of the Xylem teams will help us to bring in many more of these pipes and significant project wins. I'm generally pleased with the performance we're seeing in emerging markets but I firmly believe the opportunity is greater. During the quarter, I spent 2 weeks visiting several customers and our facilities and management teams in Asia. I left very encouraged by the prospects of our businesses there. It's clear to me that there is far more opportunity to grow our business and more opportunity to localize manufacturing and research and development, which will ultimately drive innovation which can support the local markets, but can also be leveraged globally. Experience tells me this does not happen overnight. It's a multiyear process and I am excited by what I see and by what I believe what lies ahead for us. Tonight I leave for South America where I will spend the next week or so meeting with customers and will be assessing and evaluating new opportunities in that region. With that said, let me get back to the quarter. Second quarter revenue was just over $1 billion and includes favorable contributions across most regions, including 11% organic growth in emerging markets. Now let me give you some color as to how the quarter progressed. We started with flat year-over-year revenue in April, which was short of our expectations. As a result, the team focused on ensuring we would deliver every scheduled order we have on hand, working hard to reduce delinquent shipments. And as the quarter progressed, we did see some market improvement and also ended up seeing some business shipped in the second quarter that we originally expected deliver in the third quarter. No heroics or big projects to note specifically, but rather a strong focus and execution by the teams. Operating income increased 28% year-over-year and operating margin expanded 220 basis points, reflecting strong incremental margin performance and the significant impact of cost reduction actions. We generated free cash flow of $50 million, primarily reflecting higher income and typical seasonality. Finally, on the capital deployment front, we opportunistically repurchased an additional $50 million in common stock bringing our full year repurchases up to $100 million and our total return to shareholders up to $147 million, including dividends. To wrap up the second quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.48, up 33% over the prior year. And as you already read this morning, we are raising the lower end of our EPS guidance reflecting both our first half performance and our outlook for the second half year. We will cover this in more detail on the call. Now turning to Slide 4, before Mike covers off more details in the quarter, I'm going to take a few minutes and talk about how we're doing on the 2014 goals we outlined, as well as some strategic priorities that will ultimately improve our business over the long-term. Our results continue to show we are moving the company in the right direction. Based on our first half performance and outlook over the balance of the year, we are on track to deliver our 2014 financial commitments. We expect to achieve nearly $4 billion in revenues. In terms of operating income, we expect margin to improve to the 13% range and expect EPS in the range of $1.90 to $2, which would represent 14% to 20% growth. We continue to make progress around integrating our commercial front-end, and while we still have much work to do to optimize our structure, I am confident that over the long-term this investment will help us accelerate and achieve above market growth. We also continue to make progress on our portfolio and capital deployment processes. Creating shareholder value requires a balanced and disciplined capital deployment strategy. Earlier this month, we announced the divestiture of our U.K.-based oil and gas valve business for approximately $30 million. This transaction resulted from a continuous portfolio review process. I think it is well understood that this is a good business, but it was not scalable within our portfolio. And over the long-term it would compete for valuable capital and human resources with other parts of our business that are more aligned with our core strategies. So it made sense to sell the business, and given where we are in the cycle, the timing of this transaction maximizes shareholder value and allows us to invest even more in organic and inorganic growth opportunities that are more attractive and strategic to Xylem. We continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure. I believe, we can realize more benefits and will increase our productivity by developing stronger global strategic sourcing and Lean Six Sigma capabilities. We are working to build a mindset and a culture centered on continuous improvement. This is not just about the opportunity inside the 4 walls of our factories, but across all aspects of our value chain and business. But that's easier said than done. It will take considerable time to make this a cornerstone of our business. We are already making progress beginning with global sourcing. I believe, that by centralizing this function, we'll be able to move faster and drive more savings. So, as a first step, we've just hired a global strategic sourcing leader whose sole focus will be to optimize the savings we can achieve by leveraging the consolidated global purchasing power of the entire company. As I said, this is a first step. We will also be further centralizing our continuous improvement efforts and leadership to ensure that we have the right people, processes and tools in place to drive productivity to new levels and to help facilitate the change management programs that are required to accelerate this and make it sustainable. We need to be consistent and confident in our decisions and focus on our execution. So I'll wrap with the same message that I delivered to you last quarter. It's not lost on me or any of my team that we faced and continue to face significant challenges, but I am convinced that we are well on our way to overcoming them. I don't expect that road ahead will be entirely smooth nor should you. But I am excited about the direction we're heading, confident in the future and very excited to be leading this team. So, with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated just over $1 billion in revenues, up 5% from the prior year and up 4% on an organic basis. From an end market perspective, we saw strength in public utility and industrial, partially offset by commercial. The public utility end market was up 7% driven primarily by continued infrastructure investment in emerging markets. Europe was also up, thanks to a healthy northern region coupled with a relatively easy prior year comp. U.S. was flat year-over-year. Industrial was up 5%, with growth across most regions. It's worth reminding everyone that we serve a wide variety of industrial customers and that we supply this market with applications from both of our segments. As expected, the largest contribution from this segment was attributable to growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. While we are excited to see solid growth posted in our 2 largest end markets, we were, however, disappointed with a 3% decline in commercial. The trend here remains the same, given our overweight position in the U.S. institutional building market. Here, we continue to see pressure as construction and the recovery continue to lag the broader commercial market. I'll cover off more specifics by segment, but generally speaking, we saw strong growth from emerging market up 11% with modest growth of 3% and 1% in Europe and the U.S., respectively. Operating income of $125 million was up $27 million or 28% over last year and operating margins increased 220 basis points to 12.4%. The second quarter's performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. Cost reductions totaled $39 million and including approximately $12 million of restructuring savings, with the balance coming from sourcing and Lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 2% and unfavorable price and mix within our Water Infrastructure segment. Incremental margins were 60%, including the benefit from restructuring and unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding these items, incremental margins were still strong at roughly 40%. Solid top line and operational performance, coupled with strong execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.48, up 33% versus the prior year and slightly better than we original anticipated. More operations drove the year-over-year EPS improvement, contributing $0.13, driven by organic volume growth combined with execution on productivity and cost management, including restructuring savings of $0.05. Now let me provide more detail in each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $636 million, up 7%. We experienced organic growth in all of our applications. Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets which were up 16%. We also posted mid-single-digit growth in both Europe and the U.S. Let's summarize our average revenue performance as follows: transport revenue was up 6% driven by public utility infrastructure investment across most regions and dewatering strength in the U.S. This was driven by an increase in hydraulic fracturing rental and related services and an increase in general demand for dewatering equipment. Treatment revenue was up 15% due to emerging market strength and the timing of project deliveries. Europe was also up, driven by demand for biogas mixers ahead of the exploration of certain German government incentives. Finally, test was up 5% driven by growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Operating income of $82 million was up $19 million or 30% over last year and operating margins increased 230 basis points to 12.9%. Performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reductions, which totaled $26 million and included approximately $9 million of restructuring savings with the balance coming from sourcing and Lean initiatives. Also offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 2% and unfavorable price and mix. This was a considerable headwind driven by lower dewatering rental for disaster recovery activities like Superstorm Sandy, and increased project deliveries in emerging and developed regions. Finally, I would note that foreign exchange also negatively impacted operating margin by 40 basis points. Let me now turn to Slide #7 and talk to our Applied Water segment. While revenue was up 2% overall, organically, we were down 1%. Regionally, we saw growth in emerging markets more than offset low single-digit declines in the U.S. and Europe. Let's summarize our revenue performance as follows. Building service applications declined 2% due to continued weakness in the commercial building market, specifically within the institutional building sector as I mentioned earlier. Our European residential business declined double digits due to continued market softness in the South. Weakness was Europe is also partially offset by growth in the U.S. residential market, which was against double-digit growth last year. Finally, I would highlight that continued strength in China drove modest emerging market growth against what was also a tough comp last year. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.4% year-over-year. We were able to offset volume declines through disciplined cost management and restructuring savings. Now let's turn to Slide 8 where I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $450 million at the end of Q2, with approximately 80% held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. Our net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 26%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Over the first half of the year, we invested $48 million in capital expenditures and we returned $147 million to shareholders, which reflects the 10% increase in dividends per share and $100 million under our share repurchase program. Over the first 6 months of the year we generated $50 million of free cash flow. This reflects typical seasonality and working capital dynamics, which include an increase in receivables due to the timing of Q2 sales and certain projects, and increased inventory ahead of second half ramp and revenue. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $48 million. Please turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2014 guidance.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. Let's start with the top line. We still anticipate 2014 revenues of nearly $4 billion, which reflects organic growth of 2% to 4%. We've increased our organic growth range at both the low and high end via a percentage point of growth. For Water Infrastructure, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, higher than our previous expectations and primarily reflecting higher project revenue in emerging markets. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues to be flat to up 1% organically reflecting our first half performance and soft end market outlook. This reflects a slight downward revision to our previous guidance. I will also note that the revenue range already reflects the reduction of revenue attributable to the U.K. valve business we divested. After posting 3% organic growth through the first 6 months, we expect second half organic revenue to be flat to up approximately 2%. This range takes into consideration the relatively short cycle nature of our business and mixed strength in our end markets. It is important to note that our second half performance will be against tougher year-over-year comps. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.2% to 14.6% and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.8% to 13.2%. And we anticipate earnings per share of $1.90 to $2, excluding 2014 structuring and realignment cost of approximately $40 million to $50 million. This reflects a $0.05 increase to the lower end of our range. Let me provide you with some perspective on this. We feel good about the execution of our broad based restructuring actions this year, in which we now expect to achieve savings of $17 million. This is in addition to the carryover savings of $25 million from the actions executed in 2013, bringing total savings to $42 million. We also feel good about our first half performance and have reflected our outlook for the second half, which include some mixed end market dynamics, lower benefits from FX and the U.K. valve divestiture. Now let me provide some additional highlights around our end market outlook. Please turn to Slide 10. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Let me spend a few minutes providing some perspective on our first half performance, our expectations over the second half and what that all means from a full year perspective. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market, representing 45% of total revenues. Through the first half, we saw organic revenue up 3% and expect second half performance to be up low single-digits. Full year organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1% to 3%. Included in our second half expectation is sequential growth acceleration in the U.S. and continued growth from emerging markets. We are also assuming that Europe remains stable. Public utility, at 34% of total revenue, is our second-largest market. Through the first half, we saw organic revenue up 6% and expect second half organic performance to moderate considerably. This reflects tougher year-over-year comps and the timing of project deliveries. With that said, we expect second half revenue to be flat to up low single-digits, and therefore our full year expectation is in the range of 2% to 5%. This outlook is improved relative to our original expectations and reflects the positive performance realized over the first half and our project backlog over the balance of the year. As a reminder, due to the considerable lead time for most CapEx projects, the majority of project orders received over the second half of the year will deliver in 2015 and beyond. I would highlight that leading indicators and market commentary suggest improving market conditions, which is supported by our growing pipeline of projects. Moving to commercial, which represents approximately 11% of our revenue. We are revising our full year outlook for commercial downward. While we originally expected low single-digit growth, we now anticipate flat organic revenue performance. The revision downward reflects our first half organic revenue decline of 1% and only a modest improvement in the back half. Our overall performance reflects our overweight position to the weak U.S. institutional building market. We no longer expect this sector to recover meaningfully in 2014. We do expect new product launches and strength in emerging markets to drive low single-digit growth over the second half. There is no change to our residential market outlook. We still expect low single-digit growth driven by the U.S. housing recovery. However, we do expect that growth in the U.S. will moderate over the second half and that continued weakness in Europe will at least offset second half growth. And lastly, while it's only 3% our business, we expect full year ag revenue to be flat year-over-year. This is down slightly from our previous expectations. Please turn to Slide 11 and I'll turn it back over to Mike to cover some additional details on the guidance.
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Patrick. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call, around what we would expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2014. I'll begin with some comments around our shippable backlog. Of the total $860 million of backlog, $643 million are shippable in the second half and the remaining $173 million is expected to ship in 2015. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $445 million and represents around 45% of our expected third quarter revenue. We still have a lot of book-and-turn business to deliver in a quarter when Europe is on holiday. For revenue, we see the second half profile more similar to 2011 and 2012, down sequentially in the third quarter with a ramp up in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we expect revenue to decline in Q3, 2% to 3% sequentially from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of European shutdowns in July and August, and a typical second quarter peak within our Applied Water segment. By segment for Q3, we expect Water Infrastructure to be flat sequentially and Applied Water is expected to decline sequentially approximately $30 million. Again, reflecting it's typical seasonal profile and the impact of the valves divestiture. Operating income performance over the second half will be driven by volume and incremental cost improvements in areas such as global sourcing and Lean, but will also be negatively impacted by mix and price. We see third quarter margins improving sequentially from the second quarter by 80 to 130 basis points despite the expected volume decline. This performance reflects the savings we expect from the restructuring action executed earlier this year. We're now on track to deliver $42 million in restructuring savings, which includes approximately $20 million of savings in the second half. By segment, we expect the sequential margin improvement to be more pronounced in Water Infrastructure than within Applied Water. We expect full year corporate expense of approximately $55 million and our full year operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. Lastly, our fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $185 million. With that said, please turn to Slide 12 and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some final comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, again, Mike. Just a few comments before we get to Q&A. As you know, this year is a critical one for Xylem. We have begun to establish a track record of financial performance, while also focusing on prospects to long-term growth. While we still have a lot of work to do, I am encouraged by our performance to date. We're making progress and our improving our productivity and efficiency. We have many growth opportunities pursue and we're doing the hard work now to be able to take advantage of the best ones to grow our leadership position in the world of water. Operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to -- I mean, there's a few things I want to dig into and I'm guessing that there's enough questions in the queue that you'll get to it, but can you talk a little bit about public utility in the U.S.? I mean, it's still flat against pretty easy comps, and is there an outlook there? And I talked to some of the local guys, they say there's pent-up demand for projects and such. But are you seeing anything that's tangible, that would lead you to believe that, that business gets better?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Scott, this is Mike. There's a couple of things going on. If you remember from some of the commentary we had last year, we actually saw a decline in the, what I'll call the longer term bookings for our treatment business, project business in the U.S. last year. Essentially, we see that carrying through in the current year shipping results. The good news is we are seeing the project activity picking up and so we're starting to build backlog in that business. And less about just the U.S., but overall, if you think about that backlog heading into 2015, we're up 18%. And we look specifically at Water Infrastructure, were actually up 22%. So that's very good indicator that things are at least starting to move in the right direction. The pipeline of bid and quote activity is at an all-time high. So it's clearly that there is definitely activity start to move from a U.S. standpoint.
Patrick K. Decker: And I would just add to that, Scott, what I'm also seeing, and we're seeing, is that as we integrate our front of the business, I would say our Treatment business is one of the businesses probably benefiting the most in terms of getting more at bats through the visibility to our transport and other businesses provide to them by now have integrated front-end. So our bidding activity on the pipeline is also improving.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I wanted to ask you guys about M&A. I mean, when I think about legacy -- well, over the years, this business when it was within ITT you always talked about M&A. But M&A was always a little disappointing, I think, and there hasn't been a lot. I think the volume of transactions overall and this side of the businesses has been pretty light. I mean, how do you reinvigorate it and how do you -- and say, reactivating M&A pipeline? I mean, how do you do it when you're limited really to the concept of water, if that's -- I'll just leave it there.
Patrick K. Decker: Sure, no problem. I spent considerable amount of time with the team, reviewing the pipeline. It is a pretty healthy pipeline from my perspective and based on what I've seen. As you know, Scott, it is a severely fragmented industry. I think we've said that, certainly, we're not going to be dogmatic on water. I mean, obviously we want to make sure that we don't stray from our identity here. And so now that we've defined our 3 fields to play, that being water productivity, water quality and the resiliency of water infrastructure. Those are 3 pretty broad spectrums in the space of water and that also opens up the opportunity to fill the pipeline. I do expect that, certainly early on here, the acquisitions that we do are going to be bolt on. They're going to be close to the core. And then obviously, over time as we continue to expand, that brings into play more meaningful acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was hoping to get some additional color on what I would call your high-quality problem of explaining how organic revenue growth sort of coming at the low-end of the range that you said back and they came in at the high-end. And, Patrick, you did give some good specifics, but just give us -- in context, you've got shorter cycle business although more limited visibility. So, through April, maybe that's 30% of the quarter if you made that announcement. So what are the other dynamics in terms of -- did you look at -- can you quantify how much business got pulled in from July is -- did you just convert more orders at the time, into revenues? And what does it say about your forecasting on a go-forward basis?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Dean, this is Mike. Let me provide some comments and then Patrick can certainly weigh in. I think there's a couple of things. One, we were providing perspective on what we're seeing, and at the time, April was coming in essentially flat with where we were last year. And I'd say that the short cycle nature of the business obviously does create a bit of a challenging dynamic from that standpoint. And I think we hit some of the points, in the prepared comments, that as we progress through the quarter we start to see the market improve. Not substantially, but just enough to move us into that higher end of the range that we've been talking about. But more importantly, I think, what you saw from us is the same thing the you've seen in for the past several quarters, which is we have much deeper visibility into the business now. The change that we made, organizationally, we are now dealing directly down, say, at the dewatering level or the treatment level. We're able to react more quickly. And so Patrick and I came back from seeing the April results and really push the team around, making sure that we were cleaning up any of the delinquent shipments that we had, making sure that we were converting all the orders that need to be shipped in the quarter. There wasn't anything large, notable, that we pulled in, per se. But I would say that the team worked hard to make sure that we met the commitments that we had laid out.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is this the calibration that book and ship is about 70% of your business, 30% project? Is that a fair...
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I'd say, right now, Deane, it's probably 70% to 80%. And obviously, as we see the longer term orders improving, that dynamic's going to start to ship probably call closer to that 70% mark over time. I'd say the short cycle nature of the things like our rental dewatering business, those still weigh pretty heavy on the results in our areas where -- we try to stay as close as we can. We've developed some new processes for monitoring what we would term backlog in those businesses, to give us better indicators around what the trajectory looks to be, but they're still short cycle in nature.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then just in terms of the businesses, what I thought was very interesting in your release, you talk about this win in Brazil. And it's noteworthy on a number of points. Importantly, maybe give us some context, are these types of whole-system high-end project bidding that you'd like to do more of? And I'm pretty sure I heard Patrick call it a referential win. And does this qualify as a reference site? Maybe some of the economics, when you're putting in one of these reference sites, because it becomes a showcase with the ability to do similar projects elsewhere. So a little color there would be helpful.
Patrick K. Decker: Sure, Deane, these actually are the kind of things we would like to be involved in. I mean, you find -- and from my background and experience, certainly, in the developing markets, our customers and clients do tend to look at -- I wouldn't call it a complete turnkey solution, but certainly looking at bundling, services and technology. And I think that's where we've already seen some of the biggest impact on the integration of our front end. I would say that, in a number of those markets. The front end of our commercial organization has long been integrated and so they've been working together for some quite some time. These are long processes you can appreciate to come to closure and win a victory. We call it referential, I think, because these are key accounts. We don't share too much on the customer specifics and economics for obvious competitive reasons, but these are healthy projects. They bring with them a very attractive aftermarket service component to it as well. But more importantly, it demonstrates that we've got the capability in these emerging markets, when we focus on them. And secondly, it helps build the Xylem brand name. Not that we were always leading with that brand name in all cases, but it certainly increases our recognition of our brand in those developing markets.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And that membranes, is that part of the joint venture with GE?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes it is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I had a question for you, Patrick, on kind of the portfolio review in the U.S. I guess, the fact that you're moving on to South America kind of suggests that some of your initial tour in the U.S. is done. Can you kind of give us your comments and perspective on how you believe the company's positioned in terms of the U.S. manufacturing footprint and whether you're satisfied with where you're at there, whether you believe there are consolidation opportunities domestically?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. I think that, over time, this is a multiyear journey where we're trying to integrate a number of legacy standalone businesses. And I would say that we've, historically, probably not had a comprehensive manufacturing strategy across the various businesses that we've got, whether that be in the U.S. or whether that be globally. And that is an area that will be of focus for me and the team, to better understand what those opportunities are from our supply chain, globally, But certainly, specifically here in the U.S. as well. And I think, as I talk a lot about the emerging market opportunity, which I think is large and real, at the same time, that's not to suggest that we don't also have meaningful growth opportunities in the more mature established markets. I think there's an opportunity for us to drive more improvement on the aftermarket piece of our business. It's not as applicable to all of our businesses, but certainly some of them has a very attractive aftermarket opportunity, that I do believe that we fully mined. And then I would say something that I've spoken a lot about and that is I see, consistency across the company, there are further opportunities for Lean deployment, certainly here in the U.S., across not only our factories but the entire value chain.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then another kind of more tactical question on pricing environment. I'm hearing less about it in your prepared remarks than we were 6 to 12 months ago. And I guess we can read that as a positive that the pricing environment has improved a little bit or at least isn't negative. Can you kind of give us an update on pricing environment out there and the outlook?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Ryan, it's Mike. We're still seeing what I'd say is a negative bias from a pricing standpoint, more particularly in our Water Infrastructure business. Applied Water is still in a positive territory, although not at the same levels, and I'd say a good portion of that's really more commodity pricing-driven. But I would say that the dynamics really haven't changed a lot. I mean, I think you can hear it with many with our competitors that the markets are improving, but we're all still in a much more slow growth environment than we have historically been and so that competitive dynamics are such that it's still putting a negative bias on pricing. You're not hearing a lot of it in our prepared remarks because it's in line with expectations we had of somewhere in the 25 to 50 basis points of pressure coming out of that particular segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So could you help frame the sourcing opportunity today? Where it stands on a percentage basis, what kind of targets you might be putting out there. Or maybe better put, who are you looking at from a peer group perspective and what kind of ranges do they have from a guidance perspective? So we can see kind of where you think you guys can go over time.
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. I think it's probably too early to tell right now exactly, to put a number out there as to what I think the global sourcing opportunity is. I think that it's probably better to talk about the journey as to where we're coming from and where we're going. We certainly don't want to suggest that there's never been any kind of leverage gained across the businesses. But each one of the value centers and the businesses in them had historically operated on a standalone-basis, in terms of having their own procurement functions. And we have a number of categories that, clearly, if we leverage our global spend here, there's meaningful upside to be gained in doing that. Secondly, it's not just about the cost takeout but it's also about getting better quality, better service, better delivery from our suppliers. So really, again, it's the whole value chain from a sourcing standpoint. I think there are a number of companies that are out there, obviously, that we model against and put ourselves up against, as a benchmark. Certainly, the Danahers of the world, the Ropers of the world, a few others that are out there that I think have been on that journey and have delivered quite a value by standardizing their process across areas, including procurement.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's fair. On the dewatering side, a couple of things there. Just, one, what kind of rental utilization levels are you guys seeing now or at least how those have tracked as you look to the quarter? It sounds like the oil and gas piece, in particular, starting to strengthen up here. What's the customer cadence sound like and what's the trajectory look like as you look out a little bit farther?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Mike, the cadence has been improving pretty much starting back in late February and we've seen that continue now through the second quarter and obviously continue to monitor that. Utilization rates, they're not about at the what I call the peak yet. And that's a broad comment because we have, obviously, model mix within that, that we continue to watch. But I would say we're getting up around that 50% mark, which is pretty close to getting the optimal and so we'll be moving into the decision around what additional assets do we need to contemplate, which would be a good thing to start talking about.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on the dewatering business. Can you talk about how much of that was up in Q2 and whether June, in particular, was stronger than you would've thought? I mean, what your expectations are for the back half.
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. So, Matt, we saw dewatering kind on a sequential improvement. Like I mentioned when I was answering Mike's question, we've seen that kind of improving month-to-month. In the second quarter we were up 4% and that brought our first half up, call it mid-single-digits, and that's vast improvement over the anemic growth that we had in the first quarter. And we see that trend continuing and we're optimistic, given the strength we've seen in hydraulic fracturing and just, overall, what looks to be a rebound in construction and use in the public utility market did support that continued growth through the balance of the year.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then with respect to the Applied Water business, I guess, whether you talk industrial, commercial, residential, maybe speaking with those 3 buckets, you've been sort of down here in this business for a little while, organically. And it doesn't sound like your construction oriented business is picking up yet. I guess, what can you say the sort of give us conference that you're not losing market share in these businesses?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, well, as you probably know, these businesses, market share data is not always easy to get. But certainly, all of the indications that we've got right now, we've been asking ourselves that question with the teams, is that actually when you look at some of our other -- companies that have reported in this space, if anything, we've probably certainly held. If not, even possibly gained some ground, especially in areas like groundwater, et cetera. So we don't really comment on share positions and really comment on our competitors but we certainly don't have any reserve, right now, to believe that we've lost any share.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And, Patrick, just one final one. Similar to how you talked about your U.S.-based footprint, what's your initial appraisal of the manufacturing footprint you guys have in Western and Northern Europe?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. Well, again, I think it's early assessment. I think that one of the areas that is fairly apparent to me and that is, certainly, when I think about the needs that we had to be able to accelerate our growth in a number of the developing markets, there's only so far that we are able to go by relying upon, in some areas, an import model. And so we already have some footprints in summary development markets but I would say we will expand that footprint over time. And then obviously, over time, we'll evaluate with our needs are from a global supply chain and make the changes necessary at that point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: On the quoting activity on the muni side, I guess you're focus on U.S. and Europe. Just curious as to how competitive that's been. I know in Water Infrastructure you say price has been a headwind. So when you say quoting activity picking up, does the level of competitiveness there seem to be exacerbating pricing pressure?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, I mean, I'd say it's a fair characterization of the market. I wouldn't put the pricing pressure as a huge dynamic at this stage. I think the competitive environment is certainly there but I think folks are being smart about the pricing dynamics. I think what it's -- that, coupled with the fact that commodity prices have been relatively tame over the past year, really has lowered our ability to get additional price. But I think the important thing to remember is we're still priced at a premium relative to the competition. So we're getting the growth, we may be losing a little bit on the pricing side, but overall it's still a pretty positive equation for us.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then on the restructuring side, you mentioned the savings you expect for the full year on top of what you got last year. So where we at as of 1/2. And I'm not trying to pin you down for next year kind of guidance, but this year you're saying we're talking about 20% or so EPS growth on around 4% revenue, a lot of restructuring savings. How would you categorize, broadly, what your expectation is? Would next year be characterized more of our revenue driven year or a more of a restructuring cost out type of year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so let me answer the more tactical side and then I'll let Patrick provide a perspective as we look forward. Through the first half, we've incurred about $18 million worth of restructuring cost and the savings that we've racked up is about $22 million and a big portion of that $22 million was actually the activity we had underway last year. For the second half, we're guiding around $20 million of savings, and that's largely due to the actions that we've taken through the first half, relative to that $18 million of cost. I would think about that, going into next year, as probably about an $18 million to $20 million tailwind as we lap and pick up favorably essentially in the first half of next year and the actions that we will have executed. And then, Joe, just to remind you, we are guiding $30 million to $35 million of total restructuring cost this year. So you can see that we have all ways to go on the second half, $17 million. But with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for any comments relative to -- as we look out to next year.
Patrick K. Decker: Sure, yes. Obviously, staying well short of giving any kind of guidance or signal for '15. I think, certainly, we are very much focused on how do we accelerate the growth of the business. Obviously, that will not be at the expense of margins. We're looking at healthy profitable growth. And so, certainly, we're making sure we're making the investments there to drive the top line. Secondly, we will continue to maintain the focus on the cost side and the margin side. While, I would never rule out restructuring, our focus right now, really again, is on ramping up, again the continuous improvement opportunities in global sourcing and Lean. So we certainly would expect margin expansion to continue from those areas. It's going to be a balanced look as we go forward from '15 onward.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And if I could sneak just one fast one in. If M&A, if you don't find anything attractive in the second half, would that imply potentially more repurchases, I think, levels we've seen in the first half?
Patrick K. Decker: I think it's premature, right now, for me to comment on that. I mean, certainly, we feel good about the return to shareholders that we've already committed to. And we'll have more to comment on that as we get further along on the M&A assessment. Obviously, M&A opportunities, you could fully appreciate, take time to cultivate. And so, us having the kind of reignited that, it may take a little bit of time but we feel good about the prospects and we'll have more to comment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So Patrick, we've been talking about several things here that are probably going to take some investments. Ramping up on Lean and Six Sigma. We've talked about 200 basis points potentially of SG&A coming out. You talked today about localizing manufacturing global sourcing investments. Can you talk about whether we should be expecting some increased CapEx over the next year or 2 and what impact might we be seeing on the marginal line as well?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. I think that one of the things that we're very much driving here, in the company right now, is kind of what I call a productivity-for-growth mindset. And that is, again, given where we are in our Lean deployment, global sourcing, some of the other construction benefits we're getting from the actions taken. These are all intended not only to expand margin. What you're seeing, obviously here in '14, will continue in '15 but part of those savings go to fund some of these investments that we're talking about. And so I don't think that we should be looking at any kind of delusion in margin. As we go forward we will continue to expand margins, as well as continue to accelerate the top line growth, assuming the markets cooperate.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And if we could just take a look at -- specifically on Lean Six Sigma. With what you've seen since you've been at the company, can you talk about where we are in terms of Lean deployment and how long you think it's going to take until you're at a reasonable level?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. I think that the way I would characterize it is we've got pockets of excellence right now, across the company. And I think that's clearly a reflection of the fact that these businesses, historically, had been, I think, early adopters of Lean Six Sigma, other continuous improvement tools. And my assessment, and I think the assessment of many of the people in the company, is that during the transition of the spin, other things going on, some of those things began to fade. I think, historically, the focus have predominantly been on inside the 4 walls of the factory. So very much focused on cost takeout, et cetera, in the factories themselves. I think the opportunities here are not only to now reignite that in the factories, but more importantly to apply these tools across the entire value chain. So speed to market efficiency, transactions, back-office, but also using these tools to help us get at what our overall global manufacturing strategy's going to be. And so I look at this in a bigger picture rather than just applying Lean within any given factory. And that to me is where the big opportunities lie.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: It makes sense. Could you possibly quantify, you said pockets of excellence, kind of what percentage of the portfolio you'd describe is excellent and what percentage of the portfolio you think needs a significant amount of work?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes, it's a tough one to say because we've got such a distributed footprint across the board. But I'd say -- the way I'd characterized it, I'd say, probably at about 1/3 of the locations that I've been to, I've seen a pretty heavy adoption of classic tools being deployed. I think the whole point of continuous improvement in Lean is that it is a journey. So it never ends and you're always kind of revitalizing and refreshing things. So there's opportunities all over the place, but I think that there's probably still 2/3 of the organization that I think are still fairly early on in the whole process.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Just a follow-up on that last question. So, even with some additional spending that you may be planning for productivity and footprint and other things, is it still the way we should be thinking about this in terms of incremental margins, that we ought to normalize into something in the low 30s as we get out beyond the second half of this year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I think so, Kevin. I think, largely speaking, we want to hold to the guidelines that we've provided around the incrementals, as well as when think about our capital expenditures, we've post 2.5% to 3% of revenue. And we may have one-off investments that we have to make and we'd obviously provide clarity around that, but we think we can largely handle it within those guide posts. And it's back to Patrick's comments around productivity for growth and making sure that we've got an engine that can produce the room to make the investments to keep the growth going.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And the first half was of course very strong, up around 60%, and we all know that'll normalize. But can you just give a little more color on the incremental margin guide for Q3? It looks like that's actually doing more than normalizing. It's quite a bit below the normal range.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I think, when you think about third quarter, sequentially we're going to be down 2% to 3% from a revenue standpoint and we're actually expanding margins 80 to 130 basis points. And that's largely due to the fact that we've got the incremental restructuring kicking in, in the back half. But we're also driving additional sourcing and Lean initiatives to try and improve the gross margin as we head into the back half.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. So there there's some additional spend that's happening on things like sourcing and Lean that wasn't happening at the same magnitude in the first half?
Michael T. Speetzen: There's a little bit. I mean, you can see it, and I'll use the corporate line as an example, we've guided to a $55 million full year corporate number, which slightly above the run rate coming out of the first half. So, given the weakness we saw coming out of January and February with the weather, we obviously, like we did last year, we took some actions to move things around within the year. Given where we're at, we feel confident that we can move forward with those initiatives in the back half. I think, Kevin, the important thing to note when you compare -- whether you're looking at Q3 versus last year or the second half versus last year, you have to really look back at 2013, first and second half, because they were really a tale of 2 different halves. That first half of last year, we were looking at a negative 5% growth rate and pretty heavy decremental margins in areas like Europe and dewatering. The second half of 2013, not only did we have positive organic growth, which we got volume leverage out off in areas like Europe and dewatering, but on top of that, we got the positive benefits of all the things we had done in terms of the restructuring actions that improved us incrementally from first half to second half year. So there is a bit of that compare that plays into it. And then you have the challenge that we're facing in the back half of 2014, which is primarily around things like pricing and then the timing of the investments throughout the year.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And Just finally, Mike, since you mentioned the corporate line, that's tracking in the first half well below the guide. Is it still a $55 million to $60 million outlook you have there on that line?
Michael T. Speetzen: $55 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Actually, just coming back a little bit to the Applied Water line. I mean you talked about the markets just being generally difficult but you're not losing share. Just on residential, I mean it doesn't seem like that ever really got off the ground very significantly at all and now you're saying that it's still going to be fairly flat. I mean, is it just the nature of the business that it's more replacement that never really went away? Or why is that not strong or maybe give a little more on why it has never saw any benefits through the kind of the upturn of that cycle.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Brian, I guess I'd point back to some of the stats. I mean, first and foremost, we actually saw 6% growth last quarter in the residential market. And if you look at the last year, the second quarter, we actually posted 6% growth. So some of it compares and timing in the cycle. But I'd also say we're not as exposed to all the new construction and some of the things that are driving the improvement in the residential market. The majority of our business is really focused around ground well and circulator pumps that go on boilers. So it's bit of a more nichey play but we have seen some of the positive effects of the residential recovery overall. And I think you've seen that play out in different quarters throughout the course of the last couple of years.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, then just on the commercial side. I mean, so it's weak kind of in the near term. But do you anticipate you will participate if that starts to gain traction or is it a similar type of dynamic?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, I think we'll participate, but again it's going to be driven by a couple of different things. One, the institutional market, specifically, in places like the U.S. And we think we're aligning well in emerging markets, China in particular, to take advantage of what could be the resumption of the commercial build-out.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And I just wanted to clarify, did you quantify the revenue pull forward for the project shipments this quarter? I know you talked to it. I didn't hear a specific number, unless I missed it.
Michael T. Speetzen: No, there wasn't anything notable or material that we would point to.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: A couple final ones. Going back to some of the metrics on Lean, maybe on time delivery in the last quarter, you've improve it. Does this mean that this is an sort of an on -- your on-time delivery numbers have improved moving forward. Is this something structural that you did or was this sort of an urgent effort to ship out everything? That's one, and then two is if you can talk about some of the Lean metrics about which we should measure outside of the 4 walls, particularly on the SG&A side going forward. I mean, what sort of productivity measures shall we be looking at?
Michael T. Speetzen: Sure. On the first one, I would say this is, right now, pretty much brute force in terms of just people focusing on making sure that delinquencies are managed and handled, and so I wouldn't suggest there was any kind of big enhancement of Lean deployment that drove that. That's certainly a long-term activity. Although, again, some of the businesses that were experiencing this are fairly far along in the Lean journey. So I wouldn't insist it was all brute force, but largely so. In terms of metrics that are out there, not prepared to disclose any just yet. I mean, certainly, a little bit further down the road here, I'll speak more openly and candidly around what are those big metrics that we're going to be measuring against. There will be some classic ones in there, and obviously -- certainly, as we go after further improvements in the area of SG&A, and particularly SG&A, that will certainly be one of those metrics that we're focused on. The others are very much focusing on what our penetration, in terms of our certification rates, are as well as the deployment of resources on active projects. So we're fairly far behind in that as a starting point. But again, as I mentioned before, the good news on this, from a company standpoint, is that this is not a foreign language for many people in the company, it's just a matter of reinvigorating the focus and deploying it beyond the 4 walls of the factory.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, Patrick, given your background of highly engineered products, in the aftermarket side you hit upon it. What do you need to do? Maybe, first of all, what is the number, today, with which you're working in terms of aftermarket as a percentage of total sales? And what number do you want to get to and what do you have to do to get there from an investment standpoint? Do you have to invest in some of those emerging markets, a la Brazil, and setting up the infrastructure there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Sure, it's a great question. And I'll have more to say here in future calls, on exactly, again, what these goals and metrics are and some of the structural moves that we would be considering taking here in the organization to get after that. I mean, today, we do just below 40% in aftermarket, if you consider with the parts, the service, the replacement piece. That number, in my view, certainly needs to be higher than that. It's not just about the percentage itself and the profitability that you get in that business relative to the OEM. But it's also just the intimacy that you get with the customer, by being in there with them and getting visibility of what's happening from a competitive standpoint, as well. And so I think that what we need to do in the area is obviously set some big goals and metrics, make sure that we're organized effectively to get at that. Right now, again, we do it very well in pockets, depending upon which value center that we're talking about. And then secondly, I would say a big piece of this is making sure that as we go into ramping up our presence in some of the key emerging markets, you want to make sure -- we want to make sure that we really maintain control of our installed base and that we're also selling aftermarket as part of the initial sell rather than try to chase it afterwards.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker: Well, I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. We very much appreciate your support and interest, and I look forward to catching up with you and updating you on our progress in our next call. So, between now and then, safe travels and we'll talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you, this does conclude today's Xylem Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Now please to turn to Slide 3. And I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, we announced our first quarter 2014 results. In a moment, I'll give you some headline comments and perspective on the quarter. I will then share some perspective on what I've seen and heard thus far, since join the company 6 weeks ago, and then I'll turn it over to Mike to share more details on the quarter and our full-year outlook. Given the slow start to the year, which was driven in large part by severe winter weather conditions in North America, the team certainly closed the quarter strong and delivered a solid performance. Heading into the last month of the quarter, we understood it would be critical to drive hard to recover from the slow January and February to get back on track. I'm very pleased with the way the team embraced the challenge, particularly during a CEO leadership transition and challenging market conditions. During the quarter, orders and revenue grew 3% overall and organically, with strong performance coming from emerging markets. We entered the second quarter with backlog of $793 million and 2014 shippable backlog of $679 million, which is up 6% year-over-year. We continue to invest for growth. During the first quarter, we spent $27 million in R&D, up 4% from the prior year and we expect those spend levels to continue through the year. And we see prior year's investments in product development paying off. For example, sales of Flight Experior embedded with new smart run technologies grew approximately 50%. This demonstrates the continued adoption of smart technology and flights capability in market-leading product development. Additionally, our investment in MultiTrode is also a driving growth. For example, we just recently completed the release of our Multismart Controller in 12 additional languages, enabling us to expand sales of this line to approximately 20 new countries. Just as critical are our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, such as the $18 million of restructuring and realignment costs in the quarter, targeted at reducing our overall cost base. We'll see the benefit from those actions in the latter half of the year, and we continue to realize significant savings from the actions the team completed last year, which resulted in a 150 basis point improvement in operating margins in the first quarter. To wrap up the first quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.34, up 26% over the prior year. Free cash flow is negative $3 million, primarily reflecting typical seasonality and working capital dynamics. We are confident in achieving our full year free cash flow target of 100% conversion of net income. Finally, on the capital deployment front, we increased our first quarter dividend by 10% and opportunistically repurchased $50 million in common stock. We will cover some of my initial observations since joining the company on the next slide, but I'll highlight one message I've already stressed: The importance to get off to a good start, which in my view is key to delivering on the full year commitments. So we're off to a nice start, headed in the right direction and have laid a strong foundation for the rest of the year. Thanks to the entire Xylem team worldwide for getting us off on the right foot in 2014. Now turning to Slide 4. I'll turn it over to Mike to cover the first quarter results in more depth in a few minutes, but before that, I'd like to share with you some of what I've seen and learned so far and what my early-stage priorities are for the business. One of the things that attracted me to Xylem in the first place, beyond the opportunity to be part of something that has the potential to make a big difference globally, is to be part of a young company with a tremendously bright future. That makes Xylem unique. We have a lot of experience to leverage within our business and it's important to me to tap into that experience, to listen and learn and to use that knowledge to help shape our future. Let me give you a sense of where I'm focusing my attention, as I settle into my new role. After joining on March 17, I convened a set of briefings on key strategic topics with Steve Loranger and the team. These meetings were crucial for me to get an even deeper perspective on the business and to make sure I thoroughly understood our financial commitments and the actions necessary to deliver them. And I want to thank Steve Loranger once again publicly for his tremendous leadership and sacrifice during his tenure as the CEO and for the very smooth transition he has worked hard to provide me. Now I was excited to hit the road and develop an early sense for the strengths and opportunities in our business. Over the course of the first month, I visited more than a dozen locations in 5 countries. The sci-fi visitor represents some portion of all of our business lines and cover more than 20% of our global workforce. I'll be visiting more sites in the next few months with a particular focus on a number of our key emerging markets. While pushing hard to get to know the business and our people, my primary responsibility, of course, is to direct our performance. As we move to the second quarter, it's critical that we stay laser-focused on driving our performance, but we meet the targets we have set. So let's move on to recap what we have to do in 2014 because there is much more still ahead. We need to maintained and grow the confidence of our investors in Xylem by delivering on our commitments. So let's start with our financial commitments. In 2014, we must generate top line growth and at the same time, improve our operating efficiency and align our cost structure to be more competitive. For the year, we expect to achieve nearly $4 billion in revenues. As you already know, we are a company that addresses challenges around the entire cycle of water. The world is changing rapidly, and the world's problems related to water productivity, quality and resilience are changing too. It's exciting to think about our potential to take our innovative products and services and our strong relationship with our customers and solve these new and evolving water challenges. To do that, we will need to continue to drive productivity that will enable further investment in innovation and our people in order to capture new growth opportunities. In terms of operating income, we expect margin to improve to the 13% range. This would result in earnings per share between $1.85 to $2, as we previously guided, and would represent somewhere between 11% and 20% growth. To make or exceed our 2014 operating income goal, we need to execute on our initiatives in Lean Six Sigma and get the maximum leverage more global strategic sourcing capability. I am a big believer in the returns we can see from Lean Six Sigma. I've seen it work. And the benefits go well beyond productivity, and we shouldn't think of lean applications as only for the factory. Every business and every function within Xylem can and will benefit. We want to achieve a high level of incremental efficiencies. The great thing about the progress make in this area is that it sets us up to be more efficient and competitive. Improvements in our cost structure that carry to the bottom line will certainly have a positive effect, not just on 2014, but on 2015 and beyond. In addition to our financial goals, we have a few other top-level priorities for the company this year. Among them, optimizing our integrated front-end to accelerate our growth and improve our sales force effectiveness. It is one of our most important initiatives. It's a big lever and it will enable us to present a more informed, more focused, single face to our customers and allow us to cross-sell our portfolio of leading products and services. Integrating the front end and implementing the associated sales force effectiveness tools we're putting into place like a customer relation management system, is no small task for a company with our geographic breadth. But it will enable us to significantly raise our game in the market. Next, under the umbrella of advancing and institutionalizing high-performing organization culture, we're reigniting the Xylem Management System, or XMS. We want to drive this disciplined approach even further into the organization, carving out and standardizing our key business processes, ensuring accountability and alignment. This helps ensure that we move seamlessly from strategy to execution. Next is rebalancing our portfolio and our product investments to ensure that we've got the right allocation of resources in the areas that we think will create most meaningful value. We could be more disciplined in our allocation of financial and human resources. This is about investing our money and our time where it matters most, focusing on increasing return on vested capital and enhancing long-term shareholder return. And I believe in benefits we can realize by developing stronger, global strategic sourcing and Lean Six Sigma capabilities. There are companies in and out of the industrial water space of similar size and geographic footprint that do this really well. We're not one of them, at least not yet, but we will be. Moving beyond our financial and operational objectives for this year, there are 3 top focus areas, ways of doing business, if you will, that are very important to me. I shared these in my Day 1 message to all employees and want to speak about them again briefly to you as well, so you understand what's most important to me. These 3 concepts can be applied to any businesses, but I believe they are particularly applicable to our company. The first is putting customers at our center. To me, this means listening to customers, understanding them and even anticipating their needs. A lot of companies say they do this, but not all of them do it very well. I often times used the expression keeping our center of gravity squarely around the customer. I know many of Xylem's employees share that same view because I've seen that firsthand over the last few weeks. But we must capture the voice of our customer and integrate it not only in how we sell to and service our customers, but how we tie the voice of the customer into how we innovate, and further expand our portfolio of products and solutions. The second area is investing in our people. We have very talented people around the world, with expertise and devotion to solving our customers' most critical water issues. We are a recognized market leader because of our people. But more than having expert individuals, our power comes when we operate as a global team, leveraging everyone's important role in what we're aiming to accomplish. I believe in empowering our people to do their jobs. This empowerment includes providing the right training development, as well as honest and constructive feedback around performance to goals. But most important, I believe in providing an environment that ensures everyone's safety. In my experience, strong safety performance almost always coincides with good employee engagement, which ultimately translates into strong financial performance. The third area involves driving for peak performance. This bears repeating, Lean Six Sigma or Continuous Improvement works. It's important that we embed all these tools in what we do every day. Equipping our people around the world of continuous improvement skills will be a key part of our training and development efforts. It's not lost on me or any of my team that we have faced significant challenges, but I am convinced that we are well on our way to overcoming this. I don't expect that road ahead will be entirely smooth nor should you. But I am excited about the direction we're heading, confident in the future and very excited to be leading this team. So with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and full-year guidance in more detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenues of $906 million, up 3% from the prior quarter. It's worth noting that we're comparing the first quarter of last year, where we experienced 7% organic revenue contraction. The public utility industrial and residential end-market showed strength relative to poor performance last year. The public utility end market was up 5%, driven by continued infrastructure investment in emerging markets and while we did have some sizable projects deliver in Europe and the U.S., customers remain focused on operational expenditures and small project activities. Growth of 1% in industrial stemmed primarily from emerging market demand, including the delivery of several projects for the power market in Korea and heavy industry in China. While the commercial market came in flat for the quarter, residential continues to demonstrate growth, up 6% over the prior year, driven by growth in both the U.S. and emerging markets. I'll cover up more specifics by segment, but generally speaking, we saw strong growth from emerging markets, up 18%, modest growth of 1% and the U.S. was down 1%, most significantly impacted by weather. We delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $94 million was up $16 million or 21% over last year, and operating margins increased 150 basis points or 10.4%. The first quarter performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. Cost reductions totaled $31 million and included approximately $10 million of restructuring savings and the balance coming from sourcing and Lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of nearly 2% and unfavorable mix due to lower dewatering rental revenue, which stemmed from the severe weather conditions experienced early in the quarter. Incremental margins were 59%, including the benefit from restructuring savings and unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding these items, incremental margins were still strong at 42%. EPS expanded 26% to $0.34, better than we anticipated, driven by favorable revenue performance and accelerated cost actions given the slow start to the year. Core operations drove the year-over-year EPS improvement, contributing $0.10 driven by organic volume growth combined with execution on productivity and cost management, including restructuring savings of $0.04. Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $568 million, up 4% organically. Additionally, we had 1 percentage point of growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange was a 2-point headwind. We experienced organic growth in all of our applications, with transport up 3%, treatment up 9% and test up 5%, year-over-year. Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 24%. Europe was positive, up 2% and slightly better than our expectations, but was more than offset by the U.S., which was down 6%. I'll summarize our revenue performance as follows: Growth was driven by Water and Wastewater infrastructure investment in emerging markets, for example, China, which was up more than 50% year-over-year. Increased demand for mixers and project deliveries drove mid-teens treatment growth in Europe that was partially offset by the slow recovery of the U.S. CapEx market. Test was up 5% for the quarter, driven by project shipments into the emerging markets, such as a $3 million order to Brazil's national water agency, ANA, our largest analytics delivery under this region to date. In addition, test had 2 large shipments to China's Ministry of Environmental Protection. And lastly, our dewatering business was down low single digits, as we lapped a tough compare with Superstorm Sandy and saw the negative impact to our rental business due to the severe weather in the U.S. Operating margin increased 80 basis points from 9.4% to 10.2%, due to increased volume and cost reductions. Restructuring savings of $7 million, coupled with sourcing and Lean initiatives, more than offset the negative effect of inflation, unfavorable mix due to weather impacts on our rental business and foreign exchange. Let me now turn to Slide #7 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 3% overall, with organic growth at 2%. As you can see, building service applications grew 2%, driven by strength in the U.S. market. Irrigation, while relatively small, was up 7% and industrial water was flat year-over-year. Regionally, we saw growth across the U.S. and emerging markets which were up 3% and 6%, respectively, while soft market conditions continued in Europe, which was down 4% for the quarter. I'll summarize our revenue performance as follows: Growth was driven by continued strength in U.S. residential and agricultural markets, while industrial projects in residential investments fueled growth in emerging markets, such as Asia Pacific and the Middle East. While we saw a low single-digit growth in our U.S. commercial building services business, we were flat overall with weakness coming from Europe. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points from 12.2% to 13.2%, year-over-year. Margin improvement was driven by volume leverage coupled with the favorable impact of cost reductions. Although price was positive, we continue to see downward pressure given current market conditions. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintained a strong cash position with the balance of $466 million at the end of Q1 and approximately 71% held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. The net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 26%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balance capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested $25 million into capital expenditures, and we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is up substantially from $37 million in 2013. The increased cap -- return of capital to shareholders was driven by the 10% increase in dividends per share we announced earlier this year and an increase in share repurchases of $36 million. Free cash flow was a negative $3 million and reflects typical seasonality and working capital dynamics. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $7 million. With that said, please turn to Slide 9 and I'll cover our 2014 guidance. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Overall, we continue to see low single-digit growth across the majority of our end markets. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market, representing 45% of our total revenues. In the U.S. the industrial market continues to slow recovery and market reports suggest that demand conditions are generally improving. In Europe, macro indicators suggest that the market may have bottomed out. And lastly, partially offsetting growth in these regions is a continued weak global mining market. Public utility at 34% of our total revenues is our second largest market. We continue to expect growth in emerging markets. While we're currently expecting a slow recovery in the U.S. and European CapEx markets, we have seen market indicators, suggesting conditions could be improving. We've already seen some of this activity in our bookings, and we still have a robust pipeline of projects we are actively pursuing. We expect to continue to see strength in maintenance and repair activity. While we expect building service applications in the commercial and residential markets to be up low single-digits in 2014, commercial growth is expected to come from emerging markets and the successful launch of new products. However, we expect to continue to see soft conditions in the U.S. institutional building market and a slow recovery in Europe. We seen slightly better performance from residential in the U.S., but anticipate this will subside, as the housing recovery moderates. In Europe, we expect conditions to continue to stabilize and it's also important to note that last year, we posted very strong residential growth, creating a tough year-over-year compare. Lastly, our bookings and backlog position coming out of Q1 supports a low single-digit revenue growth trajectory. Our backlog position, as a percentage of the balance of full year revenue, is 22%. So while encouraging, we still have to see consistently improving book and bill rates throughout the balance of 2014. I'd also like to note that we are encouraged by the strength in backlog deliverable in 2015, which is up 34%. Please turn to Slide 10. Let me spend a few minutes covering our full year guidance in detail. We anticipate 2014 revenues in the range of $3.9 billion to nearly $4 billion, which reflects organic growth of 1% to 3%. For Water Infrastructure, we expect revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, reflecting organic growth of 2% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.6%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.6% to 13.2%. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $2, excluding 2014 restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $40 million to $50 million. We expect approximately $15 million of the savings from restructuring to be realized in 2014 from these actions. This is in addition to the carryover savings of $25 million from the actions executed in 2013. Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, and fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $185 million, which takes into account anticipated share repurchases of approximately $130 million in 2014, of which $50 million has been completed. Please turn to Slide 11. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our first half and second half revenue and operating income profile to be in 2014. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we recognize that it's helpful to highlight trends and expectations to assist in modeling. Revenue, we see the first half representing approximately 48% of our full year, which is consistent with our typical seasonal profile. This reflects sequential growth in Q2 of 8% to 10%, with growth balanced between both segments. While our backlog is up 10% year-over-year, Q2 shippable backlog is up only 3% versus last year, supporting a Q2 organic growth rate range of 1% to 3%. Operating income performance in the second half will be driven by volume leverage and incremental cost improvements in areas such as global sourcing and Lean. We see second quarter margins improving sequentially from the first quarter by 130 to 170 basis points. We're on track to deliver the $40 million in restructuring savings, which is equally split between first and second half. Although corporate expense was below the full year run rate, we do anticipate spending between $55 million and $60 million for the year. In summary, backlog trends are supportive of the 1% to 3% organic growth target, and we're pleased with the progress being made, thus far, on cost reductions to ensure we meet our profit expectations. With that said, please turn to Slide 12 and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some final comments. Patrick?
Patrick K. Decker: Thanks, Mike. We delivered a solid first quarter, which gets us off to a good start to the year and we're very excited by the direction Xylem is headed. As Mike indicated, we see stable market conditions and are gaining momentum in orders activity. Operational performance is improving. While we are not where we need to be yet, I am pleased with the progress the team has made and the trajectory we are in. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are clear about our focus areas and remain committed to delivering on our financial commitments and recognizing the full potential this company is capable of delivering. Operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That was a nice clean quarter. I had a couple of questions. The first will be on the emerging markets. Seeing an 18% organic revenue is very impressive, as well as the 50% up in China. So if you could just give us some additional color, how much of that -- is it a lumpy business? Are these big projects? Is there any MRO associated with them and then how does that play out the balance of the year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So thanks, Deane. The 18% growth was terrific and as you indicated, there's definitely project activity that comes with that. And it was pretty balanced across various regions. I think the key point I'd make is that we are anticipating that it will decelerate. We anticipate the full year emerging markets would be in the high single-digits. And so although it will continue to be very positive for the business, we do see it moderating a bit. And as you indicated, we are dealing with some of the project deliveries and saw a couple of those accelerate into the first quarter, which created a little bit of a distortion on growth rate.
Patrick K. Decker: And Deane, I would only -- I would just add that the emerging markets, that whole area in my mind from a strategic standpoint is, I think, a big area of opportunity for us. I'm actually going to be traveling over to Asia for the first couple of weeks of June, to get a number of our markets over there and just get a better feel for the pulse of the business, but I'm very pleased with the quarter. But I'm also very much focused on what the long-term potential is for us in those markets.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I should have also added, it's -- you'd rather be in a position of explaining why the emerging markets are up so much, rather than the other way around. And the second question, for Mike, I know you alluded the fact that corporate expense came in late this quarter. Maybe if you could calibrate for us what's some of the puts and takes were. I know, from our estimates, it came in like by about $0.025 favorable. So was there some discretionary spending that you pullback and what other puts and takes might there be?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, look there's always puts and takes relative to things like compensation accruals and things like that. But I think, given that we saw the year starting off slow and saw the weather having a pretty heavy impact on our very profitable dewatering business, we made some discretionary decisions around deferring certain costs out of corporate. And that was really consistent with what you've seen us do in the past, where we're keeping a very quick pulse on the business and reacting quickly as well. We do anticipate some of that coming back into the business. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see corporate being in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the year. So you ought to anticipate us being around $15 million to $16 million per quarter.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then -- perfect. Just last one for me, is maybe you can address how the cadence of the quarter played out. You said January and February were light, March came in strong. Can you give it to us on organic revenue growth basis by chance?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I guess, maybe I'll put it in these terms. When we looked at February, as I mentioned in Patrick's introduction call, we were actually flat year-over-year. And when we looked at how much we had delivered through that point, we were at about roughly $500 million worth of revenue. We were anywhere from 2 to 3 percentage points behind where we have historically been. So by default, March came through a couple of points better than we had originally anticipated and I really give a lot of credit to the teams, given the weather conditions improved into and back out of it. Dewatering, for example, we had seen utilization rates in the low 40s, 40% range in January and February and we saw these utilization rates improve back up into the high 40s. We did not recover the January and February missed revenue, particularly in that business, but the teams really took advantage of the weather being back. We didn't run special promotions or anything like that. The teams just went out and made sure that we were executing on the business.
Patrick K. Decker: Now I would just add, Deane, that I -- having come in the middle of the month and knowing and seeing firsthand the level of focus and intensity the team was placing on this, I was very impressed by how they came together and rather than making excuses, we're really going out and just as Mike said, doubling down and the teamwork across the organization was very impressive, those last 3 to 4 weeks of the month.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: This question is for Patrick. Patrick, you mentioned the top 3 focus areas on Slide 4 and the #1 focus area there is putting customers at the center. And there's been some level of chatter in the marketplace, maybe some of it opportunistic by your competitors that given the last few years, there's been a lot of distraction, the spinout, multiple changes at the top. Is the fact that, that goes at the top of your list any reflection that you think there is merit to that distraction and now this needs to refocus? Or is something else that you saw on your travels that led you to put that at the top?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. Well, I appreciate the question. I had to say, first of all, throughout my entire career, it's always been very clear to me that keeping customers at the center is got to be at the forefront for any organization and company. I will then add that I think any organization that is going through a number of changes and transition a company like Xylem has done, naturally, they're going to be magnetic forces that pull people away sometimes from focusing on the customer. But I have been very impressed by what I've seen out at the local level in terms of people's passion for the customer. The whole passion for being very entrepreneurial at a local level and all I'm trying to do here is to really elevate that. You've heard Steve talk in previous calls about the importance of us investing in innovation and that also is very much a centerpiece for me. Because I do think we have opportunities here to again leverage our productivity to invest even more in innovation over time.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: And then kind of a related follow-up is just in terms of compensation structures and incentives, both for I guess, in the -- both the manufacturing side of the house and maybe more importantly in the customer-facing side of the house. As you look at the way things are structured, are there any changes or tweaks do you think that need to be made in terms of how the teams are incentivized to drive the business?
Patrick K. Decker: Well, I would say, again, good question. It's early days for me. I mean, it's my seventh week in the organization. Obviously, making sure that we've got the right organizational model in place, which I feel good about in terms of the changes been made here, making sure that the incentive structure is aligned with that, are clearly very much on my radar screen. But I think it's premature for me to comment right now on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So could we just go through the puts and takes, when looking at the front half of the year versus the guidance for the back half of the year? Obviously, a large portion a little over half of that's going to be just sequential volume uptick that you guys are projecting, but what are some of the other puts and takes there sequentially from a mix perspective, as you see restructuring layering in and any other items like that?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I think a couple of things, Mike. Restructuring is going to be pretty even throughout the year, it's going to be about $20 million in the first half and the second half. What you really sees is a couple of things and you hit it, it's the volume leverage, as we get into the back half of the year. We're going to end up delivering, call it another $150 million worth of revenue and it's going to have a pretty hard mix in our Water Infrastructure segment, which is we've indicated drops at a pretty high rate. In addition to that, as we laid out in our guidance, we talked about the $100 million worth of cost reductions. It's a little more biased towards the back end of the year. If you look at our first quarter, we got about 22% of the total savings including restructuring. So we're going to end up picking up another $15 million to $20 million in the back half, which is really the work we're doing to accelerate a lot of the sourcing savings that we think the business has the potential to recognize, as well as just getting the Lean projects up and going. So you've got the volume leverage, coupled with higher level of the profitability coming through on the productivity savings.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Makes sense. And then on the dewatering platform, obviously, mining is a little bit of a headwind, weather was a headwind in the first quarter. Maybe you could just talk a little bit by end market, what you're seeing there as weather and trends start normalizing and which of these areas or strength are improvement, which areas are still soft?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so and I think you're right. The mining is going to continue to be a headwind, especially in the first half because then we'll start to lap some of other things, we saw playing out last year. For us, the first quarter, and whether it was public utilities or construction, given the freezing conditions, the fact we had, I think over 20 Godwin branches that were shut down due to weather and construction sites being down, we saw that part of the dewatering business down kind of call it mid-single digits. As we go through the balance of the year, we're not anticipating the recovery in mining. We definitely see the construction markets improving, and we'll definitely see public utilities getting back to a more stable environment. I think that will really help, from a mix perspective, back to your first question with the rental business, picking up momentum through the course of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Patrick, hearing your prepared comments, you spent a fair bit of time talking about your philosophy in your approach to management in terms of Lean Six Sigma, voice of the customer. It's probably unfair to ask you about where the opportunities are within Xylem at this point, but could you just expand on that a little bit more and how you intend to draw those changes down through the organization?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. Again, thanks for the question. I would summarize it as this. As I've traveled around, I've clearly seen some pockets of real strength and excellence, as it relates to the application of Lean Six Sigma and also even in the area of sourcing activity. But I do believe that there's an opportunity for us to make that more consistent in its application to also make it deeper in its application. So, for example, what I've not seen as much of is the application of Lean Six Sigma kind of beyond the 4 walls of the factory. So when you start getting into the sales and marketing area, the R&D area, I've seen pockets of it, but I think, there's more opportunity for us in that area, that will also help us enable to drive growth. In terms of how I go about doing it, again, I think messaging across the organization and making sure that people understand that it is a #1 priority for me is where it starts and also making sure that we are investing adequate resources in terms of training, certification, but also how we deploy the resources across the organization. So there's a multitude of things that I'll be driving in that area, as we go forward. As you know, very well, this is a journey. It's a journey that's never ended, and I think that we are well on the path to realizing it, but there's still opportunity in front of us.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And my follow-up is on the test, strong growth there. You did call out some large projects shipments in that business. Is that something that you're expecting to recur or we expecting to see a moderation of the growth rates there?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. I think there'll be a little bit of a moderation, as I commented overall from around the emerging markets, with us, up 18% in the first quarter. We're going to see that moderating down into what I'll say is the high single-digits as we move forward. And again, it could move around within the quarters, but at this point, I don't anticipate anything significant for that particular business unit anyway.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Patrick, I know it's early days, so it's kind of hard to answer some of these questions, I'm guessing. But I wanted to touch on a couple of topics. And first is just the cost base. It was always our understanding at least that the high fixed cost base in Europe needed to be chipped down at. I mean, have you dug into that or at least, have any early read on whether that cost out -- take out the past restructuring, that's already done, but whether that cost base can, in fact, be brought down to better levels? Or do you just need volumes to come back to make that business look better? I guess, it's -- I'll just open it up to that.
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. Yes, well, volume always helps certainly, and we shown, certainly this quarter, that leverage in that volume growth is a great way to expand margins. But my assessment right now is that I think the commentary that's been made in the past around there being a couple of hundred basis points or so of SG&A opportunity that's still in front of us, I think, is very fair. I've seen opportunities as I've traveled around that I do believe, we can drive that number down. In terms of margin expansion, again, I still believe that through, again, some of the Lean work that we can do, there'll be opportunities in that area, as well as we go forward. In terms of any other kind of cost takeout actions, I think, again, there's opportunities there in terms of helping us get this business to that mid-teen margin that's been put out there in the past as a long-term goal.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, one thing that was missing in your slides, and again, early days, is really the portfolio and M&A. I mean, how do you think of driving the M&A organization? I mean, do you have to take a backseat for a while, until you make the cultural changes you're looking for, or can you proceed on continuing to look at assets and maybe even potentially getting more aggressive?
Patrick K. Decker: Sure. Yes, well, I think that acquisitions are and definitely will be a key element of our growth strategy in terms of getting our growth rate up to where we have stated we wanted to be. We continued and I've seen the teams continue to cultivate opportunities, even while we've been in this slight pause for a while. And so I think now we've made a lot of progress on the operating improvement actions, obviously, we still have work to do there. That gives me increased confidence in execution. Obviously, we no longer have the lingering questions around CEO change. I'm very pleased the team has maintained a pipeline of candidates and continue to have a strong balance sheet that we can obviously leverage when the time is right. So again, little bit more time for me to spend with the team and of course, the market factors always come in play here and when the right opportunity is available. But I can reinforce that acquisitions will be a key element of our growth strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. My first question is just a follow-up on an earlier answer. Have you seen the pickup in March? Has that carried through into April so far? I mean, what are you seeing more up-to-date trends?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so we're actually right on the forefront of getting results for the month of April. But based on what we've seen and heard and there's a little bit of softness, some of that's the project deliveries that accelerated into March. But otherwise, we really haven't seen any significant deviation from the trends that we saw in the month of March.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then Mike, I think you said in your prepared comments that you've seen some early signs of the CapEx-related business improving. Was that a U.S. comment or a global comment, and what are you seeing there that kind of gives you more confidence that maybe we could be seen recovery at some point of the horizon here?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, I think, it's between both regions and as you know, Europe is a number of different regions. So we tend to see more of the strength in the, call it, Western and Northern part of Europe. But the reason that we have, I guess, increased confidence is when you look at the backlog that shippable for 2015, it's up 34%. And then when you look at it between the 2 segments, it's actually up over 40% in Water Infrastructure. And so that obviously has some projects that are in emerging markets, but it does also contain the work that we see going on and we've seen it. I'll comment more specifically around the treatment market in the U.S., where last year as you know, we continued to see declines in the order rates. That's impacting our revenues as we get into 2014. But we are seeing order rates starting to pick up that will obviously bode well for 2015. So we're not ready to call that we're out of the woods yet, but it certainly feels like things are moving in the right direction. The bid pipeline is still very active, and we feel like, we're competitively positioned to take advantage of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Mike, maybe can you just touch a little bit more on price cost, so it was a little bit mixed in the quarter. I know you -- I think, you had some decent opportunities in the second half of '13, maybe it decelerated a little bit in Q1. I just wanted to know what your thoughts were for the remainder of the year, particularly through the channel.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I think, we saw little price, about 20 basis points in Q1 and it was actually more biased towards Applied Water. Water Infrastructure was essentially flat. It was better than we were anticipating slightly. But I do expect that the competitive pressures that we see in the market are going to still weigh on us through the balance of the year. So the discussion that we had around pricing gain, where from 25 to 50 basis point, headwind for the year still holds. But from a cost standpoint, we're actively pushing from a productivity standpoint. So even though pricing isn't pulling its share of the weight that it was in the past, we've made up for that with not only the restructuring, but also pushing forward more on the sourcing and the Lean savings in the business and creating a nice spread that's going to give us the margin uplift that we need for the year.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: All right. And this just going over to the customer relationship management system. Where are you in that installation process? Are those costs embedded in Q1 numbers and if not, I guess, maybe just touch on the cadence of the spending and potentially even the benefits?
Patrick K. Decker: Yes. So the implementation is really right at the beginning, at the early stages right now. And so the team have been studying alternatives for a while, certainly before I joined and I'm very supportive of the decision that we've made to move forward. It's a big enabler to our whole integrated front-end, getting our sales organizations able to talk to each other, get visibility to what our opportunities are with customers across the portfolio and sharing those leads. Again, the money itself, again, is not going to be incremental to what we've got into before. It's all been embedded in our outlook for the year. But again, at the end of the day, we expect that this is going to have a pretty meaningful impact for us over time in terms of driving top line growth and as well, obviously, margin expansion.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: If I could just ask one more, maybe I'm reading this incorrectly, but it looks like the FX headwind, it was $0.03 headwind in the quarter, but now, it was only a $4 million revenue headwind? How do I reconcile those 2 things?
Michael T. Speetzen: So there's -- so Brian, there's 2 components. There's the translation, which is the smaller impact this quarter. And as we anticipated, we saw a heavier transaction impact and what we do hedge, that only ends up smoothing out the eventual impact that you have from a foreign exchange perspective and we're only hedging about 75% to 80% of the total. For us, it's really around the mix of where you derive revenue and where your costs are based. So not to get into a lot of the details, but we've got a lot of euro base revenue, but a cost base based in Sweden. So you end up with some differential there and then we obviously have a bunch of cross-currency issues with Australia and the Canadian dollar, which have both had been heavily impacted this past quarter. But I think, the key message is this is consistent with we what built into the guidance. We don't see any issues as we go through the balance of the year either.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just curious, I imagine these are hedges that are put in place, but do you have an offset that hits gross margin a couple of quarters down the line as these things are delivered or is that not really play?
Michael T. Speetzen: No. This is more what actually lives through and what is what I'll call a differential in the cost base. So the hedging handles all the transactional pieces, but over time all that does is smooth you out and if you end up with the imbalance between 2 regions, you're ultimately going to have that impact to your P&L and that's essentially what this is.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: This is a follow-up question on the margin side. I mean, the SG&A was, I think, lower than many of us anticipated. Given the gross margins were essentially flat, how should we think about the gross margin pressure going forward? I think the implication is it's pretty hard to get the leverage there, if sales are flat, on the gross margin side, given what you talked about in terms of pricing. Am I missing something there? And that's I guess, the first part and the second part is, if we think about sort of the, I wouldn't call it aggressiveness, but I think there was, Steve had put it before in a prior call, that the team is more aggressive in seeking out orders and I guess, you're going to be a little bit more competitive on pricing. What is it in terms of comfort level and the backlog, how do you get comfort with that backlog and maybe that question is for both of you, Patrick and Mike, that you don't see further margin pressure in and what's in the backlog?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So on the gross margin, I guess, a couple of comments. One, Q1 was heavily impacted by the fact that we came up a bit short on the dewatering rental and we were a bit overweight to the emerging markets, where we tend to see a little bit lower gross margin in terms of what that revenue comes through. As you know, it's project-based, so it tends to be on the lower end of the margin scale. As we progress through the year, though, a couple of things. One, there is improving mix, as we see the Water Infrastructure business ramp up, that starts as we get into the second quarter. But we're also working on number of initiatives that I've talked to in prior call around the Lean, but also sourcing, where we think that there is more capability to drive sourcing savings throughout the business. And so that would tell you that our gross margin will improve on the year-over-year basis at the full year level, probably around 50-plus basis points, despite what we anticipate as some pricing headwind. On your second question around the orders, it's a good question and it's something that we're pretty active in reviewing all the bid activities. So when you think about that improvement in the backlog that's shippable going out beyond the next year. The review process we have is to make sure that we're bidding at the right level of margins. So given that there is project activity, there's going to be some pricing pressure there relative to what we would see coming through some more of the developed regions. But not a surprise and it's something that we build in, as we think about our cost plans and our margin improvement plans as we go forward. So we're adjusting our cost base accordingly, and I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to see the margin expansion.
Patrick K. Decker: I would just reinforce what Mike said here around, again, the opportunities in global sourcing are very real. And that really has been underleveraged in my view. And so again, the commentary Steven made in past quarters, I think is spot on and we're working hard in that area. And then again, the opportunities around Lean deployment, while those tend to be longer-term, I think there are some near-term opportunities there for the team. The team is working as hard as Mike pointed out, we own the pricing environment that we're operating in and we, again, want to do we can do to really use our productivity to drive growth, both investment, as well as being competitive from a margin standpoint.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.
Patrick K. Decker: Thank you. Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're very clear about our focus areas and remain committed to delivering our financial commitments and recognizing the full potential of the company is capable of delivering. We are pleased with our performance in Q1. We have a lot of work yet to do to deliver 2014, but we're confident the plans and actions are in place to do exactly that. So again, I want to thank you all for joining today and for your support interest and look forward to connecting to you again in the near future.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Steven R. Loranger: Thank you, Phil. In my entire career, I've never missed an earnings call, and hopefully, this one's going to work without any glitches. As Phil mentioned, I'm not in the New York office with the team, but I'm rather with my wife, Betsy, who just had an unplanned appendectomy a couple of days ago. The good news is that Betsy's fine, and I'm settling in my new role as Chief Caregiving Officer. I am very pleased with our Q4 performance. Thanks to the team's hard work, we executed well on our revised business goals, which was the #1 goal that we set last September. While we certainly have execution challenges in front of us, I feel confident that we turned the corner on our recovery and business improvement plans. We've positioned Xylem to perform at a higher level. Just as we saw orders and execution in the third quarter, I believe our fourth quarter was a continuation of that trend. We're proud to report that even in a less-than-robust market environment, we achieved record revenue, our first $1 billion quarter. Overall, revenue increased 7%, with the core up 5% over the prior year. We booked orders of $986 million, up 6% overall and up 5% organically over 2012. Although the market conditions were slightly more positive, our teams stepped up to the challenge and delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth. We also achieved operational improvements, resulting in $145 million of operating income, which was a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin of 14% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and up 50 basis points from the third quarter. Our renewed focus on business accountability and cost actions also had a positive effect, and you can see that in our incremental margin drop of 38%, excluding FX and acquisitions. Generally, we continue to see some market stabilization, and we've seen minor signs of improvement, including a slightly brighter outlook for industrial and public utility. But we continue to be cautious about these markets and expect, at best, slow overall market growth, but at least we see it trending in the right direction. The bottom line, we achieved 19% earnings per share growth over the prior year and a 14% improvement on a sequential basis over the third quarter. So as you think back over the full year, revenues were relatively flat, up just about 1%, coupled with an 8% operating income decline and margins down 110 basis points. In retrospect, there's no question that we had some tough market conditions coupled with some execution issues, but we feel like our second half performance is more representative of a proper trajectory, building a solid base to begin 2014. For the full year, we also generated free cash flow of $198 million, a bit disappointing on the conversion, but that was mostly a buildup of working capital due to unforeseen sales declines. And this year, as you will imagine, we have put aggressive recovery plans in place to address this issue. In addition to our solid operating results, we also executed several important milestones last year. We put a new operating model in place, one that emphasizes speed, accountability and simplicity and enables the entire organization to drive for higher performance. Every growth center and region contributed significantly to our overall performance, and each plans to accelerate their performance this year. We've worked to aggressively take cost out of the business, and this will continue. During the fourth quarter, we continued our disciplined capital deployment with another $25 million in share repurchases, matching our third quarter investment and increasing our total return of capital to shareholders by 83%, including dividends. And as you saw, we're increasing this amount again in 2014. Throughout the year, we continued to increase organic growth investments. These investments brought forth a number of new products, particularly in the areas of energy-efficient pumps, like the new Goulds Water Technology industrial pumps and the Bell & Gossett e-1510 and ecocirc HVAC pumps we just launched a few weeks ago. These are substantial additions to our portfolio and precisely what our customers are seeking: smarter solutions to their most critical water issues. The achievements at London's Heathrow Airport, where our Flygt pump systems cut the airport's wastewater pumping energy use by 50%, demonstrates the meaningful results we're providing our customers. And another example was our $2.7 million win to supply high-technology equipment for a New Jersey storm water drainage system after Superstorm Sandy. These are just a number of examples of the size and impacts of the wins that we are achieving. I remain confident in the potential of this company. We've got a strong and comprehensive portfolio to meet compelling market fundamentals around water, and our product brands are the most respected in the industry. I'm very pleased with our team's second half response to the first half challenges, and I expect our businesses to continue this execution and performance as we move forward into 2014. And now let me turn it over to Mike Speetzen to review the balance of our performance in Q4.
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Steve. Please go to Slide 4. We generated revenues in excess of $1 billion, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by 5% organic growth and additional 2% from acquisitions. It's worth noting that we are comparing to a prior year fourth quarter where we experienced negative growth. Industrial and public utility end markets showed strength relative to poor performance last year. We have seen the positive effects of rebounding industrial production in the U.S. and Europe, and we see public utility markets stabilizing, with customers focused on OpEx and small project activities, but we have not seen a meaningful recovery in larger CapEx projects. The commercial end market was down 5%, driven by a tough compare to the prior year, where we first saw the channel start to restock product and we had some benefit from Super Storm Sandy. I'll cover up more specifics by segment, but generally speaking, we saw growth across our key geographic regions, up mid single digits in both the U.S. and Europe, and continue to see growth in emerging markets, driven by timing of project business. Turning to operating income, we delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $145 million was up $15 million or 12% over last year, and margins reached 14%. Operating margins increased 60 basis points despite headwind from foreign exchange, continued price erosion and acquisitions which are in their early stages of integration and slightly dilutive to margins. These headwinds were more than offset by strong incremental margins, coupled with the favorable impact of cost actions initiated in 2012 and early 2013. Core incremental margins were approximately 38% after excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions, strong performance considering this includes absorbing the impacts of setting up our European headquarters and remaining onetime spin-related costs. Price pressure has become a bigger challenge, and in the quarter, it was a 40 basis point headwind against the overall operating margin improvement. Offsetting the price pressure were cost-reduction activities, which drove 410 basis points of margin improvement, including $11 million of restructuring savings from actions executed in 2012 and 2013. Inflation had a 210 basis point negative impact on operating margin. In summary, operating margins increased 60 basis points over the prior year. EPS expanded 19% to $0.56, exceeding our guidance midpoint of $0.51 and the high end of our range of $0.53. Favorability was primarily driven by volume and additional productivity savings from lean activities. Core operations drove strong operating margin improvement, contributing $0.09, driven primarily by organic volume growth combined with execution on productivity and cost management. Included in this performance was restructuring savings of $0.05. Our European realignment actions, including sustainable tax benefits, provided an additional $0.01 benefit in the quarter. I should note these benefits more than offset a $0.04 unfavorable impact of price and mix in the quarter. Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $691 million, up 8% over the prior year and up 6% organically. Acquisitions contributed 2 points to top line growth. Transport grew 9%, test was up 3% and revenue from treatment applications were flat year-over-year. Regionally, we saw growth across key regions like the U.S. and Europe, which were up 10% and 5%, respectively, and emerging markets were up 6%. I would summarize our revenue performance as follows. Growth was driven by strength in industrial applications, including water and wastewater transport and dewatering, the latter up slightly despite continued headwinds from a challenged mining market and a tough prior year compare resulting from Super Storm Sandy. Supporting this growth, we generally saw improved market conditions in Europe and the U.S. and increased project activity in emerging markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific. I would also add that our focus on growing our industrial market share is also gaining traction. For example, as part of our Sustainable Water Infrastructure initiative, we focus on packaging products from across the Xylem portfolio and promoting automated systems and services for the aquaculture market. By presenting Xylem's full portfolio of solutions to customers, we're accelerating our growth in this market. For example, we landed a $1.4 million order that included both Flygt pumps and WEDECO UV and ozone systems. In addition to industrial growth, we also saw strong performance from our water and wastewater transport business. Specifically, we saw our flagship brand, Flygt, drive double-digit growth in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in Europe. Test applications were up 3%, driven by strength in Europe, specifically growth in Germany and neighboring countries. And lastly, I would highlight that the year-over-year treatment revenues were flat, following 4 consecutive quarters of being down. The reality of this long-cycle business is that capital projects have declined due to the recession. While today, confidence appears to be building, we expect to continue to face some headwinds into 2014. I'll address this in more detail later in the call. Operating margin contracted 30 basis points from 16.5% to 16.2%. Margin performance was impacted by foreign exchange as we saw the euro strengthen against the U.S. dollar, and we experienced continued price erosion given overcapacity in the market and a highly competitive environment. Our overall performance was also impacted by increased investment in growth initiatives and higher costs associated with the relatively new European organization. Let me now turn to Slide #6 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 3% overall, with organic growth at 2%. It's worth noting that this performance is against a strong comp in the fourth quarter of last year, where we posted 4% organic. As you can see, industrial water applications grew 8%. Irrigation, while relatively small, was up 14%, and building service applications declined 4% year-over-year on a tough compare. Regionally, we saw growth across key regions like the U.S. and Europe, which were up 2% and 4%, respectively, and emerging markets were up 1%. I would summarize our revenue performance as follows. Growth was driven primarily by project strength for industrial water applications in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Specifically, we delivered on several northern European projects, including strong multistage pump sales, and we continue to see increased demand for industrial fire pump systems in China. While we saw double-digit growth in the U.S. residential applications, global residential and commercial end markets continue to exhibit volatility and weakness, particularly in Southern Europe. Our U.S. commercial business was down year-over-year on a tough compare, and as you may recall, Superstorm Sandy drove an increase in shipments last year. Currently, we see a commercial channel that has restocked inventory levels in advance of a market recovery. However, we see the timing of this recovery as uncertain. Operating margin expanded a healthy 120 basis points from 11.6% to 12.8% year-over-year. Margin improvement was driven by volume leverage coupled with the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives. Although price was positive, we have continued to see a downward pressure given current market conditions. Now let me turn to Slide 7 and review our full year performance. Orders for 2013 were over $3.9 billion, representing total growth of 3% over the prior year, up 1% organically. Orders slightly outpaced shipments, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02. We ended 2013 with $697 million of backlog shippable in 2014, up 16% versus where we were last year and a solid indicator of an improving market. For the full year, revenues came in slightly above $3.8 billion, up 1% versus 2012, including 2 points from acquisitions. As Steve mentioned, we faced significant market headwinds in the first half of the year, and despite posting organic growth in the third and fourth quarters, full year organic revenue declined by 1%. From an end market perspective, we saw the largest revenue declines in our 2 largest markets, industrial and public utility, down 2% and 1%, respectively. First half revenue was down 7% in both those markets. We saw growth accelerate to 4% for both in the second half. Since they represent approximately 80% of total revenue, we are cautiously optimistic as we look forward into 2014. We saw revenues flat in commercial and down overall in residential, driven primarily by weakness in Europe, which was down double digits in these markets. In the U.S., we posted 6% growth in residential. On the commercial side, full year revenues were down 1% as weakness in large institutional building projects were only partially offset by revenues from new products and restocking activities. On a full year basis, revenues in the agriculture market have grown 8%, another strong year for this niche business. Overall, on a regional basis, the U.S. and emerging markets were flat year-over-year and Europe was down 2%. Operating income decreased 8% in 2013. Full year operating margins came in at 11.8%, down 110 basis points. Second half leverage on revenue growth, coupled with cost-reduction execution, partially offset first half margin declines, which were heavily impacted by our first half organic revenue decline of 5%, and is a nice setup of the European headquarters. I would note that European realignment we started in the first quarter resulted in a pickup of $0.04 of EPS after absorbing the additional European headquarter costs and lowered our tax rate 300 basis points to 21%. The last point, and it's an important one as we look out into the first quarter, is that price drove margins favorably by only 10 basis points, approximately 90 basis points short of what we thought coming into the year. While price was positive for the company as a whole, we saw the overall contribution decline through the first half and turn negative in the second half. We expect that overcapacity in the market will drive very competitive dynamics and that pricing will remain challenged. To wrap up on 2013, I'll make one final point. The results for the full year do not reflect the drastic dynamics between the first and second half of the year. You can see from the fourth quarter, we have gained traction on the top line and have continued to drive significant cost reductions in the business to impact the bottom line. Our efforts and recent performance provide for a solid base to drive growth from and continue to improve operational performance. Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover the company's financial position as of year end. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $533 million at year end, with approximately 80% held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 24%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We have invested $207 million in acquisitions and CapEx, and we have returned $154 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is up substantially from $84 million in 2012. Key drivers were a 15% increase in dividends announced earlier this year and the ramp-up of share repurchase activity, which we continued through the end of the year, spending an additional $25 million in the fourth quarter, bringing repurchases to a total of $67 million. Free cash flow was $198 million. The decline in free cash flow versus 2012 was driven by lower growth, unfavorable working capital and higher restructuring payments. As a percentage of revenue, operating working capital increased 170 basis points, driven by timing of customer collections given linearity of sales and slightly elongated customer payment patterns, as well as an inventory buildup to support shorter order lead times. I will note that we have not experienced any significant bad debts associated with these lengthened payment durations. While we are not pleased with our working capital performance, fourth quarter reflects an improved trend, returning to below Q2 levels, and we remain committed to further improve our performance in this area. Before we turn to the guidance details, let me turn the call back over to Steve to provide you with the framework we're working with in 2014. Steve?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, thank you, Mike. Let me start by saying that we are beginning 2014 well positioned to accelerate our performance. As Mike mentioned, some of the 2013 headwinds have dissipated a bit, and we are entering 2014 with encouraging signs for more consistency in top line growth. We also expect to deliver improved operating performance across all of our businesses, positioning ourself for strong earnings growth. Let me highlight our top strategic initiatives for 2014. First, we're going to build our business execution. We will deliver on our 2014 targets, and we're going to be using a robust management process to accomplish that. We expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4% while improving operating margins between 12.6% and 13.2%. And at the bottom line, EPS will be in the range of $1.85 to $2, up 11% to 20%. Free cash flow conversion will be 100%, along with a nice improvement in ROIC. These are aggressive but achievable goals, which will -- which we're going to meet by strengthening our sales capabilities and increasing our operating efficiency. To help us achieve our #1 priority, first, we're going to look to accelerate growth by optimizing our integrated front-end strategy. This entails leadership appointments, new customer relationship technology, digital marketing, more robust sales force metrics and aligned compensation plans. Second, to improve our productivity, we are reinvigorating our Lean Six Sigma capabilities and creating a new global strategic sourcing organization. Lean Six Sigma already contributes several million dollars annually to our bottom line results, and we are actively extending its impact. Likewise, we're rolling out a new global strategic sourcing organization with a single leader. This is going to supercharge our already strong sourcing capabilities, with the goal of doubling our net productivity in 2014. Next, we're going to be focused on capital deployment, including rebalancing our portfolio and investment decisions. We're going to provide advanced technology equipment and solutions to resolve our customers' most critical water challenges. And finally, as I mentioned, we are institutionalizing the Xylem management system, which synchronizes our key business processes in an accountable way. Those of you that know me know how much I believe in a disciplined management process, and this is a vital need at Xylem. This is going to help us translate strategy to execution with linked, standardized processes, all aligned to execute our vision. So that's the set of our priorities for 2014 and our top level targets. Let me turn it back over to Mike to go over the details of our 2014 plan.
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Steve. Turn to Slide 10. We anticipate 2014 revenues of approximately $4 billion, which reflects total growth of 2% to 4% and organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. For Water Infrastructure, we expect revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, reflecting total growth of 2% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting total growth of 2% to 3% and organic growth of 1% to 2%, with a 1-point benefit from foreign exchange. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.6%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.6% to 13.2%. At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $2, excluding 2014 restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $40 million to $50 million. Of the $40 million to $50 million, we plan to execute restructuring actions with costs ranging $30 million to $35 million, with an expected payback of approximately 1 year. We expect approximately $10 million of savings to be realized in 2014 from these actions. This is in addition to the carryover savings of $25 million from the actions executed in 2013. If you'll recall, we originally expected $15 million of carryover savings in 2014. The increase reflects accelerated savings and should provide a higher degree of confidence in our expected 2014 performance. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, and fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $185 million, which takes into account expected share repurchases of approximately $130 million in 2014. Please turn to Slide 11. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market, representing 43% of total revenues, we expect low single-digit organic growth. In the U.S., the industrial market continues to slowly recover and market reports suggest that demand conditions are generally improving, whereas in Europe, macro indicators suggest that the market may be near the bottom and sentiment is cautiously optimistic. However, partially offsetting growth in these regions is continued weak global mining market conditions. And while our business is sensitive to these market conditions, we believe we have the opportunity to increase our market share through new product introductions and a broad portfolio of technologies which can be further levered into providing a complete industrial solution to customers. Public Utility, at 35% of total revenues, is our second-largest market and is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. We continue to expect stability in required operations and maintenance activities, as spend is largely nondiscretionary and funded by tariffs to end users. As we've discussed during previous quarters, the portion of public utility revenue that is derived from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project delays and funding constraints. In the U.S., we expect to see intense price competition and funding concerns to continue, thus having a more pronounced effect on our long-cycle treatment business. Given the longer lead times for treatment projects, our forecast does not reflect any recovery in 2014. We could see market conditions improve through the year, resulting in higher bookings which could lead to a better setup for 2015. In Europe, continued strength in the Nordic region and a promising outlook for Eastern Europe is partially offset by the expected slowdown in the U.K. as a result of the end of the AMP5 cycle. We expect building service applications in the commercial and residential markets to be up low single digits in 2014. While we sell to a wide range of customers, our largest commercial building concentration is in the institutional market, hospitals and schools, which have continued to struggle with spending pressures. In the U.S., leading indicators have been mixed, and while there remains a potential for growth acceleration, our order bookings have continued to be sluggish. In Europe, we generally anticipate a slow recovery in the construction markets. Residential markets support low-single-digit growth as strength in the U.S. market is partially offset by continued weakness in Europe. And agriculture remains a small market for us, and revenues are likely to be flat to up slightly given the benefit we received from drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and 2013. Taken together, the low-growth economic environment, along with the relative stability of demand for the critical types of products we sell across a variety of end markets, we expect flat to up low single-digit market growth, with Xylem in the range of up 1% to 3% organically. Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our revenue profile to be in 2014. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we recognize that it is helpful to highlight irregularities to the extent reasonably possible. So as we looked over our 2014 revenue profile, we recognized that it would likely deviate from historical seasonal patterns. As you can see from the slide, we expect first quarter revenue will be approximately 22% to 23% of our total 2014 guidance. This is approximately 1 to 2 points below prior periods but in line with what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Given the level of volume we're expecting in the first quarter, the pricing dynamics in the market today and the benefits from cost actions, we would expect operating margin to be approximately 100 basis points higher than the prior year. You can also see from the slide, we expect approximately 28% of our revenue to come in the fourth quarter at the higher end of the 26% to 29% range we experienced in the past. Let me make a couple of points which will help you better understand this profile. First, the first quarter of 2012 stood out as an exceptionally strong contributor, driven in part by the peak of natural gas frac-ing activity for our dewatering business. Second, this year, we will wrap up our first quarter with 1 less business day, which gets picked up in the fourth quarter. I won't spend any more time on this as there are more important areas I want to cover, but I did think it would be helpful to highlight that we're expecting a slightly overweight second half, reflecting both normal seasonal patterns and a couple of specific 2014 dynamics. Turning to Slide 13. While we don't expect flat year-over-year revenues, the chart on this slide reflects the cost profile as if we did. The purpose here is to simply illustrate some of the cost reduction impacts without the added complexity of volume in the equation. Starting on the left side of the slide with our 2013 cost base, we expect inflation from material labor and overhead, coupled with increased investments and some level of discretionary costs returning to the business, to be approximately $100 million or a 3% increase over the prior year. More than offsetting that and driving margin improvements are targeted cost reductions of $140 million. This represents a 4% reduction to our cost base, driven by essentially 3 components. First, we expect that global sourcing and Lean Six Sigma actions will drive $100 million in savings, essentially offsetting the cost of inflation and providing for incremental investments in new product development, sales force initiatives and new information technology infrastructure. Secondly, we expect to deliver $35 million of incremental restructuring savings in 2014. As you can see from the chart, approximately $25 million is attributable to carryover savings from our 2013 actions. Again, you should note this is $10 million higher than we had originally anticipated. In addition to the carryover savings, we expect to realize $10 million of restructuring savings attributable to new 2014 restructuring actions, most of which are planned over the first half of the year, with related savings kicking in, in the second half of 2014. Finally, we incurred $4 million of onetime spin costs in 2013, and we do not expect these costs to recur in 2014 and, therefore, will also drive year-over-year savings. Turning to Slide 14. We have a fair amount of information laid out here, so I'm only going to highlight a few key points and then turn the call back over to Steve. Let me begin by first summarizing our top 2014 capital deployment plans. Our first priority remains organic investment as this is the highest-returning investment we can make. To this end, we see investing $110 million to $120 million in CapEx, which represents 3% of revenue; approximately 3% of revenue into R&D; and approximately $40 million to $50 million into restructuring realignment to enhance our competitive position. Second, we plan to enhance shareholder returns by an expected 10% annual dividend increase and approximately $130 million from our share repurchase programs. Lastly, inorganic growth remains a key element of our long-term strategy. We expect to continue to cultivate and potentially acquire bolt-on acquisitions later this year. Free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of $310 million to $345 million in 2014, up in the range of 57% to 74% year-over-year and 100% of expected GAAP net income. The year-over-year increase is driven by higher income, working capital improvements and overall lower CapEx spend. To wrap up, I would highlight that we're targeting a 100 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital, up to approximately 11% by year end. With that said, let me turn to Slide 15 and turn the call back over to Steve.
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, thanks again, Mike. Just to wrap this up before questions, we clearly delivered a solid fourth quarter and a very strong finish to the year. But more importantly, I'm really pleased with the direction that Xylem is headed. Building on long-term market fundamentals and aiming for the best possible business performance, we're acting on several fronts to advance our ability to execute as a high-performing organization. I've been here now for just under 5 months, and I really am pleased with our top leadership team and the trajectory that we're on. To be sure, we do have plenty of operational challenges ahead of us, coupled with improving but still overall slow markets. What I'm really excited about is our collective leadership attitude and ambition. Our sales people want to win, and they want to satisfy customers. Our growth center leaders want to lean out the efficiency of their operation and get our SG&A and material costs where they need to be so that we can afford the vital investments for our future. Our teams accept the execution challenges of the past year and using this as a basis to springboard our competitiveness. So given this, as Mike outlined on Charts 11, 12 and 13, we have constructed for you an appropriate advance in our operating metrics for 2014 with measured and balanced execution conservatism. This gives us great confidence as we internally aspire to even higher performance. We have a new operating model with terrific leadership at the top, fueled to drive organizational speed, simplicity and accountability. We are building our sales and marketing capability to better leverage our leading brands and technology. Our investments in digital capability and product technology have been increased for 2014, a very positive reward for our teams as they eliminate unnecessary overheads. I'm quite encouraged by where we are. It's true, I do toss and turn at night given the execution challenges ahead of us, but I have the confidence that our global team is aligned and aspiring to achieve our vision. I'd like to now ask our operator to turn it over to the folks on the call for any questions that may be on your mind.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Steve, you mentioned, several occasions, price in somewhat negative context, and you did last quarter as well. But do you have a sense of prices getting -- can you give us a sense whether price is getting incrementally worse, or do you see things kind of flatlining here?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, Scott. If anything, it's probably more in the flat line. The issue is the entire industry is slightly overcapacity, as you know, and so all the competitors are duking it out on an incremental basis. And so while we do have a number of -- while we have already executed a number of price increases on the catalog basis, these get competed pretty intensely. And as a consequence, we're not realizing as much price as we'd like to the bottom line. So I would call it more or less flat at this situation. It is obviously a concern, but it's one that we're shoring up with our material cost takeout to make sure we balance our operating margin.
Michael T. Speetzen: Scott, I think we're -- Scott, we're trying to be conservative in the view we have for next year, so we planned for it being down about 0.5 point. Obviously, internally, we're driving higher expectations for that. And the other thing I'd add is, one other headwind relative to pricing is we have seen inflation come down, which is a good thing. We had been averaging just over 3% in the prior years, and this past year, we've gotten down to just over 2%. And we're anticipating core inflation in the business in that same area as well.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's really helpful. And then you guys talked -- you spent more time this quarter also talking about cash reinvestment, buybacks and M&A. And I mean, this has always been a tough industry to do deals. There's just not a lot of great assets that are available out there. I mean, what gives you the confidence that there are deals to do? And I guess the natural side part of this question is, would you consider going outside of water to other flow-type businesses?
Steven R. Loranger: So let me take a shot at that. Remember that the water industry is highly fragmented, and so there are opportunities. And while we have taken a respite, as we mentioned, to make sure that we get back into a solid operating rhythm, we have kept our pipeline open. And I wouldn't conclude that you can't do deals right now, although we have taken a bit of a rest. With respect to outside of water, I would say not as a strategy. I mean, clearly, we have the ability, because of the breadth of our technology and the capability of our selling marketing distribution, is to be a very, very strong provider of this technology that resolve customers' water challenges. The water market is sufficiently large to play in, and it's fragmented, and it's equally as profitable as other industrial segments. So because we are a pure-play water company, we feel very committed to continue to drive water solutions to our customer needs. In order to do that, we're going to have to do some of the things I mentioned, which is strengthen the distribution and marketing organization so we can flow more product through the front end, continue to invest in innovation and to rebalance into probably the most attractive segment of water, which is really the industrial and the international side. So Scott, we want to stay in water. We're extremely well positioned there, and it's what we do, and we think we can do it well to achieve our vision.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I do have some questions on the guidance, but the first topic is a bit more sensitive for you, Steve. And you're now in this interim role for 5 months, and from our perspective, that process, the search has taken a bit longer. But if you listen to everything on the call and the outlook for 2014, you certainly don't sound like an interim CEO at all, and this is the Steve Loranger we knew of old, managing with intensity. So it begs the question whether the board might be considering you as, let's call it, the medium-term solution for Xylem, and how should we be thinking about that?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, thanks, Dean. I appreciate the view on my attitude, and you've got it exactly right. I only know one speed, and that's full speed ahead. And whether I'm here a day or much, much longer, I'm going to be doing my very best to provide leadership and direction for the company on the basis of creating long-term value. So that's my approach. The CEO search is underway. We have -- we're probably at a point where I would say we are just concluding the Phase 1, which is the broader interview of a number of terrific and qualified candidates. And as we turn into our first quarter, the board certainly wants to focus and narrow and definitize the search down to a couple of qualified candidates. So the search is well underway. There's nothing really to report. The good news is that I am here, serving at the board's pleasure as long as it takes. And I have also committed to the board to provide whatever appropriate or needed transitional leadership in such a fashion. But I really can't be any more specific than that. That simply is where we are, and in the meantime, I've got my head down with the team to focus on executing this long-term strategy.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then for the guidance, 2 of the metrics you've provided that -- if I could get some more color on, is the $100 million in sourcing savings as well as the $35 million restructuring savings. And maybe share with us what sort of upside there are to those numbers, your confidence. You've got every project identified. Is there an internal stretch goal? And maybe just walk us through those, please.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so Dean, let me start, and then Steve can add any color. On the core sourcing and Lean Six Sigma savings of $100 million, that's pretty consistent with what we have executed in the past. We've looked over the past several years, and our teams have been pretty effective at going out and doing everything they can to essentially offset inflation and provide some room for reinvesting in the company. On the restructuring, $25 million of that, you can count on, is hard savings in the sense that we locked it in by executing more aggressively in the fourth quarter than we had originally provided externally to get a jump-start on 2014. And then the additional $10 million that we're counting on from restructuring, we've got a high degree of confidence. We've got the areas identified. We have dampened the number a bit for any potential slide in execution timing, but it feels good from our perspective. We are driving more aggressive plans internally. I mean, I think a safe way to think about it is we aren't counting on the revenue growth to get us home in terms of making the EPS range that we've put out there. Similar to what we did in the latter part of 2013, we are driving internal assurance plans that are more aggressive from a cost perspective. And we feel we've got a good line of sight and a good trajectory on them and, at this stage, feel very good about what we've got lined up in terms of cost reduction.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So are there internal stretch goals higher for both of those 2 metrics?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, Dean, of course there are. And these stretch goals are hardwired into our growth center plans, so the teams actually are working to numbers that are higher. The challenge is obviously bringing the ball home to score. You mentioned projects. Take the sourcing, for example. We have identified the areas of all $100 million, but I would say, safely, probably only 70% or 80% of that $100 million is detailed in terms of clear execution plans. That's where businesses normally are at this time in the year, but at the end of the day, I think it outlines the point that there's a bit of execution ahead of us. So I'm not concerned at all about whether or not the opportunity is there, but my interest and our -- is to make sure that we stay very, very focused on the execution. And yes, as you would expect, our internal plans that the teams have committed provide some conservatism.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I just want to ask a couple of questions -- well, a question on the dewatering side of the platform. If you strip out the mining side of that, what do the core trends look like there? And then also, specifically, how is the rental component of that business tracking here?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Mike, it's -- if you pull out mining, I would characterize it as improving. We certainly, coming out of the 2011, 2012 timeframe, the natural gas frac-ing bubble that essentially created a bit of a distortion there, I'd say we're returning back to more normal patterns. We've seen a little bit of an uptick here and there from construction. Public utility seems like it's relatively stable. At this stage, the only area we've seen any downward movement in is primarily around the mining segment. So we're not anticipating dewatering accelerating at rates that we saw back in 2011. I think the nature of the frac-ing industry has changed in terms of the way they look for water services, and so we see a little bit more moderated growth trend there. But all the other indicators look promising at this stage.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then on the commercial construction side, maybe you could frame the commentary from the folks you're selling to here, what they're seeing when they're starting to stack a little inventory, as well as maybe, when you're looking through the year here, where is the incremental caution coming, from your perspective, on the timing of the recovery? And what are some of the things you're seeing out there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I think, one, the caution is we've seen this game play before. Two, I think when we look at the commercial market and where we're exposed in terms of the institutional, I mean, we sell into all the different markets, but institutional, we're a little bit more overweight to. We really haven't seen much move in terms of project orders. I think the channel is encouraged because they are seeing more design activity being done, more quotation activity being put into the marketplace, so they've obviously moved forward and taken a position on that. We are just being cautious, with a low single-digit growth expectation, that, that market could be a little bit slower to ramp up. And certainly, some of the trends coming out at the end of 2013, with the Architectural Billing Index coming down a couple of months in a row, and just some of the external commentary says that there is still enough apprehension around the market that counting on it being at a high rate of growth is probably not the right thing to do right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, can you just provide a little more specificity around the $40 million to $50 million in restructuring spend for '14? In the slides, you talked about, over the course of '12 and '13, there was a rift of about 8%. You closed 24 facilities. What's sort of this next wave entail, if you will, and will this be the conclusion of it in '14?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I think our expectation, Matt, is that we will substantially get through the majority of the work. I think if I look back a couple of years ago, we were expecting a market that was going to grow 4% to 6%, and it's actually contracted. And so we've been very aggressive about going in and really surgically addressing the cost structure. I think in light of the performance over the past couple of years and the new structure that we put in place in the latter part of 2013, we feel like these actions, which gets to that total workforce reduction, are going to essentially conclude the majority of what we would need to do. Now we're always going to be looking for opportunities to go in and surgically get at the cost base, but in terms of the large programs, I definitely think this is going to be some of the bigger areas that we'll go.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just a follow-up question. If you look at the free cash flow improvement, from roughly $200 million to upwards of $310 million to $345 million, I think, how much of that change is coming from working capital? And I guess working capital as a percent of sales is around 24%. What should that be longer term?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, I think longer term, we would expect to have that, in terms of what the industry operates at, probably in the 22% range. And if you look 2 or 3 years ago, that's where we essentially were. It's been this -- really over the past year or so that we've seen the working capital bubble up a bit. So there's going to be a substantial portion of the improvement in 2014 that comes from that. We're talking about taking our working capital from just over 24% down to about 23%, and that equates for basically about $40 million, about 1 turn of revenue. We've got pretty detailed plans behind what we're doing there. Steve and I are engaging more deeply with the businesses on a monthly and quarterly basis. But we've got plans identified around the inventory side and the receivables side, and we're going after the payables side in terms of getting more robust around our supplier payment term management process. Long term, we'd like to see working capital get down into the high teens. We think that's the hallmark of a very well-run company, but we clearly have a ways to go. So right now, our sights are setting on reversing the trajectory which we saw in the fourth quarter. We saw ourselves get back down to levels that we had earlier in the year on improving revenue trends, which was a good thing. And we're going to continue to drive that into 2014.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just starting off on the lean and sourcing side of that, you've been taking about $100 million out of that a year. You're talking about, I think, approaching that in a little different and a little more aggressive way. Can you continue to take $100 million of cost out through lean and sourcing in the medium to long term? Or have we picked some of the low-hanging fruit there and that number needs to come down over time?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, it needs -- and obviously, the answer of that is yes. We're not at any asymptotic point on lean. The better you get, the better you can get. So clearly, there may be a point of diminishing returns at some point, but not for the near future. When you think about it, if you look at our material savings as a percent of spend, you look at our total net productivity and you look at our SG&A and even working capital, as Mike mentioned, we've got opportunity. So I would say I would love to entertain that question a couple of years from now, but for right now, I don't think that there's a limit on our opportunity. There's obviously limits on your organizational capacity to execute in a given amount of time, but if you take a look at the operating metrics we're turning in for full year '14, we've certainly got opportunity for further improvement.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I think you partially addressed it there. You're talking about a new targeted global sourcing organization. How is the talent level there? Are you able to fill everything you need internally there, or do you need to bring in some talent to round that out?
Steven R. Loranger: It's a bit of both. We've got some awfully good talent in our sourcing organization throughout the world. We will probably bring in some selective people. We've recently hired a gentleman that comes out of Mercedes-Benz and a couple of other folks that come out of the automotive industry as well. So we'll probably be selectively looking for some help on the outside. We've got a lot to work with. The biggest challenge we have is to integrate our sourcing activities so that we can take advantage of commodity purchasing and long-term contracting across the diversity of our businesses. We know the opportunity is there. We do some of that today, of course, so we've got some selected sourcing and commodity groups. We just believe we can do so much more.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And my last question, 3% into R&D, which is, I guess, percentage-wise, a fair decline from 2013. Was 2013 overspent on growth investments, R&D investments, and 2014 is more rightsizing it? Or are you cutting back just in soft markets, and you would intend to grow that? And kind of what's the right level, long term, for the company?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, we're actually spending a little bit more on a dollar basis in 2014, call it $115 million versus just over $100 million in 2013. So I think more than anything, it's more a factor of the revenue growth dampening the percentage. Our plan is to continue to invest, and we're obviously doing a lot more to prioritize the investment. The area that you do see our investment coming down is around CapEx, coming down to about 3% of revenue, and that is...
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sorry, it was CapEx that I meant.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so for CapEx, CapEx is coming down. It really reflects some of the onetime items that we had to deal with in 2012 and 2013 coming out as a new company, primarily getting into a new headquarters per the spin agreement, as well as disconnecting from several systems that we were leveraging from ITT. I feel like we're through that. 3% still feels a little high to me. We're still doing a lot around our dewatering rental bank globally. And so over the next year or 2, I would anticipate it continuing to come down a bit. We're still at a positive reinvestment ratio, so we're still in a positive trajectory from that standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: A couple of questions, maybe just starting with Q1 guidance. I know, Mike, you want to stay away from this a little bit. But just thinking about kind of modest organic growth in Q1, I mean, you kind of highlighted there were some tough comps from Superstorm Sandy and dewatering, and there's an extra -- or 1 less day of selling. But at the same time, I mean, you're looking at a negative comparison. I mean, you were down over 7% in Q1 of '13, and obviously, you did a good job exiting the year at fairly decent rates. I'm just curious, maybe there's some other items that you could just kind of provide color on that kind of support the notion that only 1% to 3% is where it should be.
Michael T. Speetzen: You bet. Yes, I made some comments in my prepared remarks about our ending backlog being up 16% versus where we were last year, which is certainly encouraging from a full year perspective. One stat that I didn't provide was our Q1 shippable backlog. It's essentially flat to where we were last year. And I think when you think about the overall revenue guidance, it is a bit conservative given the volatility we've seen in the market, and I think you see that playing out from quarter-to-quarter. Our January performance has essentially lined up consistent with that in terms of that flat year-over-year performance, although we are comparing against last year, which was down substantially. The initial indications for what we anticipate seeing in the first quarter are pretty consistent with some of the comments that I had made. I think it's important to also think about price as a headwind as we go into the first quarter relative to where we were in the first quarter of 2013. Despite all that, we do anticipate seeing our margins expand, and I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about margins being up around 100 basis points.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got it. And then just secondly, just thinking about the full year guidance, I mean, if I remove the expected savings from restructuring that you highlighted, the $35 million -- you talked about higher R&D. I think on prices, you're saying about a 50 basis point headwind. Productivity is offsetting inflation. If I kind of just dial down to what your core -- what you're suggesting for core volume, you're looking at conversion of well over -- or easily over 40%. Actually, I mean, if I look at Q1, it looks like the conversion on your volumes were probably less, maybe around the 10% area, if I exclude some of the investments and the European headquarter investments as well. I'm just curious, why is the incremental on the core volume -- maybe can you comment on maybe why Q4 was fairly weak and why, 2014, the core volume conversions get that much better?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So I guess you had -- there was a lot in there, so let me kind of step back. Let me talk about 2014 versus '13, and then I'll come back. And I think when you strip out the restructuring and you get to the core underlying incrementals that we're anticipating in 2014, so the core operations of the business, it's around 30%, which is quite strong given the fact that we're actually facing what we anticipate is negative price contribution. And again, a lot of that has to do with the mix. We're anticipating a higher growth rate coming out of our Water Infrastructure business, and we're building off of the cost base that we've worked on over the past couple of years, so we get that nice volume leverage off of the fixed cost position that we're in. If you look at our fourth quarter, we were about 20% on the face from an incremental standpoint. There were a couple of items that we had to contend with within the quarter. They were small, but when you add them in, they make a difference. We had some cost issues on a project coming out of India that was worth a couple of million dollars. And then coming out of Europe, we had low-margin project shipments in the fourth quarter that were overweight relative to what they typically are, and so that diluted the margins down. All in, we still had over 20% incremental, so we still feel pretty good about that, excluding restructuring and all the favorable benefits that we had built in the quarter.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Am I interpreting wrong, though? I mean, if I'm looking, for instance, at your Water Infrastructure, you're saying that the volume mix and other was a 50 basis point headwind, Euro headquarters was 30 basis point headwind and this whole investment was 10 basis points, so obviously, there's a 20 basis points relative headwind on your volume. So I mean, I guess that would suggest that your margin is probably less than 16.5% on that segment. Is that the wrong way to interpret it? I guess I just wanted to get a little clarity on how to read that.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, no, like I said, there were 2 things that gave us a bit of a headwind. It's the additional cost in our India project, which shows up in Water Infrastructure, as well as the projects that shipped out of Europe at a low-margin rate, which again is Water Infrastructure. So I think that's what's contributing to the dynamic you're pointing out.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano of Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just maybe anecdotally, can you talk about how you see the size incrementally in the municipal budgets in U.S. and Europe '14 versus '13 and then how your margins tend to be levered to the size change year-on-year? Because, I mean, we talk here, your operating margins, you say 80 to 140 bps improvement. And the restructuring alone, it looks like, on a $4 billion revenue basis, somewhere around $90 million. So I just want to see how that relationship -- kind of how you see that playing out.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so I guess just backing up and talking about the muni market overall, we're not anticipating a significant change in the overall budgets. I think if we start to see that movement, it will more than likely occur in the middle of 2014. And given the long order lead nature of our business, it will typically result in something that's more favorable in 2014 -- 2015, I'm sorry. So there is a leverage component. And I would say, when you think about the margin performance between our segments, you've got to remember that Water Infrastructure, obviously, is heavily weighted to public utilities. Within Water Infrastructure, it's a tale of 2 different developed markets. You have the U.S., which goes through more distribution, and Europe, which goes through more of a direct channel. So you end up with a little bit different margin leverage equation when you look at it from that perspective. I think the other thing to take into consideration when you think about that basis point improvement year-over-year is price is a headwind. So we're flipping to a negative 50 basis point impact from pricing versus what we have historically seen, anywhere from 10 basis points this past year to as much as almost 200 basis points in years past. So we're offsetting that, as Steve mentioned earlier in the call, with aggressive cost actions, but some of that is getting diluted by the pricing pressure we're seeing in the market.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Do you think, if you start seeing some of that budgetary positivity towards the second half of the year, does that have -- would impacting that price dynamic?
Michael T. Speetzen: It really depends. I think first of all, it's probably not going to have an overly dramatic effect on our business initially, meaning most of that would probably get booked as business that has anywhere from a 6-, 9- to 12-month lead time. Certainly, an improving market is going to help on the price side. As the capacity utilization starts to improve in the industry, the competitive dynamics take on a different shape, and so we should start to see pricing move in the right trajectory. But again, we've been conservative, assuming that we're not going to see that type of dynamic play out, and that's why we've essentially built in assuming that we're going to have price pressure through 2014.
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, okay. So let me just close the call out. We've gone a couple of minutes long here. I just want to thank all of you for your interest in the company and for your support as we transition from a challenging 2013 to what we believe is going to be a very, very solid and attractive 2014. We've got a good plan in place. We've got, more importantly, a very, very -- an excellent team that's going to execute it, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. So we'll be in touch throughout the season on this and looking forward to talking to you at our next earnings call. But in the meantime, we're going to have our heads down. We're going to stay busy on executing this plan and, hopefully, continue to drive the kind of performance that we know we're capable of. So I want to thank you all and wish you well. We'll talk to you next. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Steven R. Loranger: Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm now 50 days into my tenure at Xylem and I've managed to cover a lot of territory. Let me start by saying that I am thrilled by the dedicated team that we have here. And likewise, I'm very excited by the significant growth opportunities in front of us and especially, our team's performance in this third quarter. I'm going to offer a little more detail on what I've seen and how we're prioritizing in a moment, but let's first start with the third quarter results. We achieved revenue of $965 million, up organically for the first time since the third quarter of last year. We booked orders of $955 million, up 6% organically over 2012. Our view is that some market conditions are showing stabilization and we could see some slight improvement in the European public utility and industrial markets as we look ahead. While we are cautiously optimistic on these markets, we are very proud of our sales teams, who continue to drive hard in this environment. Their focused efforts, along with a slightly improved Europe, were significant factors behind the pickup in revenue and orders this quarter. Equally important is the progress we're making with improved operational performance. Our operating margin was up 330 basis points sequentially from the second quarter, or up 60 basis points year-over-year. This represents record margin performance for the business since spinning out from ITT 2 years ago. We clearly see the benefit derived from our earlier restructuring actions, and we are delivering better volume leverage. We also drove incremental improvement by executing on the second phase of our European realignment. And these activities have significantly lowered our tax rate. And we also think that our short-term focus on business accountability and cost actions have had a positive effect. The bottom line, we realized 11% earnings per share growth over the prior year, up 36% sequentially from the second quarter. With a lot of market volatility, we have had some forecasting difficulties. And as a result, we've taken a conservative approach, not unlike our peers and other industrial companies who also see the same challenge. But over the last quarter, we've taken significant steps to improve forecasting, particularly in Europe. We have driven substantial integrated activities to add more financial discipline. And our work continues, we are not finished yet. We have improved our business visibility by streamlining processes, delayering parts of the organization and eliminating complexity. One of the key impressions I got initially was that we needed to make things simple, enable faster decision-making and clarify accountability. Yesterday, we took a logical step to streamline our European operations and further clarify individual roles. We are eliminating a redundant management level which was created by the overlay of our European regional businesses with our Water Solutions group. Because we now have excellent traction with our integrated front end in both EMEA and Asia, along with strong selling organizations in the Americas, we made a substantial move to strengthen the management of our product-focused businesses. As a result, we are eliminating Water Solutions as an umbrella value center and refocusing on 3 global P&L businesses: transport, treatment and dewatering. These 3, along with Ken Napolitano's Applied Water and Chris McIntire's Analytics units, will all access global markets through our regional selling organizations. This did create some management changes. Colin Sabol, who you know is our Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, will be transitioning to lead our global dewatering business; Chris McIntire, who has done an impressive job running Analytics, will also assume the treatment franchise; and Tomas Brannemo, who was running Global Transport within Water Solutions, will continue to run this as a standalone P&L business. Mike Kuchenbrod, who has been running Water Solutions, will leave Xylem. And I want to take this opportunity to thank Mike for his terrific 25 years of service and dedication to the company. To close out on the quarter, while we were conservative on the second half, we did deliver a strong third quarter, both with revenue and our operating metrics. We are benefiting from our restructuring and realignment actions and with better visibility, we have more confidence going forward. We do see slightly favorable conditions in emerging markets. The U.S. has remained stable for us. And Europe, albeit still slow, has improved relative to the second quarter. We're cautious in this assessment, but we do think it's slightly more positive. We have begun to prioritize our growth initiatives, continuing to invest for growth in a disciplined fashion in applications and geographies most critical to our vision. We're also targeting increased productivity by our global sourcing initiatives and Lean process improvements in the manufacturing facilities. And so I am very pleased with our team's second half response to the first half challenges. We expect our businesses to be squarely focused on execution and delivering on their commitments for the remainder of the year. And as a result, we are raising our full year guidance. Finally, in the third quarter, our board approved our $250 million share repurchase program. Since that approval, we have repurchased approximately 1 million shares and we expect to remain active with this share repurchase program. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the third quarter results and guidance. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Steve. Please go to Slide 4. Xylem's revenues were $965 million, up 4% from the prior year, primarily driven by 1% organic growth and an additional 2% from acquisitions. Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and region. First, in our largest end market, Industrial, organic revenue was up 1%. Europe was up low single-digits due to increased demand for dewatering applications, driven by construction activity in Germany and mining strength in the Nordics. The U.S. was down low single-digits, as slow mining and construction markets were only partially offset by an uptick in demand for frac-ing dewatering applications. Public utilities also increased 1%, year-over-year, as growth in Asia Pac and Europe offset a low single-digit decline in the U.S. Consistent with past quarters, demand related to CapEx projects remained weak in developed markets, while continue to see stability in demand associated with MRO activities. As developing countries are at an earlier stage of building out and upgrading water and wastewater networks, we continue to see growth in CapEx-related projects, which, for example, is driving strong growth for us in China. Commercial building services revenue was up 8% compared to the same period in 2012, when revenues were down a similar magnitude. Promotional activities in the U.S. contributed to growth in the face of continued weak end market conditions. Increased construction activity drove favorable results in Europe, while we continued to see strong demand in emerging markets. Residential building services revenue was down 7% year-over-year, driven by a decline in the U.S. groundwater market and continued difficult market conditions in Southern Europe. And lastly, agricultural was up 2%, driven by strength in the Western U.S. states. Let me spend just a few minutes highlighting our overall geographic performance. Europe grew 1% organically, as strength across most of the region was partially offset by continued weakness in the South. Generally, our performance was significantly better than our previous expectations. This was driven by 3 main factors. First, we saw improved sales execution under the newly integrated European sales organization and from internal sales initiatives, such as Find More, Win More, Keep More. Second, market conditions modestly improved outside of Southern Europe. And lastly, we admittedly had a conservative forecast following the significant decline we experienced in the second quarter. U.S. was down 1%, driven by the mix and market dynamics I highlighted earlier. And while sequestration and the government shutdown did not have a significant impact on our business overall, they did affect our Analytics platform, which does serve various federal agencies in the research market, which were unfavorably impacted. Emerging markets grew 8% organically in the third quarter, including continued double-digit growth in both Russia and China. Before turning to our operational performance, I'll highlight that similar to prior quarters, we've excluded restructuring and realignment costs. In the third quarter, we've excluded $20 million of one-time special charges, including the costs associated with the CEO transition, including legal, PR and search fees, and the resolution of legal settlement associated with the use of the Xylem mark. More information regarding the settlement will be provided in our quarterly filing later today. So now turning to our operating income. We delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $130 million was up $10 million or 8% over last year. And margins reached 13.5%, our highest mark since spinning out from ITT. As expected, we had strong incremental margins of 29% for the quarter, even after absorbing negative foreign exchange and acquisition impacts, as well as continued investments in the business. Incremental volume leverage offset higher G&A costs for the European headquarters, pension expense and unfavorable mix. Price pressure has become a bigger challenge to our growth and in the quarter, it was a 30 basis point headwind against the overall operating margin improvement. Difficult market conditions, particularly in the public utility, industrial and commercial end markets, have driven overcapacity in the market and, as a result, has lead to a more competitive environment. Looking forward, the pricing environment is likely to remain challenged as long as this economic backdrop persists. Offsetting the price pressure were cost reduction activities, which drove 350 basis points of margin improvement, including $7 million of restructuring savings from actions executed in 2012 and 2013. Inflation had a 210 basis point negative impact on operating margin, while foreign exchange movements subtracted 10 basis points. In addition, acquisitions were dilutive to margins by 40 basis points as they contributed revenue but no income in this stage of integration. In summary, operating margins increased 60 basis points despite considerable headwinds from price, a dilutive short-term impact of acquisitions and the investments that we continue to make in order to grow the business over the long term. Turning to Slide 5. This slide shows our EPS performance for the third quarter. We're reporting $0.49 of EPS, up $0.05 or 11% from the prior year, and 36% on a quarterly sequential basis. Core operations drove strong operating margin improvement, contributing $0.04, driven primarily by organic volume growth, combined with good execution on productivity and cost management. Restructuring savings provided a $0.03 benefit. Ongoing European realignment actions and the associated sustainable tax benefit from a lower tax rate provided a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a $0.02 unfavorable impact of mix and price, as well as one-time separation costs and pension headwind of $0.01. Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $619 million, up 5% over the prior year on a constant currency basis, and up 1% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth. Transport grew 2%, primarily driven by mid single-digit growth in Europe, as strength in Northern and Central Europe more than offset weakness in Southern Europe in the quarter. Transport revenue in the U.S. was flat, as strong demand for dewatering applications, including frac-ing related activity, was offset by declines in CapEx spending. Treatment revenues declined 2%, as strong double-digit growth in Asia Pac, including China, which was up over 30%, did not fully offset the ongoing weak demand environment in the developed markets. Both the U.S. and Europe continued to experience funding constraints and associated project delays. Our European treatment results were also impacted by the decline in the biogas market and the comparison to 2012,which had strong shipments in the U.K. with the regulatory spending cycle. And lastly, Test revenues were flat as growth in Europe and the Middle East was offset by sequestration-related softness in the U.S. Operating margins came in at 15.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. We delivered very strong incremental margins despite significant price headwind, unfavorable foreign exchange and acquisition impacts. This also included increased investment in growth initiatives and higher pension expense. With 2% growth in Europe, we benefited from the same factors that drove high decremental margins in Q2, mainly volume leverage versus the fixed costs associated with the European direct sales structure in this segment. Let me now turn to Slide #7 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 2%, both on a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was up 1% as strong commercial performance discussed earlier was offset by a decline in residential-related sales. In particular, U.S. groundwater sales were weak as market share gains could not offset the decline in the U.S. groundwater market. Industrial water was up 2%. Sales in China were particularly strong on the back of demand for our products used in offshore oil and gas fire pump applications. And lastly, irrigation was up 2%, with the U.S. up 7% as weather conditions continued to drive strong demand in the West. Operating margin was 12.2%, a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year. While cost reduction initiatives more than offset inflation, lower-priced realization and negative mix drove margins down slightly. Mix was impacted by 2 factors. One, revenue was down 1% in Europe, which is where we carry higher fixed selling costs. And two, we saw a 13% increase in emerging markets, where our margins, in general, are slightly lower. Now, let me turn to Slide 8 to review our financial position. Xylem maintained a strong cash position with a balance of $394 million at the end of the third quarter, and the majority is held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. Our net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 27%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we've invested $172 million into acquisitions and CapEx. Additionally, we've returned $107 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, up substantially from $58 million in 2012. The 2 key drivers here were the 15% increase in dividends we announced earlier this year and the ramp-up of share repurchase activity. Free cash flow was $72 million year-to-date and while down from the prior year, remain strong and at a level consistent with our capital deployment strategy. The decline in free cash flow year-to-date versus the same period of 2012 is driven by lower income, unfavorable working capital and higher restructuring payments. As a percentage of revenue, operating working capital increased 170 basis points, driven by a number of factors this quarter. First, we had a particularly strong September, relative to the rest of the third quarter, which resulted in a higher level of receivables that we expect to collect in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to hold higher-than-normal levels of inventory in order to compensate for shorter customer lead times. And finally, customer payment times continue to be elongated, although we have not experienced any significant bad debts associated with these length in payment durations. Please turn to Slide No. 9, and I'll cover our guidance update in detail. As Steve mentioned earlier, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance and the anticipated improvement driven by internal growth and cost savings initiatives. As you can see from the chart, we are raising our full year revenue expectations by $50 million, which brings our full year revenue projections up to $3.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this revision includes our third quarter results, which was approximately $35 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS better than we expected. The additional $15 million of revenue and $0.08 of EPS is attributable to our improved outlook for the fourth quarter. With respect to revenue, our guidance implies fourth quarter organic growth of 1% and reflects what we think are stabilizing conditions we have seen in Europe, particularly with the public utility and industrial markets, partially offset by lower revenue from residential applications in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we have assumed continued growth in emerging markets and the conditions in the U.S. do not improve from what we've seen in the past quarter. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint, which is driven by an increased focus on execution and continued disciplined cost management. Let me point out that our guidance reflects the fact that we are on track to deliver the restructuring realignment benefits and incremental cost savings I discussed in our last earnings call. In summary, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $3.8 billion and EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.65. Please turn to Slide 10. Let me highlight just a few items I haven't covered yet. First, we still expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We anticipate a normal seasonal increase in free cash flow generation and conversion on our last quarter of the year, coupled with higher receivable collections resulting from the strong sales we experienced in September. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21% for the year, consistent with our previous guidance. This is indicative of the progress against the realignment initiatives we started earlier this year. We expect our share count to be approximately 186 million for the full year calculation, but down to 185 million for purposes of the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of approximately $25 million deployed towards repurchases during the third quarter and an assumed similar outlay with our approved program in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we expect restructuring and realignment costs to be in the range of $65 million to $80 million. With that, operator, we can now begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Steve, welcome back to the front lines.
Steven R. Loranger: Thank you, Deane. It's great to be back.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right, so I wanted to hit you with the first question, and this is kind of like a high-quality problem, to have to answer this question. And it's, how would you characterize the upside this quarter? I mean, we've gotten some of the nitty-gritties in terms of where the upside is -- how it has been reported, but maybe you can characterize it. Is this too much conservativeness in the previous guidance? Is this a catch-up from some of the second quarter? And -- or are we at this meaningful inflection point where we're now seeing some projects being released?
Steven R. Loranger: Deane, the real answer to that question is all of the above. And we had a number of dynamics occurring, which came together nicely. First and foremost, I think that previously, Gretchen and the team have done a really nice job in the summertime of outlining the necessary cost reductions that were needed to make the third and fourth quarter, with a relatively sluggish top line. The teams executed against those cost benefits. So we certainly got every bit of what we're looking for. Second of all, there had been some ongoing restructuring, as you know, in the 2012, 2013, time frame, and that's coming through. We did see some slight favorability in markets, although we're not going to forecast any real trend here, these markets have been moving around. But certainly, the markets were a little bit favorable, but we also had our sales teams out there really working hard. We put a lot of pressure to go get the order and focus, and the teams did a good job. And then finally, there was certainly some conservatism. When the July forecast was announced, the team really wanted to make sure that we had a number that we could make. So it really was all of the above. You take a little conservatism out of it, and what I'm mostly pleased about, is just really the operating performance of the teams, both on the sales line and the operational execution line.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then just as a follow-up, make sure I understood some of the nuances here within the realignment. And if you could just clarify about Water Analytics. Because, Steve, when you put this business together back in ITT, you talked about the transportation -- or transport, treatment and test, the 3 Ts of water. And so analytics seems to be not one of the cornerstones within the 3 businesses. So just clarify where Water Analytics is.
Steven R. Loranger: Okay, fine. First of all, on transport and treatment and dewatering, the purpose of associating all those underneath the umbrella of what was water, wastewater and later water solutions, was less about the relatedness of operations and the product technology, and more about the ability for Water Solutions to enable access to a global market. So in the presence of our integrated front end, which is we've essentially migrated in most of our regions, we now can go back, with respect to running really, really efficient product businesses in those dimensions. Analytics or Test remain separate underneath Chris McIntire, and as part of this -- as it has been. So there's no change there. But as part of this, Chris has been doing an outstanding job, and there is some more relatedness with some of the treatment technology and some of the tests. And we invited Chris to be the leader over both of those franchises.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's terrific, okay. That's still part of this. So we should think of it as part of the Treatment division?
Steven R. Loranger: Well, think about Chris McIntire as leading both the analytics/test and the treatment businesses now yes.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that makes all kinds of sense. And just a special shout-out, that's great to see Colin getting an operating role.
Steven R. Loranger: And we're thrilled by the change in leaderships. Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I think, Mike, on Slide 10, you talked about the net cost savings in '13 being in the range of $14 million to $15 million. Based upon what you're doing this year and anything left over from '12, if you will, what would be the incremental cost saving benefits that we should expect for '14, based on stuff done as of year end -- as of the end of the year here?
Michael T. Speetzen: So we -- consistent with what we've talked in the past, there's a few components to that. First, the carryover restructuring is going to be in the range of about $15 million. In addition to that, as we guided, there were still some one-time spend costs that we were dealing with this year. The 2 biggest drivers being IT-related costs, as well as moving our corporate headquarters, and that's about $5 million. So those 2 items gave about $20 million. And then as we indicated in our last discussion, there's an additional $15 million related to the cost actions that we're taking here in the second half that will play out into 2014. And what I would say is, Steve talked to it a little bit in the upfront comments, we're continuing to work for more. I think the key component that we want to signal is, even with a flat top line in 2014, we feel confident we can deliver EPS growth in 2014.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just one sort of follow-up on what you're doing, at least in the near term, from a cost standpoint. I mean, have you cannibalized any growth investments? Have you substantially throttled back discretionary spending? Can you talk about maybe some of the more temporary levers you may or may not be pulling right now?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, there's a couple of things. I mean, one, we're clearly seeing a lower level of inflation, and that has helped. I mean, we've gone from some just under 3% in the first quarter. We're down near around 2% in the third quarter. So there's a been little bit of help from that. But there's certainly been a mixture. I would say that there were some short-term measures that we took. Nothing, from my perspective, that's damaging the business. I think it was prudent cost management in light of a volatile top line. But we are also working right now to identify what are more permanent cost reductions, as we head into 2014, as Steve highlighted. We've got opportunities around global sourcing, we've got opportunities around the Lean and Six Sigma avenues relative to our business. And the other key point I'd make is we continue to invest in the business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it continues to be a slight headwind relative to margin performance through the third quarter. So one thing we've made sure of is we're not going to do anything that damages the long-term potential of the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're looking for in a new CEO? I mean, are you looking for a restructuring person? Are you looking for somebody with water experience? And just give us a sense of what type of profile you're looking for.
Steven R. Loranger: Well, first of all, the CEO search is well underway, and I don't have anything definitive to say there. But clearly, Xylem is a company that has just terrific global assets. You guys know about our technology, our market and customer reach around the world and some really, really good supply chains. And we think that clearly, the opportunities in front of the company are every bit as rich as they were when we created the spinout. So the notion about having a very, very strong global product business that can access these markets and become greater than the sum of the parts, is still in the front of our minds. And clearly, a CEO who has the leadership, the vision and the track record of experience in that dimension would be first and foremost.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair point. When you think about, Steve, what's happened over the -- since the spinoff, clearly Xylem has been the most disappointing of the 3, and arguably had the most promise, really. What's gone wrong? Are you just behind -- did the restructuring come too late for the slow global macro? Just give us a sense of the playbook to kind of what went wrong, so we can get a better sense of what you're going to change in the near term.
Steven R. Loranger: Well, I think focusing on where we're going in the future is really responsive to that question. We clearly have had some challenges with these markets. And we have such a broad portfolio. I think what we do need to do is to focus and re-prioritize both our investments and growth activities in a way that can create more total value. As an example, we really do like the Flygt product line. That's been a fabulous product line. We're going to be increasing some investments in that to continue to drive competitive advantage in the transport segment. The same thing in the analytics and the emerging markets, as Mike had mentioned. The operative component there is to really prioritize those investments where they make -- where they matter the most to execute our vision around Let's Solve Water. So that's a big piece of, I think, where we need to go in the future. The second big piece really just has to do with the structure and efficiency of the company. I mean, with these markets, we have diluted operating margin, as you well know. And the team collectively have come to the conclusion that we simply need to get back up to the level of operating metrics, that we know that we're capable of, in a hurry. And so that really induces strategies like a global strategic sourcing organization of simplified and streamlined, product-line focused, an integrated front end that, quite frankly, not only is more capable than the independent selling organizations, but it can -- has the potential of being more efficient. And so that's a lot to talk about, but it has to do with de-leveling, organizational simplicity and clarification. And I think all those things are going to go into the operating efficiencies that we know are possible in front of us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Maybe first, just with Mike, just trying to get a better sense of how the quarter, particularly in infrastructure, Water Infrastructure, progressed sequentially. You had decent or modest top line growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the drop-through to operating profit was just pretty extraordinary. I know you had sequentially, I think, you were suggesting $10 million, $11 million or so of incremental restructuring benefits hitting Q3 versus Q2. But even kind of removing that, you're looking at close to 100% drop-through of the revenue. Maybe can you just talk about were there other factors, what the other contributing factors were there, so we get a sense of how that played out.
Michael T. Speetzen: Actually, this gets back to, I think, one of the questions that was asked earlier in terms of the conservatism in the forecast. I guess a couple of comments I'd make is, when we put our guidance out after second quarter, the one thing we were looking at is we were looking at July results, which were relatively weak and supported a -- obviously, a much lower view of the trajectory we were headed on. So I think the first statement I'd make is the momentum started to build towards the end of July. And then clearly, as we got into August, it got a little bit more difficult to see, just given the dynamics that go on in Europe. But it was clear that we were pulsing at a level that would suggest that we were going to have stronger revenue performance. I think given the dynamics we were facing, one of the things that we did is not only did we have the cost actions identified, we had outlined what we called an EPS assurance plan. So essentially, we had identified additional cost activity to basically go and execute if the revenue didn't materialize. So essentially, we ran a scenario that said, what if we're flat sequentially for the first to second half? What would we need to do to ensure that we got to our EPS range? So when I look at what happened in the third quarter, we got the revenue growth that was targeted, albeit, it came a little bit late in the quarter. And we also executed on the additional cost actions, and so you got the double benefit of those. And then you're obviously correct in the restructuring kicked in substantially in the third quarter, and we've been signaling that throughout the first half relative to all the activities that we undertook in the first and second quarter, relative to primarily what is our European realignment.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just secondly, Q4 revenues at $965 million. So flat sequentially. I think typically, we've seen over the last several years when you roll everything up, you did have anywhere between a 5% and a 15% uptick on a sequential basis, but you're looking for flat now. Is that -- and also I think you've spoken before about the utility and municipal spending being very Q4 loaded. Is that some conservatism there, or was there some pull forward of revenue into Q3 from Q4? If you could touch on it, that would be helpful.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I wouldn't characterize it as a pull forward, but definitely, we saw a very strong third quarter. Quite frankly, it was actually opposite of what we've typically seen, which is third quarter drops from the second quarter. So admittedly, there is a little bit of conservatism in the fourth quarter. If you look at the upper end of our range, it's more indicative of what you would typically see in terms of the seasonality uplift. The one comment I would make is, our backlog position going into the fourth quarter has increased about 13% from what we had going into the third quarter. So that's obviously a very good indicator and gives us confidence. But at the same time, as Steve highlighted, these markets have been volatile. We've been dealing with this for the past 1.5 year, and it's too early to call it a trend. We're optimistic and we'll continue to drive, and if it's there, we're going to get it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Can we just go back to visibility, in general, that you have and the forecasting issues, Steve, that you mentioned? I understand having a conservative forecast coming off a bad June and early July, like you did as we went into Q3. But are there actual forecasting issues that you had that have now been fixed? I think you mentioned Europe in the context of your new management change. But can you just address that? What's different or improved that allows you, going forward, to have better visibility and then allows investors to have more confidence in the guidance that you're giving?
Steven R. Loranger: Well, thank you. The forecasting issues that I talked about were principally in the creation of an integrated regional business and the integrated front end, particularly in Europe, to some degree in some of the other regions. Where in order to make that effective and put the accountability out at the point of sale, there was a lot of moving parts internally on the forecast with respect to things like transfer pricing and cost allocations. And so we just finished about 9 months of organizational change in that area, which made it difficult to see as clearly as we wanted to. We've had outstanding actual cost and revenue visibility, but that's always where we're looking. So quite frankly, it was just a lot of financial discipline, some blocking and tackling, refining of formats and processes and understanding of things like cost allocations and transfer pricing levels that, to some degree, have been -- with good financial work with Mike and his team, have just kind of gone through the system. So not that we are finished in that area, but we do feel better. Mike, do you want to add to that?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I guess the only thing I'd add is the organizational change that Steve talked about, I think, puts us closer to the point of impact and being able to see the inner workings of the business. Because the thing I'll go back to is, we are improving visibility and our ability to have good financial discipline, but our business is heavy short-cycle. And so it's important for us to be close to those trends to understand what's going on in the marketplace on a real time. And we go into any given quarter with less than 50% of our shipments sitting in backlog. And so I think that's always an important piece to keep in mind. But I think the discipline, the financial changes that we've made, I think the organizational change that Steve announced, is going to put everything closer to the point of impact, and I think we'll have a lot greater visibility and accountability.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And if I can just follow up. In terms of the short-cycle nature, Mike, I think last quarter, we were still talking about de-stocking at your distributors and that's a big chunk of your business, seeing smaller orders and less frequent orders and therefore, you're carrying more inventory. So in the context of your bookings being better now and the momentum starting to build in late July, are you seeing any notable change on that front?
Michael T. Speetzen: I wouldn't say any notable change. I would say, in our dewatering business, we saw the distributors start to restock. We had been dealing with them de-stocking for the past couple of quarters. And I think that's shown up in the positive results we've seen in our dewatering business, which is -- has been on a nice, steady growth trajectory. And I'd say, in our commercial segment, there's clearly been a strong performance there. Resi continues to be -- it was down for us here in the third quarter. The groundwater market, we're primarily servicing the well water market, as well as boiler circulators, and we've seen a little bit of downward movement there. But I wouldn't characterize that we've seen some big shift, and I would not anticipate, in the near term, seeing the distributors go back into a significant restocking mode.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: With increased emphasis on redeploying some capital back to shareholders, can you just talk about how that impacts your thoughts around M&A? And then as you look out at longer-term targets, if you do see acquisitions coming in at less than that, call it, 2.4% range or organic growth a little below, do you think you can make that up through better execution and operating performance here?
Steven R. Loranger: Well, most certainly, we think the very best acquisition that we have in front of us right now is Xylem's stock. So you can expect us to continue to deploy there. Also, we have had some operating concerns, as we've been talking about the whole call, and we thought it prudent to take a pause on some of the actual acquisitions. We're continuing to cultivate and we still have a rich pipeline. And to the note of your question, yes, with respect to some of the operating metrics we're forecasting in free cash flow generation, we will be able to continue to redeploy capital in the share repurchase and generate capacity for the acquisitions. And we expect, over the next quarter or so, as things settle down, we'll get back into the market. We're actually committed to meeting our long-term targets that you're all aware of in terms of operating margin, EPS and ROIC. So that's all highly intact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I was hoping I could follow up a little bit on Europe, sort of the upside surprise for the quarter for -- at least for us. Maybe you can walk us through in terms of the -- what you're seeing in Europe. Were a large number of orders just released? Was there a push? And then maybe you could talk about, I think you've implied that there was a push for orders in September. Was that Europe, was it across the board? And what's the implication for margins going forward? Was that at the expense of margins, or is it really kind of what we've been seeing?
Steven R. Loranger: Yes, so let me talk just a little about the -- I'd say, the overarching dynamics around Europe. I mean, we certainly had seen some dynamics, as I talked about in the last call, around public utilities pulling back. And as evidenced by our overall aftermarket performance, which was up low single-digits, we've seen a return to, well, say, a more normal pattern around the break fix, the operating maintenance, from a public utility standpoint. In the industrial side, I think there was a de-cycling there in the first half, and I think with more positive signs in Europe, in general, we've seen things -- I wouldn't say that I'd call it a recovery. I would say things are just starting to move again. And then certainly, the construction market has been favorable, specifically in areas like Germany. And that's helped our commercial business, as well as our dewatering business as we look at those dynamics. From a margin standpoint, I guess I'd say a couple of things. One, with the recovery in Europe, that's actually helped because as I mentioned, we've got impacted pretty heavily in the second quarter, given our fixed cost structure in Europe, which is, on average, 7 to 10 points higher from an SG&A standpoint because of our direct selling channel. Obviously, with the return of volume in Europe, that helps us more than cover those costs, and you saw that come through in the third quarter results. The one dynamic we are facing, which we talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks, is pricing. That is causing some top line pressure to the tune of about 30, 40 basis points in the third quarter. I don't think that it's anything atypical of what the competitors are seeing either. So I don't think there's any distortions in the market, nor do I think we've done anything to gain volume. But I do think that's going to continue to be a headwind for us. I think just given the overcapacity across public utility in the industrial space, that's going to continue to weigh a little bit on margins. But as Steve indicated, we've got ample opportunity to go out and drive improvements in our sourcing, in our Lean, value-based, Six Sigma. So we'll be able to go out and use that as an advantage to offset some of those headwinds.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Mike, that's helpful. And I was also trying to see if there was any sort of -- and I think you made some commentary around potential pull forward, but when you -- when Steve mentioned the push for orders in September, did that mean at lower margins, were there some sort of special terms? Was anything unusual or different that took place in September that would have taken place in any other month?
Michael T. Speetzen: We had some marketing initiatives. Like in our standard care and mixer lines, we introduced some new products and went out with some attractive new programs. But for the most part, I'm just going to say it was disciplined blocking and tackling, and getting the sales teams focused on winning more. Colin and Joe Vesey and the team have been driving a program called Find More, Win More and Keep More, which is just a series of classic, good, strong marketing activities. And they've been deploying that, and I think we've got some benefit from it.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Did you see the momentum continue in October?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, we've seen -- the comment I gave you about October is our performance from a booking standpoint has roughly been in line with the guidance that we've provided. So we've not seen anything substantially shipped in the month of October.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: How much industry overcapacity do you think there is in public utilities and industrial? In other words, how much demand do you think would have to improve to bring pricing back to more normalized levels?
Steven R. Loranger: It's hard to say that, but it's got to be several percentage points. If you just -- one way to think about it is, you go back to the 2007, 2008 timeframe and figure that the industry was probably at pretty full capacity at that point in time. And you could sort of subtract from that, what the gross markets have done since then, and probably divide that difference in half to get to the answer to your question. The half being that companies have taken out some capacity on these downsides, but not all of that.
Michael T. Speetzen: And, Jim, the only thing I'd add to that is if you look at just the U.S. water and wastewater spend as a proxy for what Steve was just walking through, it's down to levels that go back to say, 2004. And so, I think that gives you an indication of what we need to start to happen, which is essentially, we'd need to start to see fully embodied projects released. That's meaning, not just treatment projects, but projects that include transport products, pumping primarily.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research: You have obviously leading positions in many markets: transport, industrial, water, tests, building services, and regarding the pricing. And are there any of those areas where demand might be more inelastic, where customers you have a relationship with, where they'll stay and not base their decisions totally on price?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I think -- and Stewart, I think you have to almost take it segment-by-segment. I'd say that our applied water business probably has a little bit tighter curve. When you look at our Flygt business, our direct selling channel, I think gives us some ability to leverage. But again, I'm going to point back to the overcapacity in the industry, I think, has put all the competitors in a position where every bit is being competitively quoted. And so I think that's putting some pressure from a top line standpoint. Clearly, from a project business perspective, given the fact that projects are down some 15% to 20% from the height, pricing is extremely competitive and quite frankly, the fact that things are not converting from bid to actual order is indicative of the fact that folks want to have another 1 or 2 looks at pricing.
Steven R. Loranger: Some of our premier brands, such as Flygt, we probably can get some good price just simply because we represent some very high quality. But with the question earlier about some slight overcapacity in these markets, we've got great competitors out there that we're very respectful of and everyone's working hard. So price is going to continue to be an issue. But that just merely underscores the comments I made earlier about the necessity for us to drive higher levels of operating efficiencies. What I mentioned this global strategic sourcing group we're going to be establishing, that is in part in effect now, but we're going to make a holistic global group out of it. We're going to be able to substantially improve our net productivity in the areas of sourcing. That'll start adjusting our cost base in ways that are going to address some of the front end pressures. So that's why we're working on that side of the equation as well. Well, with that -- operator, is there anybody else in the queue?
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, I did have a follow-up question on your inventories, the jump in inventories for the quarter. Can you just give us a little bit more color if that was raw materials, finished goods, was it in Europe, where did it come from? It's kind of a big jump.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, there's a couple of areas, but I'd say, we're -- as I've indicated in the past, I mean we've probably impacted our inventory turns by 0.2, 0.3, in an effort to make sure that we can deal with what has been relatively volatile dynamics around the inventory delivery requirements. So it's pretty equally weighted across the businesses. And from a geography standpoint, David, I don't know that I could isolate it to one particular area. It is an area of focus. I mean, Steve and I, clearly, are not happy with the inventory, and broadly, the working capital levels that we're at today. So it's a key area of focus for us. We're going to continue to monitor it. And hopefully, as the market starts to return to some level of growth, that'll give us a little bit of pressure to be able to take some of that inventory out of the system as lead times start to move back into something that's more reasonable versus the very short nature that they are today.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And just to be clear, if the business was a -- started to get little bit better than you expected, I would have assumed that you would have been running pretty lean on inventory, given your guidance. So was there some sort of makeup at the very end and as you've got inventory out?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, I mean, like I said, we started to see order rates improving in the month of August. And I'd say that the teams were moving quickly to make sure that they were able to satisfy the promotions that we were putting out into the marketplace, as well as to support to Find, Win, Keep initiative that we had underway. So I think in light of what was a pretty disappointing level of performance in Q2, we were doing everything we could to make sure that if an order came in, we were in a position to satisfy it.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So the 90% free cash flow conversion seems fairly reasonable then, by year end?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I think so. I mean, we had some dynamics with the way the receivables came in at the end of the quarter. But that's not too out of the normal for what we see at the third quarter point.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Steven Loranger for any additional or closing remarks.
Steven R. Loranger: Well, thank you. And let me summarize what I hope everyone has ultimately taken away from this call. We do have a lot of work in progress. We're going to stay focused on doing the basics well. And clearly, we've got a lot of work in front of us. We have faced some real challenges and those challenges are not going to subside anytime in the future, but we do have the foundations, the tools and the global assets. We've got some great technology, premium brands, terrific applications, expertise with comprehensive selling and distribution channels. And I can tell you, we've got some of the greatest, talented employees of any company in our space. So we've got these assets and collectively, we will eventually overcome some of these challenges and help realize our vision. We do have 3 priorities right now. First and foremost, it should come as no surprise, we've got the entire organization working to achieve the 2013 commitments. Second, we are prioritizing our strategic initiatives to drive more top line growth, as I outlined. And finally, we're focusing both our strategy and our operating framework to accelerate and increase shareholder value, not only in 2013 and beyond. So we've taken some decisive actions to improve our performance in the face of these ongoing challenges. And I believe there's a lot that we can still do to perform better and grow faster across the businesses. And our commitment, as you would expect, is we will move as quickly as we can to make all of that happen. So with that, I want to thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Gretchen W. McClain: Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Most of you have seen the news release with our disappointing second quarter results. Today, we'd like to walk you through the numbers and of course, respond to your questions and feedback at the conclusion of the call. As outlined in our earnings release, we experienced a 3% organic decline in revenue in the second quarter. This lower-than-expected revenue, along with investments of growth and productivity, resulted in lower operating profit and led to adjusted earnings per share that were below our expectations. During today's call, we'll summarize the dynamics impacting our top line, show how they affected our financial performance and give you our outlook for the remainder of the year. Also, I'll tell you about some of the things we accomplished in the second quarter and outline the strategic and tactical actions we are taking to enhance our performance for both the short and the long term. So let's start the quarterly summary with the key driver, our revenue performance. Before jumping into the details, let's take a look at what we assumed going into the quarter. You may recall at the beginning of 2013, we were bearish on the macroeconomic conditions across Europe, and we planned accordingly. Even with this precaution, conditions have proven to be more challenging than we had anticipated. A significant portion of our business is short cycle in nature with 50% of our sales going through distribution. These dynamics coupled with customers requiring shorter lead time and distributors minimizing inventories, have led to more frequent and smaller transactions, thus limiting our short-term visibility and resulting in increased variability from month-to-month. Let me also remind you of our seasonality of our business with the fourth quarter being the largest, followed by the second quarter, and June being an especially important month for us as Europe prepares for its summer holiday. We entered the second quarter with a solid backlog, early order tracking to our expectations, and we are taking aggressive actions to close orders. While June is the strongest month of the quarter, it did not play out as we had expected. Our revenue shortfall was driven primarily by transport and treatment in our industrial and public utility market. While the revenue declines were fairly broad-based and not restricted to any one country, from a regional perspective, the most significant headwinds were in Europe. Unfortunately, our product pipeline continues to push out to the right due to the uncertainty around funding and budget constraints. We are not experiencing meaningful order cancellations, though timing of revenue, conversion is certainly -- is increasingly uncertain. And in this competitive market, we were unable to achieve our targeted price realization and face strong foreign exchange headwind. Before discussing our adjusted operating profit, I would briefly -- I'd like to briefly highlight some of the bright spots, namely: commercial, residential and agriculture. These 3 growing markets represent approximately 22% of Xylem's revenue. We continue to see strong performance in the U.S. residential market, which posted a third consecutive quarter of organic growth. Second quarter results in the U.S. were in the high teens. U.S. commercial posted 9% organic growth, providing some confidence that this market could be seeing some fundamental improvement. Agriculture was up 10% in the second quarter driven by strength in the U.S. Another bright spot in the second quarter was orders . We received more than $1 billion in orders, that's up 4% in constant currency and 1% organically, and our highest level of orders since becoming a standalone company. Sequentially, organic orders were up 5%. For the second quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was in line with seasonal trends at 1.05. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $759 million, up $36 million or 5% from the previous quarter. Our shippable backlog is up 7% year-over-year, and we expect to deliver approximately $400 million in the third quarter, and approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. Now to income. We're reporting gross margin of 38.6% for the second quarter, and operating margin of 10.2%. Relative to the prior year, these results primarily reflect lower volume and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. We are partially offsetting margin dilution with contributions from new products, from the savings realized through restructuring actions taken in 2012 and further cost reductions resulting from our Lean and global sourcing initiatives. As a result of these items and the tax benefit realized from our realignment actions, our adjusted net income was $66 million, or $0.36 per share for the second quarter. Our free cash flow performance was driven primarily by a lower income for the quarter, typical seasonality and timing of tax payment. Let's turn to Slide 4. For the remainder of the year, we have re-forecasted both the top and bottom line assumptions to reflect current market conditions, our first half result and foreign exchange headwind. We now expect revenues to decline 3% to 4% organically, that's down 4 percentage points from our previous guidance. And we expect to deliver EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Our top line revision is centered on Europe, Latin America and the Middle East growth rate being weaker than we had expected, along with a slower-than-anticipated U.S. industrial market recovery. And we expect public utility project activity to remain challenged into 2014 driven by the weak CapEx spending especially in wastewater. So what are we doing about this? Across the company, we are taking out additional cost to drive efficiency and a lower cost base in the company while staying focused on growth. We've initiated the majority of our previously announced restructuring and realignment actions. And as a result, I am confident we can deliver the full year cost savings we previously indicated, which will be in the range of $25 million to $27 million for the year. Accelerated cost-saving initiatives will drive an additional savings of approximately $0.06 per share over the balance of the year and are reflected in our revised guidance. These include aggressive cost management to drive further reductions in manufacturing costs by accelerating our Lean initiatives and tighter sourcing controls and significant cuts in discretionary spending across the company. We've already made some immediate adjustments to our cost base while protecting our best profits for growth. We are pacing investments in light of this current market environment. In addition, we are dialing back capital expenditures and resizing our acquisitions spend while still advancing our strategy. On the other side of this balanced equation are the efforts to drive top line growth. We are launching a series of compelling new products over the balance of the year and staying focused on growth in emerging markets. As always, we are evaluating all opportunities and are taking steps to position this company to be more agile and more competitive. We are leading from the front, actively meeting with our teams around the world, closely tracking progress in our critical initiatives and sending a strong message to everyone across Xylem that our performance must improve. I would like to quickly highlight some of the areas of progress against our strategic priorities for the year. Turn to Slide 5. We are sharply focused on delivering customer value and driving profitable growth through the launch of technologies that address higher order solutions. Some of these are evidenced by the following key wins. One is a large project in the UAE, to deliver a Leopold brand of filtration system, to pretreat seawater as a critical component to the desal process. In Spain, we won a $2 million project to install our newest UV disinfection system, WEDECO Duron. And we have a $1 million project with our partner, Visenti in Singapore, to help monitor the country's water infrastructure through leak detection technology. These projects are great examples of how we are leveraging our innovation, applications expertise and offering new services to get after some of the world's most challenging water issues. And we're excited by new product launches that are winning in the marketplace, and being recognized with technology innovation awards. We continue to execute our inorganic growth strategy, having completed the acquisition of Pollmann Pumpen during the second quarter. While this acquisition is small compared to those that we completed in the past, it's strategically important and squarely in line with our geographic expansion strategy in dewatering. Pollman complements our existing capacity in Germany and enables us to help better serve our customers across Europe. We have an active acquisition pipeline, and we are advancing our bolt-on strategy. Having spent $80 million on acquisitions year-to-date, we now expect to deploy up to $200 million in total this year. Lastly, we continue to focus on our business sustainability. As I've already discussed our cost saving initiatives, let me provide you an update on our regional transformation in Europe. You may recall that we opened our European headquarters office in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and completed the transition of our European Water Solutions business to the newly formed European management structure in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we moved forward with our second phase. And our Applied Water business is now operating under the new structure. And our sales companies across each country across Europe have been integrated into one Xylem team, which will result in greater efficiency and growth as we move forward. I'll wrap up later and take your questions, but for now, let me turn our call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the second quarter 2013 results in detail. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 6. Given our second quarter results, we feel it's important to walk you through our performance relative to our expectations. Organic revenue was unfavorable by 2 percentage points. Strong performance across all end markets in the U.S. was more than offset by weaker conditions in Europe, in the emerging markets, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Let me cover the market dynamics in more detail. First, we saw better-than-expected market conditions in our U.S. residential and commercial building service business, and our Ag business continued to benefit from drought conditions in the Southwest. Europe was generally weaker than expected, but most significantly down in the public utility and industrial markets. We also encountered greater-than-anticipated pricing pressure, as continued market demands challenged our ability to gain more significant price increases. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind, as we saw the U.S. dollar and Swedish krona appreciate against other currencies. The most significant impact was from the noneconomic translation of financial statements into U.S. dollars. The impact to Xylem's revenue was $14 million and the impact to earnings was $3 million. Acquisitions in our restructuring and realignment activities tracked expectations. During the quarter, we realized restructuring savings of $4 million, reflecting our 2012 actions in the initial savings from actions initiated in 2013. Lastly, our adjusted tax rate of 22% was in line with our previous guidance and expectations. As you can see from the bottom of the chart, our EPS shortfall was primarily driven by the volume miss of $0.05. In addition, price and foreign exchange were each $0.01 unfavorable during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 7. Xylem revenues were $960 million, down 1% from the prior year driven by a 3% organic decline and partially offset by acquisitions. Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and by region. First, in our largest end market, industrial. Organic revenue was down 5%, with Europe and the U.S. down mid-single digits. Public utilities declined 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by slowing activity in Europe and emerging markets. CapEx spending was weak in both regions but had a greater relative impact in emerging markets where we have a modest installed base and reliant projects to drive our revenue. Globally, residential and commercial building services were up 6% and 1%, respectively, primarily driven by improved market conditions. And lastly, Ag was up 10% driven by favorable weather conditions. Let me spend a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was up 2% on an organic basis and as I mentioned, better than our expectations. Europe and emerging markets were both down year-over-year in the range of 4% to 5%. In Russia and China, we continue to generate double-digit growth. The decline in other emerging markets was driven by timing of project shipments and a decline in market demand. Our profitability was significantly impacted by the volume decline. Cost-reduction actions drove 330 basis points of margin improvement. This includes restructuring savings of $4 million from the actions executed in 2012 and 2013. As previously mentioned, price pressure has unfavorably impacted our performance. As a result, price only drove 30 basis points of operating margin improvement, short of our previous expectations and indicative of the environment we expect to see over the balance of the year. These benefits more than offset 250 basis points of inflation and partially mitigated the foreign exchange and acquisition impacts. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted year-over-year operating margins by 90 basis points. Acquisitions were neutral to income but dilutive to margins in the amount of 30 basis points. Gross margin was 38.6% and operating margin was 10.2% for the quarter. Gross margins were down 100 basis points, primarily driven by the volume decline and foreign exchange impacts. Operating margins were down 380 basis points as a result of loss volume leverage in our continued investments in strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 8. This slide shows our EPS walk for the second quarter. We're reporting $0.36 of EPS, down $0.13 from the prior year. Core operations were down $0.11, driven primarily by volume decline [indiscernible] offset by a $0.02 benefit from restructuring savings. Ongoing European realignment actions provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS and foreign exchange was unfavorable by $0.03. Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 9. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $596 million, down 2% over prior year on a constant currency basis, and down 6% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to top line growth. Transport declined 6%, primarily driven by weakness in Europe and decreased mining and public utility CapEx spend in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Treatment revenues declined 12% with the majority of the decline occurring within Europe and the Middle East. As was the case in the first quarter, developed markets continue to see market softness particularly in wastewater capital spending driven by municipal funding constraints. We anticipate that these regions will continue to lag in performance at least until confidence is restored and project orders are released. And lastly, test revenues were down 2% as growth in Europe was offset by sequestration-related softness in our YSI business, which sells to government agencies and the academic market. Operating margin came in at 10.6%. This segment is our highest gross margin segment. The significant volume decline impacted operating margins by 480 basis points, given our direct selling overhead cost structure. Cost-reduction activities yielded 350 basis points of margin improvement, largely offsetting inflation and investments. Foreign exchange volatility and its impact to margins were significant this quarter, totaling 160 basis points, while acquisitions reduced margins by 40 basis points. Let me now turn to Slide 10 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 1%, both on a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was up 3%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was down 2%. Soft market conditions in the U.S. and Europe resulted in organic declines of 6% and 4%, respectively in the short cycle business. And lastly, irrigation was up 10%, with the U.S. up over 20% as weather conditions continue to drive strong demand. Operating margin was 13.4%, as price increases and cost reduction initiatives more than offset inflation. Year-over-year margin was impacted by the favorable reduction of a contract loss accrual in 2012. Let me now turn to Slide 11 and review our financial position. Free cash flow was slightly positive in the second quarter. Our performance is below our expectations but reflective of the profitability in the quarter. As you will recall from last quarter, we had $11 million of Sandy relief deferred tax payments. In addition, working capital was unfavorable for the quarter. As a percentage of revenue, working capital increased 120 basis points, driven by longer collection periods and higher inventory as we continue to deal with customers expectations for short lead times and an increasingly competitive environment. Our available cash on hand was $360 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio remains at a healthy 29%. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our guidance provision in detail. As you can see on the upper left of the chart, for the full year 2013, we expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion, down $135 million before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. To help illustrate this revision, we have summarized our end market expectations which we highlighted when we set guidance earlier this year, our performance over the first half of the year and our current outlook. As you can see, we've revised our outlook downward for both our 2 largest end markets: industrial and public utility. Industrial is now expected to be down mid-single digits for 2013. Through the first half of the year, industrial was down high single digits. While we saw sequential improvement during the first half, the performance was below expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we believe the lack of corporate confidence to move forward with projects will significantly impact our performance in the second half of the year. And while we still expect some modest sequential improvement, we're reflecting a slower recovery than originally anticipated. With approximately 13% of our industrial end market exposure tied to global mining, we expect to face significant headwinds in the second half of 2013. For public utilities, we now expect full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. In the U.S., we've seen slightly better than expected results through the first 6 months and expect the positive trends to continue through the back half, resulting in a slightly positive organic growth for the full year. However, more than offsetting this favorable trend is the challenging market we face in Europe. Based on first half activity, including significant challenges in the treatment market and weakening customer confidence, we expect that Europe will be down high single digits. We have also lowered our expectations for the public utility end market in the Middle East region, reflecting project timing delays and uncertainty around when large projects will be released. While we saw the commercial market down low single digits during the first half of 2013, we see the potential for improvement in the U.S. over the balance of the year. This expectation is based on market data, customer feedback and our improved performance during the second quarter. We've seen favorable performance in our residential and agricultural markets, primarily driven by conditions in the U.S. which I covered earlier on the call. We have slightly increased our expectations in these markets, reflecting our first half performance and expect continued favorable conditions over the balance of the year. Finally, foreign exchange translation is expected to be a headwind of $70 million to revenue and $0.09 to EPS relative to our previous guidance and is based on currency rates at the end of the second quarter. With that said, you can see how the market dynamics I just described are driving what amounts to be a $0.30 reduction to our full-year EPS projection. In summary, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, and EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Please turn to Slide 13 and I'll provide some color specific to our second half planning assumptions. We are anticipating second half revenue of approximately $1.9 billion, driven by sequential improvements in the U.S. and emerging markets. We're monitoring Europe and have assumed the conditions will remain relatively consistent with what we've seen during the first half of the year, which represents a weaker outlook than originally anticipated. We're forecasting third quarter revenue to be down sequentially in the mid-single digits consistent with our typical seasonality given the European vacation season. This reflects a low single digit year-over-year decline. We expect an increase in second half operating profit of over 25% driven by the sequential uplift in volume, the incremental savings attributable to the 2013 restructuring actions under way and the impact of recovery actions being taken to reduce costs. Based on rates at the end of June, we anticipate that foreign exchange will be a sequential headwind. Despite volume decline, we expect a modest sequential operating margin rate improvement in the third quarter, driven by the incremental restructuring and accelerated cost savings totaling $10 million. Please turn to Slide 14. Let me highlight a few of the items I've not yet covered. First, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. This is a 5 percentage point decline from our previous guidance and reflects the impact of higher working capital. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21% for the year, consistent with what we have previously guided and is indicative of the progress against the realignment initiatives we initiated this year. We expect our share count to be approximately 186.4 million, and we now expect restructuring and realignment cost to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million, reflecting a $10 million increase in realignment costs. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect 2013 restructuring costs in the range of $40 million to $50 million, which will generate 2013 net savings of $13 million to $15 million. With that, let me turn the call back over to Gretchen.
Gretchen W. McClain: This is not easy news to deliver and we're not pleased to deliver it. We know we must take tough decisions and accelerate our actions given the market conditions we face. But remember, we're seeing a number of positive signs across the business: our order rates are improving, we have a good backlog, we are launching compelling new products and the commercial efforts we are making are all starting to yield positive results. Building the Xylem business is a journey. We're taking the necessary steps to position this great company to achieve higher performance in both the short and the long term. Operator, we're ready for questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. You mentioned heading into the second half of the year, you had about $960 million in backlog, $400 million ships in 3Q, $200 million in 4Q. In a more normal year, what would that dispersion look like? And what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much more you still have to go out and get in a tough year like this relative to a normal year? Does that make sense?
Gretchen W. McClain: Sure, sure. I mean our backlog, when you look at it from a year-over-year prospective, we're up 7% year-over-year. So we're going in with a good backlog, solid backlog. We still have work to do because we do have a short cycle business. But I would say, we feel good about the rates in terms of what we need to achieve as well as the market conditions that we've looked at and adjusted based upon the first half of the year.
Michael T. Speetzen: Matt, the other thing I'd add to that is when we look at that backlog shippable in the second half, we look at it as a percent of the revenue. If you look back at 2012 as an example, it represented about 30%. When you look at the backlog, we're entering our second half, it's up at about 30 [indiscernible] a little bit higher. That's not surprising given the fact that we've seen a decline in the project business. So that's a dynamic that we adjust for as we look at that. And I'd say the dispersion between the 2 quarters is pretty typical of what we've seen barring the projects.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then based on what you're stepping up and doing from a cost standpoint now and what you've previously disclosed, how much in incremental savings should we be thinking about for 2014, assuming you complete everything you've discussed?
Gretchen W. McClain: So, Matt, we're working on that today. I mean, we're laying out those actions to date. Most of the things that we're talking about are, it's $0.06 to the EPS, it's $15 million that's baked into our revised guidance. It's discretionary pullback, taking some costs that we need to out of the business. As we get a better projection of the '14, we'll obviously -- we'll share that with you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The first question is for Mike. Take us through the free cash flow because if I've done my math right, you've done a 2% free cash flow conversion so far year-to-date. So how do you get to a 90% conversion in the second half if you're looking at longer collection periods, higher inventory and obviously higher working capital?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. It's a good question, Deane. We've taken a hard look at this and I think from a cash standpoint, the one we have to keep in perspective is the cash cost structure is a little bit different than the P&L structure. For example, we pay out bonuses at the beginning of the year and then you're earning yourself back as you go through the year. So adjusting for those types of items, that's why we've revised our working capital projection down, which has had about a 5-point impact on our free cash flow conversion. When we look at the profitable -- profitability and the contribution to cash, we get pretty comfortable as we look into the back half of the guidance levels we have. We've factored in the longer collection cycles as well as the inventory levels that we've got on hand. And then, the thing you have to keep in mind is sort of at least that first half period, we're dealing with a little bit higher cash tax rate given some of the deferrals we had from last year. And then obviously, to Gretchen's point, we're looking at investments in the second half which in terms of the free cash flow conversion, the one area that will be impacted is our capital expenditures. We see that as being dialed way back from the guidance that we have originally given where we talked about it being at about 3.5x -- or 3.5% of revenue. I'd look at that number as being closer to 3% or lower in the back half.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, and then, maybe you can talk about how the quarter progressed because you did say that June came in weaker and that was expected to be seasonally strongest. And the spirit of the question is, when you see the margin shortfall as severe as it did this quarter, I'd like to get a better sense of how proactively did you take out cost this quarter. I know you're trying to manage to a decremental margin because it sounds you're making some cost take outs here adding only about $10 million to the restructuring. I thought that maybe I would see more and maybe see more cost take out within the quarter. So maybe just take us through how the quarter progressed and what cost actions you were taking during the quarter?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So, Deane, let me address so. As we went through the quarter, as I mentioned, June is a big month for us and it's solid. So we didn't see that fall out. We were working our restructuring actions to $60 million to $70 million that we had in our plan. If you remember, we had set our plan assuming we're going to be a flat growth rate and we would size our cost base accordingly. And so we are focused on those areas. Still advancing some of our investments around productivity, which was tied to repositioning ourselves in Europe, and also some new product launches. So that didn't come through. This was our high growth margin business and we saw a big drop to the bottom. Now going forward, we are going to be resizing the business and taking steps. I've talked about what's embedded in the revised guidance. There's more work we need to do and we are looking at all opportunities to see how we can bring our cost base down. Our end markets are challenged right now. The underlying fundamentals of our market are going to be -- have an overshadow of the economy and we've got to make sure we've got cushion in our business to be able to still allow us to invest into growth initiatives that we need because this is a strong market in the long term. And right now, we need to get be able to get our cost base further down. And so there will be more actions. As I mentioned, we put in the $15 million in the revised guidance, actions we will be taking for the rest the year. And while we are 7 months into the year, we've got 5 months yet. Most of those will be savings that will probably play out into 2014 and beyond.
Michael T. Speetzen: And, Deane, I think on the decremental question, roughly we're managing to about a 50% decremental and there's a couple dynamics that play in. While we are taking the cost actions which helped us in the second half, one, we're dealing with a revenue decline in our highest margin business where we have a higher cost structure that we're contending with. So you've got very little erosion in gross margin, but you can see the impact at the up line and that's really around that cost structure. The second dynamic we're contending with is much lower price realization. And as you know, that drops at 100%. We're obviously not just accepting that. We're pushing the teams. But in light of the current environment, that certainly places additional pressure on that decremental margin. So at this point, it wants to be close to 60% and we're fighting to get it down closer to about 50%.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then, just one last question for me. If I heard it correctly, it sounded, Gretchen, like you still had some M&A lined up for the second half. And are you locked into these acquisitions? Are they the right ones to be doing at this time? And I know there's a sense that you want to be playing offense here for the long run, and just how you're weighing that against some of the shorter-term challenges of getting the P&L in order?
Gretchen W. McClain: Deane, it's a great question. And clearly, as I mentioned, we're dialing back a little from what we have originally said. There are some key bolt-on strategies that we'd like to continue to progress. But our #1 priority is to make sure that we get the business in order. We get our performance higher. And making sure that we address, taking the cost out that we need to deposition this company and bring it forward. But there are some acquisitions that strategically are nicely positioned to help us ultimately grow. So again, that balanced equation is essential. Take the cost out, position us for a cushion, but then be able to invest in those strategic initiatives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I just want to touch on the incrementals again but more sequentially, meaning, the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So you're looking at a $42 million increase at the midpoint on revenue between H1 and H2 and a $46 million increase in the operating profit. It sounds like maybe $25 million, $26 million or so that it's from incremental restructuring, but it still suggests a fairly significant incremental from the core business. I think there are some other items, but I was hoping if you could help bridge that gap for us.
Michael T. Speetzen: Sure. Yes, there's a little bit of noise in there. So let me give you a few of the pieces that I think will help provide that. If you look at our core volume, organically, we're up about $67 million versus the first half. Foreign exchange is about a $34 million headwind in the second half and then we've got an additional $10 million of acquisitions. You have to remember the acquisitions are not contributing at a high drop rate at this point in time and foreign exchange are obviously has its set of impacts. So when you look at the core volume increase, less the savings from restructuring, we're looking at about a 50% incremental drop rate, which given where we're at in the business specifically around Water Infrastructure where we see that sequential improvement, we expect to see that drop rate. The drop rate then gets enhanced by the incremental $12 million worth of restructuring benefit that we pick up in the back half. So in my prepared comment, I talked about our restructuring in the second quarter, was it $4 million? $3 million of that came from the actions we initiated in '12. One of that came from the actions we started earlier this year. We pick up incrementally in the back half another $12 million of restructuring benefit.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, but the core business dropping at 50%, I mean, have you ever had that type of experience before? Why is that changed now?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, there's a couple of things. I think when you look at the Water Infrastructure business, one, we're going to be levering off that cost base. Two, when you look at the mix that we're anticipating in the second half, specifically on the industrial market as it relates to dewatering, even though we're down on a year-over-year basis, the trends we've seen in terms of some of the frac-ing that's driving increased volume to support the rig count increase, that activity comes at a very high drop rate and it's helping us from a mix perspective.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just moving on to the comments about the municipal trends, I think, Gretchen, you said you anticipate the spending to remain weak into 2014. The orders from the quarter actually maybe showed a little bit of an improvement. Maybe can you just elaborate on that comment, I mean, is this just a small aberration in orders that you see in the quarter and it had to drop off again? Maybe you can give us some color on that market, it would be helpful.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So if I step back and I just look at some of the market dynamics that are going on, first of all, in the U.S., you have wastewater spending which is down substantially. And that doesn't look like it's changing anytime soon. Now, we all understand the need of water and the demand that is pending up. And we're seeing that in terms of the bid activity. There's a lot of work in terms of bidding. But the confidence level to actually make that bidding into an order is just not happening. It's not converting. And we anticipate going forward in 2014, right now, nothing that indicates a significant change there. Now if there's public-private partnership that may move that more aggressively, but when I look at the general dynamics in the market, not only in the U.S. but even globally, the confidence level in the funding streams haven't changed. And when you think about 2014, you need to start getting those orders now versus next year because they typically are 12- to 18-month type of orders.
Michael T. Speetzen: And Brian, I guess, what I'd add to that is when you look at the 1% order increase that we had in the quarter, a significant portion of that was driven by Applied Water. The Water Infrastructure business was up about 0.6%. And when you look at that business on a year-to-date basis, because it was down close to 10% in the first quarter, orders were down about 5%. So back to Gretchen's point, the order funnel really hasn't filled at the level that would support significant growth in 2014.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about the signs of bottoming you're seeing to support the outlook in the back half. It sounds like you're not factoring further deterioration in Europe, mining's obviously been quite challenged. Can you just sort of walk us through what you're seeing in some of those markets?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So mining as you mentioned is challenged globally. We're clearly seeing the mining industry being challenged and that hit us, as we talked about in terms of the emerging markets. But let me talk about a little bit from the regional perspective. In the U.S., we're seeing positive signs but the industrial market still has not had the confidence level to give us the confidence that's going to pick up in the second half of the year. In Europe, we're still seeing Europe down. We saw substantially a decline in southern Europe more than we anticipated. While we thought it was down substantially, we didn't think it could go down much further and we've seen that continue. In the Nordics, positive -- still positive growth there but not enough to offset what we're seeing in Europe. And where we're seeing Europe as well as in the public utilities and industrial markets, we anticipate will be weaker as we go into the second half of the year. Emerging markets, China and Russia, we're doing extremely well. We're double-digit growth in both of those regions. But with the global economy pulling back and confidence level still being questioned around the growth in China, that has had impact in the mining industry and our emerging markets globally, specifically, the Middle East and Australia when I look at the Asia Pacific region.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Okay. And I guess as you look out if you couple sort of visibility staying challenged in '14, it sounds like with dialing back the M&A a little bit, maybe you can talk about some of those longer-term assumptions, how we should think about those?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. I think I would say a couple things. What we think is the markets is pulling back some. We're still feeling confident about the product launches that we are launching this year and into next year. I feel good about some signs of the market picking up. We're seeing residential, commercial picking up. So what we want to do in terms of given the overhang that we've got in some of our markets, being industrial and public utility, still stay strong with our customers, work with them as they're challenged in terms of their funding with services and aftermarket. But we're going to have to adjust ourselves to pull our cost base down. We're still committed in terms of our long term in our business. We're taking the right short-term actions to position the cost base, but still being able to position ourselves with the growth initiatives to hold on to our long-term objectives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Would you please quantify the impact that you think the decline in the dewatering business had on margins and revenues as well?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. Dewatering globally had been significantly impacted in the industrial market and very specifically, in the U.S. we've seen some decline there, about $4 million in the U.S., in Europe, $7 million, and in Latin America, about another $1 million. So it's down over $10 million in terms of dewatering. Now let me just talk a little bit about our dewatering strategy. That is not just our Godwin business but it is our Flygt business that support some of the mining industry. So it's a combination of the 2.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. That's the -- what's the operating impact on the business?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, David, it's a high drop rate business. I mean the majority of where we've seen the pullback is around the rental market. As you know, that's a high margin business. And that's played into, frankly, where we're dialing back from a capital expenditure standpoint as we size that fleet accordingly. We don't typically get into the specific breakouts, but there is obviously within the water infrastructure business, dewatering being a relatively large component of that and impact from the pullback in the rental revenue.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, I think when we last spoke, your sense was that your assumptions basically been would hold, this is back in June, provided that you didn't see deterioration in Europe. Most indications is Europe is not deteriorating. Is there some element in your business that you see different than your competitors where you're more vulnerable than your competitors?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So, David, it's a great question. It's obviously something we sit back and we look at the data and analyze it. But I still feel very confident about the issue that we're facing is the market dynamics. And it's the underlying market overhang that we're seeing specifically in the public utilities, very specifically around CapEx, and then also the pullback very specifically in the mining and the industrial market, just the confidence of not being able to go spend. When I look at our win-loss data, we look at data in the industry trade. Our share, we think we're holding our share. We feel very good about where we're going. Now of course, what's important to that is to make sure we continue to launch new products and we stay close to our customers. But I do not believe this is a share issue, it's a market dynamic.
Michael T. Speetzen: And David, I guess, I'd just -- I'd point out a couple of things. If you look at our peers specifically around the wastewater side of our pumping business, where we're down about 6% in the public utilities, I think you'll see pretty similar characteristics in those results. And then in the commercial and resi side where we're up 9% and 18%, respectively, that's very strong relative to the peer group, although it's a small part of our business. Those 2 components make up just under 20% of our revenue.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, lastly, general commentary was MRO is up, is that the same for you or not?
Michael T. Speetzen: Our repair and overhaul or our service revenue was up in the quarter when you exclude the effect of our PIMS acquisition. We were up just over 1%. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen coming out of the operational side of the public utilities and even the industrial market where folks are still continuing to spend on repairing and maintaining the existing equipment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I had a question on -- I wanted to continue on this topic of competitive dynamics. And specifically, Mike, you mentioned price and the fact that they initiated pushing the teams to try that, maintain that, and so forth. Can you just give us a little more color around that side of things? How the market weakness that you're seeing is impacting your strategic pricing initiatives and then just probably price across the market. And then relatedly after my follow on here and relatedly, do you believe industry capacity overall is where it needs to be? Or are we at risk here of having an overcapacity situation and impact on price there that impact the end market weakness per se?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So, Ryan, let me talk about pricing. If the pricing dynamics that we're really seeing is in the industrial and public utility market, that's the market that we've seen down. And also across-the-board, it is a competitive market. The market is slow and so everyone is going after competitively to win the bids that out there. Now we have a good process in place and we've been driving price and have seen up and through last year, a positive price value gap. We want to continue to drive that, but we also do not want to lose share in our core positions. And that's what we've done is we pull back to make sure that we can get the position that we need. I'd say beyond just a price perspective though, our commercial excellence initiatives that we've been driving, drive more than just price. It's about talking to our customers about our value proposition, around really thinking about our key accounts and making sure that we're driving our growth with those accounts. So I feel good about our strategy. And we are continuing to drive for profitable growth. That is key to us. But we will make sure that we don't lose share in the marketplace.
Michael T. Speetzen: Ryan, I made a comment in my prepared remarks in terms of we saw about 30 basis points of favorable margin impact in the second quarter, which was down pretty significantly from what we had in the first. We think that's indicative of where we'll be for the balance of the year. So we were anticipating when we originally gave guidance that we'd be around 1% pricing. We now see the effect of revenue is about 40 basis points positive pricing and that flows through the margin with about 30 basis points. So pretty similar in what you saw in the second quarter, holding for the balance of the year.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And on the issue of capacity, I mean, do you believe that from industry perspective, the situation is significant enough in terms of end market weakness, but it needs to be a curtailment of capacity industry-wide. And if so, is that happening or is that not the right way to frame it?
Gretchen W. McClain: Well, I'd say from this perspective, the capacity issue, when you look at where our equipment, our technology is positioned in the marketplace, as long as the factories are up and running and so forth, our equipment is being utilized. I would say in the mines, they're not opening the mines. That industry has pulled back, but still we got a good position in the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, though, some of the dynamics in the marketplace in terms of inventory in the markets, it's not there, pullback. So there's a growth cycle, that maybe an opportunity for us in terms of quick turnaround. But right now I don't think capacity is a big driver for us.
Michael T. Speetzen: Ryan, I think we look at it in short and long-term views. I think in the short term, we all know that distribution channel has pretty well destocked to a level that when growth is restored, we think that will obviously serve as an opportunity. And I think as we look over the longer term, we don't see that as a capacity issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: You talked about pressure from the sequestration on the test category, which I know provide some nice margins for you guys. But what percentage of that business is impacted by these sort of issues?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. If you take our Analytics business, it's really the YSI business here in the U.S. They typically do work with the USGS and of course, with some universities and that typically get their funding coming from the government. It's probably 40% of that business, roughly. Now the one thing I would say is, while sequestration is having an impact, there's not been significant reductions in terms of budgets, but the pullback of funding and the confidence to go ahead with certain projects is clearly stalled in the market. And so we're watching that closely. We feel pretty confident about our position and our relationships with those end customers. And our hope is that will get released over time.
Michael T. Speetzen: And I think it's also important to point out as we did in our remarks that Europe was up about 5%, which is a strong performance in light of the current environment.
Gretchen W. McClain: And I even say even in the U.S. in our wastewater Analytics business, we feel positive signs as well.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Sure. And then on the commercial side of things, it looks like you saw some gains there. I know it's smaller. But any sense how much of that is market growth this quarter versus sort of market share gains or any repositioning you've done with that business?
Gretchen W. McClain: I would say it's a little bit of both. I mean we had spent some time investing in new product launches and the team has done a great job in getting out and being able to show the value proposition announced. As a lot of company -- or businesses are upgrading their commercial buildings, our new products are nicely positioned to do retrofits and so forth. So I think it's a combination of growing with the market as well as taking some share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gaugler with Brean Capital.
Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: You had mentioned in earlier prepared remarks, Europe municipals and industrials as weak end markets. As you look to future acquisitions, are you looking to exclude these areas in the end markets?
Gretchen W. McClain: So let me address it, in general, that's a tough question to answer. I mean, I'd prefer an acquisition that's going to give us a nice position to the emerging markets, which are the growing markets. But depending upon the technology and how that complements our position and being able to serve our customers more effectively, you've got to look at the technology and potentially the channel to the market as we go forward. So it's more of a strategic direction.
Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my apologies if you covered this previously. In your infrastructure segment, how's your after sales service business performing? And what percentage of the sales mix is it now?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So right now, in the second quarter, our aftermarket for Water Infrastructure was up about 8%, but that includes the effects of the PIMS acquisition. We're up about 2% organically. And that constitutes just under about 20% of our revenue coming out of that segment.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen McClain for any closing remarks.
Gretchen W. McClain: Well, let me just summarize with -- as we reported today, we are not happy with our performance. We know we have work to do. Our markets are challenged. However, we do have some very positive signs that are taking place on the business. And we're going to continue to push forward with our new products. We're going to make sure that we're staying close with our customers and make sure that we're driving the top line. At the same time, we're going to make sure that we're positioning this company with cushion for some challenging markets that we know are still there. And we are focused on our long-term objectives and making sure that we're putting the actions in place that we can assure the long-term still plays out. This is a strong market. The macro conditions are still there. And we have the right technologies and the right talent to be able to lead the market. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Gretchen W. McClain: Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We ended the year expecting a challenging first quarter, and it was. Delays in global treatment projects and tough year-over-year comparisons for our U.S. industrial dewatering business drove our revenue expectations to be down mid-single digits. As we progressed through the first quarter, we saw additional weakness in Europe, and as a result, our top line was 1% weaker than expected. While the top line was disappointing, we gained strength in key areas of the business. Exciting new product launches are winning in the marketplace and are leading to share gains in key markets. Acquisitions added 2% to the top line, including contributions from our 2 most recent acquisitions, which we closed during the first quarter, PIMS and MultiTrode. Looking at our operating performance, we had better-than-expected segment margins, and as a result, we are reporting EPS of $0.27 for the first quarter, in line with expectations. As we look forward, we are maintaining our full year guidance. The U.S. is a region where we have seen and expect to see growth in 2013 across various end markets. Emerging market conditions remain favorable and we are well positioned, and we expect growth to accelerate through 2013. While Europe is clearly challenged, we are actively monitoring the situation, and we are expecting a significant -- and we are not expecting a significant recovery. We are aggressively taking actions to improve our cost base and reposition ourselves for growth in this region. Now let's dig into the quarterly summary in more detail. We received orders of 962 million, down 4% in constant currency and 7% organically. Sequentially, relative to the fourth quarter, organic orders were up modestly by 2%. For the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio is in line with seasonal trends at 1.09. We exit the quarter with backlog of $723 million, up $76 million from year end. Of our shippable backlog, we expect to deliver approximately $400 million in the second quarter and approximately $250 million in the second half. Revenue for the first quarter was $879 million, down 5% in constant currency and 7% organically. We are reporting gross margin of 38% for the first quarter and operating margin of 8.9%. These results primarily reflects lower volume, onetime acquisition costs and continued investments. We are funding these investments and partially offsetting margin dilution with the contributions of new products, restructuring savings from actions taken in 2012, and cost reductions resulting from Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, EPS was $0.27 for the first quarter. And finally, free cash flow was a negative $10 million, driven primarily by lower income for the quarter, typical seasonality, timing of tax payments and continued investment in growth platform. Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the business and the progress that we've made on our strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 4. I want to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the decisions that we have made and the actions that we've already taken against the strategies we discussed at our recent Investor and Analyst Day. First, an incredible focus on delivering customer value. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our annual revenue comes from our large installed base. We pride ourselves on our relationships with our customers, and our goal is to continue to earn their loyalty. Our TotalCare program is all about providing a suite of advanced aftermarket services to create customer value over the long term. With the recent acquisition of PIMS, a U.K. services market leader, we are adding firepower and extending our competitive advantage. Second, drive profitable growth. We continue to make solid advancements in our disciplined acquisition strategy. Most recently, we completed the acquisition of MultiTrode, which enhances our global water and wastewater monitoring and control capabilities. During the first quarter, we began selling the innovative product lines of MJK into China through our in-region analytic sales office, and our PIMS services has been extended to existing customers in Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are simple examples of how our global presence is driving revenue synergies from our bolt-on acquisition and how we are accelerating our geographic growth. Third, improve business sustainability. We are focused on continually improving the efficiency and effectiveness in all we do, which translates into greater competitive advantage and builds sustainable cycle of financial stability and flexibility. During the quarter, we made substantial progress against our restructuring and realignment initiatives. In January, we opened our new EMEA headquarters office in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. We completed the transition of our European Water Solutions business to the newly formed European management structure. André Dhawan is our new leader in the region. He's a seasoned executive with over 10 years of experience in our business running key global operations and corporate strategy. We've communicated to employees the new organization and the rationale behind our changes. This is a more competitive organization and is designed to create more value for our customers. As part of the transition, we've already announced the closure of 1 facility and started integrating our sales organizations. We are moving forward to Phase 2, which is anticipated to be completed later this summer. This will move the European Applied Water Systems business under the newly formed European structure. Let me wrap up this point by saying that we are on track to deliver the targeted $13 million to $15 million of net savings from 2013 actions. This is in addition to the expected $12 million of savings from the actions we executed in 2012. Let me illustrate how these 3 strategies on this page come to life. 2 weeks ago, I visited our facility in Auburn, New York. There, we produce the Goulds Water Technology brand for products in our residential, commercial and industrial markets. We have been investing in new products and technologies in our Applied Water segment. Our energy-leading e-SV, which is produced in this plant, saw double-digit growth in North America in the first quarter and is now in its third year of strong double-digit growth. Over the past 2 years, this facility has undergone a complete transformation. Our Lean efforts have resulted in cycle time reductions of 20% to 40%, higher on-time performance and 25% reduction in floor space. This site was also the first to implement our new ERP platform in the first quarter, which will further improve operational efficiency and our response time and accuracy. In Europe, our Hungary facility has completed a similar Lean transformation. There, we are producing our new ecocirc heating pump, which is growing more than 20%. In both cases, we are taking share through a combination of product and factory innovation and creating value for our customers. As I continue to share with you, we are gaining traction against our most critical strategies that advance customer value: new product launches, our TotalCare services program and expanding our portfolio with acquisition. This is the best way to drive growth, and this is precisely what we are doing. All the while, we continue to execute on our operational performance in these tough market dynamics. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the first quarter 2013 results. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Xylem revenues were $879 million, down 5% from our first quarter in 2012. Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and by region. First, in our largest end market, industrial. Organic revenue was down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, performing worse than anticipated. In the U.S., we continue to be negatively impacted by year-over-year comparisons of water transport applications supporting natural gas frac-ing and destocking by some distributors, particularly those serving the U.S. mining industry. We also saw some weakness in niche markets like marine, which was unfavorably impacted by a cooler start to the season. European industrial market weakness continued in the first quarter, down mid-single digits. Project timing in emerging markets drove a year-over-year decline in industrial markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia-Pac, which were both down double digits. First quarter revenue from the public utility market declined high single digits year-over-year. Overall, this was in line with our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S., where we were up low single digits, we saw an acceleration of activity, driven primarily by previously delayed replacement and maintenance work. We continue to see stability in Northern Europe. However, year-over-year project timing, spending cuts in Southern Europe and funding challenges in Eastern Europe resulted in a double-digit decline for the first quarter. Commercial building services were down low single digits, primarily driven by weak institutional construction market conditions in the U.S. and slowing retrofit opportunities. Outside of the U.S., we continue to see strong results, particularly from emerging markets. For example, fire pumps and integrated commercial building packages drove double-digit growth in Latin America and China. While year-over-year sales were flat for the quarter, we saw conditions improving in the Middle East and are cautiously optimistic about construction growth in the region moving forward. Residential was down low single digits in the first quarter. In the U.S. we were up low single digits, with performance driven by seasonal promotions and improving market conditions for new and existing home sales. Europe was down double digits, driven primarily by weaker market conditions in Southern Europe. And as for agriculture, we were up high single digits for the first quarter, driven by better-than-expected results in the U.S. and project shipments into Latin America. Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 6% on an organic basis in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Relative to our expectations, we saw weaker industrial market conditions. These were partially offset by a pickup in public utility maintenance and repair activity after a slowdown in the fourth quarter and strength in residential. Europe was down 8% for the first quarter, below our expectations of a mid-single digit year-over-year decline, driven by weaker industrial and residential market conditions, particularly in Southern Europe. Emerging market organic revenue declined 9% for the first quarter, reflecting the impact of year-over-year project timing in our Water Infrastructure segment. China and Russia continued their upward trajectory, both posting double-digit growth in the quarter. Gross margin was 38% and operating margin was 8.9% for the quarter. Margins were negatively impacted by year-over-year volume declines and associated leverage loss. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business, which impacted margins by 70 basis points. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from cost reduction initiatives, including the benefit from restructuring actions executed in 2012 and price. As we indicated in Investor and Analyst Day, we anticipate that acquisitions and foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impacted on margins this year. In the first quarter, we saw 40 basis points of headwind from acquisitions, primarily reflecting the impact of purchase accounting, integration and transaction costs. In addition, foreign exchange translation and transaction unfavorably impacted operating margins by 30 basis points. Please turn to Slide 6. This slide shows our EPS walk for the first quarter. We're porting $0.27 of EPS, down $0.09 from the prior year. Core operations were down $0.08, driven primarily by volume decline, continued investment in strategic initiatives and costs associated with acquisitions. Restructuring savings and net cost reductions driven by our Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives partially offset these impacts. As planned, the completion of Phase 1 of our European realignment actions provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS, and foreign exchange was unfavorable by $0.02. During the first quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1 million related to a foreign tax refund. However, according to the terms of the tax matter agreement, we're required to make payment of refunded amount to ITT, and therefore, recorded an offsetting nonoperating expense. Backing this out, our adjusted operating tax rate would've been approximately 22%, in line with our expectations. Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. For the first quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $551 million, down 5% over prior year on a constant currency basis and down 9% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth. Transport declined 7% for the first quarter. In the U.S., transport declined high single digits, primarily due to a significant decline in industrial dewatering applications. This decline was driven by tough year-over-year comparisons for natural gas frac-ing-related applications and lower distributor sales, which we attribute primarily to a decline in mining. These declines were partially offset by favorable public utility performance, driven by an acceleration of operating activities and a continuation of Sandy disaster recovery dewatering projects. In Europe, transport declined in the mid-single digits, driven by funding constraints and project execution delays and broad-based spending cuts in Southern Europe. While market conditions in most of Europe continue to be challenged, conditions in Northern Europe remained stable. Treatment revenues declined 22% for the first quarter, driven by 2 factors. First, in the developed markets, we continue to see market softness. As an example, water and wastewater capital spending in the U.S. remains down, and we continue to see municipal funding constraints in Europe. We anticipate that these regions will continue to lag in performance, at least until confidence is restored and project orders are released. Secondly, the first quarter also reflects how project timing can impact any one quarter's performance. For example, the Middle East and Asia-Pac were down double digits year-over-year due to a few large projects that shipped in the first quarter for 2012. And lastly, test revenues were down 8% due to the timing of European project shipments in 2012. First quarter operating margins came in at 9.4%. Operating excellence and restructuring actions drove 340 basis points of margin expansion. As you can see from the slide, these cost reductions, coupled with favorable price of 30 basis points, slightly offset the organic volume decline and continued investment in the business by 20 bps. Our margins were negatively impacted by 60 basis points of acquisition dilution and 50 basis points from foreign exchange. Let me now turn to Slide #8 and talk through Applied Water. Applied Water's first quarter revenue was down 3% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was down 3%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was down 6% and was primarily attributable to weakness in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we were down approximately 10%. Our results were unfavorably impacted by weakness in marine and a weaker general industrial market. Europe was down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in Southern Europe. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we continue to see favorable results in emerging market regions. For example, Latin America and Asia-Pac both posted double-digit growth in beverage dispensing applications, and Russia also posted favorable performance. And lastly, irrigation was up 7%, with the U.S. and Latin America up double digits, partially offset by Europe being down high single digits. Applied Water posted strong operating performance during the first quarter, with margins up 170 basis points to 12.2%. Price and productivity actions, including the benefit of restructuring actions taken in 2012 coupled with new product sales, more than offset the impact of lower volume and inflation, enabling continued investment in this segment. Now let me turn to Slide 9 and review our financial position. Free cash flow was slightly negative in the first quarter. Our performance is in line with our expectations and reflects the impact of lower volume and the anticipated increase in tax payments. These tax payments were related to extensions provided by taxing authorities following Superstorm Sandy. Our available cash on hand was $375 million, reflecting the deployment of $78 million into acquisitions and $15 million in share repurchases. Our net debt to net capital ratio remains at a healthy 29%, and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. Please turn to Slide #10. We are affirming the guidance we provided at our 2013 Investor and Analyst Day. So in the interest of time, here are the highlights. We anticipate 2013 revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, which reflects total growth of 3% to 4%, consisting of flat to 1% organic growth and 2 points of growth from acquisitions. We've prepared a revenue outlook summary on the next slide providing insight to our planning assumptions, but before we move on, let me make just a few more points. While foreign exchange rate fluctuations could impact our performance in 2013, we have not seen any significant movements that would require adjustment to our guidance. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, and company operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.2% to 12.7%. We anticipate second quarter segment and operating margins to improve sequentially similar to 2012. We anticipate full year earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.89. This range excludes onetime restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $60 million to $70 million pretax but includes approximately $5 million of additional onetime separation costs and $5 million in higher pension costs. Free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be approximately 95%. Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, a reduction from 24% in 2012. This rate reflects a sustainable benefit from the establishment of our new European headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Please note, because of certain milestones, including the rollout of the European structure across our regional businesses, we expect the operating tax rate to average approximately 22% over the first half of 2013 and 20% over the second half. Please turn to Slide 11, which illustrates our revenue outlook by end market and outlines a few of the related planning assumptions around the balance of the year. Industrial is our largest end market, representing 43% of our revenues. For the full year, we expect flat to up low-single-digit organic growth. We expect challenging market conditions to continue in Europe but have not factored further declines into our outlook. We do anticipate the U.S. industrial markets will improve sequentially for the second half of the year. It's also important to note that our performance will be against relatively easy prior year comparisons. Revenues from public utilities, now 35% of our total revenue, are expected to be flat with 2012 levels. We continue to expect stability in required operations and maintenance activities, as this spend is largely non-discretionary and is funded by tariffs to end users. As we have discussed during previous quarters, the portion of public utility revenue that is derived from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project delays. Given the longer lead times for such projects and the absence of any significant change in CapEx spending levels, our forecast for 2013 assumes that this continues to be the case. We expect that demand for emerging market public utility infrastructure will be a source of growth for Xylem in 2013. Our revenues from commercial markets are expected to be flat to up low single digits. Indicators such as the commercial Architectural Billing Index have improved for the first quarter, which could lead to a recovery in the second half. We've assumed a modest improvement in the U.S., offsetting the weakness we saw in Europe during the first quarter. Additionally, we expect that new products and emerging market revenues will continue to grow at a faster-than-developed-market rate. Residential markets support flat to low-single-digit growth, as our product sales are largely driven by replacement sales associated with our large installed base. We see potential for favorable performance in the U.S. market and have assumed that the European markets stabilize. Agriculture remains a small market for us, and revenues are likely to be flat. Despite a strong start in the U.S. and Latin America regions, we expect flat year-over-year performance, primarily due to the difficult comparison from 2012. Taken together, the low-growth economic environment along with the relative stability of demand for the critical types of products we sell across a variety of end markets suggest flat to low growth in 2013. Please turn to Slide 12. Although I've covered this slide in the past, let me walk you through it again, as I highlight important margin and EPS dynamics impacting 2013. First, we are incorporating the remaining required onetime separation costs for IT systems and corporate headquarters relocation into our guidance. These costs result in a $0.02 reduction to EPS and a decrease of 10 basis points to our operating margin. We expect a $0.01 dilutive impact to EPS for foreign exchange and acquisitions. At the operating margin line, these drivers will have an unfavorable impact of 50 basis points. Operating margins related to the acquisitions are unfavorably impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments and integration and transaction costs. Excluding these impacts, operating margins for these acquisition would be accretive to Xylem's operating margin. Cost savings initiatives, restructuring savings and productivity are expected to drive a $0.07 benefit to EPS and 50 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher pension cost of approximately $0.02, continued investment in growth initiatives and the headwind from a low organic growth environment. Finally, our European realignment will add $0.03 to EPS. The lower tax rate discussed earlier will more than offset the higher run rate costs associated with the new European organizational structure. At the segment and operating margin lines, this is expected to have a 30 basis point negative impact. The combination of all these items results in an EPS of $1.84 and an operating margin of 12.5%, consistent with our guidance midpoint for 2013. Please turn to Slide #13, and I'll turn it back over to Gretchen to wrap up.
Gretchen W. McClain: In summary, we continue to make progress on our growth strategy through the acquisition of PIMS and MultiTrode. We delivered solid operating performance despite macro challenges, which resulted in a softer top line performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. As we move forward in 2013, we are continuing our investments for growth, launching new products and solutions to better serve our customers, driving Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives, executing on our restructuring and realignment plans and advancing our acquisition strategy by executing against a robust pipeline of opportunities. While market conditions remain challenging, the fundamentals of our business are strong, the macro trends in water are compelling, and we are advancing our growth strategy. I am confident in the Xylem team, our technologies and solutions and our direction. With that, we'll be happy to take your question. Laura?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I had a question that relates to -- you mentioned Sandy a couple of times in the prepared remarks. I wonder if you could -- if there's any way you can quantify the impact there, whether it be in terms of top line or margin or EPS, any kind of granularity you can give us on what impact that had on the quarter would be helpful.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. So in first quarter, we saw revenue of Sandy at $3.5 million. You've got a couple of dynamics going on with Sandy. One, we've had our dewatering pumps there longer than we had actually anticipated. The release of disaster funding has been slower than anticipated, so some of the work that we were hoping would start has been delayed, but obviously, opportunities as we go into second quarter and the remaining of the year.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then second, I guess, follow-up question. You mentioned mining as a headwind to your industrial business. Can you give us a little more color there, specifically on where we stand there in terms of bookings and backlog as we've moved into April here and what inning you think we are in, in that pullback in your opinion and based on what you're seeing in the business?
Gretchen W. McClain: Sure, good question. So mining really is impacting our dewatering business. So let me give you a little flavor of what we're seeing since April. So April is giving us some good indications, a little bit more confidence in a few areas. Dewatering, we are seeing some order pickup from the natural gas activity. And then mining, globally, there's still opportunities for us from a dewatering perspective. So as I look at our dewatering business, which is the most impacted, it is in line with our expectations going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So just to tack on to that last one when you started talking about the trends in April that you've seen on the dewatering side. Could you maybe talk about more broadly, through the whole platform, how trends tracked through the quarter? I know at the Analyst Day, you talked about a little bit weaker February. How did March end up? And then what have you seen so far through April more broadly? And are you seeing any inflection points one way or another yet?
Gretchen W. McClain: Sure, let me give you some flavor on that. So as we went through the first quarter, we knew we were coming into a low growth environment. We knew we had some tough compares from our previous very strong 2012 first quarter. So what we did see is January, February, a little low. We had a pretty good March. It wasn't a great March, but had a pretty good March. As we've come now into April, as I mentioned, I'd say April has a couple of good indicators for us. More confidence in a few areas: dewatering, as I mentioned; natural gas; as well as the disaster that we're all seeing in the Midwest, flooding, that's helping. The other area I would say is our orders in Europe is in line with our expectations, so we're seeing some progress there. Again, we're watching that closely. Our loading program and our building services area has -- looks nice coming into the second quarter, which is obviously a good sign for us. So overall, in line with our expectations at this point. When I look at the opportunity in front of us, natural gas, the flooding, the U.S. residential market is positive. And the areas that we're watching, as I mentioned, is Europe, some of the project delays and any other uncertainty in terms of the market. But right now, more positive indicators.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Mike. I guess the only thing I would add is, relative to when we talked to everybody on Investor Day, we had some projects push out of the first quarter that -- the good thing is that they're rescheduled later in the year, so we've got good line of sight to that. But that was probably the one area that came out of the expectations that we had articulated at that point in time.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That makes sense. And then Mike, a point of clarification on one of your comments. When you said that you're expecting second quarter margins to be comparable to 2012, I just want to make sure. Were you saying comparable on a year-over-year basis to 2Q '12, or the move from 1Q to 2Q would be comparable in '12 versus '13?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, the move. I think if you look at 2012 from Q1 to Q2, we saw about a 280, 290 basis point movement in margins. We see a very similar line of sight in the second quarter of '13.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: What I'd like to get some more color on is the municipal market. You said now this is 35% of the mix. And I'm trying to bridge some of the comments about you're seeing some stability in the U.S. muni, but you're also saying there's no capital spending, big projects releases, and we know that this has been an ongoing position for the municipalities. So within the part that they are able to spend, which is OpEx, some of it's break and fix. There's no discretion, have to fix those. But it sounds as though there's an element of business that falls under OpEx where there is some discretion and there had been some pushouts. And maybe you could just give us some color as to what those projects are. They're not the big CapEx. They're not break and fix. But they are falling into that OpEx, and in some cases, there's some discretion on pushouts.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, Deane, let me just kind of step back on the muni market. As you mentioned, there's the CapEx and there's the OpEx. What we saw -- and I'll talk very specifically about the U.S. first -- is last fall, we actually saw, with the uncertainty in the market, the fiscal cliff concern, we actually saw some pullback in some of what I would say is maintenance operations that typically would be done in expanding cycle. When we came into the first quarter of the year, we saw the OpEx, our transport side of the business, see some positive effects because of that. We're also seeing a couple of areas where we have advanced new products and services. So we are working with our public utilities to bring solutions around energy efficiency, helping them with -- from a maintenance cost, bring their cost down so that they can free up dollars to go towards capital expenditures. As Mike said in his remarks, our capital expenditure, we're not assuming that's going to change substantially. However, the bidding activity, as we continue to talk about, is still strong. The portfolio -- I mean, our funnel is strong, but we're not seeing any signs of any kind of sustainable release of those orders at that point in time.
Michael T. Speetzen: And Deane, I think it's evidenced by the strength that we saw in the U.S., where we were up essentially 6% relative to -- those delays, from an operational standpoint, can't happen for a long period of time, and I think you saw that play out in the first quarter.
Gretchen W. McClain: I'd just add one more piece, which is tariffs continue to grow across the board. In the U.S., they're up around 6%. And you've also have got regulatory-type requirements that are ultimately driving the implementation of some projects, both maintenance as well as CapEx, as the funding gets released.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's helpful. And I didn't hear you use the term sequester. So was there any pressures from the sequester side that's -- any expectations?
Gretchen W. McClain: I would say mostly in our analytics business, our YSI business, where a lot of instrumentation goes through universities, colleges and so forth. But right now, we still feel confident in our direction and the orders that we're getting in. But that is an area that we are watching and we'll keep a close eye on going forward.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. Just one follow-up. The comment on PIMS, the point of saying you're in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Now was PIMS already in those regions? And maybe just some color there. And how do you scale up a business that does involve a lot of headcount, and -- so what is the plan to roll out there?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, great question. Let me just talk a little bit. If you looked at PIMS specifically, they were mostly in the U.K, and they played predominantly in the industrial side, which complemented us very well, because we play in the public utility side. Where they were not -- where we are entering in Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's specifically through our existing sales channels, going to see the public utility and actually being able to service them more robustly. In terms of scaling this out, let me tell you how we're working through that. PIMS had a very good set of tools and documentation that we are actually now being able to deploy out through our seasoned sales companies to be able to drive that. We're also using some of their core talent to help us train those teams so that they can get up and running. There's no question you'll need people in each of the regions, but in terms of the core competency, the business model, the dos, the don'ts, it'll actually allow us to run more quickly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Can you touch on price cost briefly? It seems like in both segments you had some price benefit, but yet you call out a pretty sizable hit here on the material, labor and overhead inflation. I would imagine the material side gets much easier for you going forward with what's happening in commodities, but can you just talk about that bucket a little more, the material, labor and overhead?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, let me just take the price question, and I'll let Mike walk through some of the details. But overall, we saw in the first quarter 60 basis points from price. We've been talking about driving strategic pricing across the organization, and we have been very successful in doing that. This year, we are in a competitive environment, and we want to make sure that we maintain the share in the markets that are important to us. And so we've talked about 1 to 2 points that we are driving across the organization. In 2013, we will be at the low end of that.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. And so if you think about inflation, I mean, our inflation in the first quarter was about 2.8%. The way we've got that factored in for the balance of the year is definitely on a declining basis, so you ought to be expecting around 2.5% from a full year. So that will become a bit of a tailwind. I think that plays to some of the dynamics we're seeing on the front end from a pricing standpoint, as well as just the year-over-year compares relative to commodity pricing and input costs.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then, Mike, a second one from me. You mentioned pushouts a couple of times, some things moving out of Q1, maybe into Q2 or the back half. Is that what really gives you the confidence to stick with a 0% to 1% organic after a negative 7% in Q1?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I guess there's a couple of things that play into that. Definitely, with some of the projects pushing out, they pushed out beyond essentially Q2. There's some underlying dynamics that play out as we go into the year. One is, you've got seasonality. So if you look from Q1 to Q2, the percentage of our backlog that's shippable within the current quarter is pretty consistent as we go into Q2 as it was in Q1. And so we've got about, as Gretchen mentioned, just over $400 million worth of backlog in the pipeline as we head into Q2. And from a seasonable standpoint, we do typically ramp up into the second quarter. There was a number of things that happened in our business around loading programs that go into the Applied Water segment, et cetera. As we look out through the balance of the year, we haven't seen anything yet that tells us that things are going to be dramatically different. I think people are still projecting that the industrial production level in the U.S., although it's down versus last year slightly from a growth standpoint, it's on a increasing basis versus last year, things were on a pretty steady decline throughout the year. So that's a dynamic that works in our favor. Certainly, natural gas pricing, now over $4, gives us a good view relative to frac-ing pads coming back online, and our business that delivers water to the frac pad will, obviously, potentially benefit from that. And then you just have some of the other seasonal characteristics. You've got the flooding in the Midwest that's obviously going to play to that. And then overall, you've got the compares. So our growth rates last year were on a sequential declining basis, and by the time we got to the fourth quarter, we had essentially a negative 3% -- I think, negative 3.4% organic growth. So there's some of that, that, from a compare standpoint, helps from a growth perspective.
Gretchen W. McClain: And I would just add a couple of points, which is we had new products that we're launching. We're expanding geographically, even with the acquisitions that we've acquired, and gives us confidence as we go through the rest of the year. We've got a short cycle. As I think about quarter 2, we've got -- when you look at quarter 2, it's going to ramp up, which is seasonally aligned. It's about 25% of our revenue. And we're basically expecting second quarter to be down low single digits.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. And then I guess the only other piece I'd add is -- the question was probably more around revenue. But I think from a margin standpoint, it's also important to think about, obviously, we've got the sequentially improvement from revenue. You can see the impact from a volume leverage perspective. It played out against us in Q1, but that will obviously become a tailwind for us as we go through the year. We made great progress from a restructuring standpoint. We recorded about $5 million worth of cost in the first quarter, but I think it's important to understand that we essentially initiated about 70% of our actions. So we're going to have a substantial benefit in the back half of the year, well over $10 million to $11 million worth of benefit coming from the actions initiated in 2013. We're already seeing the benefits from 2012 play out, and then we've obviously got the continued focus around cost and the fact that inflation should be moderating as we get into the back half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: If I may follow up on the inflation question briefly, and then I have one other one. On the inflation question, is there -- other than raw materials coming in, can you give us a bit more dynamic of what your expectations are for labor and why inflation is so high versus the headline numbers that we see? I mean, is it geographical differences? Is it labor? Maybe you can you give us a little bit more color. And then I'll have a follow-up.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So labor definitely plays into it. As a factor relative to the total inflation number that we provide, labor contributes about 1 point to that. So throughout the globe, we see, obviously, different inflation rates in terms of what the various labor forces are looking for. And it's obviously a little bit higher in some of our developing regions. But I do think that plays out quite a bit. We see the material component moderating, as I mentioned earlier. That takes time to work itself through the system. We have very little direct commodity exposure, so most of what we're exposed to ultimately comes through some sort of a component that's had some value associated with it. That takes time to work itself through from an inventory standpoint. And then really, our manufacturing overhead, it contributes some. We're seeing normal levels of inflation there. But I think the biggest single component starts with labor, and then it moves quickly to material.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. On then on the -- on your treatment business, I'm trying to reconcile some of the commentary around project delays and then regulation. Maybe you can give us a little bit more color in terms of why the treatment business is down as much as it is and your expeditions going forward outside of some of the project delays?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, David, let me take that in terms of the treatment. Treatment is driven primarily from the capital expenditures and the budgets around the globe. We see significant opportunity in the emerging markets as they're building infrastructure to be able to have the economies in the future, we see that as an opportunity going forward. The funnel is getting stronger in the Middle East. It's getting stronger in Asia-Pacific. But even in the developed regions, Europe and in the U.S., while there's bidding activity, given the funding is just not there in the public utilities, it's not being released. Let me give you a couple of dynamics. In first quarter of 2012, we had a substantial amount of large orders. And in this quarter, we saw a little less, but we also saw about -- some of those projects slipping throughout the rest of the year. It's a good thing we have those in hand. It's a matter of them shipping later this year, so I feel good about that. In the treatment, half of our funnel is -- I mean, half of our orders are filled. And so it's a continuation going forward.
Michael T. Speetzen: David, I'd also add we saw some dynamics in Europe that played out last year where there were biogas regulations that played out in Germany, a little bit in Italy as well. Those have since essentially dissipated, and so there's a little bit of that, that you have in terms of the year-over-year compares as well.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So it's going to be lumpy throughout the remainder of the year, but you feel comfortable because you have projects in hand?
Gretchen W. McClain: I'd say, it's going to be lumpy. We've got projects in hand. Like I said, half of them, we've got book-to-bill that we can still go after and so forth. So we'll be watching our treatment business as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. Just had a follow-up on the seasonality question. As we model the balance of the year, I mean, you're going to see stronger seasonal trends in the second quarter, but what do you expect the linearity to look like through the back half? Should we expect -- I mean, you're getting the cost -- the benefits from the cost takeout in the back half of the year. Do you expect fourth quarter to be the high water mark in terms of operating income and EPS or -- how do you expect that to fall throughout the course of the year?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. So from a -- it all starts, obviously, with the top line. We see our linearity playing out pretty similar to what we've seen if you looked at an average over the past several years. So I'd expect Q3 to be relatively consistent with the second quarter, and obviously fourth quarter will be the height, and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen historically. That is typically when we see our highest-margin performance. That obviously gets somewhat accentuated by the fact that we're executing a bunch of restructuring actions. Primarily, we obviously made great progress in Q1 and in Q2, and we'll be seeing the full benefit in the back half. And so those dynamics will play out and support a higher margin level in the fourth quarter.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the MRO side, did you recapture any of the pushout you saw in the fourth quarter, or was it just a return to sort of the normal buying patterns there? And then on the destocking that you talked about last quarter and again this quarter, has that abated now, or do you anticipate a further headwind going forward?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I think on the maintenance side, the public utilities, we definitely saw that play back out. I mean, the U.S. we were essentially up about 6%. So we've seen that come back in line. I think, as it relates to the destocking, the most recent activity we've seen is more around the dewatering. And again, it's relative to the first quarter of last year, when we still saw strength from a mining standpoint. And most of the destocking is in the channel where the mining activity has come down and the distributors are essentially not wanting to carry as much stock. The other parts of the business, I'd say, there really hasn't been a big change, as we've mentioned in the past. We're carrying more inventory to supplement the fact that our customers are looking for very short lead times now, and they're really looking for us to be able to react to that. So we're obviously pushing hard to have the factories be responsive, as well as making sure we're carrying safety stock to meet those requirements. But aside from the dewatering, we didn't see a big change.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Back to pricing. Understandable that driving price gets a little tougher just given the -- some of the end market uncertainty. Can you talk about how much of that 1 point in '13 is driven by some of the newer products and services and then how that could set you up for next year?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. As we've been investing in new product launches, we've been putting a lot of effort into making sure that we have a value proposition, that we really position ourselves differently and can bring something different to the customer that they value. So our gross margins, our pricing situation around those new projects, I feel very confident about. So that is helping. As I highlighted, a couple of our new products that we are launching are seeing double-digit type of advancement. So I feel good. Our vitality index, as I've talked about in terms of the robustness of our new products, is at about 16% this year. Just a couple of years ago, it was 12%. So we're continuing to advance. We continue to see them penetrate the market, and that also gives us the confidence that we've got the right position and the right portfolio going forward to address the water issues in the market.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Great. And then one more. We've talked about dewatering quite a bit, but maybe you can touch on some of the asset utilization trends just by geography, whether you've had to make any significant adjustments there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. I mean, we clearly -- we manage this business very different than we do the rest of the portfolio. And really, starting back in first half of 2012, we started making adjustments. The good thing for us is the equipment is movable between different end markets, and so that gives us some flexibility. We did dial back our capital expenditures in line with the revenue decline we saw coming into '12 as well as into '13. But we're still focused on expanding. We're going into new markets. Obviously, we've talked a lot about Australia, but we're also going into Latin America and into Asia. And so we see areas where we're continuing to invest. In those markets, we've actually seen growth. We're we've essentially had to pull back in certain areas of asset investment has really been primarily in the U.S. And it's a generic statement to make, because there's actually some parts of the business where we've had to invest because the dewatering equipment is being utilized, for example, to support the Superstorm Sandy recovery and some of the activities going on in the Midwest. There's other models where we've had -- obviously had to dial back. So it's a pretty complicated and detailed analysis. But I'd say overall, we've seen a pullback in the U.S. in terms of where our investment is, but we're still moving geographically where we're seeing the growth.
Gretchen W. McClain: I'd just add to this that our whole dewatering model, we bought the -- a leading, #1 position in the U.S. with Godwin, and our goal here was ultimately to be able, internationally, to expand ourselves. So we're trying to have that right balance in terms of pulling back where it make sense but also making sure that we're investing for the global opportunity in front of us. I think last year I mentioned that we had our first dewatering order into China. We now have our first dewatering order into India, and so we are expanding nicely in terms of our opportunity and reach. So I feel very confident about our growth opportunity for dewatering going forward internationally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: On the building services side of Applied Water, as we're starting to see planning for new non-res projects picking up, can you elaborate a little more on maybe some of the incremental signs you may be seeing within your own business that gives you confidence in that improvement in commercial in the second half?
Gretchen W. McClain: Can you say your question again, because you came in very, very low?
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Sorry about that. Yes, just on building services side of Applied Water, obviously, some of the leading indicators seeming to show non-res projects picking up, or at least planning around it. Can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the incremental signs you might be seeing within your own business that gives you some confidence in that improvement in commercial for the second half?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, sure. When I look at building services, a couple of things. As I mentioned earlier, in April, we saw our loading program around the building services come in very nicely. So that gives us good confidence. We're also seeing, in the U.S., residential playing out nicely. But typically, that's before you see commercial, and we're seeing our architectural billing increasing, which is a good indicator that, in the future here, that we'll see nice projects. When I look at it from a geographic perspective, we're seeing nice growth in southern -- I mean, in Latin America. We're also seeing nice growth in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. We see that's going to show signs of improvement. We had political unrest there for quite a while. I think we've got the right team and the right position there to continue to go forward. So U.S. recovery in the second part of the year, and I feel pretty good about the direction of the new products the teams are launching.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the Water Infrastructure segment. You mentioned difficult comps for the emerging market regions. When did those start to ease? And it sounded like you were expecting some improvement going forward. Is that due to higher quotation levels, or you're actually starting to see some orders received?
Gretchen W. McClain: When I -- when we came out of first quarter, our book-to-bill in our Water Infrastructure was about 1.09, consistent with what we said in Xylem. So our book-to-bill is in line with where we are and in line with what we saw historically. So I feel good about that. When I look at the Water Infrastructure and public utilities, again, you're seeing the need for the infrastructure in the emerging markets, and our position is playing out nicely. Where I feel confident, I'll go back to new product launches. Experior had been -- has had a nice launch into the market. We have worked with many of our customers to pilot our products, and ultimately, that's leading them to see energy efficiency and ultimately to buy as we go forward. So I feel pretty confident about our base operations side of the house. CapEx is the area where we've got to watch in terms of the funding and how that flows.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel of Morningstar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: What was the growth rate of total aftermarket revenue in the past couple of quarters, where do you see that growth for the rest of the year, and how much does that presumed revenue mix shift towards aftermarket contribute to your expected margin performance in 2013?
Gretchen W. McClain: So I'll take it from an aftermarket perspective. In first quarter, overall aftermarket was down. That plays to the dynamics of the industrial market being down. You've got mining down. You've got -- then that drives the use of a lot of your products and services there. Applied Water, up 1%. And so you're seeing, where there is growth, you're continuing to see that aftermarket. Going forward, we do see the aftermarket still playing as we think the industrial market plays out. And so we believe we'll see a positive growth in the aftermarket by the end of the year.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes. And I guess the one thing I'd add, Jim, is with the project being -- I'm sorry, project business being down, one of the things that goes along with project business is initial provisioning of spare parts. And so that obviously is a knock-on effect that we're seeing playing out, as well as we see headwind from our project business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf of S&P IQ.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research: Could you talk a little about the M&A, and has anything changed -- or what are the multiples? And are you looking more in one direction or just being opportunistic at this point?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, great question. And clearly, M&A and inorganic growth is a key strategy for us as we go forward. I feel very good about our pipeline, probably as robust -- it's as robust as I think we've ever had it. If you look at our track record, the last several quarters, we've been able to announce a new acquisition. So the team is aggressively working hard. We're working in terms of candidates, working in terms of the same areas that we've talked about. Analytics is clearly a key area as we go forward. Dewatering continues to be an opportunity for us. Services, as we look at how we can support our large infrastructure and the customers that we currently have. So those are the key areas. We haven't kind of moved off of that. They're a substantial fragmented market that we work within, and we feel good. The multiples continue to stay stable. And so we're in the game, and we hope to continue to play hard.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research: Okay. And regarding Venezuela, what is your position there, and have you changed your thinking about that area with the currency devaluation and geopolitical situation?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, very small presence, limited currency exposure, most of the currency is utilized within-country. So it's really a non-issue for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a point of clarification, Q2 guidance and just how it relates to the year. Gretchen, I think you said that Q2 was going to be down low single digits. We talked about the sequential improvement of margins similar to what we saw last year between Q1 and Q2, around 270 basis points. Just kind of plugging it in and assuming kind of stable corporate costs and interest expense, everything else, I mean, I see the contribution relative to the midpoint of your full year guidance closer to 20%, not 25%. And then you were saying that Q3 is probably going to be a similar level to Q2, and then you'll see a bump in Q4, which actually would require a fairly substantial increase. And I know you're getting more restructuring and other items, but it just seems unusually large. Maybe I kind of misunderstood the comments, but can you just walk through that a little bit more just to make sure we're all clear on what you're saying?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so let me maybe back up a step. So when you look at the sequential growth we'll have from the first and second quarter, you do the math, it's over $100 million of top line. And essentially, we're getting in the mid-30s from a drop rate, which -- it's supported by normal volume leverage. I think you can see how sensitive the business is to that from the first quarter results. Plus you've got the incremental restructuring kicking in from the actions that were initiated in the first quarter. As you get into the back half, you have stable revenue between the third and fourth quarter, and then you get a pretty sizable pickup in the fourth quarter. It does have high drop rates when you do the top level math. One, we would expect to see that in terms of the different markets that we're seeing, but you've also got the benefits from the restructuring actions that are going to hit heavy in the second half of the year. And so when you play all that math through, I think you can get yourself pretty close to the incrementals. The base business is dropping anywhere from 35% to 40%, given the volume lift that we're getting. And then you tack on restructuring on top of that, and that will get you there.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So on the project work that you have line of sight on, I typically would think of those as kind of lower-margin type of projects. Is that not necessarily the case? And it sounds like maybe not, if you think the drop-through was so high.
Michael T. Speetzen: No, there's definitely some impact there. We talked when we issued our guidance the first round that, for us this year, we essentially said mix is somewhat neutral. You've got a little bit of headwind coming from some of the projects, but you've also got a pickup coming from the mix for dewatering and some of the activities we have going on from a price-to-cost ratio.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just lastly, on kind of the frac-ing comments that you were making, you expect that to start to improve. I mean, a lot of the equipment guys in the market are discussing, while there may be some incremental improvement given some of the higher gas prices, there is a ton of equipment that's just sitting idle that needs to be absorbed before equipment actually -- or equipment orders actually start to improve. Do you not see similar dynamics? Do you not need to see, I guess, a period of absorption before you would see the benefits of, I guess, just market trends improving on that?
Michael T. Speetzen: Well, there's certainly some of that at play. But you have to also remember, most of that business is service-related. So they may have equipment sitting there, but they need personnel there to run it. So when you think about the activities that we have from a frac pad perspective, there's certainly equipment rental, but there's also the folks that are there monitoring and ensuring that the water flow is consistent and reliable.
Gretchen W. McClain: Right. So it's rental. I mean, a lot of times they're renting this equipment, the more they're using them -- their mine as compared to just necessarily expanding out to another drill site.
Operator: That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor to Gretchen McClain for closing remarks.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, let me just close with a thank you. Thank you for your time and your support for the business. We're looking forward to our next call and showing you where we are, but we've got great activities going on in terms of advancing the business around growth. Our new product launches, our services, our acquisition strategy are taking traction in the marketplace, and we feel confident in the direction that we're going. Again, thank you very much for your time.

Gretchen McClain: Thank you, Phil. Good morning and Happy New Year. Thanks for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. We made substantial progress in 2012 putting a foundation in place and defining a clear path to realizing our full potential. We are confident in our course and we are moving forward this year with continued focus on leveraging our full power of our portfolio, our industry knowledge and our customers’ relationship to grow this business. While we were disappointed from a top line perspective in 2012, we entered the New Year with relatively stable market conditions, a resilient portfolio and plan to earn to drive earnings growth centered on improving our competitive positions, simplifying our business and continue our focus on cost saving initiates to provide flexibility to expand our growth strategy. Later in the presentation we will discuss how we see 2013 from a market perspective and the actions we’ve been taking to deliver earnings growth and impact of these conditions. Now I’d like to walk you through our fourth quarter results. We received orders of $926 million, up 3% in constant currency and 2% organically. Revenues from the fourth quarter was $969 million, down 3% compared to prior year, when we registered over $1 billion in revenue, an all-time record performance. Revenue in the U.S. and Europe was down 4% organically versus the prior year, while super storm Sandy provided a benefit of approximately $8 million, it did not offset weak Industrial and Public Utility markets. Within the emerging markets which today represents approximately 20% of our revenue base, fourth quarter revenues were down 2% organically. However when you exclude the timing of large project shipments the fourth quarter of 2011, emerging markets grew 9%. Investments made in key countries like Russia and China resulted in double-digit growth in this quarter. We’re reporting gross margins of 39.4% for the fourth quarter, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 points to 13.4%. These results demonstrate our commitment and ability to drive operating performance from our business even in a challenging growth environment. Our strong operating performance during the quarter resulted in earnings per share of $0.47 up 21% on a normalized basis. Overall, we delivered strong operating performance, delivering additional penny of earnings relative to our guidance, despite lower than anticipated volumes. Our full-year 2012 financial highlights are as follows. Orders of $3.8 billion were in line with revenue and we are exiting the year with a backlog of $647 million, roughly in line with prior year. Revenues had increased 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 39.6%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Operating margin was 12.9%, up 100 basis points on a normalized basis. To put this into perspective, our full-year margin came in right around the midpoint of our original guidance we set last February, a significant achievement given that impact of lower volumes and dilutive transaction and integration cost from the MJK and Heartland acquisitions. It also includes the addition of incremental standalone costs of $28 million. At the bottom line, we’ve recorded EPS of $1.77 exceeding our previous guidance by $0.01. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $312 million, a conversion ratio of 100%. Now I’d like to provide you with an update on the business and the progress we’ve made on our strategic initiatives. We continue our focus on acquiring businesses that set our strategic objectives for growth, and we believe we’ll achieve attractive returns on invested capital. During the third quarter of 2012, we acquired MJK, followed by the acquisition of Heartland Pumps in the fourth quarter and earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of PIMS Group. I’ll spend some time on the next slide walking through the PIMS acquisition. We’ll just say for now is that our integration process is working both MJK and Heartland are already exceeding our expectations. In fact well we expected the impact of Heartland to have been $0.01 dilutive to the fourth quarter, it was neutral to earnings. We are excited to have added these three acquisitions to what is already the world’s broadest portfolio or water focused solutions and we believe our pipeline provides opportunity to deploy our capital in a disciplined fashion in this fragmented market to drive growth and return for our shareholders. Last year we began several steps to better align ourselves to maximize our presence and efficiency in Europe. The European market is and will continue to be a critical region for us. We’ve operated there successfully for more than 100 years and have built a large install base with trusted customer relationships. By capitalizing on our entire portfolio of products and services and leveraging our scale and expertise more efficiently, we not only preserve but enhance our competitive positions. We made significant progress on this initiative beginning with the establishment of a new European headquarters in Schaffhausen in Switzerland. We also initiated some restructuring steps in 2012 and this year we will be taking additional restructuring and realignment actions targeting at advancing this new European management structure for growth. By driving our strategic and operating decision making aligns Xylem in Europe we will best – we will best positioned to take a more focused view of our customers’ needs and optimize our cost savings, differentiating Xylem in the marketplace. We made good progress in delivering customer value. For the year, we achieved the Vitality Index of 15% which is our internal measurement for our new product as a percent of total revenue. This is up from 12% in 2011 and reflects the successful deployment of innovative new product applications and services for the relevant customer segments. This means we generated over $0.5 billion in revenue from new products – new innovative product launches including more than one-third from application self designs reducing the energy consumption of our customers processes. During the quarter, we announced plans to open a new office in Saudi Arabia to continue to build our already strong position in the Middle East and Africa region which today represents approximately 5% of total Xylem revenues. Accelerating our presence in market penetration in the emerging markets will continue to be a key focus area for Xylem. And I am pleased to announce that we recently proposed and achieved Board approval to increase our first quarter dividend by 15%. Our annual dividend payout will be approximately $86 million assuming the Board approved each of the next three quarter dividends at the same amount as the first quarter. This reflects our confidence in continuing to generate strong free cash flow from the business. Beyond 2013, our dividend policy will be to propose dividend increases in line with earnings growth. Turning to Slide 4, this week we announced the acquisition of privately held PIMS Group with fiscal year 2012 revenues of $38 million for a purchase price of $57 million. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our aftermarket service business and accelerate our expansion in the contract services. Located in and servicing more than 10,000 locations in the U.K., PIMS specializes in the installation and maintenance of water and waste water pumping systems, sewers and drains and waste water treatment plants. The business provides municipal, industrial and private customers with 24x7 support services. We expect to leverage its market leading business processes throughout our global footprint with minimal additional capital investments, while enhancing the services we already provide today. With Xylem’s large install base, PIMS is a perfect match to ensure customers are provided with industry leading products, application solutions and enhanced aftermarket support services. We expect to generate cost synergies with the acquisition and to generate revenue synergies in the U.K. and as we expand globally. We expect the PIMS to be margin dilutive during 2013 as we get through the normal purchase accounting step up adjustments and integration costs. And we expect that PIMS will be EPS neutral in 2013 and accretive in 2014. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen to walk you through the 2012 detailed results. Mike?
Mike Speetzen: Thanks Gretchen. Please go to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter Xylem revenues were $969 million, down 3% from our record fourth quarter in 2011. Let me provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and full-year revenue performance by end-market and by region. First in our largest end-market Industrial, organic revenue was down low single-digits, year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Despite the impact from super storm Sandy, U.S. continued to be negatively impacted by dry weather conditions and the slowdown in water transport supporting natural gas fracking. European industrial market weakness continued in the fourth quarter down mid single-digits. Industrial performance in emerging markets was robust with Latin America and the Middle East and Africa regions posting double-digit gains over the prior year. On a sequential basis, Industrial grew mid single-digits in the fourth quarter driven by Europe, reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Overall, full-year organic revenues for Industrial were up low single-digits. Fourth quarter revenues from the Public Utility market declined high single-digits year-over-year. This was weaker than our expectation of a low single-digit decline. As we mentioned on our last quarter’s call we saw the acceleration of some deliveries into the third quarter and we knew we were facing a difficult time given the sizable projects we delivered in 2011. The varying levels of uncertainty among public utilities both in the U.S. and Europe resulted in the delay of smaller projects in discretionary maintenance and drove the additional weakness in this market. Overall, full-year organic revenues for Public Utilities were down approximately 1%. Commercial Building services were up low single-digits. In the U.S. we saw market conditions weaken in the back half of the year. Super storm Sandy partially offset this weakness providing approximately $1.5 million in revenue for the quarter. Outside of the U.S., we saw strength in Latin America driven by several small project shipments and Europe was flat year-over-year. Overall full-year organic revenues were flat for the Commercial end-market in line with our expectations. Residential was up low single-digits in the fourth quarter. U.S. market was up mid single-digits driven by seasonal promotions and the benefit of approximately $0.5 million contributable to super storm Sandy. Despite the contribution from our recently launched high-energy efficient Ecocirc Circulator, Europe was down low single-digits given continued weakness in the housing market. Overall, full-year organic revenues were down low single-digits for the Residential end-markets, in line with our previous expectations. And as far Agriculture, we were up mid single-digits for the fourth quarter driven by better than expected results out of Europe. Overall full-year organic revenues were up low single-digits in line with our previous expectations. Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 4% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 5% for the year in line with our previous expectations. Europe was down 4% in fourth quarter and was down 1% for the year slightly below our expectation of flat year-over-year performance, driven by weakness in the residential market. Emerging markets organic revenue declined 2% for the fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of several large project shipments which we delivered during the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding these projects, emerging market revenue was up approximately 9%. Emerging market organic revenues were in mid single-digits over the full-year in 2012. Adjusted operating income was up 8% despite lower than expected organic revenue, fourth quarter operating margins came in at 13.4% up 140 basis points after absorbing the minimal impact of incremental standalone ramp up costs. Gross margin was 39.4% for the fourth quarter, up 150 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost improvements more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. By driving gross margin performance we are able to continue to invest in our business while expanding operating margins. Investments in the fourth quarter impacted operating margins by 30 basis points. For this quarter, our operating margin contribution for price offset material cost inflation. The MJK and Heartland Pump acquisitions were 10 basis point headwind operating margins for the quarter, reflecting the impact of purchase accounting and integration costs. The impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction favorably impacted our operating margins by 20 basis points. Please turn to Slide 6. This slide shows our EPS walk for the fourth quarter. This has been a transition year for Xylem and as such there were lot of moving parts. So I am going to spend some time this morning as we have on previous calls describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts we’ve adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clear picture of how we performed operational efforts last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between we made two sets of adjustments. For the fourth quarter on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.28 by $0.11 to show 2011 on a comparable basis. For the fourth quarter of 2012, on the right side of the chart, we adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.39 by adding back the net negative impact of 2012 one-time separation costs, restructuring and realignment costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments for the fourth quarters on a comparable normalized basis to allow for better view of operational performance. This analysis shows that normalized EPS increased 21% or $0.08 and was completely driven by core operations including actions taken to reduce costs and restructuring activities initiated in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. Acquisition impacts, foreign exchange translation and our operating tax rate were neutral to our EPS performance. We previously provided a range of restructuring and realignment costs of $15 million to $20 million with related savings of approximately $10 million. For the year, restructuring and realignment came in at $24 million and will yield savings of approximately $12 million in 2013. Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenues of $637 million, down 5% over prior year on a constant currency basis and down 7% organically. The MJK and Heartland Pump acquisitions contributed two points to top line growth and foreign exchange was a one point headwind. Transport declined 5% for the fourth quarter driven by weakness in both Public Utility and Industrial markets were we saw mid single-digit declines. Despite approximately $6 million of revenue due to super storm Sandy, our U.S. dewatering business was down significantly from the prior year due to ongoing drought conditions, lack of public utility funding for projects and lower industrial rentals particularly for natural gas fracking applications which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2011. Treatment revenues declined 18% for the fourth quarter, by the general decline of project activity and the delay of project shipments in 2013. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2011, we saw a 21% increase in Treatment driven by the timing of large shipments in the Latin America which did not repeat in 2012. Test revenues were up 1% due to strength in emerging markets partially offset by continued weakness in Europe. Fourth quarter operating margins came in at 16.5% of a 120 basis points for 2011. Operational excellence and restructuring savings expanded operating margins by 380 basis points, where our customer excellence initiative drove price to 270 basis points and as a result, more than offset the impact of inflation and provide a flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Our margins were however negatively impacted to the previously mentioned lower rental dewatering volume and acquisition headwind from purchase accounting and operation costs. Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Applied Water’s fourth quarter revenue was up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Foreign exchange was a 1% headwind bringing our total growth in the segment 3%. Building services was up 2% driven by Commercial and Residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was up 6% due to favorable general industrial market conditions across most regions. In the U.S. our results were favorably impacted by the timing of shipments we mentioned during the last quarter call. Excluding these dynamics U.S. Industrial Water applications were slightly weaker than expected. Europe was up low single-digits driven by growth in Russia and we continue to see favorable results in Asia-Pac. And lastly Irrigation was up 4% with Europe up mid single-digits, partially offset by the U.S. which was down low single-digits. Fourth quarter operating margins came in at 11.6%, up 240 basis points from 2011. Price and productivity actions and benefits from severance actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011 more than offset the impact of lower volume, unfavorable mix and inflation enabling continued investment in this segment. Now let me turn to Slide 9 and review our financial position. We generated $312 million of free cash flow for the year, a conversion on adjusted net income of a 100%. Our cash flow is down from 2011 as anticipated, driven primarily by interest payments of $53 million related to the debt put in place as a result of this spin on from ITT. In addition, we had an incremental U.S. Federal and State tax payments in 2012. As a reminder the 2011 figures are a result of the carved out financials provided in the Form-10 and reflected in allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed as Xylem obligation for the purposes of the Form-10 statement. Note that adjusting to these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance. As you can see from the slide, working capital as a percent of revenue increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 100 basis points and was partially offset by 20 basis points of operational improvements. Improved collection performance and favorable supplier terms more than offset investment inventory to support shorter lead times expected from customers. As it relates to our capital structure, we ended the year in a strong position. Our available cash on hand was $504 million. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 25% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations at current rates. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. Before we turn to the guidance details, let me turn the call back over to Gretchen to provide you with the framework we are working in 2013. Gretchen?
Gretchen McClain: Please turn to Slide 11. I want to say a few minutes providing you with our strategic framework that guides and drives our decisions and actions. We will spend more time in our upcoming Investor Day on March 7 explaining this to you. But simply put these are our key goals and initiatives and from here we develop plans for change and ways to measure the change. It’s our business model to drive excellence throughout the business. In 2012, we made substantial progress putting a foundation in place as a pure play water technology company, taking it to the next level and positioning Xylem for the long-term requires a few things. First an incredible focus on delivering customer values. We price customer intimacy above all and working to meet customer needs and deliver the unique value as part of our company DNA. We will continue to deliver value across our portfolio, products and services and actively seek new ways to create more value to bring together our application expertise and integrated processes across the business to help solve the complex water challenges our customers confront. Through our Xylem Total Care program coupled with the benefits of the PIMS acquisition, we’re enhancing our aftermarket capabilities to protect and expand our large install base. Our applications knowledge gives us the ability to provide energy audits, system upgrades and solutions focused on reducing our customers total cost of ownership. Second, drive profitable growth. We are balancing growing our main lines of business with pursuing dynamic new opportunities, both through organic investments and our disciplined acquisition strategies. We will accomplish this by indexing and innovative offerings in high potential areas like smart products, energy efficiency and reuse, expanding our gross platforms, analytics and dewatering and extending our geographic position in the key markets, both emerging and underserved matured markets. And we will maximize revenue and profitability and carefully manage how we use our capital to invest in our business, balance risk and opportunity and return to our shareholders. Third, improve business sustainability. We are focused on continuously improving the efficiency and effectiveness in all we do, which translates into greater competitive advantage and builds a sustainable product goal of financial stability and flexibility. We will continue our focus on optimizing our cost structure. We plan to invest $60 million to $70 million in restructuring and realignment in 2013. As I discussed earlier, in Europe we are repositioning our business as well as talking other targeted actions to better position us in the future. And we are driving robust operating rhythms throughout the organizations. These changes will lead to achieving our goals and enabling innovations, agility and speed which are necessary to address the long-term market drivers of demand in the water industry. So let me set the stage for our 2013 guidance before I hand it over to Mike to walk through the details. Turn to Slide 12. This slide shows our revenue profile on a trailing four quarter basis since 2011 and highlights some of the key major drivers that have influenced our actual performance and our forecast for 2013. As the chart illustrates, we experienced strong growth in 2011 driven by the delivery of large project orders received in 2010. Strong performance from dewatering and analytical businesses acquired in 2010 and general strength across all end-markets driven by the recovering global economies. We started to see order rates for a large public utility CapEx project flow in the second half of 2011 impacting Public Utilities revenue growth in 2012. Compared to the strong performance in 2011, the U.S. dewatering business was impacted by drought conditions along with the slowdowns in natural gas related fracking activities. While European political and economies concerns made headlines in 2012, our European business remained resilient down only 1%. Like most other companies, we saw a general slowdown in the U.S. and European industrial markets in the latter half of 2012. Taken together this led to a flat organic revenue growth with a more difficult second half of the year. Looking forward to 2013, we expect the second cash flow down experienced in 2012 continue to impact the first half of 2013. Compared with relative prior year periods, we expect revenue will be down mid single-digits in the first quarter of 2013, down low single-digits in the first half of 2013 and up low single-digits through the balance of the year. We expect Europe to remain relatively stable and expect the U.S. to strengthen in the second half along with reacceleration in emerging market growth, this sequential improvement in underlying demand for our business as the year progresses. Please turn to Slide 13 where Mike will walk you through each of the end-markets and our 2013 guidance.
Mike Speetzen: Thanks Gretchen. On a global basis Industrial remains our largest end-market representing 43% of our revenues in 2012. In this market we provide cards which are critical running our customers base operations for energy efficient products and total cost of ownership of value by our customers. In addition the majority of our dewatering revenues are associated with Industrial end-markets. With some uncertainty around where U.S. industrial demand will go and European industrial production is expected to remain challenged, we anticipate our revenues will be flat to up low single-digits organically in 2013. In addition to slightly improving economic conditions in the U.S. and emerging markets, we see additional expansion of our Treatment solutions into Industrial applications and a return to more normal weather patterns for dewatering business in the U.S. Revenues from Public Utility is now 35% of our total revenue, and are expected to be flat with 2012 levels. We continue to expect stability and required operations and maintenance activities as this spin is largely non-discretionary and is funded by tariffs end-users. As we’ve discussed during previous quarters, the portion of Public Utility revenue does drive from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project orders. Given the longer lead times for such projects and the absence of insignificant change in CapEx spending levels our forecast for 2013 assumes that this continues to be case for this year. We expect the demand for emerging market public utility infrastructure will drive growth for Xylem in 2013. Our revenues from commercial markets are expected to be flat to up low single-digits. While indicators such as the Commercial Architecture Building Index have improved slightly in recent months, we expect market demand in the U.S. to remain flat for at least the first three quarters. European commercial construction is expected to remain challenged, offset by growth in emerging markets. Residential markets support flat to low single-digit growth as our product sales are largely driven by replacement sales associated with our large install base. Agriculture remains a small market for us and revenues are likely to be flat given the benefit we received from drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012. Taken together, the low growth economic environment along with the relative stability of demand from the variable types of products we sell across the variety of end-markets suggest flat to low growth in 2013. Please turn to Slide 14 and I’ll walk you through the guidance details. We anticipate 2013 revenues of approximately $3.9 billion which reflects total growth 3% to 4% consisting of flat to 1% organic growth, two points of growth from acquisitions of MJK, Heartland and PIMS and a one point benefit from foreign exchange. For Water Infrastructure we expect 2013 revenue of approximately $2.5 billion reflecting total growth of 4% to 5%. Organic growth for Water Infrastructure is expected to be flat to 1%. The previously mentioned acquisitions will contribute three points of growth while foreign exchange has a one point benefit. Finally for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. This reflects growth of 1% to 2% driven by organic growth of flat to 1% and one point benefit from foreign exchange. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.3% and company operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.90. This range excludes one-time restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $60 million to $70 million pre-tax. That includes approximately $5 million pre-tax of additional one-time separation cost and $5 million pre-tax higher pension costs. Of the $60 million to $70 million we plan to execute restructuring actions in 2013, which will cost approximately $40 million to $50 million with an expected payback of approximately two years and we expect approximately $13 million to $15 million of net savings to be realized in 2013. This is in addition to the $12 million of savings resulting from the actions executed in 2012. Free cash flow conversion is forecast to be approximately 95% slightly lower than 2012 after taking into account restructuring payments and capital expenditures related to the European realignment and targeted expansion of dewatering. We also have the remaining actions required to separate from ITT including IT systems to exit service agreements and as well as the required relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% a reduction from 24% in 2012. This rate reflects a sustainable benefit from the establishment of our new European headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Please note, because of certain milestones including the rollout of the European structure across our regional businesses, we expect the operating tax rate to average approximately 22% over the first half of 2013 and 20% over the second half. Our fully diluted share count is expected to be a 186.4 million which takes into account our share repurchase program targeted at offsetting dilution associated with the various Xylem employee stock plans. Finally, let me summarize our capital deployment plans. Our first priority remains organic investments as this is the highest returning investment we can make. To this end we see investing 2.5% to 3% of revenue in CapEx, 3% into R&D and just under 2% into restructuring and realignment to enhance our competitive position [ph]. Inorganic growth remains a top priority. Our acquisition capacity and pipeline support continued investments. As Gretchen mentioned we’re increasing our dividend by 15% and have the intention to grow at future years in line of earnings. Please turn to Slide 15 which illustrates our EPS and operating margin walk in 2012 to the midpoint of 2013 guidance. For 2013, we are incorporating a remaining required one-time separation costs in the – for IT systems and corporate headquarter relocation into our guidance. These costs result in a $0.02 reduction in EPS and a decrease of 10 basis points for operating margins in 2013. The impact of foreign exchange and the acquisitions of MJK, Heartland and PIMS are neutral to EPS that reduces our 2013 operating margin by 40 basis points. Operating margins related to the acquisitions are unfavorably impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments and integration and transaction costs. Excluding these impacts, operating margins for all the three acquisitions will be accretive to Xylem’s operating margin. Cost savings initiatives and productivity are expected to drive a $0.07 benefit to EPS and 50 basis points to margin improvement, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher pension costs of approximately $0.02, continued investment growth initiatives and the headwind from a low organic growth environment. Finally, our European realignment led $0.03 to EPS. The lower tax rate discussed on the previous slide will more than offset the higher run rate costs associated with new European organizational structure. At the segment in operating marginalize this is expected to have a 30 basis point negative impact. The combination of all these items result in an adjusted EPS with $1.85 and adjusted operating margin of 12.6%, consistent with our guidance midpoint of 2013. Please turn to Slide number 16 and I’ll turn it back over to Gretchen to wrap up.
Gretchen McClain: In summary, 2012 was certainly a challenging but rewarding first full year. Looking back we established an organization with the ability to handle adversity, adapt to changing market dynamics and deliver strong performance. We’ve discussed in detail how we’ve advanced our strategic position over the past 12 months. Launched new innovative products and services and were recognized by organizations and customers as best in class. We delivered strong financial and operational performance despite macro challenges which resulted in softer top line performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. We drove significant growth margins and operating margin expansions in line with our original guidance and we are taking actions to project our progress and continue our efforts we initiated in 2012. As we move forward to 2013, we will focus and maintain our focus on improving our competitive position, investing for long-term growth and increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We ended the year well positioned in the marketplace with a strong balance sheet and an organization still to succeed. With that we’re happy to take your question. Operator?
Operator: The floor is now open to the questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Thank you, good morning everyone.
Mike Speetzen: Good morning.
Gretchen McClain: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: I was interested in hearing more about the PIMS acquisition, the move with the services does cope up with the equipment model but if you can comment on how you scale the service business, there is a lot of headcount in terms of returns of that business model, so how much has it been growing and how do you scale it and do you get a flow through of your aftermarket products through service organizations like PIMS?
Gretchen McClain: Yes, Deane let me step back a little bit and we’ve been talking about our aftermarket strategy for quite some time. We’ve been spending enormous amount of time driving what we call our Total Care program is. And so in all of our businesses where we have a large install base, our sales teams have been working aggressively to make sure that we’re capturing the parts and services but also bringing advanced services where we can bring the broad portfolio of products that we have and our ability to going and do energy audits and so forth. What we get with PIMS is, one, some very nice processes. We also get a very talented group of folks that have a core competency that we can help train geographically our teams that are positioned very well. So we not only do we get a great position in the U.K. which complements where today we play in the public utility and 90% of their customer base is non-public utility. We also get a core competence of talent that we can actually use to help our teams geographically expand.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great, and then just a quick follow-up for Mike. Can you comment on the lower tax guidance and you know what’s driving that and sustainability?
Mike Speetzen: Yes, good question, Deane. We do quite a bit of work around the tax planning. As we have mentioned in prior discussions, we actually were fortune to take the tax leader [ph] that was at ITT with us given the global footprint that we have. So we’ve been doing a lot of work around the planning aspects. I think the key elements is this is a sustained tax rate improvement from some of the restructuring that we’re doing in Europe and we look at it as a great position not only the leverage, including other parts of our current portfolio but as we look to bring new acquisitions into the full that will give us a good leverage point in terms of doing some sustainability around further improvements in our tax rate.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more, I understand the relocation of the headquarters, but just what you are doing from – heavy lifting perspective in terms of restructuring, are you taking out facilities, people, can you put other numbers sort of behind that, and then what do you expecting the payback to be on the $60 million to $70 million year investing in ‘13 as we think about at ‘14?
Gretchen McClain: Sure, Matt, let me first talk a little bit about what we’re trying to do in Europe. We’ve been positioned in Europe for quite some time, and as a separate independent company, we have not really been totally utilizing or leveraging our unique and broad capabilities as a total Xylem in the water industry. And so our objective here is to setup the headquarters, one headquarters, today we have three headquarters in Switzerland. We will be aligning our strategies around our end-markets that we go to and so couple of the restructuring actions will lead to consolidating multiple sales companies in one country. And we’ll be able to leverage our back office more efficiently and effectively. We’ll be able to set up shared services to support the teams across Europe. They have centers of [ph] excellence and ultimately be able to get some opportunity to leverage, manufacturing, our supply chain leverage, commodity-wise across the whole organization. So I feel like we’re going to be able to position ourselves to be able to work more effectively and efficiently in the market, but ultimately be able to bring more value to our customers. Mike, you can walk through the numbers.
Mike Speetzen: Yes, so Matt let me just kind of step back and hit some of the numbers. So in 2012, we executed about $17 million from a cost perspective of restructuring. We got about a $1 million of benefit in 2012. The remaining $12 million will be a benefit in 2013. Out of the $60 million to $70 million of restructuring and realignment, $40 million to $50 million of that is restructuring and we see that giving us a benefit in 2013 of about $13 million to $15 million. So think about the total restructuring benefit from actions done in 2012 as well as 2013 in a range of $25 million to $27 million. The payback period on these like we’ve articulated before given the fact that we’re focused primarily around Europe is going to be approximately two years.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Okay and so then we should think about that, in other words [ph] you are getting a one to one dollar payback that there is somewhere in the range of $35 million to be – they will be back in ‘14, is that the right way to think about it, Mike?
Mike Speetzen: Yes, we’re essentially from an execution standpoint for the actions being done in 2013, pardon me, planning in Q1 execution in Q2 and then we’ll be looking for run rate savings to have achieved in Q3 and Q4.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan Connors – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thank you, good morning.
Gretchen McClain: Good morning.
Ryan Connors – Janney Montgomery Scott: I had a question in regards to foreign exchange, last year you all made a downward guidance revision based on the Euro and translation and given now strongly the Euro in particular has rebounded and look at the guidance assumptions, a little bit surprised that Forex has a little tailwind as it is in that 100 basis points, so you can just talk us through Mike, kind of the assumptions you’re making around currency and the Euro in particular? Thanks.
Mike Speetzen: You bet. Euro is clearly the largest driver we have. In the guidance we used a $1.32. Rates have been trading at slightly higher than that, but just from a modeling perspective if you look back the average rate that we had during the 2012 time period is about $1.20. And so as we look at that, it’s about 1% pickup from a top line perspective. Obviously if the rate were to hold at a $1.35 you would see some incremental pickup. If anybody shot in terms of where the Euro is going to go, if you look at what the projections are through the balance of the year, the Euro is supposed to moderate some based on what they are projecting with interest rates but certainly if it were to hold at the levels it is today we would see potential upside from where we’re at today but again it’s all translation, it has a minimal a impact on the bottom line.
Ryan Connors – Janney Montgomery Scott: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore – Canaccord Genuity: Good morning, thanks. On the repositioning, I was wondering if you could talk a little under term once you get through the actions in Europe, how much more runway that you have streamline in the business in where you’re at?
Gretchen McClain: So we’ve been making actions as we established Xylem, and so if you were to look at our Asian organization today, we have aligned around the Xylem organization across our Asian region. We’ve been making some moves in Europe, a couple of countries have already integrated and so that has been positive. And so we’ll be making actions. Europe is critical. It’s a market that’s challenged right now. It’s an important customer base. And so those are the first major steps. But I do feel overall we’ve got a nice alignment in the organization and we’re trying to take those big steps now to position ourselves for the long-term. We’ll give a little bit more color in March at our Investor Day but the big step is in Europe.
Chip Moore – Canaccord Genuity: Great, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Good morning, couple of quick questions. On the spin cost, can you elaborate a little bit more of what we’re seeing and why we’re still seeing that cost, (inaudible) and then maybe a little bit more differentiating the orders for the fourth quarters given that they were up so much and your commentary about public utility is being down, I am assuming that the order growth is more industrial than public utility maybe you can get down for us?
Mike Speetzen: Yes, let me David take the one-time spin cost. Obviously at the time of spin we did our best estimate what do we take to effectively separate ourselves from ITT. When you look at the total amount of money that was spend to exit, the remaining $5 million that we’re talking about in guidance is relatively small. It’s not related to anything that we did not know about. We spent the better part of 2012 trying to make sure that we had a good effective strategy for the IT systems exit as well as exiting our current location for our new corporate headquarters. So it’s nothing that wasn’t anticipated. It was tough to put a number around it. At the end of the day we weren’t going to compromise an effective and efficient exit. I do not see anything beyond this, this effectively ends all the inter-learnings [ph] that we have with ITT this year. So this is the reason we pointed out is to ensure that as you think of the margin going forward it’s not an ongoing cost.
Gretchen McClain: Yes, let me talk a little bit about the fourth quarter dynamics. As we all saw the confidence level in Europe and some of the confidence level around the U.S. fiscal cliff, had people falling back high on their budgets. So we saw that both in Public Utilities and Industrial. In the Public Utilities, part of that was driven by some of the orders that were pulled forward in third quarter but we did see some pulling back. We’ve done a lot of discussion with our customers to understand what’s going online and what to expect going forward. We did see them extending some of their business activities not something we think is a trend or difficult and we also had some very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it was our all-time record fourth quarter in 2011 at $1 billion and a significant part of that growth was tied to treatment orders in the fourth quarter of 2011 – sales in 2011 which didn’t of course repeat. The good thing is we held some nice orders in the fourth quarter of 2012 around treatments so we are feeling good about that. Let me just come back in terms of the order rates we’ve seen, we’ve talked about bidding activities still being strong, bidding activity is still good, our pipeline or I should say our funnel is very full but there is not a significant change in terms of the release of those bids into orders. So see something happen in the fourth quarter, not sure that’s the trend. It’s too early to say that at this point in time and so we’ve not take that in. We think we’re going to still see that market very challenged going forward.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Moore with C.L. King.
John Moore – C.L. King: Thank you, good morning. Can you quantify any benefits that Sandy had on the order rate in the fourth quarter, and do you expect to have any benefit from Sandy related demand in the first quarter or longer term?
Gretchen McClain: Yes, let me comment. On fourth quarter we saw $8 million from Sandy that came from both of our segments. The largest portion of it from dewatering business, the team did a remarkable job in executing and being there helping our customers. In terms of 2013, we all know that the Disaster Spending Bill has been approved, projects are being worked. We’re working very closely with our customers. I think we’re well positioned to be able to benefit when you look at the portfolio that we have, the expertise that we’ve got but again it’s early in the stages of those projects getting laid out that should be something that falls out later. So it’s tough to quantify 2013 impact at this point.
John Moore – C.L. King: Okay, great. The $8 million was the revenue, but was there a similar benefit to orders in the quarter?
Gretchen McClain: Yes.
John Moore – C.L. King: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.
Jim Krapfel – Morningstar: Hi, good morning. I think you partially answered this question already, but would you think the driving – the weakness you’ve seen from your Public Utility customers, do you think it’s more due to weaker electricity usage trends or the necessitated need for doing product plans or do you think it’s more to due to continued low [ph] power prices making utilities more conservative with available cash. So just trying to get a better sense of whether the utility end-market weakness is more secular in nature or is this typical?
Gretchen McClain: I think you have two dynamics. The Public Utilities have been down in the CapEx expenditure for quite some time. They’re at low ends I think 60 years, that’s not changing. We don’t see any indication of that changing. That’s a big piece from the CapEx perspective. From the operational, OpEx side of the house, as I said we felt some dynamics so we pulled some things into the third quarter. We don’t think the aftermarket is a very strong market and given our large install base that we will reposition very well. I also think public utilities are looking at how they can reduce their total cost of ownership that again positions us extremely well to be able to bring solutions to help them take their costs down.
Jim Krapfel – Morningstar: Okay. And then how is the acquisition pipeline looking and what evaluations are you encountering especially relative to the past few quarters?
Gretchen McClain: So our acquisition pipeline is quite strong. We continue to cultivate a lot of different businesses as we know the water industry is quite fragmented and feel good that we have a healthy acquisition pipeline. And it’s working I mean we had three acquisitions over the last three quarters and we feel very good about that. I also felt very good about our acquisition strategy – our pipelines and integration process. Each one of our acquisitions that we’ve acquired are getting well integrated with the businesses, are performing quite well. In terms of evaluation, in the fragmented market you still have various different acquisitions. We have been looking primarily on bolt-ons, smaller, many those who are private companies and it varies whether you are going after a businesses in the services areas, sources whether you are at more of a high attractive value in the analytics or treatment area.
Jim Krapfel – Morningstar: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: I just have a couple of follow-ups, can you talk about, you know from putting Sandy aside for a minute, what was the magnitude of drop-off you saw throughout 2011 in your dewatering business, and given that some of the longer term kind of drought related statistics that at least we look at are still indicating a pretty severe situation here in early ‘13, were you driving the confidence so that business gets better?
Gretchen McClain: Yes, so the water is two dynamics, two very significant dynamics. One an all-time drought in the U.S. which brought that down. And then the other area where we felt 2011 flow is the pickup that we saw in 2011 around the national gas fracking activities. The positive things about our dewatering, dewatering is well positioned in the U.S. We have been able to take that business model and expand ourselves in Australia, now into Brazil and we intend to take that business model into other regions around the world. We think that will ultimately be significant in terms of growth for us and also help cycles with their when you do have some kind of a drought activity. Overall our position in dewatering does serve many multiple different end-markets but we did see a spike in the natural gas which makes it tougher compare [ph]. But we were flat for the year.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Your global dewatering was flat?
Gretchen McClain: Our overall business.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Got it. And then, as we think about the margin dynamics, your core business flat to up 1%, Mike sort of talked to my last question about the anticipated cost savings from the ‘12 actions, what’s going to happen in ‘13 following through for the year. I guess I am having a hard time reconciling to your operating margins being down as much as 50 basis points and I would assume you are looking to take more prices this year?
Mike Speetzen: Yes, so let me comment it from a couple of different angles, Matt. From a pricing point we’ve talked firstly about having a target of 100 to 200 basis points. We’re obviously entering a – continued to be in a tough economic cycle and pricing is going to be towards the lower end of that range versus this year we ended up at about 150 basis points. So there is going to be a little bit of headwind now although we do still see a positive contribution from price. But I think the slide we put together in the deck hit of the some key points, I mean first of all we’ve got a pretty substantial pickup from foreign exchange and acquisitions and while they are not dilutive from an EPS standpoint, they are not bringing any income for the most part to the bottom line and that ends up diluting the margins by about 40 basis points. The foreign exchange piece is more of a triangulation effect of the currency change. The acquisitions, it’s more of a short-term impact of the upfront purchase account and some of the transaction cost. The European realignment was a pickup from an EPS standpoint and drives a substantial portion of the tax benefit. We do have to setup infrastructure in Europe to support that. That’s a 30 basis point headwind. Now the good news is over time that’s going to give us a platform to drive future benefit to the business from an operating (inaudible) and then we’ve articulated really two of the – what I’d say is out of the norm adjustments, one it is the pension discount rate came down about 75 basis points and for us its about $5 million impact. And then the one-time separation costs which we’re about just really trying to make sure we exit the connections with ITT in the right way. And then if you look at our core operations, we’re doing a lot of the same things that we did in 2012, dealing with a low growth environment, we have very robust lean and sourcing initiatives and sure we’re driving productivity to not only offset inflation that give us a little bit of room to continue to invest in the key parts of our business and I think that’s a critical element is we have not backed off making sure that we’re investing in the future of the company. And then the restructuring savings obviously to that to help offset what is some headwind from the other cost increases that I had mentioned a little bit earlier.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Pretty detailed walk, thanks Mike.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Good morning. I just had a only question really on the Public Utility, you hit on some of it but I am just curious what you’re thinking actually is going to take to get the capital projects part of the business to trend upwards, I mean if you think about what – historically how can you refine that, it seems like the healthy – the municipalities is able to issue debt now that we’re seeing some improvements in the residential market, you would think that health of the municipalities are improving. But I am curious is there a kind of a period of absorption that needs to occur or kind of the – the municipalities go less before they are able to get to a point where they are able to improve the bond issuances at the municipal level to start doing these capital projects on a more significant level. We know there is no shortage of demand for new projects, it’s really a matter to regain that capital into the system I think. Can you just – if you could address that?
Gretchen McClain: Sure. It’s a great question. Here is how I think about it, I mean the economy is down until the economy gets dressed in some of the key issues that we’re talking about in the U.S. and other areas it’s going to be a challenge area. Now that’s not stopping us ultimately in terms of strategically looking how we position ourselves in working with our customers to get after cutting, to reducing their operating costs so that they can actually invest in those areas. There are a lot of bills that are out there that are being kicked around and addressed. There are indicators that will say later this year or into 2014 you will see activity taking place, but right now the trends and the orders don’t reflect that. Our teams are aggressively investing in the right technology, so we are well positioned once that opens up.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.
Stewart Scharf – S&P Capital IQ: Can you talk a little bit about the mix in base line, the new products and end-markets, is there – what areas that you are focusing or where the mix generally is better and the margins or is it just pretty even based on the various new products and end-markets?
Gretchen McClain: I would say one thing when I talked about our Vitality Index, we are getting a large percentage of our revenue coming from our new product launches which is a good indication that we have the right technology going into the market. I feel good about that. When I look at the mix, going into ‘13 we think our mix is going to be net neutral. You’ve got emerging markets that is pulling down and that’s an area that is growing and an area that we continue to expand in. Analytics and dewatering is positive.
Mike Speetzen: Yes Stewart and maybe just from a financial standpoint I mean 2012 we saw a lot of negative mix and we had a lot of the drivers around the dewatering business being the primary impact. As we look into 2013, as Gretchen stated, we see mix being less of a factor for us, where we see positive upticks in areas like dewatering and analytics. We’ll see a little bit of an offset from an emerging markets standpoint but nothing that’s significant at this point.
Stewart Scharf – S&P Capital IQ: Okay and just going to your financial allocation, it is pretty much the same, focused on the strategic acquisitions, just raised your dividend, maybe change in planning for use of cash, share buybacks and so forth?
Mike Speetzen: No, I mean we have a share repurchase program as we’ve stated in the past, it’s primarily in that managing the dilution from the equity programs. At this point we have a very robust acquisition pipeline and an ample supply of internal investments and our strategy is going to be to focus in those two areas and continue to reevaluate as time goes on.
Stewart Scharf – S&P Capital IQ: Okay, thank you very much.
Mike Speetzen: You bet.
Operator: That was our final question and I’d now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen for any closing remarks.
Gretchen McClain: Yes, I just want to say thank you for joining us. It’s been a great year. We’ve got a great plan laid out. We are watching the economy very closely. We’re sizing our business to ensure that we’ve got the flexibility for growth. We’re driving of course for growth in our strategic activities. So if we did it and the market changes, that’s a positive thing that we will see in the future. I look forward to seeing you in our Investor Day on March 7. So thank you very much for your time.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s Xylem Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Gretchen W. McClain: Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. Today is a special day for us as it marks our 1-year anniversary as a separately traded public company. As we were getting ready to celebrate this week, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, leaving a path of devastation behind. I'm sure many of you and your families have been affected as many of our Xylem employees have been, so please know that our thoughts are with you. I'm always reminded in the aftermath of crisis situations such as this of the importance of the work we do. In many of the areas where flooding is a huge issue, Xylem is there with our equipment and with our expertise, helping to bring things back to normal as quickly as possible. As I reflect back over the past year and on our accomplishments, I'm proud of our team and how we've come together, staying focused on our customers, advancing our strategic initiatives, all while standing up a new company and in the face of some very difficult economic headwinds. This has been a challenging year by any standard, but a satisfying one as well. The team has sharpened its execution, tightened spending and continues to drive cost reductions to navigate through these challenging times, and as a result, our business operations continue to improve even with lower-than-anticipated revenues. But our journey has just begun. We are laying the path for growth with investments to provide customers with new products, services and solutions they're looking for. We're investing to expand geographically so we can reach our entire servable market and realize our full market share potential. And we continue to expand our portfolio with our disciplined acquisition process. And today, I'll highlight our latest addition, Heartland Pump. So special thanks goes out to our 12,000, 5,000 -- 12,500 Xylem employees around the world. They're dedicated to this business and are driving Xylem forward with long-term goals in mind. Now I'd like to walk you through our third quarter results. Our team delivered another solid quarter of operating performance. Today, we're reporting third quarter revenue of $931 million, reflecting growth of 3% on a constant currency basis. Organic growth was 1% with acquisitions adding another 2%. Revenue in Europe grew modestly despite underlying market weakness. For the third quarter, organic revenue in Europe were up 1% year-over-year. Exiting the second quarter, we've highlighted our expectations that U.S. growth would moderate during the second half. In the third quarter, U.S. organic revenue declined 3%, relative to a strong prior year performance where we posted revenue growth of 20% and organic revenue growth of 9%. This was driven by slowing industrial markets and continued drought conditions. Emerging markets continue to drive growth, up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strength in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Our continued focus on acquisitions -- attractive acquisitions is helping us drive top line growth, adding 2% during the quarter. It is important to note that in September, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary of the YSI acquisition, and as a result for the quarter, those revenues for the month of September are now included in our organic performance. We received orders of $882 million, down 5% in constant currency resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95. Under normal market conditions, we would have expected a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0 for the overall business. This puts pressure on the top line, leading into what historically has been the strongest quarter of the year. When I look at the project funnel, I remain cautiously optimistic that orders will be released, that activities for capital projects will continue to increase, but the release of orders still remains much slower than anticipated. The key focus for us has been margin expansion. Despite the lower demand, we continue to reach higher levels of profitability. You may recall from our Investor Day last fall, we had set a long-term target in gross margins of greater than 40%. We've made significant progress towards this goal in 2012, including 130 basis point improvement for the third quarter compared to prior year and surpassing the 40% mark for the first time. Operating margin was 12.9%. Excluding the impact of standalone costs, operating margin was up 50 basis points. Earnings per share were $0.44. Core operations and YSI performance drove earnings up $0.02 but were offset by foreign exchange and higher operating tax rate. Overall, our operating performance was solid, particularly in light of the market dynamics around the world. Please turn to Slide 4. Let me provide you an update on the business and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. We continue our focus on acquiring businesses that fit with our strategic objectives for growth and make strong additions to our portfolio. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of MJK and we've been successfully integrating the business into our analytical instrumentation platform. We're still in the early stages but I'm very pleased with our progress. Just last Friday, we announced the acquisition of Heartland Pump, a perfect fit for Xylem as it expands the geographic reach of our dewatering platform. These acquisitions and those that we completed over the last few years have positioned us in 2 very attractive areas, mainly dewatering and analytics. Before I move on to highlight some of our latest product launches, I'd like to recognize that during the third quarter, Xylem was selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability Global Index where we were one of 340 companies selected out of 2,500 applicants and we're also included in the North America Index, an important step in a long journey to demonstrate Xylem's focus on sustainable solutions in our business and in the communities we live. We continue to make great progress in deploying innovative new product applications and services that differentiate Xylem in the marketplace. Earlier this quarter, at the West Tech Trade Conference, we launched our Sanitaire Bioloop Oxidation Ditch into the U.S. market. Globally, this is roughly a $1 billion market. Importantly, in the time of limited CapEx spend -- expenditure by the public utilities, this offering is targeted to retrofit the significant number of aging oxidation ditch treatment plants around the globe, requiring energy-efficient solutions to address needed repairs, higher affluence standards and population growth. Bioloop's extended aeration process effectively removes nitrogen and total phosphorus, but more importantly, by combining our aeration and mixing expertise with our controlled technology that Sanitaire Bioloop can deliver energy savings of more than 50%, providing us with a clear competitive advantage. I'm happy to report that this product has captured the market's attention and we received our first order from the city of Liberty, Kentucky. In Europe, we launched our energy-efficient Lowara Ecocirc, in advance of the EU new eco-design directive, which mandates certain energy efficiency standards for the region beginning on January 1, 2013. Ecocirc not only meets the 2013 standards, but also the more stringent energy efficiency standard set forth by the directives for 2015. Our year-to-date sales for this product line are up 13%. Lastly, I'd just like to quickly highlight that our Flojet business has been recognized by the Coca-Cola Company as supplier of the year. The recognition stems from all of our team has done in terms of strategic execution, product innovation and customer intimacy. We continue our journey to increase our presence in emerging markets. For example, growing industries and the need for water and wastewater infrastructure are driving year-to-date organic growth rates of 20% in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, respectively. We're also working on a number of areas to ensure that we achieve the growth and margin potential our businesses are capable of delivering independent of market conditions. Progress continues against our key priorities as evidenced by our growth and operating margin expansion. Through operational excellence initiatives, we are driving faster efficiencies, lowering production costs and improving on customer satisfaction. For example, continued progress improvements have significantly increased our on-time delivery at our Auburn and Dallas manufacturing sites this year. Our global sourcing supply team has increased our efforts in low-cost countries where we currently have over 100 parts under development to lower our product costs. These projects are focused on expanding and improving the quality of our emerging market supplier base for future growth in the region and globally. Finally, we recently completed a project to reduce packaging costs, and as a result, we have decreased the consumption of wood by 36 tons at our Buffalo facility. This is just one example of the many projects our teams are working daily to reduce costs and implement sustainable solutions throughout Xylem. On the front end of our business, the processes and disciplines we've implemented around pricing through our Customer Excellence programs continues to pay off. We're delivering strong price realization in our results, approximately 1.5% during the quarter, after delivering 1.7% in the first half of the year. And in order to better position us for growth in 2013, we're executing on the restructuring and realignment actions we mentioned during last quarter's call. Turning to Slide 5. Last Friday, we announced the $29 million acquisition of privately held Heartland Pump Rentals & Sales with 2011 revenues of $33 million. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our dewatering business globally, including in the United States, and provides the additional opportunities to leverage our portfolio. With 40% of revenue coming from rental equipment and services, we further enhanced our position in attractive profitable space. With our dewatering platform now over $600 million, this acquisition will benefit from scale advantages around costs and CapEx. Similar to Godwin, Heartland serves a wide range of customers including industrial, public utilities and agencies addressing disaster recovery situations. Turning to Slide 6. Before we look ahead to the fourth quarter, let's take a quick look back and review our performance on a year-to-date basis. Orders of $2.9 billion have slightly outpaced revenue of $2.8 billion. Revenue has increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 39.7%, up 110 basis points over the prior year. Operating margin was 12.7%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year after adjusting for standalone costs. To put this in perspective, our year-to-date operating margin of 12.7% is the same as where we ended 2011, after absorbing $26 million of standalone costs as an independent company. And finally, we reported EPS of $1.29 and generated $171 million of free cash flow. Turning to Slide 7. Looking ahead, I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions and have the plans in place to position Xylem for growth in 2013. Because we've not seen any significant signs of turnaround in the marketplace, we've accelerated additional restructuring and realignment actions and now expect to be at the high-end of our previous range, approximately $20 million in 2012. In addition, we are focused on integrating MJK and Heartland quickly and effectively into our portfolio, while continuing to deploy capital in the disciplined and thoughtful fashion we've demonstrated thus far, an approach focused on delivering sustainable long-term returns on investments for our shareholders. So from a full year perspective, we still expect to deliver revenues of $3.8 billion, reflecting 1% organic growth, the low-end of our previous guidance. Despite volume challenges, we will deliver solid operating performance with margins in the range of 12.7% to 12.9%, and we expect EPS in the range of $1.72 to $1.79, a midpoint of $1.76, including the $0.01 dilutive impact at Heartland. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the detailed results. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 8. In the third quarter, Xylem revenues were $931 million, reflecting 3% growth on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth contributed 1 point to the total and acquisitions added another 2 points of growth. Foreign exchange translation was a headwind of 4 points. Let me provide you with some perspective of our third quarter revenue performance and how we see the remainder of the year by end market and by region. First, in our largest end market segment, industrial, organic revenue was down slightly year-over-year versus expectations of low-single digit growth. The North American region continues to be negatively impacted by dry weather conditions versus the prior-year period, which had seen double-digit growth in dewatering activities. European industrial market weakness continues for the second consecutive quarter. These results were partially offset by strength in mining, particularly in Latin America and South Africa. On a sequential basis, industrial declined low-single digits in the third quarter, driven by weakness in North America and Europe versus our previous expectation that these regions would be relatively flat. We now expect full year organic revenues for industrial to be flat to up low-single digits year-over-year. This range assumes fourth quarter revenues will be down low-single digits. We continue to see and expect resiliency out of the public utility market. Third quarter revenue was up high-single digits with growth coming across most regions, but generally in line with expectations and flat on a sequential basis. We expect second half 2012 revenue to be up low- to mid-single digits over the prior year. The timing of deliveries favorably impacted our third quarter performance and we expect fourth quarter revenue results to be down as a result of project deliveries in 2011. While bidding activity continues to improve, we continue to see capital expenditure delays. Based on the order activity we've seen this year and the strong fourth quarter performance in 2011, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue to be down low-single digits. For the full year, we anticipate public utility revenues to be flat to up low-single digits compared to the prior year. Commercial building services were down high-single digits, reflecting challenging market conditions in Europe, a sluggish recovery in the U.S. and a tough prior-year comparison when we delivered 9% global organic growth. We expect the commercial market will continue to be challenged. We project full year performance to be flat to down low-single digits. This assumes low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter. Residential was down low-single digits in the third quarter compared to a very strong third quarter of 2011, where we saw double-digit organic growth in the U.S. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect low-single digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe, driven by high energy-efficient circulator demand. Overall, we now expect residential revenue to be flat to down slightly for the full year. As for agriculture, we were up high-single digits for the third quarter, driven by better-than-expected results out of the U.S. given continued drought conditions. Overall, we expect full year agriculture to be up low single digits. Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 3% on an organic basis, up 1% year-to-date. As a result, we expect flat year-over-year organic performance for the full year. Europe was up 1% for the third quarter and is now flat year-to-date. We also expect full year organic performance to be flat in this region. Emerging markets continue to drive top line growth, up 6% for the third quarter, with double-digit growth coming from both Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Year-to-date emerging market revenue growth is 9%. We are now projecting full year organic growth to be up high-single digits. Organic order rates were down approximately 7% and book-to-bill was 0.95. Orders were down year-over-year, reflecting large project order delays, drought conditions driving lower demand for dewatering applications and continued softness in the U.S. commercial market. Adjusted operating income was up 2% when adjusted for incremental standalone ramp-up costs incurred in Q3 of 2012. Despite lower-than-expected organic revenue, third quarter operating margins came in at 12.9%, up 50 basis points after adjusting for the impact of standalone costs. Gross margin was 40.2% for the third quarter, up 130 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost improvements more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. By driving gross margin performance, we're able to continue to invest in our business while expanding operating margins. Investments in the third quarter impacted operating margins by 40 basis points. For this quarter, our value GAAP, measured as our operating margin contribution from price versus material cost inflation, was positive, adding 60 basis points and the impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction negatively impacted operating margins by 60 basis points. Please turn to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS walk for the third quarter. This is a transition year for Xylem, and as such, there are a lot of moving parts. So I want to spend some time this morning, as we have on previous calls, describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts, we've adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clearer picture of how we performed operationally versus last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between, we made 2 sets of adjustments. For the third quarter, on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.42 by $0.03 to show how 2011 would have looked had Xylem been a standalone company with the interest expense on debt and required independent company costs. We have also adjusted the numbers to exclude the 2011 impact of one-time separation costs and special tax items. For the third quarter of 2012, on the right side of the chart, we adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.38 by adding back the net negative impact to 2012 one-time separation costs, restructuring and realignment costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments put both third quarters on a comparable normalized basis to allow for a better view of operational performance. The analysis shows that normalized EPS decreased 2% or $0.01. Core operations and the net impact from acquisitions provided $0.02 of EPS growth or 4%, but was more than offset by higher operating tax rate and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. Now let me provide a little bit more detail on our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 10. For the third quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $595 million, up 7% over prior year on a constant currency basis and up 3% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth and foreign exchange with a 5 point headwind. Beginning in September of this year, YSI revenues are included in our organic growth performance. Transport grew 1% for the quarter, driven by favorability in the public utility market where we saw mid-single digit growth for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see a stable environment with growth driven by aftermarket sales and services. In addition, we continue to see strong emerging market growth. Industrial transport was down low-single digits as U.S. drought conditions continue to negatively impact dewatering rental services. Treatment revenues grew 11% for the third quarter, driven by public utility strength. And we expect that public utility treatment revenues will be up on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. However, due to significant project deliveries last year, revenues will be down low-single digits year-over-year. From an orders perspective, we continue to see large robust bid and quote activity but conversion of booked orders continues to push to the right. We've increased our focus and set forth a specific initiative targeted at increasing our share in the high potential industrial treatment market. For example, we highlighted a large order win within the pulp and paper market in the second quarter and we recently won a large Ozone order for aquaculture in Canada. Test revenues were up significantly, driven by the inclusion of the YSI and MJK business. Excluding acquisitions, the test application was up 7% organically year-over-year due to strength in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by continued weakness in Europe. Third quarter operating margins came in at 15.5%, down 80 basis points from 2011, excluding the impact of standalone costs. Our operational and customer excellence initiatives more than offset the impact of inflation and provided flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Our margins were, however, negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower rental dewatering volume. Let me now turn to Slide #11 and talk to our applied water segment. Applied water's third quarter revenue was down 2% on a constant currency basis. Building services was down 6%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I articulated earlier. Industrial water was up 1% due to favorable general industrial market conditions across most regions. In the U.S., revenue declined low-single digits due to shipment delays. We expect these shipments to be delivered in the fourth quarter and as a result, anticipate high-single digit growth in the U.S. And lastly, irrigation was up 9%. U.S. revenues increased by double digits, reflecting strong demand given current weather conditions. Third quarter operating margins came in at 13.2%, up 70 basis points from 2011, excluding standalone costs. Excluding a $2 million asset impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2011, and the benefit from foreign exchange, our operating margins would have declined only 20 basis points despite a 2% reduction in volume. Price and productivity actions more than offset the impact of lower volume, unfavorable mix and inflation, enabling continued investment in the segment. Now let me turn to Slide 12 and review our financial position. We generated $171 million in free cash flow year-to-date, a conversion on adjusted net income of 73%, reflecting typical seasonality for our business. Our cash flow is down from Q3 of 2011 as anticipated, driven primarily by incremental interest payments of $38 million related to the debt put in place as a result of the spinoff from ITT. In addition, we had incremental U.S. federal and state tax payments in 2012. As a reminder, the 2011 figures are a result of the carve out financials provided in the Form 10 and reflected in allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed a Xylem obligation for the purposes of the full intent statement. Note that adjusting for these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance and normal seasonal trend. As you can see from the slide, working capital as a percent of revenue has increased year-over-year. The majority of this increase is driven by foreign exchange rates, but additionally, we are carrying slightly higher inventory levels to ensure we can meet shortened customer lead times. As it relates to our capital structure, we ended the third quarter in a strong position. Our available cash on hand was $424 million, up from the second quarter. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 28% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. And last week, the credit rating agencies affirmed their previous ratings of Xylem. Now let me just turn to Slide 14 and talk about our guidance for 2012. This chart illustrates the walk from our previous guidance midpoint for EPS to our revised guidance. Our previous guidance was for a midpoint EPS of $1.77. FX continues to fluctuate. Based on quarter-end currency spot rates, we expect a $0.02 tailwind when compared to rates assumed in our previous guidance. For example, our current guidance assumes a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.28 for the balance of the year versus $1.22 assumed in our previous guidance. As you can see from the chart, these tailwinds, coupled with additional cost savings actions, enable us to offset the impact of the volume decline. So before we update our full year guidance for the newly announced Heartland acquisition, I would highlight that the midpoint guidance remains at $1.77, consistent with our previous guidance. As we highlighted earlier, we recently announced the acquisition of Heartland, which will add approximately $4 million in revenue and will be $0.01 dilutive due to acquisition costs and purchase accounting impacts in 2012. We expect the acquisition will be accretive in 2013. Please turn to Slide 15. This slide provides all the relevant details for our guidance range. I'd like to highlight just a few key points. We're now projecting full year organic revenue growth of 1%, which is at the low-end of our previous guidance. We expect approximately 1% organic growth from each of our 2 business segments. Because we've lowered the top end of our revenue guidance, we are also lowering the top end of our operating margin range. We now expect operating margins in the range of 12.7% to 12.9%, flat to up 20 basis point over the prior year, including the impact of incremental standalone costs. Excluding standalone costs, this represents an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement. As Gretchen mentioned earlier, we have taken initial steps to address the softening European economic environment and have initiated several restructuring and realignment actions. We anticipate these charges in 2012 to be approximately $20 million. In the third quarter, we incurred $5 million of these costs. We still anticipate that these actions will be substantially completed in 2012, with approximately $3 million of additional costs being incurred in 2013. The run rate savings will be approximately $11 million beginning in 2013. We anticipate less than $1 million of savings in 2012. Year-to-date, we recognize $15 million in onetime separation costs and we expect full year separation costs to be approximately $20 million. Please note that our EPS guidance does not include any impact from restructuring and realignment costs, onetime separation costs and unannounced acquisitions and related costs. Let me now turn the call back over to Gretchen to wrap up.
Gretchen W. McClain: In summary, we had another strong quarter of operating performance. We are and will continue to position ourselves for long-term growth. By investing in our growth platforms, executing a disciplined acquisition strategy and advancing our geographic growth initiatives, I am confident we will deliver long-term growth and higher returns for our shareholders. We continue to launch new products and have the financial ability to continue to invest for future growth. And for our customer and operational excellence initiatives, we will continue to expand operating margins. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have a series of restructuring and realignment actions under way and are developing plans should the market deteriorate further. By making these difficult decisions today, we're preserving investment capabilities and defending and improving our competitive advantages. This will lead ultimately to higher levels of profitability. My last point, we're entering the fourth quarter and shortly thereafter, 2013, with a strong financial position and the flexibility to continue to execute our long-term strategy. With that, we'll be happy take your questions. Brandy?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just first question is regarding the impact of Hurricane Sandy. And of course, we're still early in the process, we understand, but from a disaster recovery standpoint, can you comment on any business interruptions that Xylem has had and then balance that with what are the opportunities for the company on the recovery process. Every time I heard you say low dewatering rentals in the quarter, I'm thinking that obviously you see the big reversal this quarter and even Heartland should participate as well. But if you just talk about what the opportunities are in residential, commercial, industrial and maybe comment on -- I heard on the radio that you all were shipping pumps on an emergency basis and you got a shout out, so maybe comment on that as well.
Gretchen W. McClain: Sure, Dean. Let me talk about Sandy. In terms of your first question, interruptions to the business, I can't really comment right now. What we've been mostly focused on is making sure that we're deploying our equipment and we're trying to get expertise to those who obviously are in need at this time. We've shipped over 200 pumps into this whole North East region. And we have, I understand, another 100-some pumps and we also made sure that some pumps and if we're low on pumps, water system pumps are available to our channel and trying to help them as quickly as we can. So it's a horrible situation, but it's an opportunity for us to be able to engage with our expertise and our equipment. In terms of where we are with fourth quarter, as we're going into the fourth quarter, our orders are not where we want them to be, so this is an opportunity to backfill that. There will be some things that will be offset because things will be pushed to the right because of the disaster. So we'll kind of have to look at it through this quarter and into next -- and first of 2013 to see what the overall impact will be.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just as a follow-up, on your point about some of these order pushouts, maybe you can take us through the different markets, what types of pushouts are you seeing, on the muni side both in and on the industrial side? Are these pushouts as a result of funding issues or a lack of confidence in the outlook, the fiscal cliff and so forth, but a color on the motivation behind the pushouts and potential timing?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, let me first start with industrial. I mean industrial, what we're seeing now is the capital expenditure being challenged. A lot of that's driven by the uncertainty in the economy, people holding back to see what happens here, so where we're seeing a significant part of project delays within the industrial side. As we've been talking about on the capital expenditure side on the public utilities, we saw nice orders in the second quarter. We've seen our bid activity in the third quarter increase. But again, we're not seeing the orders being released at the level that we would have anticipated. So that's the result of the CapEx in the public utilities being down. I don't think it's down any further. I think, right now, they're trying to determine which projects to let go out since they've got a backlog of activities. Commercial area, we saw the same thing in terms of capital expenditures pulling back, people pulling back because of the confidence in the region.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: But no pullback on what would be the break-and-check side of your media business, which is about 70%? Is that still the aftermarket percentage?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, I think our business in terms of operations, maintenance, repair, services has been robust, continues to be resilient in Europe, and our large installed base in those relationships we have with the customers continue to be strong.
Michael T. Speetzen: Dean, I'll add our aftermarket services are up 4.5% through the first 3 quarters of the year as evidence of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. Just in terms of the bidding activity that you talked about, Gretchen, what are you seeing in terms of the pricing dynamic on that project side? Is it -- do you see folks chasing that business so it's getting more competitive pricewise? Or just given the pent-up demand now and as you project capacity out as some of these orders theoretically let in the future, is it actually firming up and getting better?
Gretchen W. McClain: So I wouldn't say the competitive nature has gotten any worse. I really think there's a lot of activity. Of course, our customers are making sure they are looking at choices and getting options. But they're looking specifically on how to resolve the issues. And the bidding activities there, our funnel is as rich as it's been in quite some time. Now the question is a matter of getting those released and getting them actually turned into firm orders.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, if I could just -- a quick follow-up on Deane's first question around Sandy, how much do you typically bake into your guidance for severe weather cleanup? I mean, I know it's impossible to predict the number of storms and where they are geographically, but there is a hurricane season, so there's some regularity there. Can you just give some color on maybe more broadly your thought process on how much -- when you think about guidance and how you bake in that kind of unpredictability?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, so in the third quarter, when you think of the dewatering business, third quarter is typically a large time for seasonal effects. You've got the storms, the hurricanes coming in. And we only saw Isaac this third quarter, part of the reason why our orders and sales are down in our dewatering business. Typically, you'll see 3 or 4 different types of storms and we would react appropriately. So you'll see that typically more so in the third quarter. Going into fourth quarter, you typically don't see that type of seasonality. So we try to factor in an average amount of storms. So in some cases, you'll be down; other cases, you can actually benefit from it like we saw the year before.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: A question on gross margin, obviously, very strong here at 40%, matching your long-term goal. It sounds like, Gretchen, from what you're describing in terms of your order cadence and initiating new restructuring, maybe the top line gets a bit more challenging here before it gets better. I'm just wondering on that gross margin line, can we sustain this type of level in that environment? Or was there anything unusual in terms of mix or one-offs that really helped profit up this quarter?
Gretchen W. McClain: So I would comment just in general on how we're driving the growth margin. I mean, it's coming from several different things. One, we've been driving our commercial excellence activities, which is driving price and we're seeing nice price. We're also seeing the shift in our portfolio through the acquisitions that we've done. The other benefit is we're seeing the sales that we are getting from our new product launches and our new product launches have higher margins. And we're also, of course, doing a lot of the things I talked about in my opening statements, is a lot of activities and there are many of them around continued productivity in our factories, in our supply chain, sourcing and so forth that are giving us benefit. When I look forward and say what's in front of us, we still have a lot of work to do around product rationalization, which will continue to propel us in the future. But volume does have an impact and we're living right now in a low-growth environment and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. One is going back to an earlier question on sort of the read in terms of why are projects being delayed. Is there any commentary, as I understand part is fiscal cliff, any potentially election-related?
Gretchen W. McClain: I can't comment on that. I just think it's the uncertainty in the market in general. I think in most of our customers, they've got constrained budgets, they're trying to make the choices in the public utilities. What they're trying to determine is which project do they let loose first before the other ones and so, they're going through that now, I think, on a daily basis.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So there's really not a sense in terms of does this go live in December or January or February? So there's no sense of timing?
Gretchen W. McClain: No.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. Secondly, if we could, going back to the notion of dewatering, clearly, you've benefited in the past by -- in the oil and gas shale plays as we've discussed, you're expanding into other markets. Can you discuss sort of the strategy in dewatering as it relates to both opportunities, risk management and working capital requirements? Clearly, you're going to have to step up inventories if you have a lot of storms. And as you go internationally, what sort of inventory will you have to have for emerging markets like China, et cetera?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, so a great question. And just let me take a step back in terms of our dewatering strategy. The one thing we acquired when we acquired Godwin was a very good business model around 24/7, and -- in terms of being able rental and services with equipment not only for public utilities, but also in the industrial market being mining, whether it being shale, whether it be disaster-related activity, and most of that equipment can be deployed in multiple uses. So far, that's the positive part of it. Typically, in the U.S., you would typically see maybe the East Coast being a drought and the West Coast being wet or vice versa, and you typically wouldn't see the whole U.S. in a drought situation like we've seen this year. Typically, that will offset itself. One of the things we're trying to do with our dewatering strategy is to take that model and now take it geographically. And we've talked about expanding in Brazil. We've talked about expanding in other regions around the world. And we think that ultimately will allow us to better utilize our footprint, get maximum utilization in terms of our assets which, it is a costly model, but is a very profitable model when deployed appropriately.
Michael T. Speetzen: Hey, David, the other thing I'd add is, we've mentioned before, we manage that business in a different manner just given the nature of the CapEx that's involved. And so for example, when we see lower volume rates, we dial back the investment because we're looking at utilization rates and return on assets. The other thing I'd point out is, given the nature of the equipment, it can be moved pretty easily between applications. So it can be moved from construction to municipal bypass relatively easily. So that allows us to get some efficiency, whether it's in the CapEx or the inventory that's used to support the equipment. So it's definitely an area that we watch very carefully. And as we go into new markets, we're very deliberate about how much investment we make and we monitor that closely against the utilization rates we have in the business.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: So as the footprint expands, you'll probably see less volatility in top line in margins, I would take it?
Michael T. Speetzen: That's one of the benefits from the global expansion, absolutely. That and the diverse end market exposure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: So back to Sandy, I guess once you get past sort of the immediate disaster recovery cleanup efforts, what does it look like longer term for you guys in terms of the infrastructure investments? What you see back with Katrina in New Orleans, is there any opportunity there for the rest of the portfolio?
Gretchen W. McClain: The area that I'd say where we play is in building services, we will have a lot of businesses that we'll have to go back and retrofit some of their services, whether it be boilers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and so forth, so there's opportunity in the future as that expands out. But that won't be the first need. Obviously, the first need will be the initial cleanup.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: And then just as a follow-up, on the M&A side, clearly, the balance sheet is very strong. Can you just talk about the thought process, analytics, dewatering, where you're looking, what we should be looking for?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, I'd just comment that we have a healthy pipeline. We have been continuing to work our -- the different candidates that we're cultivating. I feel very good about the process in which we are on. I'm very optimistic of what's in front of us. We continue to use the same process. First, start with our strategy. Our strategy has been to expand in these nice profitable growing areas like dewatering and analytics. We will see that continuing to play out. We'll continue to use our demonstrated process that we have and make sure that we're managing and integrating and getting the value out of the acquisitions that we've executed so far. So I see it as a ripe pipeline and an opportunity in front of us to continue to expand.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I apologize if this has already been covered, we've been kind of shuttling between calls with Sandy-related conference call delays here. But pricing, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about your strategic pricing initiative and the goals you've laid out for us there and how you believe the current environment and the book-to-bill kind of headwind you talked about, Gretchen, and how that impacts your short-term ability to meet the sort of guidance you've given us on pricing, annualized, through strategic pricing. And then just longer-term, update us on what kind of contribution you think pricing can make to the top line.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. As we've talked about, we've said pricing, we'd like to be able to get 1 to 2 points from pricing each year. Our whole commercial excellence activity has really driven our whole strategy, our strategic pricing thought process and the actions that we're driving throughout the organization in a very positive way. As I mentioned, in third quarter, we've had 1.5% price after the first half of the year being 1.7%. Now we're going into the fourth quarter. It's going to trend downwards. We're wrapping around from some of the price actions we got from last year and we're also in a tough environment in terms of competitive nature with the low growth markets that we're living in. But that's not going to get -- make us step back. We believe we've got strong products, we've got a strong understanding of where we play. We've got a good discipline. We continue to look at our losses and our wins and readjust appropriately. So we think we've got the right position to go after price in the right strategic differentiated areas. In other areas where it make sense, we'll aggressively play so that we can make sure we don't lose market share.
Michael T. Speetzen: Ryan, I'd add to what Gretchen said in the sense of the mechanics. One of the things we're doing is making sure that as we see price increases on the back end of the business, as I commented about the value gap, that those are being built into the pricing model. But I'd also point out, this pricing initiative is not a broad initiative in terms of the way we apply it. It's very targeted in terms of end markets and products. And it helps that we have such a healthy pipeline of new products, that gives us the ability to differentiate and get improved pricing in the marketplace. So I think Gretchen's absolutely right. We're going to continue to see headwinds given the economic environment, but we're pretty confident that we've got a good process in place to maximize our potential.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Great. And then just a kind of follow-on to that, I mean, one of the things we've been trying to figure out is whether there's been a change -- a sort of sea change in the public utility channel, in particular in terms of resistance to price increases and how hard utilities are sort of driving a bargain on pricing just given all that they've gone through from a financial standpoint the last couple of years. Any color you can provide on that would be helpful. I mean, do you sense any difference today versus 2 years ago? Even for your customers that are spending, do they have a more -- are they more sort of aggressive at the bargaining table than they used to be?
Gretchen W. McClain: So let me address it from this perspective. I mean, we're seeing price in both our Water Infrastructure and our Applied Water. So we're seeing it both in the public utilities, as well as across our end markets. Your question around public utilities, and there's no question, they're challenged for -- to be able to do all the projects they want to do. Now the one thing is, their budget continues -- because tariffs still continue to go up, but they are -- the real strategy here in my mind is helping them understand how we can help them reduce their operating costs. That allows them to ultimately spend less in their maintenance and operations and be able to free up money to be able to put on their capital expenditures. So if you have the dialogue, you can demonstrate it in terms of the energy efficiency, cost of ownership. They're inclined to go after quality reliable parts because they're talking about water and wastewater that's critical for all of our health.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: And then just a follow-up, lastly, to a prior question there on the M&A environment, there's been a lot of talk about the tax changes at the beginning of 2013 and how that's driving some smaller business owners to actually seek an exit prior to that. Is there any -- do you believe that could drive some deal activity for you all in the near term and then maybe a little bit of a fall-off in the first half of next year?
Gretchen W. McClain: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, when you look at our pipeline and what we're cultivating and working on, it's not driven by the need to tell a company because of tax reasons. It varies depending upon what the candidate is doing, if they need more investment in terms of their business, ultimately if they want, and they don't have something, a successor, to hand the business off to. Whether they'd like to be part of a bigger business that's focused around water, that has played to our advantage. So I wouldn't say it's the tax issue and things will fall off after next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So orders were a little tougher in the quarter, but you talked encouragingly about bid activity improving sequentially here. Could you talk about the composition of that bid activity and if there's any inflection one way or another that's different from the broader trends you're seeing on the underlying order rates? In other words, any pockets where you're starting to see things get a little bit better from a quoting activity, but aren't seeing in your core numbers at this point?
Gretchen W. McClain: Right now, I'd say the bidding activity across most of our end markets, both industrial and the public utilities, are probably the largest area. Industrial is encouraging to us. Again, we've not seen the release of it, but I'm encouraged when you think about where we played in our treatment business to be able to expand more in the industrial side. Our teams are going after a number of activities and I do believe they're going to break loose. It's just a matter of when.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then on the restructuring side of things, other than the ongoing initiatives you have in place to meet those long-term targets and just specifically focusing on some of the actions you're taking to respond to the shorter-term environment, any way to delineate, at least qualitatively, how much of that's more permanent in nature and how much of it is just the desire to flex up or to flex down to meet the demand levels?
Michael T. Speetzen: Mike, I guess the way I'd answer that question is the restructuring, that $20 million that we're executing this year, the majority of that is permanent in nature. So we're taking the opportunity given the fact that we have a view that Europe's going to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future, that we'll be looking at restructure. You can see it in the payback, quite frankly, in terms of the payback being around 2 years, that we're taking some more difficult cuts that are going to position the business better for the long term and are more sustained in nature.
Gretchen W. McClain: I would just add, when we think of Europe, and that's where the focus has been around, the restructuring, is really aligning ourselves as one Xylem team. I mean, we take -- we go to market in very different ways today. We have the opportunity to leverage our portfolio to position ourselves even more effectively with our customers. And so part of what we're doing is helping us get to our long-term strategies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman and with D. A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: It sounds like you've obviously talked about some continued order delays in treatment though the pipeline is getting larger. Are these projects in any specific region? And then it sounds like the private industrial treatment jobs are moving a little faster than the public utilities side. Did those jobs offer the same opportunities to leverage sort of other products in your portfolio as you'd see on the public utility side?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, so let me just talk about the orders and so forth. I mean, geographically, U.S., there's a lot of bid activity. The emerging markets, there's significant activity. Europe's a little weaker from an activity base and that kind of plays with the economics we're seeing. I'd say a lot more of the projects are smaller in nature as they are compared to large in nature. And today, when we look at large projects, we look at the full capability of our portfolio and how we can bring that together where it makes sense.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: What kind of returns on invested capital are you expecting out of your YSI and MJK acquisitions? And how have the acquisitions tracked relative to your original expectations?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Jim, we're actually going to spend some time in our Investor Day talking through the performance of the acquisitions, because it's an important part of the story that we have. But the criteria that we set out in clearly, YSI and the other acquisitions falling through, is we look for returns in the midteens. The way I would characterize the series of acquisitions that we've done, Godwin, Nova and a string of analytics deals, is they are outperforming our models despite the economic environment. And the reason that we do that is when we go through justifying the acquisition, we obviously don't load in all the expected synergies and then we obviously put more aggressive targets inside the business to ensure that we drive the growth. As we've talked in the past, we've got a pretty robust integration model where we're measuring the business against those original plans, meeting with a business in the initial 30, 60 and 90 days of the integration to make sure that gets integrated well and then doing periodic check-ins after that. So I would answer the question broadly, that they're performing better and we intend to get into that in a little bit more detail when we have our Investor Day next year.
Gretchen W. McClain: And I'd say in both our dewatering and our analytics business, they're now becoming a large platform in which not only can we do -- continue to expand with acquisitions to expand them, but we also now have a core competence level to do organic growth. And so you've got the benefits of both.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, and you mentioned that your acquisition pipeline is still pretty strong. Are you seeing anything to the size of what you did with the YSI?
Gretchen W. McClain: Our approach has been a bolt-on strategy. But in our pipeline, we look at all sizes, all shapes and all regions. We'll continue to look at it from a strategic perspective and how that can help us accelerate our strategic vision. So again, mostly, a bolt-on strategy, but we don't preclude looking at larger acquisitions as well.
Operator: That was our final question and I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen for any closing remarks.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, I'd just like to say thank you for your interest and your time this morning and really sharing our first year anniversary with us. As I mentioned, the business operations will continue to improve even with the lower anticipated revenues. We're aggressively positioning Xylem for the future with immediate [ph] actions that we've talked about this morning. And while we do that, we remain, of course, very focused on good earnings and solid cash flow. So again, thank you for your time. We appreciate your interest.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Gretchen W. McClain: Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. I'll begin the call by providing you an update of our overall financial results for second quarter; spend a few minutes updating on the progress we've made on our strategic objective; and provide my perspective on our first half revenue performance and our full year outlook. I will also discuss the actions we're taking to address the continued economic uncertainty and to position us future growth. I'll then hand it over to Mike to walk through the details of our quarterly performance on our full year guidance. Today, we're reporting second quarter revenue of $966 million, reflecting growth of 4% on a constant currency basis. Organic growth was 1%, with acquisitions adding another 3%. While overall revenue were below our expectations for the quarter, our performance was on top of strong growth last year and in a more challenging environment. In Europe, where overall economic growth is negative, our revenues on a constant currency basis, were down a modest 1%. And our continued focus an attractive acquisitions is helping us to drive top line growth. YSI added $32 million in revenue in the quarter and continued to outperform our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, YSI is up approximately 11%. We received orders of $970 million, up 2% in constant currency, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. During the quarter, we won some key public utility and industrial transport and treatment projects spread across the U.S., Europe and emerging markets, which will ship in 2013. Let me highlight that in the second quarter, we registered our highest order rate in treatment projects since the first quarter 2011. This is a positive sign for next year and we're encouraged by the number of projects still in the funnel. As I mentioned last quarter, good activity for capital projects has continued to increase, but release of orders continued to be slower than anticipated. A key focus for us has been margin expansion. Despite the lower demand, we continue to reach higher levels of profitability. This performance demonstrates the results of years of disciplined execution, a focused growth strategy and processes put in place to drive price and reduce operating costs. We will cover these details later on the call, but for now, I'd simply note that for the quarter, gross margin was 39.6%, up 60 basis points versus last year and fast approaching the long-term target we set out at our Investor Day. Operating margin was 14.8%, up 100 basis points, excluding the impact of recurring standalone costs. Earnings per share were $0.49, up 4% on a comparable or normalized year-over-year basis. Core operations and YSI performance drove earnings up 13%, giving us confidence that we can continue to deliver fundamental growth in a tough environment. The negative impact of foreign exchange knocked 9 points off that growth rate, bringing it down to the 4% you see on the slide. We've generated year-to-date free cash flow of $86 million, which represents 54% conversion of net income and is consistent with our seasonal performance. Please turn to Slide 4. As we laid out in our October Investor Day, we have 3 key focus areas in 2012: advancing our strategic position, deploying innovative new product applications and services, and continued strong execution. We continue to make good progress in advancing these priorities, and this slide highlights just a few of these accomplishments. On July 13, we announced another important step in advancing our strategic position with our first Xylem acquisition, MJK Automation. MJK's strong position in the Scandinavian market and their flow in level-centric technology and expertise, enhances our analytical instrumentation platform and provides energy-saving measurement and control equipment. MJK is another example of a perfect bolt-on for our Water Infrastructure segment, as it allows us to expand our wastewater and surface water applications, and bring together our transport and test capability. For those familiar with MJK's products, their products are used in water, wastewater, environmental and irrigation applications, where critical measurements are required in pipe, wells, open channels and canals. Their monitoring control technologies are well suited for field, online and lift station application; all areas where Xylem has a strong presence and can now offer even more value to our current and new customers. MJK is the fifth acquisition we've closed in our analytical instrumentation platform. And much like YSI and the others, they bring a strong local market presence, and this provides the ability to sell our other products to their customers and expand its product sales globally through the rest of Xylem. During the quarter, we also announced several plans to continue to expand our emerging market presence, including our plans to grow our dewatering platform in the attractive markets of Brazil. We will start by strengthening our rental offering in 3 key locations before launching new services at additional locations across Brazil in 2013 and '14. We're also making great progress in deploying innovative new product applications and services to address global water challenges. I already mentioned the strong treatment orders in the second quarter. Here, we're deploying our technologies into industrial adjacency and new application solution. Let me highlight that just yesterday, we received an order for a small package turnkey water treatment plant in New South Wales, Australia. We're excited because it's the first order that includes our ZeeWeed membrane system through our expanded partnership with GE. We expect this to be the first of many orders to come from a growing pipeline of projects being developed by our global sales team. A new product launch out of our analytics business, EXO, is the next generation of multiparameter field water quality instrument. The largest order we received since the launching in June, was from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The Department is using the equipment to monitor the Hudson and East Rivers for water quality parameters, such as oxygen and pH. This data is used to confirm that the rivers are safe for recreation and public use. In addition to supplying the instrumentation, Xylem is also providing training, installation and field support services to ensure the department is receiving the highest data quality. Another example is how we're working with the public utilities to address one of their key challenges: reducing their energy cost. As part of our total care offering, we've been performing energy audits as a new service for our public utilities customers at their site, providing extremely valuable data in consultation regarding the efficiency level of their operation. By highlighting areas of improvement and having the energy-efficient solutions, we can help them significantly reduce operating costs and put ourselves in position to win additional business. Taking this a bit further, energy represents the highest cost for a wastewater treatment plant and research shows that the aeration process accounts for up to 60% of that total energy consumption. Just a few weeks ago, at the Singapore International Water Week, we shared the results of our study performed at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. The study concluded that Xylem's energy-efficient secondary treatment solutions can help customers reduce energy costs up to 65% through an optimized aeration system. Just one example of exciting opportunities in front of us that leverages our product breadth and our application's depth. The third area of focus is strong execution. We continue our journey to increase our presence in emerging markets. We had an exceptional quarter, growing at 22% on constant currency basis, with positive contributions from all emerging markets. We are also working a number of areas to ensure we achieve the growth and margin potential our businesses are capable of delivering, independent of market conditions. As you can see, we're making progress against our key priorities, as evidenced by our growth and operating margin expansion. The processes and disciplines that we've implemented around our pricing, through a customer excellence program, continues to pay off. We are delivering strong price realization in our results, approximately 1.7% over the first half of this year. And we continue to gain momentum and improved profitability with our lean factory and global sourcing initiatives, as well as driving product rationalization. These activities are all key in delivering more value to customers and getting the right cost structure for the future. So now turn to Slide 5. Let me provide some perspective on our first half revenue performance by end market and by region. This will help frame for you how we're looking at things, heading into the second half of the year. First, in industrial, our largest end-market segment, we saw mid single-digit organic growth in the first half. On a sequential basis, industrial grew in the second quarter but not at the rate we had anticipated. North America was generally in line with our expectations of mid single-digit growth, however, weakening macroeconomic conditions unfavorably impacted Europe. We continue to see and expect resiliency out of our public utility markets with flat year-over-year performance, despite lower revenues due to delayed capital projects in 2011. I'll remind you that we had a strong second quarter last year from our dewatering rental services, which benefited from the heavy snowfall, a cold winter wet season and severe flooding conditions in the U.S. and Australia. So stepping back and considering the tough compare, I think of this as good performance given the budgetary pressures public utilities face in this environment. This illustrates the mission-critical nature of the products and expertise we provide our customers, and the valued relationship we've built over many years of service. As I've mentioned, we've had some good progress in our projects business with our key wins in second quarter. Unfortunately, the delay in these order bookings has pushed revenue recognition into 2013. Our commercial business services business came through with low single-digit growth in the first half, certainly better than the flat markets in which we operate, but lower than our expectations. During the first quarter, we saw healthy growth, particularly in the U.S. and Asia Pac region. The performance moderated in the second quarter and Europe was down mid single-digits. Residential was down, low single-digits for the first half. The U.S. posted strong growth in the mid single-digits, following a tough first quarter, which was unfavorably impacted by a warm winter. Europe, on the other hand, continued to struggle. While sequential revenues were up for the second quarter, year-over-year performance was down mid single-digits. Touching on ag, we continue to see robust business in the U.S. given the drought conditions; however, it's on top of already a very solid year in 2011. Europe was challenged, as you would expect. On a regional basis, we've laid out for you on this slide all the major drivers. I'll just highlight a few. The U.S. saw the benefits of the industrial and residential growth, partly offset by the drought conditions and strong compares with the prior year in dewatering. I will highlight that industrial dewatering applications continue to be robust in the first half. Europe was down across most end markets, with the exception being public utilities where we were flat year-over-year. Emerging markets continued to drive top line growth and we saw contributions across all regions during the first half. We expect continued strength throughout the balance of the year. Now turn to Slide 6. Exiting the second quarter, it is clear we are faced with a weaker economic environment in Europe than originally anticipated and some moderation in the U.S. growth. We expect significant foreign exchange headwinds to continue. Despite volume challenges, we are confident that our performance in delivering solid productivity and strong execution will continue through the second half and beyond. Although we will pay some investments, our disciplined approach is allowing us to continue to invest in our business, while expanding operating margin and advancing our strategic position. Simply put, our goal is to maintain our 2012 operating margin rate as previously guided, despite the lower projected revenues of approximately $150 million. So we are updating our full year guidance and now, expect our full year EPS to be within the range of $1.72 to $1.82 per share, compared to previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.95. This reduction reflects current macroeconomic conditions and end market dynamics, updated exchange rates, and continued productivity across all businesses. Excluded from our guidance are restructuring realignment costs estimated to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million in the second half of 2012. We are taking aggressive cost actions targeted at reducing operating costs across our European operations, and to align our Xylem business for flexibility given the lower level of demand, while strategically positioning the business for growth in the geographic regions critically important to us. These actions are similar to steps we took in 2008 to reposition our cost base and as a result, we will have a more competitive business structure and will allow us to continue to lead within the global water industry. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the detailed results. Mike?
Michael T. Speetzen: Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 7. In the second quarter, Xylem revenues were $966 million, reflecting 4% growth on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth contributed 1 point to the total and acquisitions added another 3 points of growth. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 5 points. Organic growth was driven by strength in the industrial and public utility end markets, where we continue to see growth opportunities. The U.S. continued to show modest growth and emerging markets were strong, up 22% on a constant currency basis. Europe continued to present challenges, given the worsening economic environment. YSI had a strong quarter, adding 3 percentage points to our top line. I think it's also important to note that YSI, once again, had double-digit organic growth and is not included in our organic growth performance articulated earlier. Organic order rates were down 1% and book-to-bill was 1. Orders were impacted by sluggish demand from Europe, coupled with tough compares to prior year treatment orders. Operating income, adjusted for onetime separation costs, increased 1% in the second quarter and was up 7% when adjusted for incremental standalone ramp-up costs incurred in Q2 of 2012. Despite lower than expected organic revenue, second quarter operating margins came in at 14.8%, up 100 basis points, excluding separation costs and the impact of standalone ramp-up costs. Gross margin was 39.6% for the second quarter, up 60 basis points versus the prior year, as price, cost improvements in YSI, more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. By driving gross margin performance, we're able to continue to invest in our business, while expanding operating margins. Investments in the second quarter impacted operating margin by 30 basis points. The impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction was neutral with operating margin. As the chart reflects, on an operating basis, we drove incremental margins of 36%, excluding standalone costs and foreign exchange. I would add that this 36% incremental margin was achieved on modest organic volume growth and reflects additional investments to further our strategic execution. These additional investments were a 6-point drag on our incremental margin. Now turn to Slide 8. This slide shows our EPS walk for the second quarter. This is a transition year for Xylem and as such, there are a lot of moving parts. So I want to spend some time this morning, as we did on the last call, describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts, we have adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clear picture of how we performed operationally versus last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between, we make 2 sets of adjustments. For the second quarter, on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.39 by $0.08, to show how 2011 would have looked had Xylem been a standalone company with interest expense on debt and required independent company costs. We have also adjusted the number to exclude the 2011 impact of onetime separation costs and special tax items. For the second quarter of 2012, on the right-hand side of the chart, we adjust GAAP EPS of $0.48 by adding back the net negative impact of 2012 onetime separation costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments puts both second quarters on a comparable, normalized basis to allow for a better view of operational performance. This analysis shows that normalized EPS increased 4% or $0.02. I'd also highlight that excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, our core operations plus YSI, less the tax rate differential drove a 13% increase in EPS. Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 9. This slide shows the results of our Water Infrastructure segment. For the second quarter, this segment reported revenue of $609 million, up 7% over prior year on a constant currency basis and up 2% organically. The YSI acquisition contributed 5 points to the top line growth and foreign exchange was a 6-point headwind. Transport grew 6% for the quarter, driven by the global industrial market and strong emerging market growth. A significant portion of transport is driven by the public utility market and here, we continue to benefit from the stability that comes from a large install base and growing tariffs. Public utilities were up mid single-digits in Q2 and industrial continued to demonstrate strength. Drought conditions in the U.S. and Australia negatively impacted our dewatering rental business. Treatment declined, driven by the softening we saw in developed market project orders in 2011. As a reminder, treatment orders for large projects slowed after the first quarter of 2011, and given the longer lead times associated with these projects, we are seeing the impact in our year-over-year revenue performance. We're encouraged by the win rate we've seen in the second quarter for treatment projects. Conditions appear to be improving, and we anticipate order growth to continue in the second half. Test revenues were up significantly, driven by the inclusion of the YSI business acquired in Q3 of 2011. Excluding YSI, the test application was down year-over-year, coming up a strong 2011 performance, and reflecting weakness in Europe. Second quarter operating margins came in at 16.1%, up 20 basis points from 2011, excluding the impact of standalone costs. YSI contributed 50 basis points to the segment margin, highlighting the strong business that we have added to the portfolio. In addition, our operational and customer excellence initiatives are more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and have provided flexibility to continue to invest in the business while expanding margins. Our margins were, however, negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower rental volume. Let me now turn to Slide #10 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Applied Water second quarter revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. Building services was down 2%. Commercial building services were down low to mid single-digits, reflecting slow institutional demand for retrofits. Residential building services were down low single-digits. U.S. performance was up mid single-digits, more than offset by challenging economic conditions in Europe and continued instability in the Middle East region. Industrial water was up 4%, driven by favorable general industrial market conditions and strength in our food and beverage applications. And lastly, irrigation was down 4% against a difficult compare versus the second quarter of 2011. U.S. strength, reflecting strong demand given the current weather conditions, was more than offset by weakness in other regions. Second quarter operating margin came in at 14.4%, up 140 basis points from 2011, excluding standalone costs. Price and productivity actions more than offset the impact of inflation and enabled continued investment in the segment. Margins continue to improve sequentially, as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives. Now let me turn to Slide 11 and review our financial position. Slide 11 reflects the key elements of our balance sheet and capital structure. We generated $86 million in free cash flow year-to-date, a conversion on adjusted net income of 54%, reflecting typical seasonality for our business. Our cash flow is down from Q2 of 2011, as anticipated, driven primarily by incremental interest payments of $26 million, related to the debt put in place as a result of the spinoff from ITT. In addition, we had incremental U.S. federal and state tax payments in 2012. As a reminder, the 2011 figures are a result of the carve-out financials provided in the Form-10 and reflected an allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed a Xylem obligation for the purposes of the Form-10 statement. Note that adjusting for these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance in normal seasonal trend. And lastly, we incurred additional cash outlays associated with costs operating as a standalone company. As you can see from the slide, we also improved our working capital as a percent of revenue year-over-year. As it relates to our capital structure, we ended Q2 in a strong position. Our available cash-on-hand was $358 million, up from the first quarter of 2012. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 30% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. Now let me transition to Slide 13 and talk through our guidance for 2012. As Gretchen mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are revising our guidance down to reflect the impact of the current and anticipated economic environment. Let me spend a few minutes walking through our assumptions and revise guidance. Slide 13 reflects our revised view of the various end markets we serve. As a reminder, we discussed our original end market projections on February 28. We view the industrial end market performing in the low to mid single-digits for the full year versus a previous assumption of mid single-digits. As Gretchen highlighted, industrial was strong in the first half, but we saw moderating growth in Q2. We're assuming a slowing in this end market, predicated on the current European market conditions, as well as a slowing market in the U.S. The revised outlook still assumes moderate sequential growth in the second half. The public utility end market was previously projected to grow low single-digits. We are now revising this to flat to low single-digits, based on the delay in project order bookings. This revised outlook still reflects modest second half sequential growth. The commercial end market is now projected to grow low single-digits versus low to mid single-digits, given the lack of improvement in the underlying market. We see this end market as flat to up slightly in the second half, driven primarily by energy-efficient solutions. Lastly, we see the residential and agriculture end markets performing in line with our prior guidance. Bottom line is that a weaker Europe, economic environment, and some level of moderating U.S. conditions are driving our revised revenue outlook. Our revised guidance assumes sequential organic growth in the second half. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance assumes a second half organic growth of over 2%, based on the end-market dynamics in our seasonal profile. Turn to Slide 14 for a roll-forward of our guidance. This chart illustrates the walk from our previous guidance midpoint, for revenue and EPS, to our revised guidance. Our previous guidance was for $3.95 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.87. Foreign exchange has become a substantial headwind, driven primarily by the continued weakening of the euro to the dollar. Our guidance assumes $1.22 exchange rate for the balance of the year versus the $1.31 assumed in our previous guidance. The weakness experienced in the first half, coupled with the projected weaker euro in the second half, impacts revenue by $50 million and has a $0.03 negative impact to EPS. The majority of this impacts the second half of the year. We recently announced the acquisition of MJK Automation. This acquisition will add approximately $6 million in revenue and will be $0.01 dilutive, as acquisition costs and purchase accounting impact the first 6 months of ownership. We expect that the acquisition will be accretive in 2013. Lastly, the previous communicated end market weakness will impact the top line by approximately $105 million. The effect of the loss margin on this revenue decline is approximately a $0.16 headwind to EPS, partially offset by approximately $0.10 of cost actions to mitigate the loss margin impact. These net to a $0.06 impact to EPS. Relative to previous guidance, our current outlook reflects a 3-point reduction on organic revenue, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives, which nets to a 3% decrease in EPS, as illustrated on this slide. Turn to Slide 15 for more details on the revised guidance. This slide provides all the relevant details for our revised guidance range. I'd like to highlight a few key points. We're now projecting a full year organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% versus a prior 4% to 6%. From a sequential perspective, we expect approximately 45% of Water Infrastructure's second half revenue to come in the third quarter, and we view Applied Water to be essentially evenly split between the 2 quarters. We expect full year segment margin in the range of 14.2% to 14.6%, up 20 to 60 basis points over the prior year. We're holding our operating margin range to our previous guidance, flat to up 60 basis points over the prior year, despite slow organic growth and incremental standalone costs. Excluding standalone costs, this represents a 90 basis-point improvement year-over-year. Our revised EPS guidance range is now $1.72 to $1.82 with a midpoint of $1.77. As Gretchen mentioned earlier, we've taken initial steps to address the softening European economic environment, and have initiated several restructuring realignment actions. We anticipate these charges in 2012 to be between $15 million and $20 million. These actions will be substantially completed in 2012 with approximately $2 million of additional costs being incurred in 2013. The run rate savings will be approximately $10 million beginning in 2013. We anticipate less than $1 million in savings in 2012. I'd also add, we are tracking to our onetime separation cost of $15 million to $20 million. Please note that our EPS guidance does not include any impact from restructuring and realignment costs, onetime separation costs, and unannounced acquisitions and related costs. Let me now turn the call back over to Gretchen to wrap up.
Gretchen W. McClain: Thanks, Mike. Let's turn to Slide 16. There's no question, today's economic conditions are volatile, but we have faced similar conditions in the past and we have successfully managed through them with strong focus and attention to the many levers that we control in our business. In 2009, our business declined 9% on an organic basis. Despite the external factors, we were able to hold our operating margins flat year-over-year. Our demonstrated performance and our continued margin expansion are the result of several key drivers and management decisions. These include a portfolio of businesses that have demonstrated resiliency during difficult times, thanks to the large install base of leading products and critical customer applications and strong customer relationships. A disciplined management approach, including proactive actions beginning in 2008 at the onset of the decline, and again this year, taking appropriate steps to position us in the future in the face of continued economic uncertainty. In addition, we are aggressively managing our costs through our continued customer and operational excellence initiatives. This has enabled us to continue to invest in our business, to capture growth as markets rebound and to gain market share. And our acquisition strategy has led to higher than average profitability, while expanding our market reach. As the slide illustrates, based on our midpoint guidance, we expect and have expanded operating margin by 290 basis points since 2008. Collectively, through the actions we control, we have shaped the company into what it is today, and we are laying the path for Xylem's future, a better positioned leader in the global water industry. Now turn to Slide 17. In summary, we had strong second quarter operating performance. Our business's performance illustrates the stability of our portfolio in the face of challenging global economics, backed by disciplined execution. However, we're not immune to the environment and we expect some headwinds during the second half of the year, particularly in Europe. We are addressing the challenge head-on, taking actions and making strategic investments today that will drive future growth. And of course, our strong cash flow generation and financial position provides the flexibility to continue to execute our long-term strategy. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Brandi?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I'm just interested in exploring, for a minute, this issue of -- that you mentioned several times, bid activity continuing to increase while release of orders among your customers are disappointing. Can you just expand on that a bit for us? Your remarks sort of implied that you think order release will ultimately follow. So I'd be interested in your perspective on whether you've seen this kind of dynamic in the past, and if so, how that ultimately played out?
Gretchen W. McClain: Ryan, I'd look at it first from a broad perspective. I mean, we're seeing large issues around the water industry and public utilities, and then having to pull back to be able to support their operating and maintenance activities. And so a lot of activities around capital expenditures have been deferred or put off. Though the activities are being planned, so when they get the additional funding, they're able to let them go. So this last fall -- I mean, we didn't see much activity. All through last year, our project activity was quite low. And so the stacking of projects in the queue has continued to come forward. And we've been doing a lot of activity around first quarter and second quarter in bidding. They just have not been released as quickly. We believe, given the tariffs that continue to increase with the public utilities, that they will be released as we go forward. And the other area that we've been focused on is trying to the help the public utilities bring their operating costs down, so they can free up money for capital expenditures.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then to your knowledge, is there any correlation with project release around fiscal budget resets? I mean, most of your customers, I assume, are either June or September fiscal year, so as those new budgets get set, is that when we start to see some of that money starting to flow?
Gretchen W. McClain: It varies because if you look at U.S., you'll see the June time frame. It's on around, obviously, the government-type funding. But you also have many of them that are on a year-over-year, especially when you look globally. So it does flow differently throughout the year. We are planning on treatment in our activity, continuing to pick up in the second half from an orders perspective, but given the length of the projects, you'll typically see the revenue come in to 2013.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just one last, when you mentioned that you took 170 basis points in price in the first half, obviously, that's a very impressive figure in this kind of environment, and I know you focus more on the value-added, technology-driven-type product lines, but do you feel like you're sacrificing share anywhere in the portfolio as a result of your stance on price in this kind of a tough environment?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, it's a great question. It's something that we try and stay very close to. We feel really good about our strategic position in the market. We're still having good growth, in general, when you strip away a couple of the activities that I talked about, on top of the very great growth in 2011. So we have individual market and regional, and really project strategies that we deploy in a framework of an overall portfolio strategy. So I feel good about where we are. We've put a good process in place, that we review our wins and our losses, and then we make the appropriate adjustments as required. So we feel good that we're driving the right thing and, of course, we're driving profitable growth as we continue in the future.
Michael T. Speetzen: Ryan, the only other thing I would add is, what you're seeing come through on the first half, is also the product of the price actions that were taken in the second half of last year, primarily in our Applied Water segment, where we saw a pretty significant inflation. And obviously, that will moderate a bit because the compares become a little bit more difficult in the second half. But that also plays into it, in terms of similar dynamics that we saw play out across the broader market.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to first start with Mike. If you could just give us an update about the expectation of separation costs, how those may taper off during the course of the year? What are the big components of that? Maybe we can we start there, please.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so, let's talk onetime separation cost. So we had indicated that we would have $15 million to $20 million. We've incurred about $10 million through the first half. As we've indicated in the past, we see that being -- tapering off, really, in the fourth quarter. So I would look at Q1, 2 and 3 being kind of at that same level. And it's really -- as we finalize legal aspects, as well as any of the branding signage of the company and those types of activities, and there is some IT work that has to go into that, we've got a pretty disciplined process around that, not a lot of concerns relative to the range that we've put out there on that particular bucket. From a standalone cost perspective, we've indicated $25 million to $30 million. We're holding to that range. We've obviously, as you see in our results, did take some actions relative to our corporate cost structure in the second quarter, in light of the current economic environment. But we don't see that impacting the incremental standalone costs. As I've indicated in the past, there's a good chunk of these costs that really relate to IT infrastructure that we had to put in place, and some of the incremental costs that were added, not only at corporate but also within our business segments. Again, we have a good line of sight to that and we feel pretty comfortable that we'll be right in the range on those.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. That's really helpful. And I should have just prefaced my comments with the fact that these slides that you're providing, and the bridge and the individual business line commentary is really helpful. And the next question is, to go into the businesses with the impact of the drought. Obviously, from the dewatering side, there are some positives I would expect. You mentioned ag and some of the irrigation, but also, is there much of an impact to weigh on the well business? Anytime you've got drought and water tables get lower, there's problems with wells. Anytime you open up a well, you usually put a new pump into it. So just give us a -- some of the puts and takes, with that or drought-related on your businesses?
Gretchen W. McClain: Sure, Deane. Just in terms of the other businesses that you see upside, as we mentioned, agriculture is obviously an area when we look at our TTL business with vertical turbines, and so forth. Great business during a time of the drought, helping the farmers continue to grow. If I look at U.S., North America, we're up 5% in our residential market. So we feel good about where we are. You also have, as you mentioned, the well pumps. They're working harder. You see water levels drop and so you have the opportunity for replacement. So we feel good, again, where we are with that position and continue to grow that. Coming back to your dewatering question, the one thing I would just bring up is -- yes, it was impacted by the drought, but our dewatering model in itself supports many other end markets. So we'll continue to help in mining. We're still helping with public utility bypass and other areas, still a very robust business and a great opportunity where you have similar equipment that can be used in many different applications.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And just last question for me, and it's a related question to the MJK acquisition. The idea that there's still a lot of fragmentation to the analytics market, and maybe you can give us a sense of a road map of how you'd like to build out this segment. Just in terms of priorities, is it geography? Is it adding more technology? Is it broadening the line of contaminants that you want to test for? Or maybe it's all of the above. Just kind of the roadmap for the build-out and maybe a sense of the pipeline today.
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes. Deane, I'd say, you laid it out very nicely, as those are all the areas that we're looking at. In terms of our healthy backlog of candidates, we feel like we've got a healthy deal pipeline and we're working that very aggressively. The bolt-on strategy has worked for us and we think that's a nice way to continue to expand, as well as to invest back into the organic platform that we're continuing to build. So geographic, technology, and clearly, regional areas are going to help us or channel into the market, will be areas that we continue to expand in.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, I apologize if you gave this. But what was the EPS hit from FX in the second quarter? And what is the expectation for the full year, relative to your prior estimate?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so the foreign exchange impact in the second quarter was $0.04, and then we're talking, relative to the guidance range, $0.03 year-over-year in terms of the change in guidance and that's on $50 million of revenue. And Matt, really, where that's coming from is -- although we've seen some of the currencies that make up our basket come down, the biggest impact has been in the euro. It's moved down about 7%. We had given previous guidance at $1.31. It's now at $1.22. If you think back to some of the framework we've put in place in the past, where we talked about a 10% move in the euro, yields about 3% to 4% move in the top line, you can ratio that down and it gets you pretty close to the movement you're seeing right now.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then can you -- is there a way to quantify the magnitude of push out you've seen on the projects side of the business into 2013?
Gretchen W. McClain: I'm trying to help you. Clearly, on the treatment area, we've seen a significant push into next year. We're anticipating our treatment business to be down for the rest of the year, continuing to get orders and continuing to get book-to-bill shipping. But we will see a large portion of our treatment business falling into next year.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, I mean, Matt, when you think about the guidance we initially gave for public utilities, we had guided that they would be in the low to single -- low single-digits. We're now saying flat to low. That change in guidance is being primarily driven by the fact that the anticipated order bookings that we were planning for, coming out of last year, didn't materialize and so that push has essentially moved that range from kind of low single-digits to that flat to low.
Gretchen W. McClain: And then just one more point, Matt, in terms of public utility treatment, we're also trying to take, as I mentioned, our treatment technology into industrial. And we've seen some very nice orders and wins there. Again, some will be pushed into 2013. There'll be some that obviously play into 2012. But given the length of time, typically a 2013-type revenue recognition.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: All other variables held constant, what is your view on Xylem's raw material input costs in the second half of the year versus what you experienced in the first half?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, we -- at this point, we're planning to be essentially flat, meaning about 3% inflation in the second half. And at this point, we felt it was better to plan for a higher level of inflation, both in our cost actions, as well as our cost structure. And if that ends up playing to the benefit, then we'll obviously have that as an opportunity. The thing that I'd also note is, our susceptibility to the current period fluctuations is -- I won't say that we're not, but it's minimized by the fact that we tend to put ourselves on long-term supply agreements, which essentially dampens some of that volatility. Our direct exposure to commodities is relatively small. And so some of that is going to be taken out of the equation. But we've always planned conservatively, and we'll look for any opportunities to improve that as we can.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Just very real quick ones. The -- if you could, can you reconcile the difference between the slides showing emerging market growth in constant currency for the second quarter at 20% and for the first half at 11%? Is the implication that it accelerated in Q2 significantly?
Gretchen W. McClain: So our emerging market -- so let me address that. Our emerging market growth, what we've seen, nice growth in the first half and we continue to see that sequentially growing as we go through the second half the year.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Maybe I can back up. Gretchen, on Page 5 you show organic growth versus prior year of 11%, and on Page 4, it shows emerging market growth at 22% both in constant currency. So it implies a meaningful step-up in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, that's right, it's true. We had about 17% growth in the second quarter in our emerging markets.
Gretchen W. McClain: So we've got a couple of big projects that we've won in India and a few others that ship in the second half of the year. And we've had nice order-taking and good business execution in our emerging market's strategy. Think about this, we announced that we positioned ourselves in Russia. Our organization is up and running. We've got an opportunity to continue to grow there. We've put a very focused strategy around our emerging market activity. And so, as we are expecting sequential growth from first half to the second half, we believe we've got good line of sight from some of our projects that we'll ship, as well as what we need to do and execute in our end markets.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, this could sound like a pricing question, you discussed -- we had all discussed, at one point in time, a pricing slop. How much of the pricing slop do you think you still have in terms of your powder for the second half? I think I recall there was, maybe, a 200 basis-point movement, pricing slop. You took advantage of some of that in the second quarter. How much is left in the back half?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, so when you think about it, we talked about 170 basis points for the first half. I'll still go back to what we have said our goal is, 1 to 2 points a year. And we're driving that aggressively. You're going to see a couple of dynamics in the second half of the year. One, we drove very aggressive pricing last fall, so you're going to have some tougher compares to where we were at the first half. And we've been at it for a while. So the team is getting very disciplined about their approach. The other area is, it is a tougher market. So you're going to have market pressures in the second half and so we've accounted for that as we look through the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: I was wondering if you take us back to the financial crisis in '08, kind of what you saw in Europe then and how that compares to some of the trends you're seeing now?
Gretchen W. McClain: So in 2008, when the onset -- you saw, the primary focus was in the U.S. at that point in time. Europe came much later, I would say, at the end of 2009. I would say, where we're seeing the issues in Europe -- and I think it's important to really focus where Europe is. It's been driven primarily by southern part of Europe. We're still seeing strength substantially in the Nordic regions. We're seeing strength in the U.K. We're still holding our own in Germany. So it really has been more of a Southern Europe exposure. Now, coming through the second quarter, we did see some volatility across Europe, which had us concerned and, hence, the reason why we have re-forecasted our forecast for the rest of the year. But it's not the same dynamics as what we saw in the 2009 timeframe. But there is a lot of volatility, and we want to be prepared appropriately, and that's why we're taking aggressive steps.
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, Chip. I think the way I would think about it is, in 2008 to 2009, we were coming off some market highs, specifically around commercial and the CapEx side of public utilities. And since then, those markets really have not had a significant improvement. We've seen gains in areas like retrofits and specific projects, and so what we're really seeing is more of a moderating environment, which I think is consistent with how we've articulated it versus a dramatic falloff in terms of what we saw back in that '08, '09 time period.
Gretchen W. McClain: I guess I'd add one more thing. As you know, the public utility business has been stable and what we're seeing is, you saw industrial, you saw ag, you saw the rest of the industry going up. You're seeing that now start to slow back down but, still, stability in the public utilities across the board with the exception of Southern Europe.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: And maybe just one follow-up. In terms of the reduction in revenue, the $105 million market-related, can you give us a sense of how much of that is European-related?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so here's the way to think, kind of the full picture. We had been anticipating the U.S. to be in the mid single-digits. We are now projecting it in low single-digits. We had expected some level of European growth from a full year standpoint. We're now assuming Europe will essentially be flat, and we really haven't moderated the emerging market growth that we had assumed. It's -- I'd say, more heavily weighted towards a European reduction, than it is the U.S. But we are seeing moderation in both those markets.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe just a follow up on that last comment. Mike, why would Europe get better in the back half, relative to the slight decline in the first half? What are you seeing there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, so there's a couple of things. One, we do see some of the typical seasonality that has held up over the past several years, especially coming out of the vacation season that we'll see in August. A couple of other components. One, the public utility side tends to ramp. They're on a different fiscal calendar, so you can obviously read into that, in terms of some of the dynamics that play out as you get into back half of the year. And then, our analytical instrumentation business was down heavily at the end of last year. That has obviously moderated and we see that continuing to improve sequentially, and that will also fuel some of the growth. And then we've obviously got a good presence in Eastern Europe, and we'll see that to continue to be an opportunity for growth.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's the Russia piece in particular there?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on emerging market, what is the assumption on the full year now that is unchanged?
Michael T. Speetzen: We're essentially looking at approximately 10% growth coming out of the emerging markets.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, so similar second half to first half?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, very similar.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And you've had a very strong growth there. I'm just wondering in China, in particular, are people looking for any signs that some of the stimulus in places like Changxia, and others, will help the industrial sector? Are you seeing anything there from a bid perspective in China that gives you optimism that maybe China gets better in the second half?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, we've actually seen our bid activity in China pretty well. If you think about their 12th 5-year plan, it's around wastewater, and our teams have been aggressively working, not only in the large cities, but moving Westward and trying to capture the growth there. We've got a disciplined approach. I think we will continue to see some nice execution from our China team.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Gretchen, can you remind us -- in China, the percentage of total revenues, 3% to 5%, something in that range for the company?
Gretchen W. McClain: That range.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the restructuring efforts, a couple of questions there. First, any breakdown of the $15 million to $20 million between Infrastructure and Applied for us?
Gretchen W. McClain: So in terms of the details of it, I don't want to get into the details here. It's too early to do that. But we've got detailed plans that spread across both of our segments. It's really going to position us appropriately for what we're seeing in terms of volume, but also strategically position us as we come together as a Xylem team, to maximize our penetration in the market based upon our strategic objectives going forward.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Gretchen, does the -- obviously, the step-up in restructuring -- the view that Europe stays a little weaker for longer implicit in that; but I'm wondering from the way you're thinking about the portfolio, is there any change in your thinking on potential divestitures within the context of the changed landscape?
Gretchen W. McClain: So, yes, we've looked at Europe in terms of it's going to be volatile for some period of time, so we're thinking through that as we make these decisions. We still think Europe is a critically important region for us. And we don't want to lose that focus on our customers and our ability to continue to invest for the long-term growth. So I feel very good about what we need to do, but we need to right-size both from the economy, as well as strategically position ourselves so we can execute our strategy. In terms of our portfolio -- and you look at our fundamental business of Xylem -- solid business, a solid set of portfolio, pipeline, product lines and businesses. So I feel very confident of what we have. Our strategy more is in acquiring and continue to bolt-on to our business, and continue to run our foundation even more effectively.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then just lastly, in the $0.10 of cost -- from cost-saving actions in the new guide, that is above and beyond the restructuring program. Just the paced investment comment, can you add some color there? Where are you pacing those investments? Is R&D in the mix there? Is it feet-on-the-street in emerging markets? Where are you pacing the investments incrementally there?
Gretchen W. McClain: So we're doing a couple of things. I mean, obviously, our first focus is really around discretionary cost reductions and running our business more effectively like we've been doing over the last several years. We will look at pacing some of the investments. One, when we do that, we look at what's happening in the economy, and are there some end markets where we are going to be launching certain activities that we ultimately should be slowing down based upon the execution. So it's really aligning it based upon the strategy that we have, which we are still advancing, but aligning that geographically based upon on where we have the growth. So it's pulling back a little bit, but it's not stopping our growth strategy.
Michael T. Speetzen: I mean, Terry, we're heavily focused probably more on the discretionary side. You saw it come through in the second quarter. And pulling the levers where we're clearly not jeopardizing the stewardship of the company, but that we have opportunities to defer or cancel out cost levels within the business to preserve the investments. And then really going after the restructuring as a way to make sure that we're in a good position, heading into next year to preserve our ability to continue that investment level in the business.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Then can you just clarify, Mike, on the free cash flow for the year, 95% excluding onetime separation costs. Just to make sure we're on the same page there, 290 to 300 implied by that? Have I got that about right?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, it's in that range.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Just to clarify on the cost savings, that $0.10, that is not coming from the new or accelerated restructuring, but those savings from that program will be more achieved in 2013, is that correct?
Michael T. Speetzen: Correct.
Gretchen W. McClain: Correct.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And can you just repeat, what is the savings, do you expect from that in 2013?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes, you bet. So we're going to have $15 million to $20 million of cost this year. There will be an additional $2 million next year. The run rate savings that we'll achieve will be about $10 million starting in 2013.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Got it. And would you characterize this more as somewhat new, defensive, if you will, move in reaction to something you saw in Q2 and expect in the back half? Or is this more, something that we plan to do all along anyway and we're just accelerating it now because maybe we don't quite have the volume in certain areas that we thought we would?
Gretchen W. McClain: I'd say it's more proactive steps that we're taking to position us for some of the unknown in terms of the market that we see. But also, as we think about ourselves strategically and how best to position in a geographic region.
Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, and just last from me, one more quick one on pricing. Where are you in the rollout of your initiative there as it relates to rolling this out, enterprise-wide, to your sales force?
Gretchen W. McClain: I'd say, roughly, we're about 70% deployed across the organization. Our plan was to complete about 80% this year. We're slightly ahead. So it's pretty much deployed throughout the leadership teams and very specifically, across end-market-by-end-market. The teams are really driving it in a much more aggressive way than we had in the past, and I feel good about our process.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Michael Roomberg with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just have a quick question for you on branding. Can you refresh us on the extent to which you have or are planning to incorporate the Xylem brand across your platform? And then related that, kind of talk a bit about how you strike the write balance between, I guess, leveraging the cross-selling opportunities of Xylem, the umbrella of Xylem, versus ensuring the customers kind of maintain their previous perceptions or loyalties to the brands that they've grown accustomed to over many years?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, great question. You look at Xylem, brand new company and we need to build our brand as a company and that's extremely important so people to know who we are. And we as a team of 12,500 employees, come together as an organization with a common focus around water. Our legacy brands are very strong. Many of them have been in the market for over 150 years and have a very strong relationship with our customers and the end markets in which they serve. So I think they're like, kind of like a house of brands. Now in that, we clearly will have some brands that we continue to eliminate, and really go after our strong brands, so when we go into different regions, just like I talked in our last earnings call, was we're taking products out of our WTW [ph], which is over in Europe in our analytics business and we're bringing them into the U.S. under our YSI brand, because that makes some sense. So there'll be cross-branding, maintaining those strong legacy brands, all under the house of Xylem.
Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division: Got it. So you're not looking necessarily to transform any of your existing brands into a new Xylem brand for instance?
Gretchen W. McClain: Not at this point.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel with MorningStar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Does your longer-term margin and revenue goal target some plays, that being, I think, 14.5%, 15.5% on margin in 2015, and then water, mid single-digit organically and applied water up low to mid single-digit organically?
Michael T. Speetzen: Yes.
Gretchen W. McClain: Our long-term strategy hasn't changed. I mean, we still see we've got opportunity in our business to continue to get more leverage, more productivity and we can -- and as we think about deploying new products and new markets that we go into, more attractive, more opportunity for profitable growth.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then you talked briefly about -- your acquisition pipeline looks pretty good. Would you -- do you see anything in the pipeline that -- if you do, to the size of what you did with YSI at $300 million acquisition costs, or there's more smaller bolt-on acquisitions?
Gretchen W. McClain: So we've got a healthy pipeline of opportunities, many of them focused around the bolt-on, but we've got some sizable of -- the size of YSI. We look at the full industry and we'll make the decisions based around strategic, obviously, culture, how it fits, and then the final line being the financials and does it make sense for the business. So that strategy hasn't changed. I would say, though, primarily bolt-ons, but we are looking across the whole industry for the right strategic alignment.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: And the strategic focus would be on companies with more emerging market exposure and healthy margin levels? Is that the idea there?
Gretchen W. McClain: Well, you go back to our growth platforms, being dewatering and analytics, that's clearly important to us. But emerging market's important, continuing to expand our technology, and as well as channels that allows us to position ourselves in expanding areas. So when you think about products in the portfolio, we think of gross margin and how we can improve our gross margin. So that aligns with our strategy as we go forward.
Operator: Our final question is coming from Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research: On your long-term projections, are you pretty much, over the next few years, sticking with your long-term growth, organic growth of, say, 4% to 6% and operating margins in the 14.5% range with 50 to 75 basis points annually? Do you see that basically transpiring over the next 3 or 4 years?
Gretchen W. McClain: Yes, so our long-term growth strategy has not changed and the goals that you outlined there are the same. We see that continuing to play. The actions that we're investing in, our core business, as well as the acquisitions that we have pursued, drive us in that direction and so that stays the same and we see ourselves on the right path. Some economic headwinds that we're seeing right now, but nothing's taking our eye off the ball on achieving those.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research: Okay. And targeting around $300 million a year in acquisitions, would that basically mean that you're done for the year, and you're looking more towards '13 now for any acquisitions of that [indiscernible]?
Gretchen W. McClain: We're very active. We've got a very active pipeline. We're continuing to look at it. Now, we're not going to force something to happen. We're going to be disciplined as we have been because that works for us. Our process has really demonstrated that's the right direction to go in because we're getting profitability out of our acquisitions that we've done to date. So we've got the capability to spend $300 million, but it will be paced, based upon strategic and opportunity at the right time. So let me close with just a couple of comments. Our business operations continue to perform even with the lower anticipated revenues. We feel great about gaining share in the emerging markets. We're introducing new products and services. We're expanding our position in our dewatering and analytics businesses, while we're continuing to advance our strategic acquisition strategy. And we're also, as we talked about, taking proactive actions to reposition ourselves, given the uncertainty in Europe at this point in time. We're focused on good earnings and a strong, solid cash flow. And so we feel good that our business is performing, now that we're 9 months as an independent company. So feel good about the direction that we're headed in and the growth opportunities that are in front of us. So I want to thank for your interest and the time this morning.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-03 09:00:00) =====

 Now please turn to Slide 3. And I'll turn the call over to Gretchen. 
Gretchen McClain: Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. We appreciate the interest you have in Xylem. I'm going to talk about Xylem's overall financial results, update you on our progress executing our strategic objectives and share my perspectives on our market, economic drivers and their impact on our performance. Then I'll hand it over to Mike to walk through the details and cover our segment results.
 Bottom line we're off to a solid start with our first quarter 2012 performance in line with our expectations. We are reporting first quarter revenue of $925 million reflecting growth of 6% on a constant currency basis. Organic growth was 2% and our orders exceeded $1 billion in the quarter for the first time ever. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.09 and was generally consistent across both of our segments and gives us confidence that revenue growth is accelerating exiting the first quarter. This performance is in comparison to a strong first quarter 2011 when we grew 12% organically. Gross margin was 39.2%, up 130 basis points. Operating margin was 12.3%, up 70 basis points, excluding the impact of recurring standalone costs. Earnings per share were $0.36, up 9% on a comparable or normalized year-over-year basis. And free cash flow was solid at $41 million.
 In addition today, we are affirming our previous 2012 guidance. All in all, first quarter was good and we're confident in our ability on our commitments to investors in 2012. 
 Please turn to Slide 4. As we discussed during our October Investor Day and February earnings call, our key focus areas for 2012 are advancing our strategic position, deploying innovative new product applications and services and continued strong execution. We've made good progress in quarter 1 against these priorities as shown on the slide. 
 First, advancing our strategic position. We continue to invest in building our attractive dewatering and analytical instrumentation platforms. You will recall we built our leadership position in these 2 rapidly growing, highly profitable markets over the past 2 years through a series of acquisitions. For example, Xylem Analytics was formed through the acquisition of Nova, Ondora , OI and YSI, each bringing strong regional brands. YSI acquired in third quarter of 2011 was EPS accretive this quarter and is performing above our expectations demonstrating the value creation possible with our strategy. A critical element of our analytic strategy is cross branding and leveraging our distribution and geographic position. Let me highlight just a few examples where we're making strides.
 Our WTW IQ Sensor Net offering enables wastewater plant operators to monitor critical parameters in the wastewater treatment process online. This quarter, we rebranded this offering, YSI, and received our first orders in the U.S. We also made the first major sale of YSI equipment into Germany, under the WTW brand. This installation will serve as the customer-reference site and was a critical win for the team. We are now selling our Ondora products through our YSI Japan office. An area in which Ondora was not previously represented. This is just the start of revenue synergies we expect to realize with this growing platform. 
 We're also investing and continue to expand our dewatering platform. During the first quarter, we won our first order of Godwin in China. Demonstrating our ability to expand this business quickly into international markets. Another example of how we're advancing our strategic position is the work that we're doing to expand our emerging market footprint. This quarter, we expanded our capabilities in Russia by opening a new distribution and customer service center in Moscow. Creating the capability to deliver application engineering, service and aftermarket support and training to one of our key growth markets. 
 Our second key focus is employing innovative new product applications and services to address our customers challenges around rising environmental standards and their need for more energy-efficient solution. Let me highlight just a few.
 Xylem, through our Wedeco brand, was recently awarded a multimillion dollar contract in North America for a large industrial ozone project. At the customer's request, we're keeping the client's name and the project detail confidential. However, this is a significant win that highlights and supports our strategy to expand in the industrial space where we can leverage our process expertise.
 Our Bell & Gossett energy-efficient heating circulator and brazed plate heat exchanger won PM Engineer Magazine Product of the Year honors. And our Bell & Gossett training facility, the Little Red Schoolhouse, has been certified as a provider of continuing education for lead professionals.
 During the fourth quarter of 2011, we launched Flygt Experior, the most energy-efficient product line addressing the water infrastructure transport market. Recently, Flygt Experior was recognized in China for its intelligent control features and high operational effectiveness with the 2012 Ringier Technology Innovation Award.
 Our third area is strong execution through commercial and operational excellence. While performance was in line with our expectations, we expect more from both of our reporting segments going forward. You will see a solid first quarter year-over-year progress from our Water Infrastructure segment while Applied Water was more challenged. We're working a number of areas to ensure we achieve the growth and margin potentials these businesses are capable of delivering, independent of market conditions. Our price focus is paying off, and we're delivering strong realization in our results. As we further rollout our commercial excellence management process across our global sales team, we will continue to gain momentum and improve profitability in the business.
 We continue to drive factory lean initiatives and utilize our global sourcing reach to deliver a more competitive cost structure. In March, I visited our team in Hungary, where we manufacture energy-efficient circulators for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. Last year, we made investments in automation and drove lean processes throughout the factory. These actions are delivering strong order intake driven by shorter lead times and improved product quality. We are targeting over $4 million in savings in 2012 from this facility. From there, I visited our Wedeco treatment facility in Herford, Germany where we are realizing similar savings from operational improvements in new product and process innovations. And as we continue our global product platform development, we are driving product rationalization to deliver supply chain leverage and factory efficiencies.
 And as you can see, we're making progress against our key priorities as evidenced by our expanding gross margin. And I see enormous opportunity for performance improvement as we move to 2012 and beyond.
 Please turn to Slide 5 and I'll give you a little perspective of our performance by geographies and end markets.
 Americas, was our strongest region for the quarter, with the U.S. up mid-single digits as the industrial market continues to provide strength, partially offset by continued softness in the public utilities sector. Our outlook is for growth to continue in 2012.
 Europe overall was flat year-over-year despite a very difficult compare to the first quarter of 2011 when conditions were still relatively strong in the region and our revenues grew high single digits organically. This performance highlights the stability of our large installed base and our strong position in Northern Europe where the Nordic regions remain healthy and we felt strong performance out of the U.K. And as you would expect, the southern region continues to be challenged, but has less than an impact on our business. For reference, southern Europe represents less than 7% of our total revenue.
 Overall, Europe was in line with our expectations and our teams remain cautiously optimistic about prospects for the remaining of 2012.
 As we anticipated, emerging markets have moderated a bit overall. Latin America, Asia Pac and Eastern Europe posted good growth, ranging from high single digits to double digits during the quarter. The Middle East was down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of political instability in the region. On a constant currency basis, we grew double-digits in emerging markets and our outlook is to grow mid-teens for the full year.
 As for end market dynamics. Industrial is our largest end market and our performance reflects the strength in global mining, and growing opportunity for dewatering services. It also reflects our global investments and ability to deliver application solutions to customers when and where they require them, anywhere in the world.
 Additionally, we see a broad range of general industrial application growth where our products are critical to running our customers' base operations and in food and beverage, a market focused on product innovation and driven by consumer demand.
 Overall, our revenue in industrial was up mid-single digits during the first quarter of 2012 and we expect this performance to continue for the full year.
 Switching to public utilities, our second largest end market. In developed countries, our large installed base and leading market position has helped us weather the economic slowdown. Given the majority of our revenue stems from operations and maintenance activities. As a reminder, public utilities spend over 70% of their budget on repairing, maintaining and operating infrastructure which is funded by stable flow of tariff. Lead activity for capital projects has increased since the fourth quarter providing some positive signs but release of funding is key for growth in the longer term.
 Our revenue from public utilities were in line with our expectations, down slightly year-over-year given the timing of a large project shift last year. We anticipate public utility revenue to grow low to mid-single digits for the full-year 2012.
 Moving onto Commercial, our third largest end market. We continue to see gain -- share gains, globally, thanks to the success of our new product launches focused on delivering energy-efficient solutions, which are providing cost savings to our customers. In commercial, we expect full-year revenue to be up low to mid-single digits. 
 In the residential market, most of our revenue is driven by replacement sales. Our large installed base, strong brand, applications knowledge and energy-efficient products have been and will continue to be our strength despite a market that remains down. During the first quarter, we saw negative impact to our mix due to the warm weather in the U.S. given the high margin equipment we sell into the heating applications. We do not anticipate a change in the market throughout 2012 as the rebound in housing does not have a strong effect on our business. For the full year, we expect low to mid single-digit growth in this market.
 Finally, Agriculture, which represents roughly 3% of our annual revenue was down versus the first quarter of 2011 when the business delivered high teens growth. So in summary, our business performance and our end market are generally in line with our expectations. With no significant changes to what we articulated a few months ago. Our view continues to be that we will see modest strengthening throughout the year and stronger performance as we execute our strategic and operational plans.
 With 6 months behind us as an independent company, I feel good about our team's performance and the track record we are building. We are in pace to achieve our 2012 targets.
 Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen. Mike? 
Michael Speetzen: Thanks, Gretchen. Let's go to Slide 6. In the first quarter, Xylem's revenues were $925 million, reflecting total growth of 4%. Organic revenue growth contributed 2 points to the total and acquisitions added another 4 points of growth. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 2 points and on a constant currency basis revenue grew 6%. Our growth was driven by strength in the industrial and commercial end markets were we continue to see growth opportunities and have been able to capture share. YSI had a very strong quarter adding 4 percentage points to our total top line. I think it's also important to note that YSI's organic growth was up double digits and is not included in our organic performance articulated earlier.
 As Gretchen mentioned, our revenue to the public utility market is stable as most of our revenues derived from non-discretionary aftermarket and replacement equipment. Residential market conditions have not improved. Year-over-year declines are primarily attributable to softening conditions in Europe and the impact of political instability on the Middle East.
 As Gretchen highlighted, we booked record orders, hitting the $1 billion mark for the first time in the quarter. Organic order rates were up slightly year-over-year at 1%, a dynamic primarily driven by the timing of large project orders received during the first quarter of 2011. Let me note that project order rates slowed to during 2011, so year-over-year comparisons are tougher in the first half of this year and then get easier.
 Our first quarter book-to-bill ratio was 1.09, increasing our backlog position heading into the second quarter. Operating income adjusted for one-time separation cost, increased 1% in the first quarter and was up 11% when adjusted for incremental standalone ramp-up costs incurred in Q1 2012. First quarter operating margins came in at 12.3%, up 70 basis points excluding separation costs and the impact of standalone ramp-up costs. Gross margin was 39.2% for the first quarter of 2012, up 130 basis points versus the prior year as price, cost improvements and YSI more than offset inflation and unfavorable volume and mix.
 By driving gross margin performance, we were able to continue to invest in our business while expanding operating margins. Investments in the first quarter impacted operating margins by 50 basis points. Foreign exchange favorability drove operating margins by 40 basis points. This favorability is driven primarily by the negative transaction impact of foreign exchange in the first quarter of 2011. As the chart reflects, on an operating basis, we drove incremental margins of 18% excluding standalone costs and a favorable impact of foreign exchange.
 I would add that this 18% incremental margin also reflects additional investments which will drive above market growth. These additional investments were a 10 point drag on our incremental margin. For example, investments in the recent past have led to the successful launch of products like the e-SV pump and the Flygt Experior. Growth in the quarter enabled us to leverage and drive margin improvement of 30 basis points while absorbing 70 basis points in headwind mix and investment in the business.
 Now turn to Slide #7. This slide shows our EPS walk for the first quarter. This is a transition year for Xylem and as such there are a lot of moving parts, so I want to spend some time this morning as we did on the last call describing the components of our performance.
 As the middle section of this chart depicts, we have adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clear picture of how we performed operationally versus last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between, we make 2 sets of adjustments for the first quarter. On the left side of the chart, we reduced 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.42 by $0.09 to show how 2011 would have looked had Xylem been a standalone company with interest expense on debt and required independent company costs.
 We have also adjusted the numbers to exclude the 2011 impact of onetime separation costs. For the first quarter of 2012, on the right-hand side of the chart, we adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.34 by adding back the negative impact of 2012 one-time separation costs. Making these adjustments puts both first quarters on a comparable, normalized basis to allow for a better view of operational performance. This analysis shows that normalized EPS increased 9% or $0.03. This improvement includes an increase in our core business of $0.03, partially offset by $0.02 of additional investment. YSI contributed operational benefits of $0.03 and our higher tax rate cost us a $0.01.
 Now let me provide more details for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 8. This slide shows the results of our Water Infrastructure segment. For the first quarter, this segment reported revenue of $584 million, up 6% over prior year, up 2% organically. The YSI acquisition contributed 6 points to the top line growth and foreign exchange was a 2 point headwind. Transport grew 3% for the quarter driven by the global industrial market, particularly for dewatering applications. A significant portion of transport is driven by the public utility market and here, we continue to benefit from the stability that comes from a large installed base and growing tariffs. Treatment declined, driven by the softening we saw in developed market project orders in 2011. As a reminder, treatment orders for large projects slowed after the first quarter of 2011 and given the longer lead times associated with these projects, we are seeing impact in our year-over-year revenue performance. This decline is in line with our expectations and was included in our previous guidance.
 We're encouraged by the higher quotation activity we've seen in the first quarter but we're not projecting a significant improvement at this time. Test revenues were down 2% organically, excluded from this result is the contribution from the YSI business which achieved double-digit growth this quarter and comes on top of the strong quarter we saw in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter operating margins came in at 13.4%, up 180 basis points from 2011, excluding the impact of standalone costs. YSI contributed 60 basis points to the segment margin, highlighting the strong business that we have added to the portfolio. In addition, as you can see from the chart, our operational and commercial excellence initiatives are more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and have provided flexibility to continue to invest in the business while still expanding margins. We drove 26% incremental margins reflecting strong underlying fundamentals in this segment.
 Let me now turn to Slide #9 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Applied Water's first quarter revenues were up 1% on an organic basis. Building services were up 2% as growth in commercial, more than offset lower residential volume. Commercial building services were up mid-single digits and a flat market reflecting market share gains driven by our new energy-efficient solutions. Residential building services were down mid-single digits reflecting unfavorable impact of a warm winter season on our U.S. business, challenging economic conditions in Europe and instability in the Middle East region. Industrial water was up 2% driven by favorable general industrial market conditions and strength in our food and beverage applications, offsetting a down marine market. And irrigation was down 4% against the very difficult compare versus the first quarter of 2011 when revenues were up in the high teens year-over-year.
 First quarter operating margins came in at 12.1%, down 90 basis points from 2011 excluding standalone costs. Price and productivity actions more than offset the impact of inflation. The margin decline is primarily driven by unfavorable mix, attributable to largely temporary factors such as the warm weather impact on our high-margin residential products as well as foreign exchange.
 Looking at sequential performance versus the fourth quarter of 2011, operating margins increased by more than 200 basis points on 6% higher revenue, as well as cost and price actions. While the results are in line with our expectations, we know the business has more margin potential. As a reminder, we took some actions in the fourth quarter and we have plans in place to ensure we achieve the operational improvements embedded in our guidance.
 Now let me turn to Slide 10 and review our financial position. Slide 10 reflects the key elements of our balance sheet and capital structure. We generated $41 million in free cash flow a conversion on adjusted net income of 61% reflecting typical seasonality for our business. Our cash flow is down from Q1 2011 as anticipated, driven primarily by incremental interest payments of $11 million related to the debt put in place as a result of the spin-off from ITT. In addition, we incurred higher cash outlays associated with our continued investment in organic growth through the deployment of capital and the key strategic initiatives such as the continued expansion of our global dewatering [indiscernible] business. And we incurred additional cash outlays associated with the cost to operate as a stand-alone company. As you can see from the slide, we also improved our working capital as a percent of revenue. All of these factors were included in our projected 95% cash flow conversion for the year.
 As it relates to our capital structure, we ended Q1 in a strong position, our available cash on hand was $347 million, up from year end 2011. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 31% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and undrawn. Bottom line, we continue to deliver strong cash flow and have a solid balance sheet.
 Now, let me transition to Slide 12 and talk about our guidance for 2012.  Our view of full year 2012 is relatively unchanged given our performance in the first quarter and trends that we've seen. As Gretchen mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are maintaining our previous guidance. I do think it's important to spend a few minutes and walk back through the guidance and associated assumptions.
 We anticipate 2012 revenue in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. This reflects 2% growth from YSI, foreign exchange headwind of 3% and a 4% to 6% % organic growth. One thing to keep in mind is that foreign-exchange will have a lumpy impact on our revenues. For example, the euro to dollar rate was $1.44 in the second quarter last year and we have assumed $1.31 in our guidance. Based on this and other currency rate trends, the negative impact of foreign exchange on our second quarter revenues is likely to be in the range of 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. It's also worth noting that the organic growth in the second quarter will be at the lower end of our full-year guidance range.
 Segment margins is anticipated to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% which is up 50 to 100 basis points versus 2011. We see Applied Water around the lower end and Water Infrastructure around the higher end of this basis point improvement.
 Company operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.3%, which is flat to up 60 basis points including incremental recurring standalone costs of $25 million to $30 million. These additional standalone costs include items associated with being an independent public company, as well as business level expenses related to being a standalone company. These are consistent with our past projections and it's important to note these costs impact the comparison of operating margins primarily for the periods of Q1, Q2 and Q3.
 We anticipate earnings per share in the range of $1.80 to $1.95 excluding pretax one-time separation cost of $15 million to $20 million. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year change in EPS would be minus 7% to up 1% as a full year of interest expense and standalone costs are incurred versus a partial year in 2011. Using the same approach we used on Slide 7 to make both years comparable, yields normalized EPS growth of 8% to 17% year-over-year.
 Free cash flow conversion is targeted in the range of 95%, which is lower than our 2011 performance. Factors driving this lower conversion include higher pension cash contributions in 2012 and timing of interest payments and non-cash tax impacts from special items in 2011. Additionally, we will continue to invest higher levels of capital in our organic growth initiatives.
 Please turn to Slide 13 for a walk through of our 2012 EPS outlook.
 This slide starts with 2011 adjusted EPS of $1.93. We've added $0.27 of incremental interest expense and incremental standalone costs, so the resulting EPS number, $1.66, shows what Xylem's earnings would have been if we had been a standalone company for the full year 2011. As you saw in Slide 12, we are anticipating 2012 EPS of $1.80 to $1.95 excluding onetime separation costs. At the guidance midpoint of $1.87, EPS growth is 13%. Organic revenue growth of 4% to 6% our commercial and operational excellence programs and accretive contribution from the YSI acquisition, all contribute to this performance while enabling us to invest in the business and expand margins.
 So as you can see, on a comparable basis, adjusting for the partial year versus full year impacts of having become a standalone company, we are projecting that Xylem will deliver double-digit EPS growth. I'd also like to note we've included some additional slides in the Appendix to further illustrate our 2012 outlook.
 Now turn to Slide 14 and I'll hand it back over to Gretchen for final remarks before the Q&A session. 
Gretchen McClain: In summary, we're off to a good start in 2012 with a solid first quarter. Our operational performance is in line with our internal expectations and on track for our goals for the full year. And the end market conditions continue to support our 2012 growth target.
 YSI in addition to Godwin, serve as excellent examples of our team's ability to acquire and effectively integrate acquisitions. Our strong financial position and cash flow generating ability, positions us well to execute on our growth strategies.
 When I think about all that we've covered today, our first quarter performance, the end market diversity we have and our current views of these markets and how they plowed in 2012, coupled with the strong talented people we have in place across Xylem to execute our strategy, it reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver in 2012 and beyond. 
 With that, I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Lucas of Janney Capital Markets. 
James Lucas: Two questions. First, I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit of color as we're trying to understand the dynamic of the orders and backlog from a timing perspective. I mean a 1.09 book-to-bill, very positive growing backlog, how does that book-to-bill translate into shipments as we think about the progression during the year? 
Gretchen McClain: Jim, let me give you some color there, just from our businesses. Our 2 segments, Water Infrastructure and Applied Water, when you look within Water Infrastructure, I would think about on an average when we get an order to when we ship around on an average 60 days. So let me break that down a little bit further. You get use transport, a large portion today with a large of the funding coming out of the operation and maintenance side, it's a much quicker turn, take the order, and we deliver the parts. It can be anywhere from a short cycle to 90 days. Now, if you're getting into the capital expenditure funding, where you're now into treatment or the transport of supporting a large project, that can be anywhere from 90 days to 18 months, so longer cycle when you're looking at large projects. Our testing and site end market, quick turns but I would just hesitate with YSI as we've bought YSI and integrated it and looked at what they're doing. They support a lot of large projects which do take a little bit longer time, not a quick turn sale. But overall, test is pretty quick get the order actually shipped. When you think of applied water, think of it around 30 to 60 days. You've got some things that are 2 day turnarounds. But you've also got irrigation and some building services projects that you are working with the builders and take a little bit longer but on the average, 30 to 60 day turns there. 
Michael Speetzen: And Jim, the only the other points I'd make is we ended the quarter with about $740 million in backlog. A little over 80% of that will actually deliver in 2012 so clearly there's components in the backlog that are going to to go out end of 2013. And obviously, there's going to be components in that backlog that are going go beyond just Q2. So you when you think about that 1.09, not all of that is going to translate into Q2 revenue but it's a good indicator and gives us confidence as we start moving into the second quarter. 
James Lucas: Okay. That's very helpful. And second question, could you just bring us up-to-date on your capital allocation strategy, given the strength of the balance sheet and the strong cash flow expected this year? 
Gretchen McClain: Sure, Jim. Let's just talk about the business first of all. We got a great business and great foundation of our core business and then the new platforms, which we strategically have been building out. So our priority is our organic growth and continue to expand and invest in those opportunities where we can grow geographically as well as some attractive markets specifically in our core space. As well in continuing to invest in our dewatering and our analytics business, both from an organic perspective as well through acquisitions. So we see a nice pipeline of candidates that we're looking at. We are actively engaged in opportunities for us to quickly move. You've seen us actually have a very nice success with our acquisitions over the last 2 years. And so that's where we'll be putting our first priority in terms of investing organically and acquisitively. 
Michael Speetzen: Jim, I guess that I also asked and -- I talked about a little bit on the margins. And we had about a 10 point drag on the incrementals. Because of that organic investment we're making back in the business, so for example the expansion we made into Russia is a prime example of that where we'll continue to invest in the sales channel of the business as well as continue to invest in the organic growth initiatives like we've done in the past with e-SV and the Flygt Experior. So we see as we indicated investment being about a 50 basis point drag relative to operating margins, but that's where we're really focused on driving gross margin improvement to be able to fund continuing to invest in the business. 
Gretchen McClain: And Jim, just one other thing in terms of new price, we've been launching quite a new projects sort of the last couple of years. But we're also thinking about how we can do smart information, so we gotten into smart apps and making it much easier for our customer base to work with our sales teams out in the field configuring their applications and their solutions. And that's another area where we've been investing as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc. 
Matt Summerville: Couple of questions. Gretchen in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about what you guys have been doing from a pricing standpoint, I think back at your Analyst Day you'd indicated targeting about 150 basis points a year on price and it looks like you've already ramped to that kind of run rate. So 2 things, does it make sense to move that bar higher or that goal or target? And then I guess the other question is how far through the organization have you rolled this pricing process or initiative out at this point? 
Gretchen McClain: Matt, great question. We've been driving this commercial excellence process for the last couple of years. We're still in the process of doing it. We're about, at the end of 2012, we'll be 80% deployed across our global sales team. If you think about that we're in 150 countries. We've got a lot of sales team around the globe. I'd say we're further along in our Applied Water business, than we are in our Water Infrastructure. But in terms of where we are, we're getting great results, as you can see. And I think it's going to stay about that level, obviously we drive internal targets as aggressively as we can. But you also have inflation coming down and being able to pass on price to customers. Our main thing here is we want to make sure we maintain our shares in those attractive markets that we want to continue to grow. And we have a good process around our pricing policy where we look at our wins and losses and we think about our product strategy and our differentiation and what we've done with our sales team is really get them out there selling on a value proposition as compared to on price. And it's working but there's still more to do. 
Michael Speetzen: Matt, the only other piece I would add to that is you have to remember we're lapping 2011 where we put -- took some pretty significant price actions in light of the environment we had on inflation. So you have a little bit of that dynamic that plays out. So I think as Gretchen indicated, we're kind of right in the range that we anticipate being for the year. 
Gretchen McClain: But the culture is building and that's the positive in that I feel good about. It's becoming part of our day-to-day process and we're really seeing it in the results. So that should continue. 
Matt Summerville: Got it. And then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about your incoming order rates in the quarter in terms of linearity and if you can provide any comments on what you saw in April, that would be helpful as well. 
Gretchen McClain: Yes, I would say, as I laid out the market dynamics and so forth, it's consistent with what I've been talking about. I'd say the one area we're most challenged with is, we've got a lot of activity going on in treatment and the larger projects around capital expenditures. A lot of bidding taking place but what we don't see yet is the release of funding at this point in time. Not an impact right now, but obviously something we're watching very closely coming out of quarter 2 and beyond. 
Michael Speetzen: Yes and I'd say, in the latter part of March and April, we did see improvement in a couple of the areas. We mentioned the Middle East giving us some headwind year-over-year. We did see order rates improving there and we did see orders improving in some parts of Europe. So again, that's been consistent with the level of guidance that we provided and consistent with what we see going into the month of April. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research. 
Deane Dray: At the interest of hearing about the investment in your Analytics business with regard to these growth investments, you're trying to add more capacity or add more test offerings and you believe you're gaining share on this business? 
Gretchen McClain: Yes, Deane, good question. I would say we're tackling it from all fronts. What we want to do is continue to make sure we've got the reach into the market so it is through our channels and through our distribution and make sure we're represented across the board. It's also investments to make sure that we can take the products that today are very strong from a regional perspective and brand them into the other regions as I described in kind of my opening remarks. But we are also producing new products as we go forward. As we think about some of the attractive end markets that will develop as the water issues get more and more addressed. You think about sustainable water infrastructure and our ability to take our instrumentation and work for example and work with our wastewater treatment team and we have an opportunity to bring energy efficient solutions and have real-time information for the wastewater treatment plant operators so they can effectively do that. So we are investing there as well as some attractive areas that we see coming up. 
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And just one of the comments is that since it's your second quarter and you've been hitting your targets in terms of expectations on EPS on the separation costs. And I just looked at -- yes, versus our expectations. The only thing that looked a little bit higher versus what we were looking for was the R&D expense, looks like that's up more year-over-year, is that part of the growth investment or what's driving that? 
Gretchen McClain: It's clearly part of our strategy. If you want a be a leader in the market and the markets are tougher today since they're growing slower, you've got to have innovation, you got to be able to have differentiation with your customer. And we see clear areas where that has played out and where our investments are playing very, very well. I'll use the example of our e-SV and our Applied Water business. Last year, the commercial market was flat, still flat this year, and it's continuing to give us nice revenue and nice growth because we're bringing energy-efficient solutions to our customers. So we're focused there. We're also focused on in terms of the environmental standards as people become more and more concerned about the quality of water and making sure that the water they're using is at the right level of quality, not necessarily over clean, so that it can be applied appropriately and then we can maximize and more efficiently use the water that we have. 
Michael Speetzen: Yes and Deane, one other factor that plays in is our R&D investment in the Analytics businesses is typically higher than average for the company and with YSI being added in the first quarter, that's obviously had an impact. When we gave our guidance we talked about 3% for the full year. So we're in line with that overall expectation. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord. 
Chip Moore: I was wondering if you could give a little more color on your strategy and expectations in sort of the dewatering platform in China now that you've announced your first order there, where you see the investment's going? 
Gretchen McClain: Sure. What we've done in taking -- stepping back again from the investment that we've made in dewatering. We started out as a company with just the products that went into dewatering. We weren't into the rental and the services business to speak of. When we bought Godwin, that really gave us a #1 position in the U.S. and really a #1 position around the market, where we can actually take a proven business model and we can actually deploy that internationally very quickly. We saw that happen in Australia and we're growing very nicely. We've had some nice orders in China, and we're looking at where to play in China and really how big of a depot that we need to set there to ultimately support our sales. But we see that as a real opportunity going forward, as well as other markets internationally. What's key in terms of dewatering, is it is a capital intensive business, so you've got to make sure you've got many markets that you can support. And so you look at is there opportunities for the public utilities, are there opportunities for construction, are there opportunities around mining, so that you can have a nice investment and you can ultimately support the markets even when the ups and downs take place from an economic perspective. 
Operator: Your next version comes from Michael Roomberg of Ladenburg Thalmann. 
Michael Roomberg: Just wondering if you could speak of any specific water quality regulatory developments that are having an outsized impact currently on the treatment or test side or if there may be any regulations that you're expecting to come down the pipe that would drive those 2 businesses?. 
Gretchen McClain: Sure. With the EPA, there's many standards obviously with the regulations around water. Those continue to support our Analytical business. When you think about some of the more aggressive areas, think about Dallas water, there are standards that are being put in place right now, it's really only been adopted by the U.S. taking on some IMO standards that require a certain level of requirement when the ships come in to be able to test the water. That's an opportunity for us to play both in our instrumentation as well as in our treatment solutions. In terms of another area that we get cautions around is in the shale gas right now. They are not significant regulations we think that's going to be at the local and state level, more so than at a federal level. But we track that pretty aggressively to make sure that we understand where things are going and where we can play. 
Michael Roomberg: Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then on the Applied Water side, you mentioned the end market, the share gains and the commercial end market, can you speak to what may have been behind that and what the competitive response has been? 
Gretchen McClain: That was commercial? 
Michael Roomberg: Yes. I think you mentioned the... 
Gretchen McClain: Yes, I go back to really it's the launch of our new products. We spend a lot of time with our customers working with them and trying to really understand what their needs are. And it's not only in the commercial but you talk to the customer and their first question is, how do I reduce my energy cost? How do I ensure that my overall cost of operations is coming down? And how do I ensure that I have a reliable application that's going to run consistently? When we launched our e-SV, we obviously came out with a very energy efficient solution as well as something that could be serviced very quickly, and it met the needs of our customers. So were taking share here as well as we're using that to expand and open ourselves in position geographically. 
Operator: Your next question comes from David rose of Wedbush Securities. 
David Rose: I was hoping that maybe you could provide some of the operational differences in your KPIs between Applied Water and Water Infrastructure that is providing some metrics such as on time delivering, sourcing, waste quality that can help us close the gap between these 2 businesses over time and what margin, how we get to those, that gap is closed, how we close that gap in 2013? 
Gretchen McClain: Let me just talk about that a little bit and see if I can get after. We have KBMs that we're driving across our businesses and they do differ a little bit based upon the end markets that we serve and the dynamics in terms of the business. When you think about Applied Water, you have a product line which is, quicker turnaround so on-time delivery is absolutely critical when a customer calls, you need to be able to deliver very, very rapidly so a focus on on time delivery is critical there. As we think about in terms of cost, productivity -- productivity across the board in the bulk of our businesses are driven aggressively and equally because I do believe across our procedures, there's no reason why we can't expect improvements in leaning our factories and deliver each and every time. So those drive across the board from a productivity perspective. What's more difficult is when we go through a distribution so there's different dynamics in our business. Our Applied Water, goes through distribution. Our Water Infrastructure is more of a direct sale. So you're working different dynamics in terms of your parameters as you go forward. 
Michael Speetzen: Yes, and I'd say that that plays into the gross margin levels between the 2 businesses and I wouldn't characterize as them coming together at the same operating margin level. When you look at Water Infrastructure, where we've put a pretty concerted effort around our acquisition focus and it's been in the high gross margin businesses and we're getting nice leverage off of that, I think both businesses will continue to expand as Gretchen indicated but I think you can expect to see a differential between the 2 just given the nature of the channel they use, as well as the margin profile and growth profile. 
Gretchen McClain: Yes, and I'd say that's part of the portfolio and management that we have. When you look at how attractive are the end markets and where you want to invest and the ones that we're investing a little bit more aggressively we'd like to see some top line growth. In other areas you're investing to expand your gross margin or your operating margin. So there's different strategies we play out in each different end markets. 
David Rose: So going back I mean I can understand the distribution differences and so when we get back to the productivity measures, what has to be done on Applied Water to get to the productive hitting levels that Water Infrastructure has, is it a function of volume? Is it a function of sourcing? 
Gretchen McClain: So volume definitely has an impact when you get a higher volume, you're going to see the leverage. We actually saw that in fourth quarter to first quarter in Applied Water with additional volume. You saw it come to the bottom line. We need to continue to get our factory productivity. And as I mentioned in a couple of my opening comments, we are making sure we're leaning our facilities as I mentioned our line facility over in Hungary. The automation that we put in play has actually produced better quality products so you don't have to drag on any type of quality issues and you also have an opportunity to have more throughput to the factory. As we see in that business specifically, Europe has got regulatory requirements requiring us to be able to deliver high-quality and high volume and the factory is now positioned to be able to capture that volume. 
David Rose: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow up question is on the Xenon, the relationship that you have with them has been largely on the municipal water side I would think. Are you giving any leverage in industrial given that your Wedeco is starting to pick up some traction in the U.S. on the ozone side? Can you combine these two, filtration and ozone? 
Gretchen McClain: Wedeco is doing well in both the ozone and in the UV Treatment. When we think of our treatment business we think of it basically in 3 areas biological. We think of it in filtration and we think it in terms of the UV/ozone business. We actually look at projects where we can combine technology and be able to bring the equipment necessary to help our customer base, so there is integration taking place where it makes sense. When you talk also about our agreement with GE where we're taking the GE product -- their membrane and being able to distribute that and sell it through our world-class channel, that's an opportunity again with the public utilities to combine our treatment activities together and again be able to meet our customers' needs. 
David Rose: I'm sorry, but it wasn't clear. Can you leverage that in the industrial space? 
Gretchen McClain: Yes you can. It's by a case-by-case basis. I mean in some areas, other areas it's not that quickly you can -- you can't bring it directly over. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Krapfel of Morningstar. 
James Krapfel: You mentioned that you're actively engaged in acquisition opportunities. Are you encountering much competition for acquisitions of your target size and are evaluations at levels where you think you can extract enough value? 
Gretchen McClain: So acquisition at -- the market right now, I'd say is active. You've got a lot of buyers, you've got a lot of sellers, and there's a lot of cash in the market. Where we're looking at in our acquisition strategy is a line strategically where we're going. When you think about the acquisitions we've just gone through, let's say analytics and dewatering, there's still significant opportunities. Both fragmented markets, so there's lots of opportunities where we you can continue to grow. What we look at traditionally really has been strategically does it fit, culturally does it fit and then obviously it needs to meet the financial hurdles that we addressed. Right now in terms of valuations, I'd say the markets -- the targets that we've got are reasonable. Most of them are focused around a bolt-on where you're looking at anywhere from a $25 million to a $100 million type of acquisition and we make the numbers work. Typically, a lot of these companies are private companies and so forth but there is a demand. Many people are asking from it too much but if the valuation clearly is a key hurdle we're not going to pay too much. 
Michael Speetzen: Yes and I'd add, we have a very strict set of criteria that we judge the acquisitions against. So as I've typically do in the past we look for returns in the mid-teens. We look for cash returns of 7 to 9 years and so we make sure that the acquisitions are going to fit right into that category and if they don't, then we move onto the next one. But I've referenced you back to the way we talked about our capital deployment strategy during Investor Day, and I'd say that we're continuing forward with that process. 
James Krapfel: Okay great. That's helpful. And are you feeling good about your 2015 targets and what macro assumptions are you making there?. 
Gretchen McClain: On the long-term, is that what you said? 
James Krapfel: Yes. Your 2015 revenue and margin, ROIC targets that you've previously laid out? 
Gretchen McClain: We're right on track to the plan that we laid out. So I feel good about where we are both from a couple of perspectives. One we're advancing our strategic objectives as we have laid out and those we're seeing pay off and some will be paying off in the years to come. What we said we would do this year, so far we're on track and the market seems to be playing aligned with where we want to go so I feel good both from the strategic aspect, from the operational aspect of the business, and then ultimately what we've got to do in the years to come. 
Michael Speetzen: Yes, I think one of the areas that we articulated that's critical is the gross margin performance. I think when you see us in the 39 plus percent range in Q1 on relatively low organic volume growth, that gives us great confidence relative to getting gross margins above the 40% range and given the pipeline we have from the acquisition standpoint, the success we've had with integration, gives us a lot of confidence relative to those full long-term targets. 
James Krapfel: And that's, assuming I guess a macro environment of a slow growth in U.S., little to no growth in Europe and then continued strength in the emerging markets, is that right? 
Michael Speetzen: Yes, I'd say it's consistent with what we articulated. Kind of 1% to 3% in developed markets, 8% to 10 plus percent in the emerging markets. And we're seeing those conditions play up pretty consistent relative to those thoughts that we had back in October. 
Operator: Your final question comes from Stewart Scharf of S&P Capital IQ. 
Stewart Scharf: Regarding your emerging markets just roughly 18% of total revenues. In the Middle East, there's some unrest and I'm just wondering what your focus is on? What areas you're looking to grow there? Is that preventing you from pursuing some strategic expansion there in Middle East region or just break that down a little bit? 
Gretchen McClain: Sure. Well, I'll give you some color on the Middle East. So our Water Infrastructure, is still performing well. Again, when you think about the infrastructure, the operations of your public utilities and so forth, that continues to play nicely for us. The Applied Water was more challenged in the Middle East. We still see opportunities there and actually, coming into April, we saw some orders coming in. So we see that will rebound but it is a choppy area right now that we're just watching. And we'll continue to play in opportunities that play out. Our teams are aggressively working very strategic objectives by end markets. That does not change. But I do see stability around the Water Infrastructure. And I guess I'll just pull out one other point which is when you think about our emerging markets and you step back, Middle East is a small percentage of our overall revenue. We got 19% of our sales are coming from the emerging markets, and we've talked about before that's kind of evenly split around the different regions. And across the emerging markets, we saw a nice growth and we see that continuing to play and there's plenty of opportunity when you look at where we are in the markets and the opportunity to penetrate with our products and our applications solutions that I think will continue to keep the emerging market growing aggressively. So our strategy is still intact and our teams are aggressively working on it. 
Stewart Scharf: Okay. And on YSI, what's the accretion and what are you expecting for the year? 
Michael Speetzen: It was $0.03 accretive. And as we've articulated, we'll see that accretion for the full year being in the general range of about $0.02 in the second quarter, $0.03 in the third quarter, and at that point we will have lapped the acquisition. 
Stewart Scharf: Okay. And is there any impact from the equipment that you have regarding lead free new regulations that would be coming into effect in 2014? 
Gretchen McClain: Great question. Actually in April, just this last month, we actually launched our Bell and Gossip lead-free circuits setter. They are valves for the heating ventilation and air-conditioning markets. And we've been working over the last several years to make sure that we are moving into lead-free solution. So we're ahead of that game, the team's off launching the products and we feel good at our position. The lead-free requirements, some regulatory requirements don't completely turn in until a few more years. First, I think California is the one that's put it in place but we feel good that we're ahead of the game and the teams are off executing and selling appropriately. 
Stewart Scharf: Yes, I think California and Vermont first but do you have to bring appropriate change to any of production based on preproduction or customers needing to get the products ahead of time, trying to be ahead of the curve as far as inventory, customers possibly being stuck with inventory? 
Gretchen McClain: So, we're well into that. We are in production today with our lead-free products. So that transitioning from the lead products to lead-free has been taking place and we are in full production of our new products. 
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen McClain for any additional or closing remarks. 
Gretchen McClain: I'd just like to thank you for your interest and continued interest in watching of the business. We feel very good about the results that we have today. The team has been working very, very strong and you think about as I mentioned earlier, the 6 months that we've be an independent company to be able to deliver our strategic objectives, our operational objectives and look forward to where we're going. We feel very, very good and very strong and so we look forward to talking to you again and continuing to build our record of delivery. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.
